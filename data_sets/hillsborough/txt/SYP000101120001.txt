                 Constable        in the Bro o m h a l l        area of the           city.      Previously         I have

                 worked      in the Br o o m h i l l         -area and the       first       three years         of my service

                  consider m y s e l f        to be well        accustomed           to every      public      order      sit u a t i o n

                 which arises           at most      football       matches.           Most    of my       e x p e r i e n c e with

my    life and         i t ’s difficult           to    put a true         prospective          on the        events 'of

that     day.

At 9.4 5 a.m.           the     day    in question,           1 paraded for             duty at      the

H i l l s b o r o u g h Ground,        N or th Stand.            It was a glorious'' sunny                 day and the

hundreds        of other         officers         on duty were            in a happy,          e x p ectant mood.

I have always            enjoyed wo rk i n g           on bis       occasions        like      this an d       enjoy

the    carnival         moo d    the    semi-final           brings.        I can       remember        locking          back

up -the stand seeing                  fellow      officers         laughing and joking.                  None       of us

a ware    of the disaster               that was         lurking around,             a time      bomb      ready to

explode.

S h o r t l y after      Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t       Duckenfield,           who    I had     not met

p r eviou sly o f f i c i a t e d       the      initial      briefing.           The    briefing        was       the

normal     speech we get at all                    football         matches,       along w i t h other

" g o o d i e s ’ one    can expect           at a football             m a t c h of this       scale.         I sat

and    listened to what was                   being     preached and             knew a l r e a d y that           I was

to be a l l o c a t e d       to s e r ia 1 no.        1,    the    per imeter       trac k .      Th is duty            I

have     p e rformed      on s e v e r a l ' o c c a s i o n s     over    the    last    two years.               I am

therefore       very      e x p e r i e n c e d and k n o w l e d g a b l e      of my duties           and

requirements.             I always           tried     to    position myself             in front        of the

North S tand a p p r o x i m a t e l y 20 yards                  east     of gate       number     7-      After         the

briefing        I ate a small               packed meal          in the North Stand,               together          with

Police C o n s t a b l e s       Brookes,         Smith,      Illingworth,          Cookson,        W P C 's Nichol

and Marsden.            We      sat    chatting        and    discussing          various       things        to    pass

the time quickly.                 After m e a 1 we took different                       positions        on the

perimeter       track.           1 always         stand talking            to Police          Constable        Brookes

before     the match,           as     he   is    positioned         next     to me,      some 20 yards              down

the Nor th Stand.

About     12.30    p.m.         (1230)      the    first      s u pporters        came    into     the     ground at

L e p p i n g s Lane    terraces.             Police        Constables        S m i t h and     I l l i n g w o r t h were
                                                                                                               PAGE.          :
                                                                                                               R385

positioned          directly          in front       of gates 4 and 5 respectively.                       The

Leppings        Lane and N o r t h Stands would                     contain the Liverpool

supporters.              Police C o n s t a b l e s    Brookes        and myself           remained     in front

of the N o r t h S t a n d        talking.

A r o u n d about        "I p .m . ( 1300)     Police C o n s t a b l e       I llingworth         carne over to my

position and a sked               if    I could keep an eye                on his      gate.         I agreed       to

do this and took               up his        position.        The re were          pienty of officers               in

front       of the N o r t h S t a n d so           I didn't     mind.         By this        time a steady

s tream      of L i verpool           s upporters      had c o n g r e g a t e d     behind the        goal    in the

bottom       standing        terraces.          I had built           up a rapport w i t h            several       fans      -

and    stood talking            to them.             They were        in high spirits and all

c on v i n c e d their       passage         tothe    final    was a w a i t i n g            them. The fans

g e n e r a l l y were      impec c a b l e    in their       behaviour.             It was a pleasure to

work    in that          sect i o n    of the ground.            At some        stage        in the    proceedings

I was       joined       by Police       C o n s t a b l e Helliwell.

About       1.45    p.m.     (1345)      I realised that              I had not        taken my a l l o c a t e d

meal    and     together        with Police           Constable        Brookes,        I went        to obtain my

meal    ticket       from Po l i c e S e r geant           C h a p m a n at    the    players        tunnel.     We

then    proceeded           to the West Y o r k s h i r e         canteen w agon s i t u a t e d behind

the N orth S tand next                 to the gymnasium.               When we got there,               we were

told    that       the    canteen       had shut       for 20 minutes.                We     therefore    went

back    to our       original          positions       in front        of the North Stand.

A bout 2.20         p.m.     (1420)      Police       C o n s t a b l e Broo k e s    went     for    his meal

while       I covered both             our    positions.         By    now the        ground was        filling          up

nicely.         I thought         at    the    time    though       there was         still     a lot    of    people

yet    to    come    in and       time was          getting    on.      About        2 .45    p.m.    Police

C o n s t a b l e Broo k e s    returned             and   I went     for a quick, bite to eat.                 I

r eturned      shortly         before        kick    off    to my      position.             By now the

atmosphere          was    electric.           As    I walked       back      to my    position,        i,he game

started.           When    I arrived          at my    point     I stood        facing       the     crowd.     TJien
                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                    R3S5

about     six youths         jumped over          the    concrete         wall     and onto         the       perimeter

track.        At -first I was astonished.                     I managed to              grab     hold of one

youth.       I asked      him    if he had a ticket              w h i c h he hadn't,              so    I escorted

him down the           perimeter        track     towards       the Police           Room.         I took       his

details and ejec t e d him out                  of the      ground via            'O'     gate     situated          on

Pe n i s t o n e R o a d , . near     the Spion Kop.             As     I turned          to go     back       onto       the

track,       I saw several           Police O f f i c e r s     run from the              gymnasium           onto    the

perimeter        track.         I could hear         garb l e d m e s sages          over my        personal

radio    to    the effect           that   there was        some      trouble at           the L e p p i n g s Lane

end.      I quic k l y     ran after         them onto        the     track.         As    I entered           the

ground       between     the S pion Kop and N o r t h S t a n d                I looked down              to the

L e p pings Lane        end.        I could see several               Po l i c e O f f i c e r s    s tood between

gates 4 and 5 and what a p p e a r e d                  to me    to be a crowd spill a g e                     or some

sort    of    pitch     invasion.          I ran up the          track       beside        the N orth Stand,

the    football        match     still     continuing.           I took        up my original                 position

in front       of the N o r t h S t a n d as         X. thought        the     sit u a t i o n     behind the

goal    in the L e p p i n g s      Lane     terraces      was       policed a dequately.                     I thought

it best       to stand fast where               I was      with my serial               and make         sure       no one

else    came over        from the N orth Stand.                  At this          point     I d i d n ’t realise

the    extent     of the        s i t u a t i o n developing.          Having a l r e a d y         e j e c t e d one

person,       I t h o u g h t ’that    the    spillage        behind        the    goal     was     due       to other

idiotic       fans     climbing       over    the    fencing.          1 didn't           see much        else       that

was    happening        behind me as          I was     facing        the    s u pporters          in the North

Stand.        I think      play was        stopped      by now.          The      crowd     in the North

Stand were        up out       of   their     seats     arid se e m e d      to be shouting               and

pointing       over     to the L e p p i n g s      Lane   terraces.              Some were         boo i n g ,

gesticulating          to the       fans     behind     the goal.            Probably        because           they

t h o u g h t , like    I did,      it ws     some    sort      of    c rowd      i nvas i o n .     The y

appeared       to be     incensed and          the    situation          s t a r t e d to get           out    of

hand.     Supporters           jumped      over     from the N o r t h S t a n d and               onto       the         .

perimeter         track.        It was at this           stage       I looked behind me a n d                saw

Liverpool         supporters          being a s s i s t e d    over     the fencing         by Police

Officers.

Several        appeared        to be     injured.        The y all a p p e a r e d       to b.e waIking,

holding        their     stomachs a n d         lower    regions.            I then    became aware           that

s o mething       serious       was    happening and           that     people were         injured.          It

became       chaos.        I assisted         several       injured      people       to the a d v e r t i s i n g

hoardings         in front        of the N orth Stand.                A lot wsre         in shock and

crying.         The     best    I could do was           sit    them down to make               them

comfortable.             I lost       count     of the      number      of    people     that    came       over       to

me but       it must      have     been 50 or more.                 There was a problem               that a lot

of u n i n j u r e d    people     were w a n d e r i n g a r o u n d    the    pitch making           it

difficult        to assist         those who         needed treatment            or first aid.               I can

r emember       feeling        very a n g r y    towards       people just        stood      talking,

lighting        up cigarettes           on the       pitch.         I must     have    told h u n dreds           to

move away and they w o u l d                 ignore ms.         They even        ignored        injured

people.         During      the    chaos      I h elped to s t retcher            of several           injured

yo u t h s   using a d v e r t i s i n g     h o a rdings     for    stretchers.          T hese we         placed

near     the Bpion Kop            corner      flag    near     to the N o r t h Stand.            I went          back

and forth several               times a s s i s t e d    by supporters.               They were

magnificent            in getting       the     injured a way         from the        trouble.         On one

stretcher         run    I teamed up wit h Police C o n s t a b l e               Brookes        and when we

got to the S p i o n Kop              corner     flag    I think we a s k e d          a Special        Constable

to   reassure          him until       medical       help     came.     He didn't         look    too       bad

although        he     couldn't       move    his    legs.      As    I turned to go            back    to the

L e p pings    Lane      end    I heard h ysterical             s c reaming      from a w o m a n       knelt          over

a y outh       lying     nearby.        He    looked     seriously           injured,     very a s h e n      faced

and m o t i o nless.           He was      lying     on his     back and        didn't ap p e a r       to    be

breathing.             I grab b e d hold        of Police       C o n s t a b l e S r o o k e s who    was    still

          feel     his    pulse.        We    pulled him onto his side and made sure his air

          passage was           clear.        We then      put him onto           his back a g a i n an d Police

          Constable Brookes              gave       heart m a s s a g e whilst        I gave him the kiss                of

          life.

          I kept     saying        to myself         'come on pull          yourself        t o e gether    this       lad       is

          She-said,        "Let me       help,       I ’m a staff       nurse." At this             she took          charge

          an d    continued to give                heart mass a g e whilst          I c o n tinued to give mouth

          to mouth.                                                               I felt     like       giving    up but

          the staff        nurse was          great,     she    e n c o u r a g e d all    of us to       continue.              I

          can     remember       feel i n g    the youth's         body and thinking               ’it's    still warm,

          he     can't    be dead'.           We    continued what a p p e a r e d at the time                   to    be an

          eternity,        but    to no avail.            The    staff      nurse     finally s t o p p e d       pumping,

          she     said,    " H e ’s dead,          h e ’s gone."      The    staff        nurse    then got       up and

          went.     I never       saw her again.               I presume       she went       to help others.                I

          can     remember       feeling       very'angry,         I was     totally shattered.                  I shook

          the    body and        I can       remember     saying,       "You bastard,             you    bastard."           1

          don't     know why,        I p r o bably just          had to      let go.         I failed him.              I was

          really angry towards                 him.      There     he was      just       lying    there,    I don't

          know what        I really          felt.

          Anyhow,        Police    Constables?           Andy and m y s e 1f s t r e t c h e r e d        this youth             off

          the    pitch.         As we    carried       him someone          put    something        over    his       face.

          can    remember        Andy    getting       a n n o y e d and    pulled        it off.       He was        right as

          well,    we d i d n ’t want          the other        suppo r t e r s    to think        he was    dead.           To

          them he was           just anot h e r       injured      person      being       carried off.           We    took

          him    into     the    gymnas i uiti 1and      there we were            greeted     by other       dead

          bodies.         Rows    of them w ith          stunned Po 1 i camen stood                o ve r thern 1 i ke

body into one of the rows.     Andy then took a body off a Special who had just

come in.     He was in no fit state to deal with it.   The rest was pretty non-

important.    We documented the bodies etc, we seemed to stand over them for

hours until we were told to go to another part of the gymnasium.       I found

'my' youth's details on some personal papers.      I'll never forget his name:-

DAVID WILLIAM BIRTLE, D.O.B. 060566

                            ;TOKE-ON-TRENT, STAFFS, or his face NEVER.

It's quite ironic I thought that David would have been 23 years this next

month.    His birthday was to be                        - life can be full of

daft little things like that, 23 years, what a waste.

After that I sat in the gymnasium with the other Police Officers waiting

hours and hours to get them identified and took down to the mortuary.        The

atmosphere was obviously strained.    We sat around in little groups and kept

going over and over what happened.     We all had our own   littlestories   to

tell.    It helped quite a lot talking together.   We even managed tolaugh,

let's face it it's better than crying.    As a Police Officer you get used to

switching off your emotions - you have a job to do and you do it.        That's

what all the training and years of experience drums into you.      You don't

forget you    just push it aside - life goes on.

I went off    duty at 2.00 a.m. (0200) the next morning.

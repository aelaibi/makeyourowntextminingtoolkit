                 to three.           (1435)        At    this      entrance        I saw about                4 mounted                     police

  officers             by the        outer     gates       and another            two officers                in the                 crowd

  w h ’ ch had           converged on the                turnstiles.

  t a c t year           there were           loads      more      police who were               constantly                     checking

   seemed to be a lot more                          fans w a i t i n g      to get       in not           so much more                          fans

trying     to get    in.         The   police       here    this     year   had no chance of

organising       the m ass        into queues.             I saw no stewards              this      side    of the

turnstiles.We        got        into   the    crowd an d         I a sked a number           of     people where

th“ turnstiles            for    the t e r r a c e s were        but no-one        knew.       I was       unable     to

ask a p o l i c e m a n         because      there w e r e n ’t m any of        them about          and the    one

I could now see                 I couldn't         get    to due to the        crush of the          crowd.     The

crush    i n creased a n d        I was      literally           carried to the West              Stand

turnstiles,        the     ones     I did not want,               but there was         nothing       I could <io

About    it.     About      14 ft from these               turnstiles        I saw about            four    police

officers       on top of the wall              above       these     turn s t i l e s   lifting       people     not.

of the     crowd onto           the wall      and    into        the ground.        I heard other

supporters        in the        crowd shouting,            "They got        no fuckin tickets,"               and

similar     other     statements          to the         same     effect.     At    the      time    I thought

they were        doing          this either         to as s i s t people      into the ground or

because      of the         crush,      but    now       looking back       on it I feel          that they were

trying     simply to get as many                    in as they        could but they were              higher       up

and had their         own opinions            of the        crowd from their            vantage       point    and

ob v i o u s l y had their         own reasons           for what      they did.

 I passed the turnstile.-at about                        quarter      to three.         (1445)        The     crowd

 pushed me       to the         turnstile      and       I was    pressed hard against               the actual

 t h r n s t ’I p and the        pressure      of the       crowd was making            it    cut    into me.         1

 said to the fellow behind                    the    turnstile,          "Can we    get t h r o u g h here with

 these     tickets,       t h e y ’re for      the L e p p i n g s    Ln terrace,"           and I e x p lained

 about     the   crowd.

 He   replied,      "No     chance.          You    c a n ’t come thro u g h here."               I said,

 “You'' re fucking          joking a r e n ’t you.               T h e r e ’s a crowd of about 7 , 0 0 0

 behind rne.        How do you expect me to get back                          through the           crowd."

 Before     he   could      reply a police               sergeant,       the other side           of the

 turnstile,        said to him,           "Let      it go."        The    fellow obviously did because

I have       since         handed my ticket            back     to L i v e r p o o l     Football        Clu b and had

mv m o n e y back.

Together with my                two    brothers        and                 we    joined        a continuous       chain

ODen qate          on m y     right     and then         left    towards          the m o u t h of a tunnel

w h i c h went       through the West             Stand.

The     crush had           p r a c t ically    gone     now,     it was         just        a flow of    people       but

when      I h eard the          roar of the           supporters           as    the teams        o b v iously    came

onto      the    pitch everyone             s urged      forward.           You     could see the          light       at

the end of the tunnel,                    it was       like a charge,               you just       got    carried        in.

I cannot         say       if more      people     joined       this       flow        I was    in but there was             a

definite         surge.         I cannot        say     if there were any gates                    open other          than

the turnstiles, and                   I did not       see    any gates           being        opened.

A=     the    flow of us went             into the          tunnel         it was       so    crowded and because

 of the surge we had no. choice                         but to g o          to the       right of the       barrier          a

 the end of the tunnel.                     The    surge        pushed me down the                pen until        it was

 impossible           to go any further                due to the           crush of          people    in. front      of

 me.      T h e y were        c o mpacted and          I was     pressed against                them by the

 continuous           surge      of    people     still       coming        into the          pen behind me.           The

 flow     and surge of            s upporters          a fter    having          entered the ground was                such

 As    I entered the             tunnel        there    were     no     police         or stewards        on duty to

  mntrol         this       point.      We simply went               in unchecked.              I never     saw any

        but a g a i n the       speed of the        flow of s u p p o r t e r s       p r evented you from

        looking      around.       You had to        look    after       yourself.

        Fro m the       point    in the     pen    (Pen 3) w h e n       I became          caught     up in the

        crush,     I was    gradually        s h u f f l e d about      8 yards       to my       right.       I was

        p r evented from going any further                   to my       right       because my          right    leg and

        foot    became w r a p p e d     around     the    inside       of an upright             s t a ntion of       a

        crowd barrier,            My two     brothers       were       to my       left    about      a couple        of   feet

        away.      B a s i c a l l y we were      still    together.              However.,      I had    lost sight            of

        tras p e d on the stantion.                My brother, ________ who was                    now a couple            of

        yards     in front       of me still        on my    left.           He    began to       panic and shou t e d

        he    c o u l d n ’t breathe.       I shouted       to him just             keep your         head and hands

        above     the    crowd.      It must       have    been about             3 minutes       past 3       (1503)      by

        now.      You n o r m a l l y get a crush to some                 degree       w hen you go to a big

        and     I could feel        panic     begin to       rise       in me.        Following         the surge          m

        the     pen and my being           caught     on the          stantion       I was      now standing          up at

        an a w k w a r d angle,      about 3 ft off              the floor.           There      were    people       leaning

        over me w h i c h       p r evented me      from getting              upright.          B elow ms was         a youth

         sshQut   18 or     19 yrs       old who was       s c reaming         get me out.            B e l o w him was          a

        man about         2 0-24 yrs      old.     His    face was           blue and       continued      to increase

         in colour.         His    face was        expressionless             and the       body was motionless.

         He was      either     uncons c i o u s    or dead.           I ’m afraid         I cannot      describe          him

         or the y o u t h direc t l y below me.                  At    this    time       there was      another        surge,

         barrier        to my    right    on w h i c h    I was       trapped.        F o llowing       this     surge         the

         next     thing    I remember was           seeing       this    barrier          on the floor and those 5

         m e n had vanished.             They had d i s a p p e a r e d       under       the   crowd.     There was             a

was       two     bobbies        either    side    of     him.        One    of them was           banging       him with

two hands             clenched together            on the           chest,    quite a number              of times            and

then        blowing        into his mouth.               To    the    other      side      of him was       another

copper w i t h            a girl       of about     17 yrs          old    in his arms.            At    first       he had

been trying               to   clear     her mouth.            He then just had hold of her                          and

w o u l d n ’t let         her    go.     He was     crying          his    eyes     out.        F r o m here    the         four

the same        hoarding w h i c h was            about         9*    long.     T h e n myself,       this    bloke

w it h w hom      I had got the hoarding,                       a steward and 3 p o licemen took                    hold

of the hoarding            and     ran a cross          the        pitch and to the P e n i s t o n e Rd side

of the N o r t h S t a n d where            there were               a number    of ambulances.              There

„      p , i sg = i q * 0 f police,              St   John's          me n and fire m e n      running around.

One     ambulance man           came over          to the          two m e n on the        hoardings.         He

 looked at        the older        man who         had gone           blue and d i s m i s s e d him and tu r n e d

 his a t t e n t i o n to the younger                 lad,      to w h i c h he showed more             response.

Tj-ia .ambulance had been               r e v e r s e d up and this              lad was      put    into the

 ambulance.

 I     ferried      people       like this         about 4 or 5 times, moving                  atotal     of 6

 people and of these 4                  of these           I reco g n i s e d to be dead.

 Following         the    last transfer            of      people       I went    back     onto the      pitch to go

 back across         but    there was           now a line            of   police across         the    pitch.           One

           of those                       bobbies        told me to            'get     off    the    p i t c h , * and    I went    over       by

           the S o u t h S t a n d trying                            to get      back       but    I c o u l d n ’t.      There were       some

           Notts                 fans          in the Kop end shouting,                       "Die you b a s t a r d s . "       In fact        as   I

           had been going                             b e t w e e n the S o u t h S ta n d and the Kop w ith                  people       on the

           hoardings                       some of the Notts                   fans     spat      at us.       T hey must     have       known

           what was                       going       on because          they w o u l d       have    seen all         the bodies        going

            past             but          I r e m ained       near      enough        near     the m i d d l e    of the S o u t h S t a n d on

            the          edqe             of    the     pitch until            it was       a n n o u n c e d that     the m atch had been

            abandoned.                          At about       4.3G       pm    (163Q)        I then met         up with my two           brothers

            arid                          and ‘“a Iked out of              the    gr o u n d by way         of the N orth West             !srrace

            but we                let          the ground empty a lot more                         before we a t t em p t e d       to    leave.

            I feel                if not for the                    f i r e m a n and    a lot of        the     supporters        a lot more

            then a qain they ma y not have                                      r e a l i s e d straight         away what was           happening

            and what                      did all         the damage was              the     dividing      fences        in the    pens w hich

            pre v e n t e d                the       crowds        from spr e a d i n g       out and      c o n t r ibuted towards         the

            crush and deaths,

            The Pol i c e                      lacked       control       from        start to finish and as                I have       said

            there was                      not       enough of them and                 I didn't        see a steward until               I got

             onto            the          pitch.          As a result           there was            not enough        control     of the       crowd

             entering                     the       ground and there             s h o u l d have       been some         control at the

             entrance                     to the tunnel.

At   this       time a large metal                 gate was          opened.        This f o rm e d      part of a

floor       of the      turnstile.               The    op er at o r     had hold of the fan by the hand

disappeared            into    the    crowd w h ic h had now d ev e lo p ed outside.

some were          drunk.         Heated arguments             broke     out a nd the           s i t u a t i o n behind

the t u r n s t i l e s     became       very tense.           The    crush         cont in ue d and     persons

entering          the g o r u n d were making             c o m pl a in t s    of    injury due to the

c o n d i t i o n outside.

At     this    time     I saw an         Inspector        (name      not known)          who was      s tood by the

metal     fence.          I went        to him a n d      i nf or me d him that            extra o ff i ce r s were

B y 3pm     (1300)      the p r e s su re         outside was at            its worst.         P e o p l e were

A   loud roar was h e ar d from the                     inside        of the g ro un d a nd the           crush

seemed to get worse.                  This was          o b v i o u s l y the teams       e n te ri ng    the    pitch.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 0 5 p m    (1305)      that      date the two gates A a nd 8 were

opened and a f lood of persons                        e nt e r e d the ground.            At this        time there

w as a further           loud     roar      f rom the     crowd       in the g round          a nd the     persons

pouring into           the g ro un d        accelerated           their      pace.      T here was       no way of

checking        t ickets      or directing any of the                     crowd.          It was a stampede            of

people      it was      total       chaos     they had but             one thing          on their m inds        and

that was        to get      into the ground a nd w a t c h the match.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 0 6 p m    (1306)      that      date    I was      info rm ed that       there

was a      pitch     i n v a si on and that           o ff i ce r s    had been r eq u es t ed to a tt en d

control       into the S o u t h stand and d ow n onto                       the field of          play.

I saw that          there w ere a number                of s u p p o r t e r s   on the field,           it was

Supporters          f rpm the       rear were still               pushing          f or ward at this          stage

onto    the       persons      tr ap pe d against           the    fence.           X could see         that       there

were, a number             of persons who had been f o rc e d up into                           the air           by the

I could see that a great disaste r was                                 h a p p e n i n g and    I felt       so

helpless          to prevent        it.         I saw DS M o r t o n a g a i n and said to him

s o m e th in g    like     "There must            be a bou t     t w en ty or thir ty dead".

I then saw Supt.               G r e e n w o o d who was        by the gate            to pen number              three.

remember       that PC F a i r c l o u g h was      d i r e c tl y b e hi nd me.        E n t r y t o the

huge    blob of h uman beings,               all   were    i n te r t w i n e d and    I w o u l d estimate

that    there were approx,imaely SO or so bodies                          there.        1 could see that

a large       number     of them w e r e / a p p e a r e d dead.         T he y wre     lifeless          their

moaning,       others who were           t ra pp e d by their       limbs were          s c r e am i ng    for

help.

The    crowd had m o v e d        back by now a n d the           pressure at the             front       of the

it took       6'ome m o m e n t s     to ext ract           her    from the      pile of      foodies.         She was

        |the     pressure         outside        the t u r n s t i l e s was     such that         if the

o c c u rr ed o utside           the ground.          T he re      is little doubt that w he n the

crowd       inside        the    g ro un d    roared then this            caused extra            pressure

outside        the       g ro un d and w o ul d      in my o p i n i o n have         caused f at al i ti e s          by th

Further to my report of the 2nd May 1989.


I entered the Leppings Lane Terrace through gate number    3.Immediately in
front of me and to my left there were approximately 50 or so bodies there.
All these bodies were entwined together making removal very difficult.
To enter the pen through gate 3 I had to climb over the bodies. I was the
second person to enter the pen through that gate from the perimeter track.
On referring to the map shown I can say that the greatest concentration
of bodies were in squares 04, 5, 6 and P4,5,6 and 7.
I began pulling bodies    from this area and pass them onto other officers who
had followed    me into the pen.   When the pile of bodies dwindled I accoirpanied
one of the bodies a male from the pen, it was at this stage I became aware that
one of the barriers was damaged.    This barrier is directly in front of the gate
to pen 3 and is located in squares M6,7,8 on the map.
The area where I went to assist in removing the bodies    was the same area
where I had been leaning over the fence.

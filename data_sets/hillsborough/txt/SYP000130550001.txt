to a t t e n d     either          the     planning         or    the       Sub Sector             Commanders             briefing,

and    in a n y     case       I was         closely        involved with                   I n s p S E W E L L , the          Footbal1

Liaison Officer,                   in the         planning        and where                I was       unable       to a t t e n d ,       he

did a t t e n d     on m y         behalf.           Having       said        this,         I was       not    informed             of a n y

conversation             or    q ua l if i ca ti o n which was                    being          fronted       by S u p t       GREENWOOD

in    regard       to    the m o v e m e n t         of L i v e r pool           f ans      with       tickets       for       the       Spion

seeing      Supt        GREENWOOD            on the m o r n i n g           of    15 A p r i 1 1 9 89          {150489),             after

the m a s s      briefing           for all          officers.

Dealing       with       the       mass      briefing           of all        officers            on the       15 A p r i l

(150489),          this       was     conducted            in the N o r t h S t a n d a n d we                   had a         public

address       system          set     up.         C/Supt        DUCKENFIELD                first       addressed          the       briefing

and    he    dealt       with       the      format        for    the       briefing             and    the    various          headings

as    set    out    in the           *F' Divison Police                     Order          for    the m a t c h .         Regarding

the    need      to m o n i t o r        for      public        order       and       safety        I can      remember             he    s p oke

about       searching          and       the      need     to w a t c h w h a t            was    taken       into       the    ground

having       regard       to w h a t         is     said    in the          ground          regulations             ie f l a g s         poles,

banners,         in f a c t        anything          that       can    be     used         as    a weapon.           On       the    Crowd

Saf et y aspect,              he    mentioned            segregation and                    the    sterile          areas       and       the

need    to m a i n t a i n         them      climbing           on the        various            fixtures        and      fittings

within       the    ground and               policy        in    regard          to    inflatables.                 He    specifically

mentioned          the    need        to     be     firm and          f air      and       to    have    regard          to    public

safety.          I can not            remember           his     exact        words         at    the    briefing,             but       I do

rec a l l    they were             broadly          speaking          in a c c o r d a n c e       with       his    briefing             notes

which       I had       seen       p r ior     to the       match.

So    far   as     I am       concerned             this    briefing             was       a good       one    as    compared with

other       briefings          for       football          matches          that       I have attended.                       It w a s

clear,       concise          and     to     t he    point a n d         I believe               it w a s     p i t c h e d at       the

proper       level       for       the a u d i e n c e      to w h o m        it w a s          addressed.           Certainly
when     it f i n i s h e d        I was      perfectly           cle a r    about        what       my     duties       and

responsibilities                   were     for     the m a t c h .

Following           on f r o m C / S u p t        DUCKENFIELD,              was     Supt       MURRAY who           dealt       with

communications                and     emergency           evacuation          procedures              and D/Sgt

CHA R L E S W O R T H who          dealt     with        intelligence              which       had    been        received        prior

to    th e m a t c h .        Insp S E W E L L       then        spoke      about administrative                        and

logistical             matters        before        the    briefing          closed.

It w a s      at    this      stage       that      I went        over      and     spoke        to S u p t       GREENWOOD          on

the Kop.            Also      present        was     Insp C A L V E R T and              I think          Insp BOOTH,

together           with      the    officers         in the i r S e r i a l s            responsible              for    policing

the    Kop.         Supt      GREENWOOD actually                    briefed         this       group        to    the    effect       that

any Liverpool                supporters           on the K o p w o u l d            be    directed           or    escorted          to

the    triangular             a r e a at      the    North        s ide     designated              as a h o l d i n g        area

where       they w o uld           rem a i n .      Gradually          as    they        increased           in n u m b e r , so

supervising             officers          would       increase         the     number          of    officers           to    supervise

them     pro-rata.             Supt       G R E E N W O O D ’S    instructions             were        quite       explicit,          that

none     of    these         fans     would       be m o v e d      from     the     ’H o p 8 w i t h o u t        his

authority.              This       was    a qualification                 of w h a t      w as      l aid    down       in the

Police        Order.

I can not           remember          if he       e x p l a i n e d at      th e    briefing,             th e    reasoning

behind        t hi s    instruction,              or w h e t h e r     he m e n t i o n e d         it to me        on       the w a y

over     to    do      the    briefing.              But    in a n y        case,        I was       aware        that       it was

related        to      preventing           supporters            being      moved        into a n a r e a a l r e a d y at

capacity.              It w a s     a n all       ticket         m a t c h a n d all       tickets           had    been       sold,

therefore           all      other       areas      of    the     ground were             at     capacity.              Certainly         so

far    as     I am      concerned,            the    i n s t r u c t i o n was       related           to    public          safety and

the    prevention             of    overcrowding            as      distinct         to    public           order       and    the    need

for    segregation             and       t ha t   was made          clear      by S u p t        GREENWOOD.

Subsequent             to    this     briefing           I saw      both C/Supt            DUCKENFIELD              and Supt

GREENWOOD around                   the    ground,         inside and          o u t s i d e , talking              to    individual
                                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                                SS3

             officers        and       I assume       they were         checking       that      everything         was       going

            according            to    plan.

             Whilst       I do        not    specifically          r e c a l 1 Supt    G R E E N W O O D m e n t i o n i n g - at

             briefing        a    crushing          incident       on   the   Lappings         Lane    terraces          in    1981

             ( 00 0 08 1)    I can          recall    him m e n t i o ni ng     this       incident      to me      at    some      s t age

             during       the     planning,          but    I already         knew    of    it t h e n a n y w a y .      I do

             recall       him m ent io nin g          some    public      order       type     incident(s)          t hat      occurred

             during       the     1988       (000088)       semi    f i nal    on    the K o p    between        the L i v e r p o o l

             and Nottingham Forest                     supporters        in    the    holding       area     but    this was          not

             related        to    public          safety.

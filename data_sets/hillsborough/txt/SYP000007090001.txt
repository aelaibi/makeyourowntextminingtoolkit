                arriving         in the             road outside with Liverpool                               fans     in them.      All   of   ins

                 cars were         full            of         people,              mostly all white males              in their mid to          late

OVI              Football        Club,,                 I noticed                  they were       throwing    their     empty Beer        cans and

             the     public: could see      them or not.

             This     behaviour was       no different   to any other      on the occasions        of ine

                  %o     9x3t5am (0930).           I was      in the kitc h e n       lookina      out and       I c ould see

                   A n d r e w a nd his four        friends         outside      getting    in and out of his               car.

                  He then       ran into the house,                 ran straight        upstairs,        got some mo ney,

                   came     back     into the kitchen.               We had a short          c o n v e r s a t i o n and   he

                   left.      He     came back d o w n the           path,     put his     head    round the door,

                   q u i c k l y asked me to        record the football               m a t c h and then        left again,

                   this was the           last time         I saw him.

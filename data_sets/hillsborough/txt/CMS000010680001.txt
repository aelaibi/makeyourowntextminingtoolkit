    HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY: FINAL REPORT - POLICE ISSUES


    1.   Thank you for copying to Peter Bolton your note of 20
    February and draft circular about police charging. I am
    replying in his absence from the office today and tomorrow.

    2.   First, our view is that the last sentence of paragraph
    210 of the Final Report is consistent with the Safety of

•   Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act). We are also content
    with the idea of moving towards better stewarding and less
    policing. This point was raised with Lord Ferrers last
    November by Mr Fox of the Football League. A copy of the note
    of that meeting (paragraph 4 refers) is attached. See also
    the Home Secretary's comments on 29 January (extract from
    Hansard attached). Crowd control, by which we mean directing,
    marshalling etc and the sort of duties described in paragraph
    10(b) of the draft circular is, in our view, a proper part of
    crowd safety management for which the club is responsible.
    Police presence is, we understand, a backup to normal
    stewarding because of the law and order risks associated with
    soccer matches in particular.   (Some sports, for example horse
    racing already employ private security firms as part of their
    crowd control arrangements.)

    3.   We are content to encourage local authorities to try to
    improve stewarding arrangements at grounds but terms and
    conditions of safety certificates which relate to police
    presence must reserve the determination of that presence to
    the chief officer of police. Local authorities may not
    therefore be in a position to offer "trade-offs" without
    police agreement.

    Draft circular

    4.   We would prefer to delete paragraph 5 of the circular
    altogether since charging for the police is linked more
    directly to section 15 of the Police Act 1964 rather than
    safety certificates which are not necessarily consistent on
    the point. But if you feel that paragraph 5 is important we
    suggest it should be amended as attached.

    5.    Paragraph 8(c) is awkward. As mentioned above, if you
    mean here that the stewarding arrangements are poor it is up
    to the club and the local authority to improve them. Subject
    to F 8 's views we think that the police should not be used for
    normal stewarding purposes.    If clubs are not willing to
ensure to the satisfaction of the certificating authority that
proper stewards are provided the authorised crowd capacity for
the ground should be reduced to reflect the ground condition -
which include the crowd management arrangements as well as the
structural condition.
6.   We recommend deletion of paragraph 10(a) and the phrase
"structural improvements or" in paragraph 11(d) of the draft.
We do not wish to encourage more pitch barrier fencing which
poses other safety difficulties and cost implications.

REVISED   paragraph   5


Safety certificates are required for grounds designated by the

Secretary of State under section 1(1) of the Safety of Sports

Grounds Act 1975.         They are issued by local authorities and
contain such terms and conditions as the local authority

consider necessary or expedient to secure a reasonable safety
at the ground.    Where certificates require the holder to

arrange for the attendance of adequate number of police

officers within the ground the extent of the provision of

police services must/ under section 2 of the 1975 Act as

amended, be reserved for the determination of the Chief Police

Officer of the force in question.

NOTE OF A MEETING HELD ON 29 NOVEMBER WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE
FOOTBALL LEAGUE____________________________ .
                                            ___________________



President:   Lord Ferrers                    Mr W Fox
             Mr Mould                        Mr Whalley
             Mr Smith                        Mr A Hutt
             Miss Nicholson



In thanking Lord Ferrers for the meeting Mr Hutt said that it was
good, for Mr Fox who had only recently become President to have the
opportunity to meet the Minister responsible for the police. They
hadL come today to discuss 3 matters:
     1.   The implications of the Lord Justice Taylor Report;
     2.   Pitch invasions;.and
     3.   Ticket touting.

2.    Mr Fox said that since the Taylor interim report certain
clubs were experiencing situations of. over policing. For example
a.,small, club like: Hartlepool was being, policed: as though it werei.a
clubclike?- Arsenals-;At Yorkr thee situation was that" evenr though;;•:t :
pension the .terracingsweret,empty- arpolice officer and; a^ club
steward? were&ort duty* instfront of&thenK3wWhile it was* acknowledged
that, this was one of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations Mr Fox
felt sure that it was not meant to operate in this way.
M r Whalley pointed out that the- Taylor reportIwas based on a large
all.iticket match. The police had taken a pounding in the report
and^therefore they were now being ultra careful. This of course
led to the situations which had been referred to. Mr Smith agreed
that the situation which Mr Fox had described was not whs*A:i Lord
Justice Taylor would, have envisaged. Although sympathetic to what
Mr Fox had had to say Lord Ferrers said that it would be premature
at this stage to interfere. He agreed with what Mr Whalley had
had to say about the police being very careful. This was very
understandable and no doubt through time things would settle down.
Mr Fox agreed with the line taken - he certainly hoped things
would settle but wanted at this stage to make Lord Ferrers aware
of his concerns.

3.   Mr Fox referred to various matches which had had crowd
trouble and which he had been involved in making enquiries into.
Having looked at the various reports from the police involved in
those matches he had formed the view that there was no uniformity
of procedures. Give this situation he asked whether the Home
Office was in a position to put out a circular to chief constables
giving advice on best practice. While agreeing that this was
perfectly possible Lord Ferrers believed it was inadvisable at
this stage, for the reasons he had made earlier, ie, that some



                                                   /time should..

                                     1
time should elapse to see how things proceeded. Mr Hutt asked
whether Lord Ferrers would welcome evidence from the League early
next year on how things were running. It was agreed that this
would be useful but Lord Ferrers hoped that the League would look,
at the constructive side of things as well as the negative.
4.    Another matter of concern Mr Fox said was the number of
police officers now involved as a result of Taylor's interim
recommendations. He felt that the time was now ripe for clubs to
look to using security firms such as Securior within the grounds.
He was only too aware of the demands which were placed on the
police and it was not right that there were less police able to
carry out their normal day to day duties because they were
required to attend a football match. Mr Fox said that he did not
envisage that the police would not be involved but simply that the
police presence^ should be augmented. Mr Smith said that in
general a move to more professional stewarding would be welcomed.
He referred to his experience, at. a football match in Glasgow where
a* security group- called: "Rocksteady" did-, a wonderful job. Mr Hutt
thought that some consensus*, of opinion must exist on howi using;- the
police with a security company would operate. Lord Ferrers'
thought that !:& clubs* were^ to got down this road it mightr be
necessary to provide a code of practice but that a final decision
on this would have to lie with chief officers of police. However,
he didn't envisage that the police would be unco-operative about
this.

5.   Although not related to the implications of the Taylor
interim report Mr Whalley spoke of a new situation which clubs
found themselves in. This was that they were now being charged
for police reserves sitting in vans outside the ground. The
principle had always been that the clubs paid for those in the
grounds and that the police paid for those outside. The question
was, Lord Ferrers said, whether those officers sitting in vans
outside the ground were back-up for the police inside. If they
weren't then Lord Ferrers agreed that the clubs should not be
expected to pay. Mr Whalley would keep Mr Smith in touch over
this particular issue.

6.   Mr Fox referred to a question which Lord Justice Taylor had
put to him, ie, should pitch invasion become a criminal offence.
It was the Football League's view that it should. It was
Mr Hutt's view that Lord Justice Taylor was looking to see whether
there was scope for such an offence. Mr Fox referred to the
Arsenal-Everton game last year at which Lord Ferrers had been
present and where a pitch invasion had occurred. That invasion



                                                /had been an.

                                   2
had been an example of high spirits but the problem was that
situations could easily turn. The Football League, had amongst
other things, to think of the safety of players. Although Mr Fox
believed that trouble within grounds was not as bad as it once
was, they were still worried about this aspect. Lord Ferrers saw
difficulties in making pitch invasions a criminal offence. The
practicalities of making it so would have to be considered.

7.   Turning to the matter of ticket touts, the final point which
he and his colleagues wished to discuss, Mr Fox said he was
concerned about how touts operated on the day of the game. Taking
the FA Cup Final as an example Mr Fox explained that despite
precautions tickets still .found their way to the touts. The touts
blocked the market and sold tickets regardless of whether or not
the buyer would be sitting amongst supporters of his own team.
Mr Fox hoped that consideration would be given to making it an
offence to sell tickets on match days. The difficulty
Lord Ferrers saw with this concerned the innocent man attending a
match with a group but because one of them: drops out through
illness, for example, he would be committing an offence by trying
to sell his ticket. The other problem; would be that touts would
simply sell their tickets further and further away from the
grounds, say at the train stations where supporters would arrive.
Mr Fox appreciated the difficulties and said that the way round it
might be to make it an offence to sell tickets above the face
value.

8.   In concluding the meeting Lord Ferrers said that he was
grateful to Mr Fox and his colleagues for having made him aware of
their concerns and should they find it useful in the future to
come and see him again.

    Mr Bolton


    HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY FINAL REPORT: POLICE ISSUES
    1.   You asked for advice on the highlighted issues in the
    attached note from Mr Addison to Mr Goddard. My comments are
    below and I attach a draft reply to Mr Addison for
    consideration.

    2.   First, the question of paragraph 210 of the Final Report.
    In my view the last sentence of that paragraph is consistent
    with the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act).
    The presence of well trained stewards, irrespective of their
    terms of contract are an integral part of spectator safety.
    What has to be clear of course is who is responsible for what.
    This leads to the second point about the general thrust away
    from police and towards trained stewards (paragraph 5 of Mr
    Addison's note).

    3.   Safety certificates issued under the 1975 Act do not have
    to contain terms and conditions relating to police presence -
    which may be negotiated direct between the police and the
    club. If such terms and conditions are included they must
    reserve the extent of any police presence for determination by
    the relevant Chief Police Officer.

    4.   I would endorse the thrust towards more stewards and less
    police. This was something raised by Mr Fox of the Football
    League when he saw Lord Ferrers last November (see paragraph 4
    of the note of that meeting)!: In this context I am
    interpreting "crowd control" to mean marshalling, directing,
    monitoring crowds and carrying out the sort of duties
    described in paragraph 10(b) of the draft circular enclosed
    with Mr Addison's note. Police should not be used for these
    purposes. They are, or should be, used only as a backup to
    normal stewarding because of the potential law and order
    problems which stewards, no matter how well trained, cannot
    nor should not be expected to deal with.

    5.   I am not sure that local authorities are in any position
    to offer "trade-offs" between stewards and police given the
    reserve power of chief police officers. The initiative for
    these would need to come from the police although I can see no
    objection to us encouraging local authorities to be tougher
    about stewarding requirements (see below).
                                  ***
    Draft Circular

    6.   I am not sure I see the relevance of paragraph 5 of the
    circular, if it is to be included at all I think it should
    reflect the 1975 Act's provisions and should not speculate on
    what references are made in safety certificates to payment for
    police services. I agree that such references are made in
safety certificates but I confess I have never been sure how
they could be enforced or of their relevance since payment is
required by section 15 of the Police Act 1964. My feeling is
that it would be better not to make the link between payment
and safety certificates.

7.   I am not sure what is meant in paragraph 8(c) by "crowd
control". If it means stewarding then, as mentioned above,
local authorities and clubs should ensure that any “poor"
conditions are put right. The police should not in my view be
in a position for having to be ground stewards. Reductions in
authorised crowd capacities to reflect these poor conditions
should be made within safety certificates if necessary.

8.   Like you, I think paragraph 10(a) of the circular should
be deleted as should the words "structural improvements or" to
paragraph 11(d). I think the last thing we would wish to do
at the present time is encourage the erection of more "safety"
barrier fencing.

9.   On the question of consultation my feeling is that it
would be right to consult both DOE and the football
authorities. I would be inclined to consult DOE first taking
their advice on whether it would be right to consult the
latter. F8 may have their own views on the advisability of
doing so.

1.    Thank you for copying to me your note of 20 February and

draft circular about police charging.



2.    First, our view is that the last sentence of paragraph

210 of the Final Report is consistent with     the     Safety of

Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act).     We are also content
with the idea of moving towards better stewarding and less

policing.     This point was raised with Lord Ferrers last
Nov

circular is, in our view, a proper part of crowd safety
                                                                                  v

management for which the club is responsible.        Police ap         & l+vJLaJ \
presence is, we understand, a backup to normal stewarding

because of the law and order risks associated with soccer

matches in particular.     (Some sports, for example horse racing

already employ private security firms as part of their crowd

control arrangements.)
3.   We are content to encourage local authorities to try to
improve stewarding arrangements at grounds but terms and

conditions of safety certificates which relate to police

presence must reserve the determination of that presence to

the chief officer of police.       Local authorities are not
therefore in a position to offer "trade-offs" without police

agreement.

                               %

Draft circular



4.   We would prefer to delete paragraph 5 of the circular

altogether since charging for the police is linked more
directly to section 15 of the Police Act 1964 rather than

safety certificates which are not necessarily consistent on

the point.   But if you feel that paragraph 5 is important we
suggest it should be amended as attached.



5.   Paragraph 8(c) is awkward.       As mentioned above, if you

mean here that the stewarding arrangements are poor it is up

to the club and the local authority to improve them.       Subject

to F8's views we think that the police should not be used for

normal stewarding purposes.    If clubs are not willing to

ensure to the satisfaction of the certificating authority that

proper stewards are provided}the authorised crowd capacity for

the ground should be reduced to reflect the ground condition -

which include the crowd management arrangements as well as the
structural condition.
6.   We recommend deletion of paragraph 10(a) and the phrase

"structural improvements or" in paragraph 11(d) of the draft

We do not wish to encourage more pitch barrier fencing which

poses other safety difficulties and cost implications, for

REVISED PARAGRAPH 5


Safety certificates are required for grounds designated by the

Secretary of State under section 1(1) of the Safety of Sports

Grounds Act 1975.   They are issued by local authorities and

contain such terms and conditions as the local authority

consider necessary or expedient to secure a reasonable safety
at the ground.   Where certificates require the holder to
arrange for the attendance of adequate number of police

officers within the ground the extent of the provision of

police services must, under section 2 of the 1975 Act as

amended, be reserved for the determination of the Chief Police
Officer of the force in question.

   NOTE OF A MEETING HELD ON 29 NOVEMBER WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE
   FOOTBALL LEAGUE _________ _____________________________________



   President:   Lord Ferrers                Mr W Fox
                Mr Mould                    Mr Whalley
                Mr Smith                    Mr A Hutt
                Miss Nicholson



   In thanking Lord Ferrers for the meeting Mr Hutt said that it was
   good for Mr Fox who had only recently become President to have the
   opportunity to meet the Minister responsible for the police. They
   had come today to discuss 3 matters:

        1. The implications of the Lord Justice Taylor Report;
        2. Pitch invasions; and
        3., Ticket touting.

   2.   Mr Fox said that since the Taylor interim report certain
   clubs were experiencing situations of over policing. For example
   a small club like Hartlepool was being policed as though it were a
   club like Arsenal. At York the situation was that even though
   pens on the terracing were empty a police officer and a club
   steward were on duty in front of them. While it was acknowledged
   that this was one of Lord     Justice Taylor'srecommendationsMr Fox
   felt sure that it was not     meant to operatein this way.
   Mr Whalley pointed out that the Taylor report was based on a large
   all ticket match. The police had taken a pounding in the report
   and therefore they were now being ultra careful. This of course
   led to the situations which had been referred to. Mr Smith agreed
   that the situation which Mr Fox had described was not whPM i Lord
   Justice Taylor would have envisaged. Although sympathetic to what
   Mr Fox had had to say Lord Ferrers said that it would be premature
   at this stage to interfere. He agreed with what Mr Whalley had
   had to say about the police being very careful. This was very
   understandable and no doubt through time things would settle down.
   Mr Fox agreed with the line taken - he certainly hoped things
   would settle but wanted at this stage to make Lord Ferrers aware
   of his concerns.

   3.   Mr Fox referred to various matches which had had crowd
   trouble and which he had been involved in making enquiries into.
   Having looked at the various reports from the police involved in
   those matches he had formed the view that there was no uniformity
   of procedures. Give this situation he asked whether the Home
   Office was in a position to put out a circular to chief constables
   giving advice on best practice. While agreeing that this was
   perfectly possible Lord Ferrers believed it was inadvisable at
   this stage, for the reasons he had made earlier, ie, that some



                                                /time should....

                                      1
E.R.
-   <»




         time should elapse to see how things proceeded. Mr Hutt asked
         whether Lord Ferrers would welcome evidence from the League early
         next year on how things were running. It was agreed that this
         would be useful but Lord Ferrers hoped that the League would look
         at the constructive side of things as well as the negative.
         4.    Another matter of concern Mr Fox said was the number of
         police officers now involved as a result of Taylor's interim
         recommendations. He felt that the time was now ripe for clubs to
         look to using security firms such as Securior within the grounds.
         He was only too aware of the demands which were placed on the
         police and it was not right that there were less police able to
         carry out their normal day to day duties because they were
         required to attend a football match. Mr Fox said that he did not

•        envisage that the police would not be involved but simply that the
         police presence should be augmented. Mr Smith said that in
         general a move to more professional stewarding would be welcomed.
         He referred to his experience at a football match in Glasgow where
         a security group called "Rocksteady" did a wonderful job. Mr Hutt
         thought that some consensus of opinion must exist on how using the
         police with a security company would operate. Lord Ferrers
         thought that if clubs were to go down this road it might be
         necessary to provide a code of practice but that a final decision
         on this would have to lie with chief officers of police. However,
         he didn't envisage that the police would be unco-operative about
         this.

         5.   Although not related to the implications of the Taylor
         interim report Mr Whalley spoke of a new situation which clubs
         found themselves in. This was that they were now being charged
         for police reserves sitting in vans outside the ground. The
         principle had always been that the clubs paid for those in the
         grounds and that the police paid for those outside. The question
         was, Lord Ferrers said, whether those officers sitting in vans
         outside the ground were back-up for the police inside. If they
         weren1t then Lord Ferrers agreed that the clubs should not be
         expected to pay. Mr Whalley would keep Mr Smith in touch over
         this particular issue.

         6.   Mr Fox referred to a question which Lord Justice Taylor had
         put to him, ie, should pitch invasion become a criminal offence.
         It was the Football League's view that it should. It was
         Mr Hutt's view that Lord Justice Taylor was looking to see whether
         there was scope for such an offence. Mr Fox referred to the
         Arsenal-Everton game last year at which Lord Ferrers had been
         present and where a pitch invasion had occurred. That invasion



                                                      /had been an....

                                         2
E.R.



   had been an example of high spirits but the problem was that
   situations could easily turn. The Football League, had amongst
   other things, to think of the safety of players. Although Mr Fox
   believed that trouble within grounds was not as bad as it once
   was, they were still worried about this aspect. Lord Ferrers saw
   difficulties in making pitch invasions a criminal offence. The
   practicalities of making it so would have to be considered.

   7.   Turning to the matter of ticket touts, the final point which
   he and his colleagues wished to discuss, Mr Fox said he was
   concerned about how touts operated on the day of the game. Taking
   the FA Cup Final as an example Mr Fox explained that despite
   precautions tickets still .found their way to the touts. The touts
   blocked the market and sold tickets regardless of whether or not
   the buyer would be sitting amongst supporters of his own team.
   Mr Fox hoped that consideration would be given to making it an
   offence to sell tickets on match days. The difficulty
   Lord Ferrers saw with this concerned the innocent man attending a
   match with a group but because one of them drops out through
   illness, for example, he would be committing an offence by trying
   to sell his ticket. The other problem would be that touts would
   simply sell their tickets further and further away from the
   grounds, say at the train stations where supporters would arrive.
   Mr Fox appreciated the difficulties and said that the way round it
   might be to make it an offence to sell tickets above the face
   value.

   8.   In concluding the meeting Lord Ferrers said that he was
   grateful to Mr Fox and his colleagues for having made him aware of
   their concerns and should they find it useful in the future to
   come and see him again.

              TAYLOR REPORT : POLICE ISSUES

              In your note of 9 February, you drew my attention to
              Recommendation 53 of the Taylor report, which deals with charging
              for police football matches.
              2.   Z think that the question of charges might best be addressed
1^            by the issue of a circular, drawing on the conclusions of the
              1983 Home Office Working Party on Charges for Policing Football
              Matches, which was never circulated.
              3.   Recommendation 53 may not, however, be solely concerned with
              charging policy. As paragraph 210 makes clear, one reason why
              Lord Justice Taylor wants more realistic charges to be set is to
              enable clubs to consider whether they need so many police
              officers in attendance and to consider more cost effective
              alternatives such as properly trained stewards.       Clubs may,
              however, not have a truly free choice. We have a court decision
              which says in effect that while clubs may request a police
              presence it is the chief constable who decides the numbers - and
              the club must still pay.      And that    is the effect of the
              subsequent legislation on safety at sports grounds because
              conditions of licences may well require the clubs to requ£g£ and
              pay for such numbers of police officers as the chief constable
              recommends.

          \ 4.   Two questions therefore                    arise. The first, mainly I take it
    ft    tfor G2,    is whether we can                      reconcilethe last sentence of
    *     1paragraph 210 with the safety                     of sports grounds legislation and
          \ if not whether this matters.                    I would be grateful for Mr Bolton's
          \ advice on this.

              5.   The second is whether on crowd control and safety grounds
              we are content with the general thrust away from police and
              towards trained stewards. This is for F8 and G2 and I would be
              grateful for your comments as well as Mr Bolton's on it. If you
              are in favour on policy grounds, then perhaps this implies a
              G2/F8 circular advising local authorities/chief constables that
              licence conditions should be amended wherever possible to allow
              for more stewards/fewer police.     Such parallel action seems
              indicated if the full impact of the Taylor recommendation is to
              be made as he intended.

              6.         A draft circular, on which I would propose to consult ACPO,
              the Superintendents' Association, the Police Federation, the AMA
    ^         and the ACC is attached. I would be grateful for any comments
              you and Mr Bolton have on this and for your answers to the
              questions I pose above. Would you please also note my intention
    to include the Police Federation and the Superintendents’
    Association in the consultation process and ensure that the same
    is done on other Hillsborough related consultation exercises,
    unless you see some overwhelming objection to this. Should we
W   consult the DOE or the football authorities? If so, I would be
    grateful for the relevant names and addresses.

The Chief Constable




Dear Sir

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO                /1990
CHARGES FOR POLICING FOOTBALL MATCHES


1.    Lord    Justice        Taylor's      report   on    his   inquiry into     the

Hillsborough stadium disaster recommended                       (Recommendation 53)
that:

       "Police Authorities should review the charges they make to
       clubs for the costs of policing inside grounds so as to

       ensure that realistic charges are made.                     The Home Office

       should      take      steps    to   ensure    consistency       of practice,

       subject to local discretion and the need to have regard to
       local circumstances."


2.    The    reasoning        behind    this   recommendation was given           in
paragraph 210 of the reports



       "The temptation to the clubs to leave it all to the police
       is stronger if they are not required to make realistic

       payment         for   police    services.         No   charge   is made   for

       officers outside the ground since maintaining law and order
     in the streets is a normal public function of the police.

     At the present time, the practice as to recovering costs of
     policing inside the grounds from clubs varies greatly from

     place to place, different formulae being used.             In some

     areas, the charge made is the actual cost of the officers
     attending   in the ground.         At others,   it is made on a

     sliding scale, dependent on whether the match is category
     A (high risk), B or C.      At others, it is dependent on the
     size of the crowd attending.         At some, it appears to be

     entirely arbitrary and at one ground it is said to be nil.
     In mv view a more consistent and businesslike approach
     should be made to such charges.        If clubs were to find it
     more   economical   to   recruit    efficient   stewards   than   to

     delegate duties to the police, there could be a significant

     reduction in the number of police deployed at football

     grounds, to the benefit of the community at large.”


The statutory position

3.   Section 15(1) of the Police Act 1964 provides that "the

chief officer of police of any police force may provide, at the

request of any person, special police services at any premises

or in any locality in the police area for which the force is

maintained, subject to the payment to the police authority of

charges on such scales as may be determined by that authority”.


4.   The expression "special police services” is not defined in

section 15 and must be given its natural meaning.         This is that

special services are services which would not, in the absence of
arrangements under section 15, be provided in pursuance of the
general duties of the police to preserve law a nd order.



5.     Safety certificates are required for stadia designated by

the Secretary of State under section 1(1) of the Safety of Sports

Grounds Act 1?75.                             They are issued by local authorities and

contain such rules and conditions as the local authority consider
necessary           or      expedient                 to   secure     reasonable          safety                     at the
stadium.            These certificates- gener-aAly require the holder to
arrange            for the              attendance of an adequate number of police

The view of central Government

6.     It has been the view of successive Governments since 1968

that the costs of special services should be paid in full by
those using the service and that no part of these costs should

be allowed to add to the general level of police expenditure and
thus to the burdens of taxpayers or ratepayers.                                           Charges should

be reviewed and adjusted as necessary - at least annually.                                                                 The

aim in principle should be to recover the full cost of those

police officers who are deployed at football matches solely

within the ground.
Charging and deployment policies

7.   If the full cost is to be recovered, there must be a direct

link between deployment and charges: the more officers the force
finds it necessary to deploy solely for duty within the ground,

the more the club should have to pay.       Under present charging
policies this is not always the case.



8.   There seem to be three main causes of undercharging:
     a.   Most forces charge for every officer deployed solely
          for   duty   within   the   ground     in   accordance     with
          agreements made with the clubs.        However, if the chief

          officer of police considers it necessary, because of

          the nature of the match or the reputation of the
          visiting supporters, to deploy inside the ground more

          officers than those agreements provide for, no extra
          charge is made.
                                       I




     b.   Some forces determine charges on the basis of a fixed
          formula.     Where the same formula is used for both
          charging     and   deployment,   the     economic   cost     is
          recovered.     But where the charging formula tears no
          relation to deployment (e.g. deployment is based on the
          chief officer's assessment of the policing need but
          charges are based on 2 constables - with supervising
          officers pro rata - per 1000 of actual attendance),

          charges are likely to fall some way short of recovering

          the full economic costs.     The disparity will normally
          be most marked in the case of the smaller clubs with

          low attendance figures.
      c.   Poor crowd control facilities at some grounds leave the
           police little option but to deploy so many officers

           inside the ground that the club would find it virtually

           impossible to meet the full economic cost.


Local considerations
9.    As Lord Justice Taylor acknowledged, local circumstances
cannot be ignored and charging policies must leave scope for

local discretion.     In particular -



      a.   The nature and location of the ground and the standard

           of   physical   aids   to    crowd   control     are     major
           considerations in determining the number of officers

           to be deployed inside the ground.      Facilities are often
           poorest at the grounds of clubs who are least able to

           pay the full economic cost of policing.


      b.   The financial plight of many clubs cannot be lightly

           dismissed.    Asking clubs to pay unrealistically high

           charges    for policing   could   lead   to   problems   with
           recovering dept and even to bankruptcy.


10.   There are, however, steps which the poorer clubs could take
to help themselves.     For example -

 |    a.   Structural   improvements,   such as     the provision of

           adequate safety barriers, would often help to reduce

 j         the number of police officers needed inside the ground

           and so reduce the cost of policing.
      b.   More, and better trained, stewards would similarly help

           to reduce the policing requirement.          Manning gates,
           directing spectators to the correct areas, keeping

           gangways clear and monitoring the density of packing
           in pens   and enclosures are all mentioned by Lord
           Justice Taylor as examples of duties which could be

           carried out by suitable, properly trained stewards.



Recommendation
11.   Police   authorities   and   chief     officers   of   police   are

therefore advised that:
      a.   The aim in principle should be to recover the full
           costs of all police officers deployed to duties solely

           within the ground at football matches.


      b.   Charging policies should be reviewed to ensure that
           there is a direct link between deployment and charges.



      c.   In cases where it       would clearly be unrealistic to
           require a club to       meet the full costs of policing
           inside the ground, local discretion may be exercised
           to reduce the scale     of charges.



      d.   It should, however,     be made clear in such cases that

           the club will be expected to take active steps (eg

^          structural   improvements    or    the   provision   of more
           effective stewarding arrangements) to reduce the levels

           of policing needed inside the ground.
12.   An additional copy of this circular is enclosed for the
Treasurer.



                                       Yours faithfully

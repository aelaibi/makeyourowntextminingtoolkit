              My name i s                                   I am a single man and I live at the above

              address with my mother

               I am a lifelong L i v e r p o o l supporter and for the past two years                               I have

               held a season ticket for the Kemlin Rd Stand.

              On Saturday 15th April                1989 (150489)           I went to the Hillsborough Ground

               in Sheffield to watch the semi-final match against my team, Liverpool,

              and Nottingham Forest.                 Originally I was going to the match with rny

              Dad as we both had t i c k e t                for the N,Stand,       which I had got from

              Anfield.        A couple of days before the match,                    my Dad found out that he

              w o u l d n ’t be able to make           it, so I swapped my two stand tickets with my

              sister's boyfriend,                who gave me a ticket for the Leppings Ln standing

              area.      This ticket was for £6.00.                   A friend of mine,

              already had a £6.00 ticket so we decided to go together.                                   We booked

two seats on a 52 — seater coach^>%h rough ’Sun S p ^ r T r a v e l ’ in B i rkenj^gad.

We set out from B i r kenhead y^X            about   1QQQ hry'and went straight t h r ou gh

to Sheffield.          We stoppsra at the motorway services for about /naif an

hour en route to the game,                 so that we could have a cup of tea and

stretch our legs.              We had no delays with traffic or anything because

the driver       came off the motorway early and went through the country

lanes,     so we missed all the tr af fic /j ams .

We got into Sheffield at about                 y<3Q pm ( 13J3Q hrs) and parked at the

main coach paK& by the Bass Brewery.                      got off the coach anjj^'walked

to the Grou/m together.              On the way/to the Ground,           I saw ^oitie fans
       C                                                           ,
drinking /ans of b e e r .          There we/e some sitting outsid/r the Ground

drinkit^jf, but I didn't see anybody who was drunk op/fighting.                        The

atmosphere was good;         everybody was lookijnjg^ forward to the match.
                                               , __      L_L _ .
We got to         the entrance of the Grouncl^at about 1.4Q pm    (134Q h r s ).

There were quite a             lot of peoplf^/outside the main entrance gates but

it wasn't         too bad.      We looked for our entry^fJoint ~ B           - and just

walked straight                the turnstiles and u e m t    in.     There were some

mountedi^ o i i         outside,    but I <*)a.sj/rY really taking too much notice.               I

got sear^Hed by a Po 1 i ceman & tT the 'turnst i 1 e before I went               into the

Ground,     and I handed my ticket             in at the turnstile.        I d i d n ’t see any

gates open other than the turnstiles and everybody was going in

through the turnstiles.

As I went through the turnstile,                 the first thing I saw was the tunnel

and I could see the pitch at the t f t h e r            side.      I d i d n ’t see any other

signs for the terraces so                       and I.headed for the tunnel.           We

walked t h r o u g h y C h e   tuKnel c(uite e^yfly as it was fairly empty,

ca n ’t remember seeing any Polype Officers or match stewards a round the

tunnel area controlling             it,,

As I walked towards the terraces,                 I didn't see any disorder at all,

and nobody was drinking             inside the Ground.

At the end of the tunnel,               fnd I went to the left of the dividing

fence and stood at the bac?K of Pen 4,            in area LI on the grid map.              We

stood talking to >a few/of    27             friends for a while.        This was about

1.45 pm ( 134-Jy/,hr s ) .   When we first went       into the terraces,      it was

fairly em^ty.       People were sitting on the steps and everybody had

plenty of room.        We decided to stay at the back where we were,                   because

we had a good position to see the match.

As we we re talking,         the terrace around us started to fill up.                 We were

getting pushed around a bit by the crowd and we were losing ouj

position.      We saw some spaces      in Pen 3, so            and I w e n V o a c k    into

the tunnel and around yrie dividing fence into Pen 3.

There was quite a c/*owd in Pen 3 and had to push our way through the

crowd a bit.       We stopped around area E3 on the grid map, where we had

plenty of room and where we were             in a good position to watch the

match.     The atmosphere was really good.            Everybody was singj/fg and

people were ^Knocking a beach ball around the area.                  Thif/was about

As tirare went on, more and more people started coming into the pen.

Sori)« of them were jumping down the terraces and knocking people out of

the w a y /   As more people came into the area,            it got fnore/Qiid more

.cru s   d , and the crowd started to sway.                 and I ij^re actually

pufChed over but some people managed to pull us back to our feet again

 ks the crowd swayed, we were being pushed forwards and sidewards.                          I

had no control over where          I went,    you went with the sway of the crowd

Most of the time we were able to push back against the crowd and get

back to roughly the same place.              It wasn't    comfortable in the pen but

I was still able to move my arms around.                 I wasn't frightened at

this time.                                        ^         rs

At about      1455 h r s , as the players w <re coming out onto the pitch,

there was a big surge from behijrfa.            I got pushed forward right down

towards the fronl/fence and I ended up in area G8 on the grid map.                        My

feet were on Vne floor as I was being moved forward but when the surge

stopped my arms were pinned in front of me and I was unable to move my

legs.    I was being squashed against the person in front.                   It was very

difficult to breathe because it was so hot, and we were really being

crusf/fed.   I was pushed against a girl who was irj/lurn being                pushed

against the front fence.           ^'^^^wa^ just to t j l e f t   of m e .

We were stuck at the       front   in the crush    f’Or about 20 - 25 minutes.

During this time the       pressure was increasing from       behind and everybody

was starting to panic.        The panic was made worse whejarpeople behind us

started climbing up and walking over our heads a j m shoulders to climb

out over the front fence.          Everybody was scr/aniing and shouti;

at anyone who was in front to get us out.             The St. Johns ^tfbbulance

people came over to the front fence and were trying to/calm everybody

down by telling them       to breathe easily.       I was in sjme pain because

p e op le ’s elbows were   being pushed in my      chest and back, and my hand

and arm was really hurting where          it was being crushed between two

people.As more fans were getting out onto the p i X c p f f they^were telling
               4---------------------------------------    'tJm i e n c e
the Police what was happening.     Initially the Splice seemed to think

it was a pitch invasion,       but when they final/ly realised that people

were in distress and injured inside the aens,            they started to climb

onto the fence and helped pull people p u t          of the pens.      At first we

were trying to pass the women and tlye kids out,            because they were

right at the front.        At one stage the Police and the fans tried to

pull the fence down but I w o u l d n ’t go.      This really made everybody

panic.With the pressure of people behind me,            I was being pushed down

towards the Ground.        I was finding it more and more difficult to

breathe.          ^as at the side of me and I saw him start to be sick.

He slumped forward onto the man in front of him and his head tilted to

one side. He had gone really white and I thought he had died.                     I kept

screaming at him and shouting his name and eventually he came round.

At this point I knew that I w a s n ’t going to be able to take much more

of the pressure and I knew we had to get out,           otherwise I think we

would have died.

The Police and the fans managed to pull the girl           in front of me,     up

and over the front fence.      The fella she was with was p u l l e d ^ u t

behind her and I found myself against the fejice.

I started to climb the fence and I was helped up onj/f the top.               I sat

on the top of the fence while I was getting my tfr/eath and I saw that

      was climbing up behind me.      We were helj^fd off the fence by a WPC

who led us pnto the pitch where we sat do^n for a while to get our

breath back.

All around us more and more people were gett i nq/tfut onto the pitch.

The fans started ripping down advertLa/emen'y^ioardings and Andy and I

went over to help them.      More p ojc’fce w er/ comi nijXout onto the pitch

but they went over onto the halfway line ary<Kmade a cordon.            Some

Notts. Forest fans had started to make gramments and tempers were

starting to fly with the Liverpool       fans.      The Police went across the

halfway line because it seemed th^^ they were expecting a pitch

invasion,   as the Forest fans wa^e chanting and some of the Li^frpoo 1

fans started to run across J m e    p it ch ,

Along with some other Lj^erpool      fans,      I headed back towards the ^

terraces with the hoardings that we ha^r taken down, and we put                  ured

people onto the hoardings and c a r r y ^d them to the far end o^/’the

piT^:h.   In all   I made about 6 jj/urneys with fans.       We we/e   leaving

twern at the far end of the pitch where they were being          looked after by

ambulance   crews and First Aiders.

It seemed that all around people were doing all they could to help.

Fans and Police Officers were giving First Aid to the injured and

dying people.      Some people who had been pulled out were lying on the

pitch and their faces had been covered up with jackets.

Eventually, after carrying a few people across the pitch, my arm and

chest    really started to hurt.           Some friends came across to             and me

and we decided that we had really had enough; we just wanted to get

out.

A Policeman told us the best way to go out was through the stand, and

the fans called us over to that direction arid helped/us into the

stand.     We went out of the Ground actually at thue^ Notts. F o r e s t end.

We walked along a road until we came to a car/dealers.                 We went over

to ask if we could          use the "phone, and he asked us all to        come in.         We

used her    'phone to       try and contact our home, arid this man made us all

coffee while we were           'phoning.    He theii/Qi rected us back to our coach.

Our ^oach actually          left at about 6 . 3 0   pm (1830 hrs), we were    late

leaving because one person           hadn'^'corne back to the coach.       I don't

know what happened to him.

The    coach stopped in Birkenhead just after 8 o'clock              (2000 h rs) and my

Mum met me at the coach station.              My arm and c h ^ t   were hurting




I think that the whole           incident was badly organised t^rthe club and
                        Pol.
the Police, >smd the Police seemed to be very sloj>r to react to what was

h a p p e n i n g around them.   For a long time the P^fli ce conti nued to treat

the incident as a pitch invasion even after              it was obvious that

something was badly wrong.            The match ste^Tj^ds were on the pitch and

they were more       interested in getting pejyple off the pitch than they

were    in the injured fans.

I feel that the F              has got to take some o>^lhe blame for the

incident over the organisation on the d ^ .              I also think that if all

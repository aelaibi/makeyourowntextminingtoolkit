Dear Stefan
Query from Mr David Conn
I enclose a copy of a letter received from David Conn of the Independent Newspaper which
is self-explanatory.
I have replied to Mr Conn that I will enquire whether you are prepared to do an interview
but that I very much doubted that would be the case.
As regards the query about Superintendent Beechey, I must confess that I have never
heard this gentleman’s name. I am not quite sure what I would “look up” to see what role
he had. It would be helpful if you could confirm whether or not he had a part in the inquest
preparation if you can do this from memory. Any pointers you could give me on this latter
issue would be gratefully received because I would not know where to start otherwise and I
do not particularly wish to appear unhelpful to the journalist.
I hope that you are keeping well. I was actually at Queens Medical Centre recently
meeting one of the pathology nurses. There are many many changes taking place in the
coroner’s work but I think you would have been quite comfortable with most of them.
Interestingly, I had reason to be going through the judicial review of the Stringer case
recently in preparation for the second edition of my textbook. I was reminded that judges
were extremely complimentary of your summing up and I have in fact quoted a few lines
from the Review about this. This is in the context of the increasing use of “narrative
verdicts” with inquests.
 I look forward to hearing from you in due course.
Kind regards,




 C P Dorries
 HM Coroner

              Dear Mr Dorries

              The Hillsborough Inquests

              I write a regular column in The Independent and am currently working on a book which
              will include an account of the Hillsborough Disaster in 1989. I am in the course of
              researching the tragedy and would be very grateful for a little help relating to the
              inquest, which was held in Sheffield, conducted by Dr Stefan Popper who I understand
              has now retired.

              Ideally, I would very much like to interview Dr Popper, to talk in general about the
              inquest and how he was affected by it. I would be grateful if you could pass on this
              request to him.

             I am also interested specifically in the role played in the inquest by one of the West
             Midlands Police officers who worked on the case, Superintendent Stanley Beechey. I
             know that Supt Beechey had a prominent role in the inquest preparation and the coroner
             thanked him during the proceedings for his role in preparing the summary evidence
             presented to the mini-inquests. I would like confirmation of what his official role was and
             what duties this entailed, whether, for example, it was evidence gathering, supervising
             the taking of statements, handling the evidence'to be presented at the inquest etc. Also,
             whether he had a rank within the inquest procedure, such as officer in charge of
             evidence, second in command, etc.

             I do understand that some time has gone by but as the inquest is a public forum I
             presume that this is publicly available information, even if, no doubt, it needs to be
             looked up! I did call your office and Linda Dale, who was very helpful, suggested that
             writing to you would be the best way to proceed.

              I would be very grateful if you could come back to be as soon as practically possible.

              Best wishes




             David Conn

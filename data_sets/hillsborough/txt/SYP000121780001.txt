 At    1311       I contacted          Ambulance          Control         via     the    direct      line      and    again

 spoke       to   Superintendent              Clark       and       explained       that       there     are    possibly

 hundreds         of     people    injured          and    that       we,    the    Police,        had     initiated

 Operation          Support       to    raise       further         manpower        to    the    ground.

 Supt.       Clark                     "We    are    responding."

 I then       went       into    the    Incident          Room      and     assisted       there       throughout          the

 The       speech       I have    referred          to    is    a    direct       quote    from      the    Ratal

 Tape       transcript          which    has    been       produced          by    Chief       Inspector        Edmundson.

               We      travelled           directly          to       the    ground,            arriving              near      the    ground    at    2.30

We    parked         the       car    on       a    hill       close       to    an    Esso       filling          station             and

walked       down         to    the       ground.              It    took       us    approximately                10 m i n u t e s          to       get

to    the    ground.

As    we    walked         along          I saw          numerous          fans       drinking          outside          pubs,          but

no-one       actually               drinking             from       cans    as       they    walked       along.

I    remember          seeing         Police             Officers          also       patrolling          the        area         in    groups

of    three.           Everyone            was          walking          along                           ly.

queued       and       I remember                  seeing       a    Policei                              outside             the

turnstile            to    one       side.              I had       no    difficulty             in    entering          the       ground             and

we    reached          our      seats          without          encountering                any       problems.              As    I    passed

through          the      t u rns t><fe            I handed          in m y      ticket.

I saw       Stewart^syin              yellow             jackets          directing          people       to       their          seats.

We    found       our      seats          from          the    signs       inside          the    ground.

Upon       taking         up    my    seat          I    looked          about       the    ground       and       looked          at    the

standing          area         at    the       Leppings             Lane    end       and    commented             to   my        friends

that       that      end       didn't          seem       too       full.        However,             after    a     few      minutes             I

realised          that         the    centre             pens       were    very       full       in    comparison                to    the

outer       surrounding               pens,             and    had       filled       up    considerably                in    the       space          of

that       few    minutes.                                                                                                         x

Shortly          the      game       started             and    my       attention          was       drawn     to      the       perin^g^er

fence       at    tjge L e p p i n g s             Lane       end,       where       I saw       people        climbing            over       the

fencfey, / l t h o u g h t ,              at       first,       that       it    w#s       trouble-makers                and       1 saw

.Police      go      to    them.           The          crowd       progressively                spilled        onto         the       pitch and

e v e n t u a l ly     I saw         a Pol i c e f L n / u n              onto       the    pitch       and     over         to    the

referee          a n d the          game       was       stopped.           The       Players          then    went          off       the    pitch »

Gradually,             more         and    more          people          came    onto       the       pitch     and      a    third          of       the

pitch       became         quite          congested.                  I then         saw    more       Police        a r r i v e at          that

end    and       saw      an    a m buj. agree           come       onto    the       pitch       and    end       up    behind          the

            goal      at    the       Leppings                Lane       end.           I still       had     no       idea       of    the       severity             ot

            the     incident              at    this          stage-           No       explanation           over       the       loud          speaker

            system         was       given          as    to    what       was          happening.

            It    was      when       I saw          a    young          boy    on       the    pitch        being       given          e :<t e r n a 1

            cardiac:        massage.                 I    realised             that       something           serious             was       happening.

            More      and       more       people             were       being          carried       onto        the    pi^fn          and       laid       out

            and     given        assistance.                    It       wa^when              I saw     f i r atm^/i c o m e           onto       the       pitch

            with      res cuc i t a t i o n              ^quip^Tnt             that       we    decided           to    go    and       help       on       the

            pitch.

            Myself,         Andy          and                            then       made       our    way     to       the    back          of    the       stand

            and     with        the       assistance                of    a Marshall                made     our       way    to       the       pitch       via       a

            canteen.                           ■emained             in    the       stand       as    he     is    a    dentist.                 The    rest       of

            us    are      doctors.                 It    w a s , 3 . 3 0 pm        by    this       time.

            Once      on    the       pitch          all       of    us    split          u p jjrfS w e n t        off       in    different

            directions               to    tend          to    the       injure^,

            I went         up    to       the       next       person          who       needed       assistance.                  He       was    already

            receiving            mouth          to       mouth       r e s u c i t a t ion        and      cardiac           massage.              So       I asked

            them      to    stop          what       they       were       doing          so    I    could        assess          his       condition             and

            he    actually            had       a    good       output,             good       pulse       and     a    good       colour.              His

            pupils         were       small          and       he    was       breathing.               So    we       moved^iim             onto       a

            Advertisement                  hoarding             and       I obtained                some     oxygen          from       a    fireman,             and

            a    po! i c e w o m a n ^ e s c o r t e d          him       off       to    an    amb\^lj^ce.              I would             describe             tfjis

            person         as    6ft       tall,          average          to       large       build,        dark       hair,          dark       e y e s,        j

            mid-twenties                  and       dressed          only       in       his    underpants.

            I then         moved          away       and       found       some          resucitation              equipment                from       an

            arnhu l a n c e      man.           I took          that       to       a    person       who     was       aged       late          3Q-40       y r s \ 1\»

            with      ginger          hair          and       ginger       beard.              H o w e v e r , he       was       already          dead.           He

            had     fixed        dilated             pupils          and       dark       navy       blue     in       colour.              He    had       no

    I       output.             He    had       been          unconcious                for    some     twenty          minutes             so    he    was

            taken       away         with       a    Policeman             escorting                him.

                  in m y         area         and          he           made        sure          that         a    Police          Officer              escorted          each

                  person          that           was          dead            or       injured             and          who    was       took          away.

                  I then          attended                    to         a    person              who      was          near       but       as    he     was       being       placed

                  onto       a    stretcher                         I    left         him.

                  I noticed                that            the           area          behind             the       goal       had       become           quite       full        of

                  Liverpool                supporters,                          and             I did      see          several          scuffles              break       out     amongst

                  them.           This           behaviour                      made            me    wary          of    going          away          from     rny a r e a .          I then

                  stood          up     on       the         small               concrete                 wall          infront          of       the     South       Stand        and    for

                  about          ten      minutes                       looked           about            for       Dr    Byrne          and       E?r                    and     also    to

                  becoming             more            volatile                    and          they       began          shouting                at     the    Notts       Forest

                  fans       in       the        South                  Stand.              However,                the       Police          were        at    hand       quickly.

                  At    about          4.00            pm           I decided                   to    make          my    way       back          to     the    South       S t a n d to

                  game       was       going              to        go        ahead.                  They         were        still          o b 1 i v i o ujsx^fs to            the

                  seriousness                    of       the            incident.

                  It w a s        whilst               I was                 seated             I h eard            the       l\ud s p e a k e r              announcements

                  asking          people               to       be           calm        and         remain          where          they          were        and    that       the     game

                  had     been         abandoned.                             We      waited              until          most       people             had     left       and     we    stil,

                  h a d n ’t      been          joined                   by     Andy            or                                 We    then          made     our       way     back    to

                  the     car.

                  As    we       walked             along                close           to j3 ennig^tprffe R o a d                      North/Herri^es^^ffbad                     s o u t h.

                  I saw          three          Liverpool                       fans            approach             a    small          group           of    Notts       Forest        fans

                  who    were          stood              with               their          backs          to       them,          consuming              soft       drinks.One           of

                  the    Liverpool                     fans              thumped                one       of       them       on    the       back        of    the       head.

                  The    Notts            forest                fan           dropped                to    the          ground          like       a     stone,       and       the

                  Liverpool               fans            ran            off.            A Policeman                     did       appear          and        seemed       to     restrain

                  the     Notts           Forest                while              the          Liverpool                fans       made          their        escape.

                                                                                                                                          S2607

                     grabbed          hold       of    me     and       pulled       me   away      from    the    incident,         and     we

             made    our       way    back       to    the        car.

             We    were     shortly         joined           by   Andy     and

             There       was    no    comrnuni c a t i o n          between          t hose     inauthority,            ie   the    Pg^f'ce,

             and    the     fans.          No-one        knew       what       was    happening          for     too    long.

             I also        feel      there       was     a    remarkable             lack     of    co-ordination            and

             communication              between          individual             Police\Op^fers.                   There      was    no

             clesion.

             There       was    a    d istinct         lack        of    announfojKfients           made,      such     as   to    ask     any

             d o c t ors    present         in    the        ground       to    make      their      way    to    the    pitch.

             With    regards          to    the       Police        O f f i c e r s , they         all   acted     well      individually,

             it    was     just      the   match         co-ordinatoi*s               who     had    more      information          and     who

             were    n ot      c o m m u n i c at i ng       it   to     those       on   the      pitch    that       I feel      could     have

             done    more       to    ease       the     problems.

                                                                                                                                     Is   I GNED

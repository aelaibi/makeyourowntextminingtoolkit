                     for about           15 minutes         to the       ground.       At this        time    I saw small       numbers

                     of     people       drinking         in the     street,        no more       than a normal         match.       I

1500       in total.            On the          latter          stage         of my a p p r o a c h to the ground                      I saw

only       two stio u n t e d p o 1 i c e o f f i c e r s an d no s t e w a r d s. The                               policemen

appeared             from his g e s tures                   to be telling                   people       to get        back,     but       it

was       getting          late,      I could hear                    the     crowd         inside and          people seemed

u n w i l li ng at this                late      stage          to go away from                    the outer           gates.     There

was       one    last appeal               and        the     crowd did edge                  back.      At this time              I was

at the far             right        outer        g a t e , a p o l i c e m a n inside                    opened the gate and

we all          moved       forward at a steady                          pace.         Once       through the gite               I made

my wa y to what                 I can now describe                          as    the middle m e t a l ' c / n c e r t i n a            type

see any          other        gates        being        opened.             I did not witness any u n a u t h o r i s e d

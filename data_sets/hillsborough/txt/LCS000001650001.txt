                                             As we heard the death toll climb to eight      Except he was in a hospital bed
                                             The football news no longer mattered           At last at seven ten that night
                                             Cause their whole world could soon be          We heard that my brother was alright
                                               shattered
FEAR IS...                                                                                  The death toll rose to 95
                                             We waited for the phone to ring                But at least all my family are still alive
At 3.06 we heard the news                    For the dreadful news the police might         My brother’s at home, well and safe
A pitch invasion was someone’s view            bring                                        But now in big crowds I have no faith
By half past three the facts were hazy       The deaths were up to 30 or more
TV pictures show people going crazy          But still no knock upon the door

By five to four we heard one dead            It was up to 40 by half past five
Suddenly my stomach filled with dread        But still no news, were they dead or alive
My brother was there, my uncle, his friend   At half past 6, from my uncles wife
Among the crowd at the Liverpool end         W e learned that he hadn’t lost his life

                                                     Take this special message up above

                                                     Bringing many a silent tear.                    Many people say, “Time heals everything.”

    POETRY                                           With goodbyes left unspoken.
                                                     You closed your eyes to sleep.
                                                     Gone from the world of suffering,
                                                                                                     But I have yet to see this statement in

    CORNER
                                                     To rest in perfect peace.
                                                                                                     Our family never was very close,
                                                     It was Hillsborough ’89 when I saw you,         And still this did not bring us any closer.
                                                     Then it was too late.
                                                     You were so young,                              Each day, each one goes out to work,
                                                     Too young to die: why you and not me?           Off to do their own individual thing.
                                                     Too young, too innocent to die.                 And I am left alone, nownere to go, no-one
                                                     In my room I sit,                                 to see.
                                                     With silent thoughts of you and tears           Subject to my own thoughts and memories,
                                                        unseen.                                      My mind leaves me and travels the world.
                                                     Wishing your a.bsence was only a dream.         To the world of thoughts and dreams,
                                                     Life to me is not the same.                     Thoughts of you float past my eyes.

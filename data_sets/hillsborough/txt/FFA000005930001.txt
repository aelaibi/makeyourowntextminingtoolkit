FA/HILLSBOROUGH

I spoke to 1     > , ■ re the letter from              - 'the
South Yorkshire coroner. I explained our involvement with
the coroner over the last few months and the way in which we
kept Herbert Smith - |             [Informed. We were playing
this very low key and I proposed to send a fax attaching
Popper's letter to »K6l*Jy of 22 October to explain to him
that fEdMy and Ki£tSSfl who had also got the letter would be
writing back to Popper to say that it would not be necessary
for him to issue subpoenas or summonses since they were
perfectly willing to attend.

I would then when, as was likely;     said that his clients
had no objection to this telephone^        secretary to let
her know that they coifld both respond along those lines.

       Ihoped that t Foppaf was not bringing two FA officials
there for publicity and to set them up as some sort of
target.    I said that I doubted whether that was the case.
The inquest would not be covering the same grounds that the
         report covered and would simply be dealing with
causes of death as I understood it.

 1                                               Monday,   6th October,    1997
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I have read your letter, Mr.
 3         Abrams,    I have read the material which has been submitted,
 4         much of which was before the Divisional Court, and there
 5         is the additional, which was put before the Attorney-
 6         General, and there is the additional material which has
 7         come to light since then.        I have also studied the body
 8         file, of which you have provided me with a copy.
 9              So I think really what I would want to know is what
10         more you want to say that you have not already said in
11         writing and to what extent you want to develop the
12         submissions that have already been made.
13   MR.   ABRAMS:    I am sure Ann will want to say more things,         sir,
14         and I would like to leave it her to say anything extra.
15         One query I have was the terms of reference of the Inquiry
16         and its powers and that might affect what it is you may
17         want to have to say.     I do not think I have ever had
18         anything in writing, apart from a letter of invitation.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am not sure that I have got them.
20         We can probably dig those out.
21   MR.   ABRAMS:    It might not be possible to deal with that today
22         but it if I could just say may be depending on the terms
23         there be an opportunity to submit further written
24         representations.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That is it.    (Document Handed)
26   MR.   ABRAMS:    Perhaps whilst I am looking at that if Ann
27         wants---
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes.
29   MRS. WILLIAMS:      I don't know what you're thinking of doing with
30         this case but I've thought for quite a long time I should
31         have a new inquest on Kevin because I believe Kevin didn't
32         die at 3.15 and also he didn't die from traumatic asphyxia
33         either.
34              I feel that there's three quarters of an hour of
35         Kevin's life been pushed away.       Also there's a death
36         certificate in Sheffield with the cause of death on it and


                                        2
 1          it's wrong.     I know I can't get that death certificate
 2          changed until a new inquest.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I know that there is some dispute
 4          about the evidence as to precisely when he was alive and
 5          when he was not.    As I see it there is Mr. B r uder 's
 6          evidence, which was to some extent altered, changed in the
 7          two or three days between when the first statement was
 8          dealt with and when he reconsidered it.         I am going to see
 9          Mr. Bruder about that and ask him about that.
10               There is also Deborah Martin's account.         I am hoping
11          to see her.    You appreciate, of course, that her account
12          is actually not consistent with Mr. Bruder's account
13          because he    says that Kevin was dead when---
14   MRS.   WILLIAMS:     He left him.     The reason he said that   was
15          because when he was giving Kevin heart massage and he'd
16          give him so much heart massage, give him so much
17          resuscitation, we've had a new fan come forward from the
18          Cook Report, John Prescott, which I think there's a
19          statement---
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I have seen that.
21   MRS.   WILLIAMS:     Where John Prescott told me that, and Bruder
22          said the same, that this lady came, he didn't know who           she
23          was, but all they knew is she had a uniform on and it was
24          her that told them, she took over from Bruder, and it was
25          her that told Bruder:        "He's gone.”   So Bruder was sick
26          and vomited himself and left the scene.        But Johnny stayed
27          and he said then Deborah Martin came along with a little
28          trolley and he helped put Kevin on the trolley she ran
29          with him them to the gymnasium.
30               So I've found that piece of jigsaw.         But the only
31          reason —     Johnny Prescott told me that this lady just
32          shone a torch in Kevin's eyes and said:         "He's gone" and
33          then Deborah Martin came along.       All Johnny can say to me
34          is that this lady had, he thought it was a green uniform,
35          some sort of a nurse.     He can't really remember.      Bruder
36          said the same, that this lady came across,        she pushed him


                                            3
 1        to one side and he said:    "It's hard work when you're
 2        giving somebody heart massage".      So she took over from him
 3        and do you remember him telling —      because Sheila came
 4        with me to my meeting with Mr. Bruder, but, as you know,
 5        Mr. Bruder wouldn't put in writing because he was a
 6        serving police officer with Liverpool Police.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I quite understand that you are
 8        anxious to know the details of the large half hour of his
 9        life, so to speak, or the last three quarters of an hour
10        of his life and I will try and discover that.       As I see it
11        there is the opinion of Dr. Slater that he died at an
12        earlier stage.     Opinion evidence, of course, may be right,
13        it may be wrong.
14             There is also I think the evidence of a police
15        officer on the body file which suggests that he gave
16        resuscitation at an earlier stage.
17   MS. COLEMAN:     Craighill.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Craighill, yes.
19   MRS. COLEMAN:     He lifted Kevin out.   Apparently P.C. Craighill
20        has made three statements because when we went for
21        judicial review, didn't he lend me them and we gave them
22        back, he wouldn't let me keep them.      But I see there's
23        only one statement been sent in the body file.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     The other ones may not been not
25        relevant to Kevin's case.
26   MRS. WILLIAMS:     They were relevant to Kevin's case.     He said
27        that he'd changed the statement again.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     What I would like to know, and it
29        may be that you would like your solicitor to deal with
30        this rather than you but that is up to you, there are two
31        points I think which I would like help on.      First of all,
32        we have now got the evidence of Mr. Edwards.        We have got
33        the evidence of Mr. Hart and Mr. O'Keefe and Mr. Prescott.
34        What I would like to know is how you say that that
35        evidence really carries the matter further?
36             I can see that it supports what Mr. Bruder says, it


                                       4
 1         confirms that Mr. Bruder was there, that he was giving
 2         mouth to mouth resuscitation and so on.        At the moment I
 3         am not quite clear of how that evidence takes the matter
 4         any further.     Do you understand?
 5   MRS. WILLIAMS:      Yes.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Would you like to deal with that,
 7         Mr. Abrams, or would you like to Mrs. Williams to deal
 8         with it?
 9   MR.   ABRAMS:     Perhaps we should both deal with it.      If we start
10         from the premise that the inquiry is to look for new
11         evidence what I would say is that, first of all, the
12         evidence to which you have referred gives credibility to
13         the evidence of Bruder and perhaps to Deborah Martin as
14         well, the credibility which was lacking at the stage of
15         the Coroner's inquiry.      On the basis of the lack of
16         credibility the Coroner reached certain conclusions which
17         we would submit were incorrect.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What conclusions?
19   MR.   ABRAMS:     That he would ignore the evidence of P.C. Bruder
20         and Deborah Martin or rather rely on their second version.
21         I think---
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Supposing that is wrong,    supposing
23         he was wrong about that.
24   MR.   ABRAMS:        About relying on the version----
25   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH:   Supposing P.C. Bruder was right.
26   MR.   ABRAMS:     In his first statement?
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Yes.
28   MR.   ABRAMS:     Then that means that Kevin continued to live
29         after what has been called the cut-off point of 3.15.           It
30         also might call into the question the credibility of the
31         evidence of Dr. Slater and might reinforce the evidence of
32         Dr. West.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I think there has been some
34         misunderstanding about this cut-off point.        The Coroner
35         did not    decide to adopt the cut-off point on the basis
36         that everybody was dead by then but on the basis that they


                                         5
 1         had received their injuries by then.         I take it that you
 2         would not suggest that he received any injuries after
 3         3.15?
 4   MR.   ABRAMS:    No.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I might very well conclude after
 6         having seen Mr. Bruder that his original account was
 7         correct and that may be some consolation to Mrs. Williams
 8         if I were to say that.        Obviously there is Dr. Slater's
 9         opinion to the contrary but, as I say, opinion evidence
10         can be mistaken.        I think   the next question is assuming
11         that that is so,that one          can say that Bruder is correct
12         or may well have- been correct, how does that affect the
13         verdict of the inquest?
14   MR.   ABRAMS:     It goes    to the route of the integrity of the
15         investigation prepared by the West Midlands Police because
16         if you accept that his first statement was correct,         if you
17         then accept that pressure was put on him by the officer of
18         the West Midlands Police to cause him to change that
19         statement that is one attack on the integrity of the
20         investigation.        There are obviously other attempts, which
21         we mentioned, namely, the pressure put on Deborah Martin,
22         the suppression of the existence of the second ambulance.
23         The existence of Tony Edwards and the statement which Tony
24         Edwards said that he gave to West Midlands Police, which
25         he says was never used and led to his being called to give
26         evidence to the inquiry.
27                 These are the points of which we are aware.       If those
28         point are accepted it may well be that there are a number
29         of other points where evidence has been suppressed.
30         Without access to the paperwork of West Midlands Police we
31         cannot begin to expand on that argument and to some extent
32         this comes back to the question of whether any other
33         evidence exists.        I would suggest that it may well do but
34         it can only be found by looking at the West Midlands
35         paperwork.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         You say it attacks the integrity of


                                             6
 1         the West Midlands Police, obviously if improper pressure
 2         is brought to bear on a particular witness to change his
 3         statement that is improper conduct by the officer
 4         concerned.     But suppose that I conclude that that has
 5         happened then are you suggesting that there should be a
 6         completely knew inquest and if so on what basis?
 7   MR.   ABRAMS:     I would suggest that a preliminary step would be
 8         to examine the conduct of the investigation by West
 9         Midlands Police and to examine he integrity, and I do not
10         just mean in a moralistic sense I mean in a forensic sense
11         as well, the forensic integrity of that investigation.           If
12         an examination showed that there was sufficient
13         suppression and mislaying or whatever of evidence such
14         that it affected the integrity of the Coroner's inquiry
15         itself, and that is something you really cannot comment on
16         at this stage, but if that were to emerge then, yes,         I
17         would be arguing for a fuller inquiry.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It would have to be a deliberate
19         suppression of evidence which would otherwise be relevant?
20
21   MR.   ABRAMS:     I would not argue that it would have to be
22         deliberate because what is in issue is whether the inquiry
23         reached its conclusions on the basis of proper evidence.
24         I say proper evidence in the sense again forensically
25         speaking.     If the police, for instance,    lost a whole
26         clutch of relevant evidence it would not matter whether
27         that loss was deliberate of accidental,       it would still
28         affect the integrity of the Coroner's inquiry.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I follow that.     But it is going to
30         be an almost impossible task, is it not, to re-examine the
31         whole of the inquiry?
32   MR.   ABRAMS:     It is certainly done in other cases, in cases of
33         miscarriages of justice, which I agree are probably on a
34         much smaller scale, but it is certainly done.        It might be
35         simple for me to suggest to you how that might be properly
36         conducted but it might be, for instance, assuming the


                                        7
 1         paperwork is still there, that if Ann Williams were to be
 2         allowed access to the parts of the documentation relating
 3         to Kevin we could comment on those p a r t s .   I would not be
 4         expecting to see the whole--
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        So far as I know the only material
 6         is that which is in the body file.
 7   MR.   ABRAMS:     Are you saying,   sir, that the original notes of
 8         interview, officer's pocket books, desk diaries, C.I.D.
 9         desk diaries are all missing or have never been looked
10         for?
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What happened so far as the
12         Yorkshire Police were concerned was that every officer who
13         was involved that day went away and wrote out in his own
14         handwriting or typed his recollection or account of the
15         day.    They were at some stage submitted to other officers
16         in the South Yorkshire Police and they were put into
17         witness statement form.       There are some differences
18         between those two documents.       I have looked and I will
19         look in greater detail at those things, whether there have
20         been changes.      In some of them the changes are quite
21         trivial and they are almost spelling mistakes or whatever.
22         Other ones they are more significant, but certainly the
23         ones I have looked at so far what has been cut out is
24         comment, opinion and so on, which I would regard as being
25         properly cut out.
26                What you have got in the body files are the final
27         statements which went before Lord Taylor and went before
28         the Coroner in their final form, at least that is what you
29         should have and, as I understand it, that is what you have
30         got.      I obviously   can check to see if there is anything
31         else but I do      not think I am going to be able to put my
32         hands on any other statement that relates to Kevin from
33         some other witness who made a statement at the time.          I
34         just do not think that is possible.
35   MR.   ABRAMS:     That   was why I was asking about the powers of the
36         inquiry which      are not mentioned in the terms of reference


                                          8
 1         and that brings us back to Tony Edwards who says he made a
 2         statement to West Midlands police, which they---
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I can look at that and see whether
 4         there is a statement.    But I think what you do have to
 5         appreciate when you talk about suppression of evidence is
 6         that there are a vast number of statements given by a vast
 7         number of people, the police alone took over 3,500
 8         statements and quite obviously nobody would have expected
 9         all those witnesses to give evidence.     So the Coroner had
10         to select which witnesses he would call, which witnesses
11         would be summarized or what have you.     So the mere fact
12         that a witness comes to light now whose evidence was not
13         called or was not summarized does not seem to me to
14         necessarily give rise to the inference that it was
15         improperly suppressed.
16               Obviously if it is cogent and important evidence
17         which was overlooked for one reason or another and which
18         will affect the verdict then that is what I am interested
19         in.   That is why I am anxious to know how you say this
20         further evidence, particularly the witnesses Edwards,
21         Hart, O'Keefe and Prescott, apart from corroborating Mr.
22         Bruder, which I understand, how they affect the verdict.
23   MR.   ABRAMS:   I will leave to it Ann to answer that but I would
24         like to repeat my point that it is not necessarily enough
25         merely to look at the evidence which is presented to you
26         and ask whether or not that affects the verdict.
27               It seems to me that there is an argument at least
28         that one should go beyond that and follow, if you like,
29         the paper trail.   For instance, is it significant if the
30         list, I assume there is a list of statements that were
31         taken by the investigating police,   is it significant if
32         that list omits the statement of Tony Edwards?     Is it
33         significant if the pocket book of the officers who
34         interviewed him make reference to that statement but it is
35         not followed through to the next stage?
36               This is how one routinely investigates miscarriage


                                       9
 1        cases, whether or not you choose to adopt that procedure
 2        in this case obviously is a matter for you, sir, but I
 3        would say it is in a way unjust to the families to merely
 4        say,   "I'm only going to look at what you managed to
 5        unearth and give me.     I'm not going to look beyond because
 6        the facilities of the family are obviously very limited."
 7
 8               If, based on those facilities, they can at least
 9        raise a question mark about the integrity of the inquiry,
10        again I use the word integrity in a morally neutral sense,
11        if they can raise that question mark it warrants further
12        investigation, an investigation which is wholly beyond the
13        powers of the families.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I suspect it may be beyond my
15        powers too because I can only look at what is said to be
16        fresh evidence.     I cannot,    I think, trawl through all the
17        statements, and so on, which were given to see whether
18        there is anything else.     I have your point on that.
19               What I would like to know is how you say the evidence
20        of particularly Mr. Edwards carries the matter further
21        other than to corroborate what Mr. Bruder says?
22   MRS. WILLIAMS:    When Mr. Edwards came on the ground he had
23        instructions not to stop for anybody and Mr. Bruder tried
24        to stop the ambulance for Kevin, or a St. John's Ambulance
25        man did, and I believe Kevin died through lack of care, he
26        could have been saved.     He didn't even have a chest
27        injury, he could not have died from trauma.        He died
28        because he needed a tracheotomy below the —        he had
29        fractures in his neck which swelled.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     The way Professor West puts it is
31        that if a tracheotomy had been performed it was possible
32        that it would have saved his life.
33   MRS. WILLIAMS:    Yes.   Could I also say that I've had quite a
34        lot of certificates, the Coroner's certificate when he did
35        the inquest on Kevin at the bottom,       it's the form 99, they
36        have filled in the parts of the body injured and they have


                                          10
 1         put in chest.        So we got in touch with the Coroner and we
 2         said he didn't have a chest injury, he had a neck.          So he
 3         wrote to Dr. Slater and Dr. Slater agreed to have the
 4         amended form.
 5              I wrote to Dr. Slater as well and what Dr. Slater was
 6         saying was it won't change his -- I'm talking about new
 7         evidence,    it won't change his opinion of how Kevin died or
 8         what Kevin died from but what he is saying now is he
 9         couldn't tell me what time Kevin died but he said in the
10         inquest he had no doubt in his mind that Kevin would have
11         been dead or brain dead before he was even lifted out of
12         the enclosure.       So, again, he contradicted himself.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Have you got that letter from Dr.
14         Slater?
15   MRS. WILLIAMS:      Yes.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Perhaps we can take a copy of this
17         if we have not got it already.       Have we got it already?
18   MRS. WILLIAMS:     No.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You say that suppression or
20         non-production of this evidence from Mr. Edwards and
21         others calls in question the whole investigation.          I mean,
22         have you any other ideas or hints or suggestions which I
23         can pursue which support that?        I understand what is said
24         about the videos, that is an entirely different aspect of
25         the matter and it is obviously a very important matter.
26              Is there any other aspect of the case which I can
27         investigate and which supports the conclusion that there
28         has been a suppression of evidence other than simply the
29         process of selection which has to go on in an inquiry of
30         this sort whereby not all the evidence will come out
31         necessarily at the time?
32   MR.   ABRAMS:     I think our argument on that is limited to four
33         points.     Mr. Bruder, Martin, Tony Edwards and the footage,
34         I am not sure if this is the video which you are referring
35         to, sir, but the footage showing the existence of a second
36         ambulance, which again we refer to here.        That is not the


                                          11
 1          missing video.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       There were three ambulances
 3          altogether, there was the St. John's one which came on
 4          first of all, then there was the South       Yorkshire one and
 5          then there was the one that Mr. Edwards was driving.             As I
 6          understand it at the inquest, whether they were mistaken
 7          about it or what, the police were saying there were only
 8          two ambulances on the pitch.
 9   MRS. WILLIAMS:      The Coroner dismissed Mr. B r u d e r 's evidence
10          because he says that he was wrong about the ambulance.
11   LORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I follow that.
12   MRS.   WILLIAMS:    They said the ambulance was     suppressed at the
13          inquest evidence again and Lord Justice Taylor d i d n 't know
14          about the third ambulance.        It was only from Bruder that
15          we started looking at it.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       The position about Mr. Edwards'
17          ambulance, as I understand it, is that he came on, he was
18          told first of all to go down the other end, he was then
19          told by the police that he should not do that, he then got
20          in touch with his own Superintendent,       I think it was a man
21          called Hopkins, who said,     "Go down the other end, don't
22          stop, don't pay any attention to anybody who tries to
23          interrupt you."    That is what he eventually did, went down
24          the other end of the pitch.       He also says that he did not
25          have any difficulty in driving onto the pitch whereas the
26          other two ambulance did.      I do not know how significant
27          that i s .
28                The plan was that the ambulances would go to the
29          first aid place and that is what they were doing, they
30          were coming in, backing in, picking up people and taking
31          them to the hospital and only these three ambulances went
32          onto the pitch.
33   MRS. WILLIAMS:      In the Taylor report the families asked why was
34          there only two ambulances on the ground and Lord Justice
35          Taylor said they had difficulty with ramps.        Mr. Edwards
36          said he had no difficulty getting on the ground, the only


                                         12
 1          trouble he had was the police cordon, which he tried to go
 2          through, they stopped him getting onto the ground.             They
 3          still said they were fighting out there.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Fortunately Mr. Hopkins overcame
 5          that and he went down to the other end of the ground.
 6   MR.    ABRAMS:      I think one of the questions which is raised by
 7          Mr. Edwards'     statement is, as you say, because he was told
 8          by a police officer not to go on the pitch.          Was that a
 9          police officer making a mistake?       Or was that a police
10          officer passing on directions which he had received from
11          higher up based on an assumption that someone had made
12          that there was fighting going on on the pitch?             If that
13          was a directive from higher up was that based on correct
14          information or not?      I think we would argue not.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I think it is absolutely plain from
16          reading the evidence of the Taylor Inquiry that a lot of
17          people did not know what was going on and police officers
18          were giving wrong information because they did not
19          understand what was going on.       That was a matter which was
20          criticised by Lord Taylor and there it is.          That
21          criticism, as far as I am concerned,      stands.     There is no
22          reason to doubt it.
23   MR.    ABRAMS:     One possible point is had that criticism been
24          available,     in as trenchant a form as perhaps it now is,
25          before the jury at the inquest whether they might have
26          been invited to reach a different verdict.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        What other verdict could they have
28          reached on this point?
29   MRS.    WILLIAMS:     I am straying outside my area of expertise but
30          it may be     aggravation by lack of care.
31   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is a question of law.I will
32          obviously     look at this again but I have looked at it,
33          there is a case called Jameson which supports the view of
34          the Divisional Court in this case that that verdict was
35          simply not open to them.
36   MR.    ABRAMS:     On any evidence?


                                           13
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      On any evidence.    Obviously I will
 2         look at that again but that, I think, is the position.            As
 3         I think I said this morning, there were only 2 realistic
 4         verdicts, one of accidental death and the other of
 5         unlawful killing.     That is my present view.
 6                 If you want to research and make some submissions
 7         about it by all means do.       One of the difficulties is that
 8         that is what the Divisional Court held in this case and,
 9         as I have already said, I cannot go behind what the
10         Divisional Court said.     How are we doing for time?
11   MR.   BONE:     It is just on 3 o'clock now, Sir Murray.     We have
12         Mr. Bruder coming to see us at quarter past three.          We
13         want to reflect on what you have said before we see him.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Is there anything else particularly
15         that you want to say?     Do bear in mind I have read a lot
16         of material this in case.
17   MRS. WILLIAMS:     I would like to   say before inviting Jack Straw
18         to review the position, Mr. Stuart-Smith, to do this
19         Scrutiny I was going to prepare another memorial, we were
20         going to send another memorial back to the Attorney-
21         General with medical evidence to say that an inquest
22         should determine who that person was, where he died, what
23         he died from and how he died.       I have not had how Kevin
24         died and what Kevin died from.
25                 Sheila Coleman came with me and we went to see Dr.
26         Ian West in November,    just before Christmas last year.         He
27         spent about five hours with us and these are the points of
28         the meeting and what and what we did find out that there
29         was quite a lot of points that Dr. Slater had made.
30         Things Dr. Slater has said about Kevin's injuries do not
31         match the autopsy report.       There are quite number of
32         points on the autopsy report that prove that Kevin could
33         not have died from traumatic asphyxia.
34                 All Dr. West was saying to me what he was saying --
35         he said some things, that      if Kevin hadn't got a   head he
36         still would have twitched and things like that.         It just


                                          14
 1        doesn't match the injuries at all.        For instance, Dr.
 2        David Slater said that Kevin was blue, bloated and had
 3        petechial haemorrhages.     I said goodbye to my son and
 4        there wasn't a mark on him.       Kevin looked asleep.      I
 5        questioned this.    Dr. Ian West sent the autopsy
 6        photographs.    Kevin has not got the outward signs of
 7        traumatic asphyxia, he wasn't blue or bloated.        I think
 8        you have got a picture of him in the body file, he does
 9        look haunted.   But they also told us that if Kevin had
10        been the way Dr. Slater had said in the inquest          I would
11        not have been able to recognise my son.
12             It is quite -- you know, Kevin had central pallor
13        around his mouth, which is not a sign of traumatic
14        asphyxia.    In Dr. Ian West's view the change of the face
15        was due to the neck injury.       Kevin's chest was okay.       In
16        Dr. West's view Dr. Slater should not have give traumatic
17        asphyxia as the death.    Kevin had a lethal combination of
18        injuries to the front of his neck but he was treatable
19        with a tracheostomy.     He could have survived up to an hour
20        after the event.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I have read Dr. West's original
22        report and his report specific to Kevin.        If there is any
23        further report from Dr. West that you want to put before
24        me then I must have it from him I think.
25             I do not know to what extent this will help you, it
26        may well be that at the end of the day I am not able to
27        recommend there should be a fresh inquest or there should
28        be a further judicial inquiry.       On the other hand I may be
29        able to establish possibly with greater clarity than was
30        done at the inquest what happened to Kevin in those last
31        three quarters of an hour.        If I can do that and I were
32        report on that would that satisfy you?
33   MRS. WILLIAMS:   I know what happened to Kevin now.       I've
34        tracked everybody down,    I've spoke to all these people.
35        I've spent hours with forensic pathologists.        I know why
36        he died.    I feel that Dr. Slater was mistaken about


                                       15
 1        Kevin's injuries in the inquest court.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That may be so.
 3   MRS. WILLIAMS:     Kevin had two mini-inquests on him and when —
 4        at the end of the day when we came —           on 3rd May 1990 the
 5        Coroner was actually pulled to one side, he said on the
 6        second mini-inquest —        because they'd left it where they'd
 7        said that when Mr. Bruder came across Kevin he was
 8        convulsing but they had to get that all sorted out.           So
 9        they sent the West Midlands Police round to see Mr. Bruder
10        because he came to me after.
11               Also Dr. David Slater rang Mr. Bruder up why West
12        Midlands Police were interviewing him, Mr. Bruder told me
13        this himself, to talk bout Kevin's injuries.          Dr. Ian West
14        said: pathologists don't do that.        He wouldn't dream of
15        doing it.     If you want to ask anyone about a person's
16        injuries you do      it in the inquest court.     I think that   was
17        out of order as      well.
18               Then they go back the next day and they change the
19        convulsion to a twitch.        It is quite confusing, but I feel
20        that the West Midlands Police knew Kevin was alive,
21        everybody knew he was alive.        There was so much evidence
22        pointing to him      being    alive.    Bruder was right         about the
23        ambulance.     But   he didn't fit in with the 3.15 cut-off
24        point and I just feel —       so statements had to be changed.
25        They were making injuries worse than what they were
26       because they did say some terrible things about him in the
27        inquest and I believe now the injuries weren't half as
28        bad.     He never had anything wrong with his chest.        He has
29        fallen and somebody has trodden on his neck.
30               I feel because he was alive, he didn't fit in so he's
31        got to be dead by 3.15.       So they changed statement, hid
32        ambulances and lied about his injuries and I believe that
33        to this day.     I just feel that they haven't got a right to
34        do it.     I mean it won't bring Kevin back but I just cannot
35        live with it.        They have pressurised Bruder, they've
36       pressurised that poor policewoman.         She's left the force


                                         16
 1         through —       her own words were:     "My own turned on me and
 2         all I was doing was helping a little boy" and because she
 3         was telling the truth about what happened to Kevin —            I
 4         mean she didn't write it all out in her statement but even
 5         Dr. West said he actually moved his mouth and he went
 6          "Mum".     It wasn't a death rattle.      She saw it and then he
 7         slumped back and then he went blue, he went grey and then
 8         he went blue.       That's how she explained to me.     Dr. Ian
 9         West said what she's explaining is somebody just dying in
10         her ar m s .
11                 She was a dental nurse and she said that she'd had
12         quite a lot of medical experience and she'd actually
13         resuscitated people at treated people who had heart
14         attacks      in the dental chair.      She said she'd probably had
15         more medical experience than most of the P.C.s on the
16         ground on that day.          She knew what she was doing with
17         Kevin.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          We have not actually arranged to
19         meet her yet but she will be somebody we shall see.
20   MR.   BONE:      I think Ms. Coleman wanted to say something before
21         we finish.
22   MS.   COLEMAN:       I am sorry.    Just a very brief comment in
23         support of what Ann is saying and it with regard to the
24         point you made around both the inquests and the Divisional
25         Court only having two possible verdicts, that is
26         Divisional Court agreeing with Coroner's Court in
27         Sheffield, that is accidental death or unlawful killing.
28         I think a significant point, with respect,         is that Tony
29         Edwards' statement were put before either of those courts
30         and had they been put before them then it might have been
31         the decision of the Coroner in Sheffield and the
32         Divisional Court to actually consider that there was
33         another verdict open, namely, accidental death aggravated
34         by lack of care.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Is there anything else that anybody
36         wants to say?       If you want to make any further written


                                            17
submissions, Mr. Abrams, feel free to do so.     I do not
want to encourage you to do so because I think,    if I may
say so, I have got very full submissions already from your
team, so to speak.   But if there is anything else that
occurs in the light of our discussions that you want to
put forward then do not hesitate to do so.     Thank you.

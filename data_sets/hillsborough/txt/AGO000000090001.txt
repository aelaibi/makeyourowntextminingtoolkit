                             Hillsborough, 15th April 1989
                                       Dr John Ashton



I    am   a   medical     practitioner      and    senior    lecturer    in     Community     (Public)
Health at the University of Liverpool.                      On Saturday 15th April           I went to
the FA Cup semi-final match              at Sheffield with other members of             my family.
This year we travelled by way of the M62 and Ml because for the same event
last year we had travelled on the direct route through the peak district
and there had been very bad build-ups of traffic on the way home.                              We left
Liverpool at about 10.15 am and arrived in Sheffield at about 12.15 - 12.30
pm.       We had a meal at a pub some distance from the ground and afterwards
walked perhaps 2 miles to the match.                 While we were at the pub a coach-load
of Liverpool supporters came in.                  They were boisterous but well behaved and
there was good humour between them and the local people who were eating in
the dining area.


We arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at around 2.30 - 2.35 pm
(myself,       sons Matthew,     16 and Nicholas,           14 and nephew Carl Nichols,              24}~.
It was        immediately apparent that it was going to be difficult                        to get    in.
We    had     four    tickets   together     for     row 2    of   the   West    Stand,above          the
Leppings Lane terrace.             I had been particularly relieved to obtain seats
this year because            at last year's        game   in the    semi-final we were          in the
terrace itself (in the right hand corner behind the goal) and it had been
terribly crowded and unpleasant.


On Saturday we found that outside the ground there were a large number of
supporters trying to get in to a small number of turnstiles and that there
was very: little police presence.                   I saw no stewards outside the ground.
There appeared to have been no attempt to marshal the supporters into lines

in advance of our approaching the turnstile areas.


We    managed        to   get nearer   to   the     turnstiles     but   the    crush was     becoming
unpleasant.           I heard a police officer telling the supporters that it was
their own fault for coming late.
I decided^ that I did not want to go on because it was so unpleasant.                                Carl
said     it      would only       get   worse        and that   he   was   going    in.   Matthew    and
Nicholas insisted on going in with                    Carl and theystayed where           they were as
I withdrew to the wrought-iron fence.


After a few minutes I thought I would try again.                           I could not see ray family
and assumed that they had managed to get through the turnstiles.                                When I
approached again it was now much worse and again I withdrew.                               I was aware
of an officer trying to close one of the wrought iron gates, but he had no
chance on his own.            I noticed that there was now a police landrover in the
lane just outside the gates and my instincts and experience of 30 years as
a Liverpool supporter told me that things were going badly wrong.                               I went
to the police landrover and obtained the attention of one of the officers.
I said to him,          "you’ve got to get a grip of this situation,                      it is out of
control,          there is    going        to   be    a    tragedy."       He    seemed   bemused    and
unresponsive.         People were closing in around the landrover and I withdrew
to the other side of the road to see if it would ease off and I could try
again.        The time now must have been 2 . 4 5 - 2 . 5 0 .


After a few minutes I suddenly realised that everybody had gone in and I
was able to walk up to the turnstiles and gain admission without difficulty
after tendering my ticket.


Once inside the turnstile it was at first unclear where I should go.                                There
were   no      stewards      in    sight    and      the   section     labelling    was   confusing.    I
realised where the entrance was to the West Stand and went to get in after
buying a programme.               At this stage I had no idea that things had actually
now deteriorated to the extent that they had done.                              It must have been just
after 3.00 pm.



When I went to the gate into the West Stand there were a few other people
in the process of getting in and two policemen were checking their tickets.
I then became aware of a man crying and beseeching the police.                              "There are
kids dying in there," he said,                  "you've got to do something."             He seemed to
have come out of the terraced area.                        The police were unresponsive to him..
They checked my ticket and let me in.
Once   inside the stand area I turned up the stairs, now worried to check
that Matthew,       Nicholas and       Carl were alright.         As I got to the top of the
stairs it wasdifficult to              make progress because there were so many people
in the aisle.        At the top        of the stairs I could begin to see why.                  Many
people were being pulled up out of the terrace and into the front of the
s tand.


I could neither      attempt to get down             to row 2 nor see the boys. I decided
to make ray way      along the adjacent row.               Everybody was helpful and        I was
able to do this      without difficulty.            It must have been about row 20.             When
I got some way       along    it I looked       down to see          if I could see the     boys.
First I saw Carl,      then Matthew,         then       Nick.     I wasable    to make ray way down
to them over the seats.


When I reached them I could see              that       there were alarge number of people on
the pitch,    people      trying    to get out of the terrace on to the pitch and
people were continuing to come up in to the stand.                      There seemed to be few
St. Johns Ambulance people attending the people who were lying around the
pitch and I could see people lying on the pitch unattended.                         There was a
large line of police officers across the pitch at the centre circle.                             The
tannoy told the supporters who were on the pitch to get off it.


The pressure was bad where we were so I made my way back some rows with
Matt and Nick.       Carl stayed where he was to help pull people up from the
terrace.     When    we    got     further   back     we   had   a   clear   view   of   what    was
happening    on   the pitch;       it seemed    incredible.          The   time must have been
about 3.15 pm.


The overwhelming impression was of a large and growing number of casualties
and not much response.           The supporters were now impatient and angry at the
slowness of the response to the emergencies.                    There appeared to be only one
or two stretchers on the pitch and one ambulance was making its way around
from the far corner.             The   supporters were chanting for assistance to be
brought to the injured who were              lying on the pitch.             The next thing was
that many of the supporters who were on the pitch began to tear down the
advertising boards         and organise    themselves   into stretcher parties.         This
all happened very quickly.


I heard     the   tannoy    appeal   for   doctors   to help.    I could   see   that    the
situation was really bad and could count six people who appeared to be dead
near the goal mouth.         I made sure that Matthew and Nicholas were safe with
Carl and that I knew where they were and made my way out down the back of
the Leppings Lane Stand.


On    the   stairs   a policeman was       attending somebody who was      injured.      The
injuries     did not appear to be critical so I asked the policeman where I
should report to help.          He did not know.        I went back into the stand and
brought the boys out and down the stairs to place them somewhere safe and
in sight.      I then tried to find somebody in charge to tell me who to report
to.     I asked several officers, but none of them knew.             There were people
lying everywhere in the yard area between the Stand and the turnstiles.                    I
asked the officer who was in charge and he indicated a senior officer.                     I
approached this officer and told him that I was a doctor and asked him who
was in charge of emergencies and where I should report.              He said he did not
know and that he had just arrived.            By this stage I realised that there was
no organised response and I was angry.               I asked the officer for his number
but he did not appear to have one.             I asked for his name.       He said he was
Inspector Grace.        I left him and went to see what I could do.


All around were people either dead or unconscious, or seriously hurt.                    The
supporters were fantastic.           They were all helping each other and trying to
resuscitate people.          Individual police officers were also doing what they'
could.      At no time did I see anybody attack a police officer, nor did I see
anybody who was drunk.


I came to the conclusion that somebody needed to take an overview of the
situation and began to go round all the casualties to appraise them.                    There
did not seem to be any St. Johns Ambulance workers around at all.                 I became
aware that some casualties were being taken out into Leppings Lane itself
 and I went out there.          There was one ambulance.        The time must have been
 about 3.30 - 3.35 pm.
The policy were beginning to put people into the ambulance and I realised
that a system of prioritising by triage was needed.                             So I did this.            I went
around       and    either        checked    people     myself     or    asked     the    person       who    was
attending them.              There were two or three other health workers in evidence
who    were        assessing,          resuscitating     and    doing    what      they    could.            There
appeared to be no medical or emergency equipment.


The dead were             taken to one side and I allocated the other casualties                                to
category one or category two.                    I told the police who should be despatched
by ambulance next and who could wait.                       The officers were mostly very good.
They     took my          instructions      and acted on them immediately.                      By    this    time
there was a steady flow of ambulances.                         It must have been 3.45 or 3.50.                   I
became aware of a local general practitioner who had arrived at the scene.
Over     the    next       half    an hour     we     worked    together      as   a    team,    sorting       the
casualties and despatching them in the ambulances.                             An anaesthetist arrived
from somewhere and fire-engines came with resuscitation equipment, but all
of this was              really    too late.        By 4.25 pm it was all over.                  The serious
casualties had gone to hospital and what remained were people with minor
injuries,          shock and distress and a line of dead people.                            I went to check
that my family was alright and when I came back                               a police officer asked me
 to certify the deaths.                  A general practitioner had already started this at
 one end of the row of bodies.                      I started at the other.               I think the time
was 4.27 or 4.29 and I think                        I certified five or six dead.                Only one        of
whom could be identified from                    documents on his body.


 During this whole period the                       public were fantastic,             although shocked and
 angry.        On one       occasion        atthe end a group of young men came past                            the
 dead,    and       one     of    them    expressed his        anger    at    police      who were standing
 there.        I told him to "cool it", that it was not                       helpful andhe stopped.                 I
 saw    no     other       episodes       like this    at   all,       although    there was          a   general
 atmosphere of             anger at what had been happening.                   I remember thinking how

 restrained everybody was.


 It must have been about 4.30                    - 4.35.        There did not seem to be anything
 else     for       me     to     do   behind Leppings Lane.             I checked        that Matthew          and
 Nicholas          were alright           with Carl    and then        made   my way      to    the    gymnasium




                                           £5) ‘
around tt\g side of the ground to see if I could be of any help there.                                            I
had become aware that other casualties had been taken to the gymnasium.


At first I had difficulty finding it as nobody could give me directions.
When I arrived there I went in and found that it was all over.                                        At one end
there were tables (I think three) which must have been used for processing
details of the injured.                There were now no casualties in this area.                           At the
near end of the gym were rows of bodies.                        On my way past I noticed a large
display      of    photographs         and   information        on   the        wall    of    the   gym    showing
Liverpool supporters who were thought to be pickpockets, etc.


I left       the gym and returned round to the Leppings Lane end to check my
family again.             They were alright.          I thought that I should go back to the
gym     to   see    if     there   would     be   a   debriefing           of    people       involved      in   the
emergency         response,       so   all   four     of   us   went       round.            This   time    it was
difficult to get near the gym because there was a large cordon of police
around it.          I spoke to an officer and he let us through when he knew I was
a doctor and I left Carl, Matthew and Nick safely behind them and went to
the gym.           This    time    it was very difficult              to get           in.      There wastight
control on the door.               I explained why I wanted to go in                          and was allowed to

 enter.


 I asked      about       a debriefing but nobody could help.                            Those who had been
helping were being cleared out of the gym.                                 Just then a senior officer
 called      all    the    officers      together     at    one      end    of    the hall          for    a police
 briefing.         I don’t know what it was about.                   I left.


 On our way back to Leppings Lane we encountered a police                                     officer who was in
 great distress and being comforted by another.                             I put my arm around him to
 comfort him as well.              He was sobbing uncontrollably and saying that now the
 police would get the blame.                  Another officer was .angry and fold roe that he
 felt    that      they had been let down by the .senior officers.                                  He said that
 nobody tiad taken charge               and that when senior officers had come they had

I arrived at the approach to the Leppings Hoad end of the Hillsborough
Stadium at lh.25 hours.                                       I was accompanied by my 27 year old son and
a young man of 17.                                We all had a valid ground ticket.                                                        The immediate
approach to the turnstiles, a distance of some 70 yards, was full of
a jostling crowd of ticket holders trying to make their way to the
turnstiles.                       There was no semblence of orderly cueues, with some kind
of order trying to be maintained by three mounted police officers.
Despite the lack of organisation and frustration the mood of the fans
remained reasonably co -operative.                                                  To emphasise this, one of the horses
was very close to me and accidentally almost knocked my spectacles off.
The officer apologised and we e.changed smiles and I stroked the horse's
nose.


The nearer one got to the actual turnstiles the pushing and crashing
became severe.                         After approximately ten minutes all three of us were
literally catapulted through, the turnstiles.                                                                      Over the last ten yards
one had no control whatsoever over our movements.


Once through the turnstile all three of my party came together.                                                                                                      Ify son
attempted to remonstrate with a police officer regarding the lack of
organisation on the approach to the turnstile.                                                                      He was warned by a
steward standing alongside the officer to keep quiet because other fans
who had made similar protests had been forcibly                                                                     "ejected from the ground.


We then moved away and vent to use the toilet situated in front of us
under the stand.                              As we came out of the toilet we were directly facing
the rear of the turnstile area and were immediately aware of the
opening of one of the gates alongside the turnstiles.                                                                                The time was now
just after 1U.U0 hours.                                       Anticipating the ensuing rush I took                                                             my
companions to the right, aiming to take our place high up on the terracing
to the left of the Lepping Road Stand facing the playing area.                                                                                                 The
previous y e a r ’s experience had alerted me that this was a sensible area
 to stand, both from a safety viewpoint and it also provided an excellent
view.                      I have a vivid mental picture, as we hurried past the now
 infamous tunnel leading to the ill-fated sections, of turning my head
and noticing there was nobody to be seen, either spectator or official.
The high up area we entered was very full, “but with no crash.       We

positioned ourselves within feet of the blue hoards.      Looking down from

my high vantage spot I could see the two middle pens immediately behind

the goal were .jammed to capacity with a seething mass of people.     To my

surprise, the pens on the left and right were half empty.      The area on

the far ri^it around the electronic scoreboard was also half empty.

The time of this observation was 14.50 hrs.




Ify attention then became diverted when the Liverpool team took to the

field, followed a couple of minutes later by the opposition.        At the same

time I was conscious of a few people entering our section behind and

alongside me.     There was no large influx .just before the kick-off where

I was standing.



The game had been in progress for some fxve minutes with Liverpool pressxng

home an attack at the far end, with a c o m e r followed by a shot which hxt

the woodwork.     I believe this shot to be significant because it meant

a tremendous surge down the Dens behind the Liverpool goal to try and see

what was happening.      This is the normal reaction on the terracing at any

football match.         From my vantage point I was then immediately aware

of fans trying to come over the metal fence behind the goal.        Some had

been successful and were being led down the touchline by the police.         Others

were being stopped climbing out of the pens despite their obvious protests.

 At the same time a senior police officer ran from behind the Liverpool goal

 and approached the referee.     He immediately stopped the game taking both

 teams off the pitch.        By this time a few more fans had managed to

 escape from the pens.      One fan on the field of play appeared to be

 pleading whilst he was being forcibly led to the side of the playing area.

 Behind the goal the two pens were a seething mass of people with little

 or no movement either backwards or forwards.     A few people were being

 passed from the back of the pens to the front.        The front of the pens
      t o t h e f e n c e seemed t o "be f l a t w ith o u t t h e u su a l b ob bing heads


Within two minutes of the teams leaving the field I realised something was

very wrong.       On reflection I have come to the conclusion that my alarm was

confirmed due to a combination of medical exoerience combined with an

intimate knowledge of years of attendance at football matches on the

terracing.


I quickly realised that help would be required on the pitch.                         I informed my

son what I was doing and because I was so close to the entrance to the

terracing I had entered I quickly made my way down the stairs to find a

Steward to get me to the side of the pitch.                    I quickly found a Steward who

accented what I was telling him and he took me through a tunnel under the main

stand where a Police Officer again accepted my explanation of being a trained

nurse and let me on to the pitch.


I raced to the area immediately behind the goal net.                      The narrow gate belonging

to the pen behind the net was open with ■oolice officers trying to pull flaying

bodies through the narrow openir.e.                Other officers appeared to be trying to

instruct the fans to trash back in the pens.                   I helped officers pull people

through the gate.          We were nulling ar.y part of their body we could get hold

of.    On reflection I realise now because their bodies were level with the

bottom of the gate that they must have been lying on top of people because

the gap between the bottom of the gate to the floor of the terracing was some

three feet.



The first casualties I helped pull through the gate were conscious, but very

shocked.      I attended to them at the back of the goalmouth on the netting.

Their recovery was comparatively quick and simple were moved away from the

immediate area.          Very quickly I was aware that we were pulling out

unconscious bodies.         I can next recall working on a young man who once he

was conscious seemed to have chest injuries.                  I looked around the goalmouth

for a stretcher or something to remove him to a place for him to get treatment.
                                             - 4~

    scene around me remained completely chaotic with everyone trying to do

their own thing, fans and police all mingling together.        I eventually found

a stretcher lying on the pitch with which I quickly returned to the injured man.

I literally ordered three police officers to help me lift the patient on to the

stretcher.    By this time he was complaining about the pain in his chest.             We

quickly made our way to the c o m e r of the field between the main stand and the

Kop and took the young man behind the stand to the St. J o h n ’s Ambulance room.

I then ran back on to the field to the goalmouth.       In that short interval of

time a lot more bodies were lying behind the goal.        People of all descriptions

were attempting mouth to mouth resuscitation and cardiac massage.        On the right

land side of the goal net a young girl was being worked on by a man who stated

he was a surgeon.      I moved to the body next in line and worked with a young

police officer until the patient appeared to be starting to come round.            I

then moved on to the next person who was lying unconscious and unattended in

the goalmouth.      I was working alone in this instance giving both mouth to mouth

and cardiac massage, an impossible and hopeless situation.       The patient started

vomiting to complicate the issue.       I was conscious of an elderly white haired

St. John’s Ambulance man working alongside me.        I requested some swabs to clear

an airway, all that was forthcoming was a dry sponge.         By this time it was

after 15*30 hours and vie still had. no equipment of any sort to work with.        It

ras just after that that I was conscious of the first ambulances beginning to

make their way on to the pitch.        Eventually I realised that I had lost the

battle for this young m a n ’s life.      I looked around but I could not see anymore

unattended bodies.      By that time our ranks had been swelled by ambulance crews

and firemen with some oxygen.


I next left the field making my way behind the main stand to the gymnasium where

I understood some of the injured were being taken.       Again I found another scene

of chaos.     The only entrance to the gym was a door of similar dimensions

to that found in any household room.       Directly outside this door was the

St. John’s Ambulance Room.       The space was becoming jammed full of people

with comparatively minor injuries.       The area was also rapidly filling with

people presumed dead.
  next assisted police to make some sort of pathway to the door of the gym by

helping and organising the movement of "both the prospectuve dead and the

seriously injured.       Inside the gymnasium the space was roughly divided

into two, half for the dead and the rest for the living, with tables set up

to interview the relatives.     I began to work with the injured in the

gymnasium at around 15-55 hours.     I was conscious of around three doctors in

attendance, but when I arrived there there was still no medical equipment of

any sort.     One doctor shouted across the gym for some drugs to treat an

injured fan who was in obvious pain.      There was nothing available so I

volunteered to go to the St. John*s Ambulance room.       I was informed that

they were not allowed to carry any drugs.       I rushed back to the gym asking

some Senior Police Officer on the way if they could obtain some equipment

for us.     Quickly three small plastic boxes arrived with medical equipment

plus an emergency case vrith drugs in it.     I began passing out the meagre

items of equipment to the doctors present.      There were still only roughly

a dozen injured in the area.     I prepared ten intravenous lines ready for the

Medical Officer to set up, and we commandeered police officers to hold the

I.V. packs because we had no stands to attach them to.         By then some

semblance of order was being maintained in the part of the gymnasium given

over to the injured.       The other side of the gymnasium was rapidly filling

vrith the pr^Ca**^"//^ dead.    One of the doctors present had taken one of the

three stethoscopes available to enable him to declare them clinically dead.


I next tidied up the medical equipment as most of the injured were being

rapidly removed to hospital.     I then began to realise the full extent of

the disaster for there were already over fifty bodies lying on the floor,

fty final act in this carnage was to comfort and stay with the husband of the

young girl whom I had seen attended to behind the goal.     At least I knew

she had had the best of attention that had been available in the

circumstances.    I stayed with him whilst he gave the necessary details

to the police, and then a local vicar took over from me.

When I left the gymnasium, to my amazement it was still only 16.45 hours.
The longest hour and a half of my life.
PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS



1.    Comparison of the organisation with the previous year.

      The previous year I arrived, at the same area of admission at 14*50 hours

      ■with my daughter.   Before we reached, the turnstiles at Leppings Lane

      we had. to go through a police filter system, whereby it was ascertained

      that we did have the appropriate match tickets.

      This year no such system was set up.




2«    Both years I was delayed "because of travelling difficulties.    The

      at>T>ropriate Authorities had decided to initiate roadworks on the Ko2

      to commence around a week "before each game.     Surely the matches could

      have "been taken into consideration when setting up tnese roadworks.




3.    When we carae through the turnstiles for the 1988 game we were met "by a

      line of stewards and police officers who gently but firmly prevented us

      from entering the tunnel to the middle sections.      It had been decided

      that these sections were already full to capacity.

      This year no such precaution was in operation.




4.    I can understand the Police Officers at the turnstiles wishing to open

      the gates to relieve pressure and avoid injury to life or limb, but

      in these days of ultra m o d e m and sophisticated personal communications

      surely it could have been done in conjunction with their central police

       control area at the side of the electronic scoreboard.




 5.    Very recent national publicity has assured us that surveillance cameras

       at football grounds means that any problems can be dealt with within

      two minutes of their occurrence.

       Surely with the police central control post with all its battery of

       T.V. monitors available, they should have been able to ascertain the
                                        -2 -



need to close the middle sections when they "became full.



6.    Observing from the outside it appears to have taken far too long

      for the authorities to decide that it was not a security problem      and

      that the fans genuinely needed help.     ’.forking with   and alongside

      the individual police officers in the immediate disaster area, I

      have tremendous praise and admiration for their efforts.        Overall

      at the scene, however, there appeared to be a lack of co-ordination

      and genuine leadership.



7   . For an extremely long time we were without ar.7,r form of medical

       equipment of any description.      I still cannot understand why tne

      local Health Authority's Major Medical "Disaster Team was not called

      upon.    I understand that all Health Authorities in this country

       have a major disaster policy.     It is impossible to accurately

       estimate the difference, this would have made in saving life.

       I do, however, believe that the Liverpool fans should have been

       given the chance.

    Dear Dr. Popper.

    At the mini inquests we attempted to ask a series of questions concerning
    the aftermath at Hillsborough, we were left with the impression that the
    questions would be dealt with at a later stage.

    However since then you have ruled that it 1s not necessary to proceed after
    15.15pm and it now appears that our questions will not be addressed, you
1   did say that in an Ideal world everyone would have ended up in hospital and
    you suggested that we were naive 1n thinking that the medical response was
    inadequate, that sort of answer is not conducive to the facts as shown In
    the video, and reports from Medical Personnel who were trying valiantly to
    assist the injured.

    The video shows it took till at least 15.35pm before all the casualties
    were removed from the pens, a fairly lengthy delay which obviously did
    nothing to help their chances of survival.

    Reports and recommendations from the Medical Personnel (please find
    enclosed) certainly imply that in their opinion, the response left a lot to
    be desired.

    We also know of people who were removed 1n an unconscious state, a prime
    example being Mr. Edward Spearritt who according to Mr. Spearritt was not
1   admitted to hospital until 17.00 hours and who subsequently recovered, that
    it was possible for people 1n the crush who suffered severe injury to
    survive with a reasonable amount of aftercare.

    At the very least this raises questions 1n the eyes of the families that
    the inefficiency of the major incident response could have contributed to
    the number of deaths occurring at Hillsborough and therefore we consider
    that this should have been part of your enquiries into the reason for the
    deaths.

    You have promised to look into individual questions of concern, therefore
    1t would not take a great deal of your time to enquire into this matter.



                                                                                                   /

      We v/ould suggest the two most qualified Medical Personnel n&mely Dr. John
      Ashton and Or. filynn Phillips be called to give evidence at your Inquests
      so they can be questioned as to their medical opinion of whether the
      response contributed at all to the amount of fatalities.

     S L J h luk *yo.u. realH e ^ he seriousness which we place on this matter, and we
               i * y ou / J t0 address thj s situation, that this failure will
     obviously form part of a case for judicial revidw no matter what verdict 1s
     reached.

     Trusting you will give this matter your earnest consideration.

                                    Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr Jones
Thank you for your letter dated 12 February 1991, the contents of
which I have noted and have read with care.
Whilst I would not for one moment question the seriousness with which
you view the points raised, I do not think that it is either right
or appropriate for me to enter into a dialogue with you regarding
the issue which you have raised.
However, in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding, I do have
to say that it is not my intention to call either Dr Ashton or
Dr Phillips.
I have also read your penultimate paragraph. Whether or not you
apply for a judicial review is a matter entirely for you and/or your
advisors and I do not think that I should comment on this either.
Yours sincerely

     MR.   CALLAGHAN:    Sir, you know the representation on
previous occasions and I should say it is my intention to stay
only for today and in the case of one or two witnesses.    I
will not take any major part in the Inquiry.

     THE CORONER:   I have got no particular objection to
you being here.   i thought you probably would not be here
continuously but I wanted to be sure about that.    Perhaps
the best thing would be if we started with you really and
if we started with appropriate legal submissions.    it may
be easiest if we start with Mr.. King and then we will move
across the table, so to speak.

     MR. KING:    Sir, my primary legal submission is
directed to your preliminary ruling on the last occasion
that this Inquest should be concerned only with events up
to about 3.15 pm.    As I understand your ruling, sir, it
was designed to ensure that this Inquest would only be
concerned with events leading to the crushing on the
terraces and the first arrival of an ambulance.

     As you know, sir, the families whom I represent are
very anxious that this Inquest should deal with what to
them is a very major issue, as to how their loved ones came
by their deaths, namely how the services and the rescue
services, and those attending with the emergency, coped
with it immediately after people were brought off the
terraces because death was not certified in many, if not
most cases until after 4 pm.    Sir, I do not know if you
have had an opportunity to read these.    I did ask those
instructing me to send to you statements from each of the
families whom I represent setting out a number of
individual questions directed to their own Inquest but also
incorporating in their individual cases why they were
anxious to learn of what happened between the time there
was a first sighting of any loved one being brought off the
terracing and the pronouncement of death.    I do not know
if you had an opportunity to read them.

     THE CORONER:   I have briefly because these did not
arrive until Friday afternoon but I have looked at them.

      MR. KING:     What I would like to do is take you
+v?r°U^v •SOI?e individual examples in order to persuade you
that this is a question which ought to be gone into at this
particular ^n<3uest.     I do not know whether that is a
format you want to follow or whether you want first to hear
some other representatives as to their attitude to my
submission.      I am happy to go into considerable detail
about it.

     THE CORONER:   There are several points which have
occurred to me and the first point I would like you to deal
                                                         A




with is this; you were not present but you will be aware
that in April/May this year we sat for two-and-a-half weeks
approximately and we dealt with the 95 deceased and we
dealt with three issues which Coroners deal with; who the
deceased was, when he/she died and where he/she died.    I
specifically excluded from discussion at that time the
question of how he or she died because as you will
recollect the DPP was still actively considering the matter
and we did not want to trammel his investigation but, on
the other hand, I felt it was right we should allow people
to hear what we could deal with.

     I will raise the second point at the same time because
it may be easier for you to deal with the two things
together.   At those hearings we dealt in considerable
detail, in fact infinitely more detail than we would
normally deal with in an Inquest, with events after the
pathological cause of death and I did it because I realised
that the families were desperately anxious to know what had
happened immediately after the incident.   My question to
you is - and I think this is what we need to deal with and
get right - bearing in mind we have only dealt with the
question of who, when and where and that we have done it in
considerably greater detail than one would normally expect
to do, why is it necessary to review that very activity
again which I think is what you are really asking me to do?

     MR. KING:    Sir, as I understand the individual
Inquests there was not an enquiry into, in the individual
cases, the impact of the organisation rescue on the
survival or otherwise of the particular loved one.     All
that was done when    one looks at those Inquests   was to
identify the time of a first sighting, that is to say,
somebody who seemed to be unconscious, and of a time when
effort was made to resuscitate in any given case and then
death was certified.     In many of the cases there was a
large gap of time after 3.15 pm when it was not
investigated at the individual Inquests the nature of the
services available to deal with those being brought off and
if I can just give    one or two examples of that, you have
examples of people    who are brought off at 1522   and itis
said that there was an effort to resuscitate by a lay
individual and then that particular lay individual is not
heard of again, or the officer is not, and it is said that
the given loved one arrives at the temporary mortuary.
There has been no investigation directed to the alobal
organisation_of what.happened immediately after' they^were
brought off _the tprraoes.^ certainly I have ueen through
the m&iviauaj. uranscripx.3 and there does not seem to be
any evidence directed to that issue and those witnesses wh|o
were called could not deal with those issues, sir.
     THE CORONER:   Are you suggesting that the cause of
death in respect of these individuals is not in fact the
pathological cause of death which we have been given but due
to a novus actus in effect by person or persons whose
evidence you have not yet heard?

     MR. KING:    Certainly the families, and I put it as
openly as this, sir, and putting it bluntly, cards on the
table, are not convinced at all that had there been a far
more sensible, logical organisation of the rescue services,
of the major disaster team being brought in, of proper
medical equipment being available, of proper triage being
carried out, that those measures, had they been there, in
several cases, would not have resulted in the survival of
their loved ones.    They cannot - obviously they were not
there - produce through me concrete evidence of that at this
stage but at every stage of an Inquiry into this disaster,
and this certainly is true even in the Taylor Inquiry, that
particular aspect of the disaster has never properly been
gone into.

      Again putting it very simply to you, sir, most of the
families I represent feel there has been a complete blanket
(not a deliberate blanket) been held down over what happened
after they were brought off the terraces and before
individuals were certified dead and there has been no effort
made systematically to analyse what was the organisation at
the time for the rescue, what might have been, and what could
have made a difference.    A very simple example again is that
I am instructed there is evidence of Dr. Gumpert given at the
Inquest that without an electrocardiogram we can never be
sure whether or not there is a pulse and when dealing with     i
individual loved ones taken off the terraces and simply dealtj
with by lay people, the absence of such sort of equipment     f
means ^that one would never know whether or not that          »
individual was alive or dead at that stage.    It is a       If
matter - and I do not mean this pejoratively - which is swept
under the carpet as if to say, "All we are interested in is '
the immediate crushing leading to those being brought off the
terraces".    I cannot put it any more firmly than that, sir.

     THE CORONER:    You have put it very plainly and I
appreciate it.    I will give a ruling on your application in
a few moments but do you want to develop it further?
Obviously I want an opportunity to hear from your colleagues.

     MR. KING:   Have you the individual statements which
were supplied?

     THE CORONER:   I do have those in front of me.   I would
not want to go through all of them but if you wish to pick
one or two as examples I am prepared to listen to you and
indeed it also makes it easier for everybody else.
                                                            6




     MR. KING:    Sir, if you were to turn to No. 11 to start
with, which is the submissions to you of the Jones family,
Richard Jones, I do not know whether you have been given on4
or two documents.    I have two documents in relation to Mr.
Jones one headed "Dear Miss Steel" and one headed "Dear Mr.
King".

     THE CORONER:      No. 11, did you say?

     MR. KING:   Yes, sir.     *1beg your pardon, sir, it is
No. 10.   Sir,   if you look --

     THE CORONER:    Mr. King, may I just stop you for one
moment because something has occurred to me, and I have been
reminded, which I ought to say to the Press before we go
further?    The session this morning is being heard without
the Jury and the reason we have not got the Jury is because
we are dealing with legal points.    That means no doubt that
you can report we are in session but you should not actually
report what is being said.    You will no doubt be familiar
with the provisions of Subsection 2 of Section 4 of the
Contempt of Court Act and I say you must not report what we
are discussing.    If we had wanted the Jury to hear we would
have had them present but we do not wish them to hear at this
stage.   You may, when we have finished the Inquest, if you
still feel it is a reportable and interesting aspect then, ol
course, that is a different matter but for the moment please
do not report the content of the legal matters we are
discussing.    Mr. King, I am sorry to interrupt you, would
you continue?

     MR. KING:   Sir, the document I am looking at and I
appreciate those alongside me are not looking at any documenl
but it is just to help you isone headed to myself, "Dear Mr.
King".

     THE CORONER:   I have a document headed "Dear Miss
Steel" dated 22nd October.

     MR. KING:      Sir, this   isdated 7th November.

     THE CORONER:   I havenot got it I am afraid.       It is
not in front of me.

     MR. KING:   I apologise for that and I will take you
through, if I may, through five points which are raised by
Mr. and Mrs. Jones.   Sir, they make the basic point that th<
report into the death of their loved one,' Richard, was
certified at 1600 hours in the temporary mortuary and,
therefore, so far as the family are concerned, so far as
evidence is concerned, they presume, as they say they must b<
entitled to, up to that time the evidence of death is not
clear as having already occurred.

v* r* Po^nt N o * 2 ' sir/ is extracted from the evidence oiven
by Dr. Gumpert at the Inquest already held here and in fact
        evidence given on the occasion of Kevin Tyrrell and
recall^ 1S 3 quotation from his evidence which you may

     "I would like to observe that feeling the carotid pulse
     is quite difficult in someone who has a low blood
     pressure as would have been here.   In fact it can be so
     difficult it is impossible and you have to have an
     electrocardiogram on to know whether the heart has
     stopped or not."

     Then there is the statement of Mr. Eccleston, which is
torth«ni L J M ^ em!nt i n .the large bundle of statements given
to the West Midlands Police, and indeed Mr. Eccleston gave
evidence to the Taylor Inquiry in which he says this:

     As a comment on what Mr. King has said, strictly it appears
to us that he is saying that there is the possibility, to put it
in a legal term, of a novus actus, i.e. something which
intervened after the crushing and before the deaths, which caused
or contributed to the deaths of at least some of the people, and
the response of the Chief Constable to that submission, if I put
it correctly, is that we can quite see that is something which
people would wish to see investigated on the question of how it
came about.  I only make that comment in an endeavour to be
helpful, but the position of the Chief Constable is that he has
no submissions one way or the other.
                                »



     May I just say while I am on my feet with regard to what Mr!
Hale has just said, as a matter of fact it is not correct that
the Police have admitted negligence.  It is well known and has    ?
been well publicised that what has happened is that the Police
have agreed to make payments to those people who were injured ane
to the dependents of those whodied, and that such payments are
in the process of being made. Also there has been a civil actior
in respect of apportionment of liability in respect of those
matters.

     THE CORONER:   Thank you very much, indeed.  I accept
entirely what you say and in a sense I accept what Mr. Manning
says as well.  It is not really relevant to my proceedings
whether or not negligence has been admitted or not admitted.   It
is neither here nor there. SoI did not comment on it, but I
appreciate what you have said.

     MR. ISAACS:   I think, sir, in fact, that is Mr. Hale.     Mr.
Manning sits to my left.

     THE CORONER:     I beg your pardon.   Forgive me, please, both
of you.

     MR. ISAACS:   Sir, I have no submissions.  It is entirely a
matter for you having regard to the breadth or depth which you
consider appropriate for this particular Inquest.

     MR. MANNING:   Sir, I have exactly similar comments as far
as my client is concerned.

     MISS SINCLAIR:     I have no submissions on this matter, sir.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   I add to that. The matter is entirely for
you. You are the best person, having read all the evidence, to
make that judgment, and no doubt that was the reason we had, as
you have already pointed out, sir, a fairly detailed
investigation into the earlier Inquests.

     MR. CALLAGHAN:   Sir, this is not an application of which I
have had previous notice, and which in the circumstances of the
application is some surprise to me. All I think I should, sir,
is this is not the time and place for some sort of Public Inquiry
into the activities of the Ambulance Service and the Emergency
Services, and it is not appropriate to bring such a matter into
                                                            15




the arena as a sort of   sidewind.   Beyond that, sir   it is
obviously a matter for   you.

     Miss ADDELMANN:    Sir, I haveno observations or submissio
about the point, and I can do no better than echo those remarks
made by my learned friend, Mr. Catchpole.

     MR. RUSSELL:   I too endorse those remarks.

other than my learned friend, Mr. King, has seen the original
statements, and so are being invited to comment upon a course in
the dark because we have not seen the nature of an example of the
material he now seeks to rely upon.     I recognise it is a matter
for you, and if you decide I d 6 n ’t take a stance one way or the
other.

     THE CORONER:   Shall I then deal with this point? Is there
anybody else wants to say anything on this issue? Mr. King?

     MR. KING:   Sir, only to emphasise that it is not a side
wind which I am embarking on.  I am seeking to address causes,
contributory causes to the deaths, and I am concentrating on
that, and it is in that context I have invited the Court to look
beyond 3.15, and certainly we are dealing with it from the point
of view of possibilities of novus actus, yes, I accept that.

     THE CORONER:   I have listened hopefully with attention, anc
perhaps I ought to say this to you, Mr. Russell, before I go on.
I know you have not had the advantage of seeing the letter, but
it is only fair to say Mr. King in his summary of the points as
far as I can see summarised the points which his clients were
making entirely fairly.  There is nothing extra in the letter, sc
to speak, except connecting words, basically. That is for your
reassurance, if I can put it like that.

      Throughout, and in fact almost from the word "go” on the
15th April, 1989, when I first learned about this incident, one
of the underlying criteria which I tried to apply in thinking
how to set about dealing with the Inquests was to as far as
possible treat the Inquests as if they were completely
standard, if I can put it like that - it is a horrible word -
but completely normal Inquests. The fact that it was national
news, that it was 95 young people, that it created a terrible
amount of anxiety, pain and so on, in some ways is unique
because of the numbers, but each individual death I dealt with
families are in exactly the same situation, and I tried to
think and I still try to think, what and how would I set about
if I had had a road traffic incident or a works accident as
opposed to an incident in a football stadium.    I have thought
back on many occasions to say a road traffic incident where
somebody might have suffered a serious head injury. That
person may well have been at the road side for X number of
minutes while one was waiting for the ambulance services to
attend. They may then have been taken by an ambulance to a
hospital. They may have gone into the resuscitation room.
They may have been worked on by the doctors. They may have gone
into hospital and they may have then died two, three days, may
be longer after the incident.   Or alternatively, you could have
                  /here by chance the road traffic incident occurs on
                  1a doctor happens to be. He walks up to the
                 Iks and says, "I am sorry, the injury is so severe
               rrson is dead". Or you could have a situation where
                has this road traffic incident and is taken into
               id is certified dead on arrival.

               /one o^f those instances would I as a matter of routine

          /stance, for multiple injuries with fracture of the skull, oi
         .hing of jhat nature.             It seems to me that the fact that the
       on may sufvive an injury for a number of minutes or hours or
      i days, isnot the question which I as Coroner have to
     £ider. M^task is to establish who the person was - I am
     Fry to repet this - where he died, when he died and how he
   fe d .     It is from my understanding of the pathological evidence
  ihe overwheling pathological evidence is and was that the peopie
 ilied as a reflit of crushing or traumatic asphyxia.                Different
 fwords were ukd, but the sense was always the same.                 The
  underlying ppblem which these poor men and women were subjected
  to was an iroility to breathe.

       That d<s not mean to say that some of them did not in fact
  respire forhperiod of time dr even have a heart beat
  thereafter,U,t the damage was done, and indeed, both Dr.
  Gumpert, DrSlater, Prof. Usher, who dealt with this question ir

  evidence, ectly the same.

     MR. KING:   Thank you for that.   Can I raise a
separate matter, sir, which is not connected with the issue
of cut off but is connected with the issue of 50 pages
which you have referred to?

         THE CORONER:                I was n o t s a y in g t h a t as a c r i t i c i s m .

       MR. KING:      Not a t a l l , s ir .        One o n ly has t o s t a t e
t h e number o f f a m i l i e s whom I r e p r e s e n t t o know t h a t .
Sir, a number of the families have raised specific
questions relating to the summaries which were put before
you in their individual Inquests.   I just give one
example, sir; in the case of No. 13, Jonathan Owens, you
will note they have a particular concern as to the timing
when their son came to the ground and a particular concern
to the fact that the summary suggests he joined the crowd
at twenty to three when, in fact, they point out to you
that the positive video evidence shows they were standing,
not having joined the crowd at all, round about ten to or
eight minutes to three.   I put that as an example.

     Are you willing, sir, to go through those individual
questions - not now - and indicate at some stage, perhaps
even in writing to us, whether or not you would be prepared
to reopen those individual Inquests to deal with those -
may be small points in the whole but to the individual
families - important points of factual errors which seem.to_
have crept xn by reference to positive evidence whicn can
now be laid before you?

     THE CORONER:   My recollection of the papers is that
they affected very few or where I feel it is justified.    I
think those two things go together.   As I say, I have not
had sufficient time to study it in detail but if I were to
think there was a genuine error and that that error was
actually relevant - the incident which you have given me
indicates with respect to the family it is an anxiety to
them - but the crucial point is not whether he was standing
in a crowd or whether he was standing aside but where was
he or at least at what time was he still outside the
ground?   One has to ask the question, does it actually get
us any further forward?

         MR. KIN G :      May I j u s t in t e r p o s e t o s a y t h a t t h e
e x a m p le I g a v e was d i r e c t e d as much t o t h e t im in g s o u t s i d e
t h e g ro u n d i n f a c t .

        THE CORONER:                If   we h a v e made a m is t a k e ,    and we w i l l
b e c h e c k in g t h a t . . .

        MR. KING:            I     am o b l i g e d .
     THE CORONER:   When points have been made of actual
error we have been trying to check.    If we agree with
them, as Mr. Fraser and some of the others will remember,
we have made from time to time afl hoc amendments when
points of error were pointed out to us.    I am not averse
to that, not in principle anyway, and if it helps somebody
by clarifying something then I will be pleased to do so but
I would not want necessarily to spend endless time on
clarifying minutiae which, in the final analysis, do not
matter so far as the Jury are concerned.    I am sure you
accept that.

     MR. KING:   I understand that, sir, but I am sure when
families are supplied with an "agreed" summary and they see
matters which are of great concern to them which appear to
be incorrect then obviously they are desirous that that
should be rectified as quickly as possible.

     THE CORONER:      I take it none of you have any adverse
comments on that?

     MR. KING:   What I am going to suggest is that those
instructing me extract from those documents which do
confuse two issues, those which are directed specifically
to individual questions and they can be then sent to you in
a more orderly manner which enables us the more quickly to
obtain help from you.

     THE CORONER:   That would be very helpful indeed
because then we would really know what we are looking at
and what we have got to concentrate on.

     MR. KING:      Yes, sir.

     THE CORONER:      Are there any other comments from
anybody?

     MR.   ISAACS:   Yes, sir.   I just wondered how we are
going to   deal with these matters.   I know that you started
with Mr.   King and I thought probably what you would do is
run down   the line so to speak.

     THE CORONER:   Yes, we will do that.      Have you got
any submissions to make?

     MISS HAMPTON:   I have no submissions raised by Mr.
King, though he has raised one particular matter which
concerns the City Council with regard to the agreed summary
of facts.   They have been through the proposed summary
prepared for today’s hearing and there are one or two
matters, they have instructed me on, which concerns them,
sir.

     THE CORONER:   I think I will be able to short circuit
this submission. You will recollect, ladies and gentlemen,
at the business meeting a suggestion was made that we
should try and extract various paragraphs out of Lord
Justice Taylor’s Report as an agreed statement.   I was not
particularly enamoured of the view and for some reason
which at the moment I cannot account for I forgot to
mention at the meeting that we were actually in the process
of preparing what we thought was an actual non-
controversial, entirely neutral, account of various
activities which we hoped it.would be possible to put to
the Jury so that they had an underlying base on which one
could build the edifice, so to speak.

     In the events which have happened, we have heard from
most of you, if not all, but whilst quite a lot of you have
actually come back and said that you are reasonably happy
with the summary there have been quite a number of you who
have had substantial points of criticism to make with
regard to the content.   Unfortunately some of these points
- and I do not think I am criticising anybody and I am not
going to name any names either - were not made until Friday
or even later.   When I say Friday, I mean Friday late
afternoon.   I have come to the conclusion that we are not
going to use these summaries at all.   We will build, if
that is the right word, what we need as we go along.

     I mention that now, and I will mention it when the
Jury are here, but what we are going to do is that we have
got some two dozen slides which we are going to show.
They are shots of the ground from the air and so on in
order to give the Jury some idea of what we are talking
about and then we will just build the evidence on it as far
as is necessary for the purposes of the Inquest.   I think
that probably deals with your point.   I know that many of
you thought it was a jolly good idea but in the event it
has not worked out.   I thought it was a jolly good idea as
well which is why I intended to do it but I would rather
not.   Some of the points which were made, I could see what
was being said and some were very good, but I would rather
not have anything which people were not entirely happy on.
Some of you might feel you have been pushed because you
have been asked to agree to something.   If you are not
happy with the evidence, that is another matter altogether.
I take no responsibility for what the witnesses say.    We
have to accept the evidence that is given.   Are there any
other submissions you want to make, Miss Hampton?

     MISS HAMPTON:    No, thank you, sir.

                  Today we are not dealing with a party to a cause we
                are dealing with a witness.    At common law, when a
                witness is being examined in the witness box or is
                subpoenaed to produce documents to the court then
                quite understandably, he may have something he
                wishes to keep secret to himself so that his
                neighbours or his competitors should not get to
               know of it; something which he might reasonably
                believe he ought not to be compelled to disclose.
               Not, at any rate, if it exposes him to risk of
               some ill befalling him. The common law does in
               some circumstances cast its protection over him.
               It adopts the maxim nemo tenetur seipsum prodere.
               No ;one is bound to furnish evidence against
               himself, it says:    ’If a witness claims the
               protection of the court, on the ground that the
               answer would tend to incriminate himself and there
               appears reasonable ground to believe that it would
               g o so, he is not compellable to answer” ,

              could   (I stress the "could" sir) "be used against him
              in criminal proceedings or in proceedings for a
              penalty, then his objection should be upheld.

              There is the further point: once it appears that a
              witness is ?t risk, then ’great latitude should be
              allowed to him in judging for himself of the effect of
              any particular question': see R. v. Boyes".

             can show facts which establish the existence of a
             penalty offence (or in other cases the commission of a
             criminal offence) the courts should be slow to deprive
             that party of his privilege against self-incrimination
             which the common law now for some three centuries       and
             s 14 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968 today, accords him
             In the absence of bad faith, to say that there is no '
             risk of proceedings may in all but the plainest cases
             involve a court claiming for itself a degree of
             prescient foresight to which it would not be wise to
             pretend for it its forecast were wrong and if
             proceedings and penalties were to follow, damage will
             or at least may be done by an erroneous decision of th<
             court which it would not be easy thereafter to undo or
             r e d r e s s .”

I ask you to turn over the page again to what would be 726, the
                            the ?age at D - A g a i n - a^ter a review of the
au t h o r i t i e s , Lord Justice Roskill says:

               It cannot, I think, be right in these cases for
             the court to attempt a quantitative assessment of
             the probability one way or the other of the risk
             of proceedings ultimately being taken, and then
             to seek to draw the line one way where the
             Probabilities in the view of the court are
             thought to be more or less evenly balanced and
             the other where the balance is more disparate.
             It is not for the court to resolve problems of
             this kind by calculating odds.   I think that the
             right question to ask is that posed by Shaw LJ; can
             exposure to the risk of penalties (or in other cases t<
             the risk of prosecution for a criminal offence) be
             regarded as so far beyond the bounds of reason as to b«
             no more than a fanciful possibility?”

In   fact,   later on Lord Justice Shaw said exactly that.

      Could I ask you to turn from that case to part 7 of the
         r ? h5 Ve bfen h a n d e d - because the case ended up in the

that part of the case as to what was held by their Lordships..      I
would draw your attention to (ii) starting with "The RTZ
companies".


          "(ii)   The RTZ companies were entitled to claim the
          privilege from the production of documents given by s
          14(1) of the 1968 Act notwithstanding that the
          commission had knowledge of the cartel and had not
          taken any action in respect of it, for if the documents
          were produced under the letters rogatory the RTZ
          companies would be exposed to a greater risk of
          proceedings being brought against them by the
          commission for recovery of a fine than they were
          exposed to at present, since production of the
          document's might authenticate and support the existing
          information in the hands of the commission and afford
          conclusive proof of a breach by the RTZ companies of
          the prohibition against cartels, and might cause the
          commission to decide to take action against the RTZ
          companies".

So, sir, we have there the House of Lords dealing with the point
that may be raised in this case as to the decision that has been
taken by the Director in this case, but who knows what will
happen in the future.

     Could you then turn four pages on to what would be page 445
between B-C, still the speech of Lord Wilberforce.  He says at C

          ”1 base that conclusion in part on evidence which was
          before and considered by the High Court and the Court
          of Appeal and in part on the proposition that the
          tendency to expose to a penalty would be increased if
          the documents in question were to be validated and
          connected with the RTZ companies by sworn evidence,
          as opposed to being, as they are now, pieces of paper
          found in a file” .

Sir, it w o n ’t have escaped you the difference between, albeit th<
evidence that was given before Lord Justice Taylor was all taken
down, it was not evidence that was given on oath, but of course
the evidence before you would be given on oath.

     Then, sir, could you turn another six pages, pages 456 and
457.  "To give any e v i dence” . This is the speech of Viscount
Dilhorne, between G-H, and you appreciate, sir, I am only pickin,-
those parts which are germane to this matter:

          ’’Secondly, it was argued that the discovery of the
          document would not in the circumstances tend to expose
          the RTZ companies to such proceedings” . (That is for a
          penalty)   "it was said that as the commission had
          knowledge from the ’Friends of the E a r t h ’ documents fo
          a considerable time of the existence of the cartel and
          had taken no action, there was no real risk of such
          proceedings if the documents in the possession of the
                                                              33




            RTZ companies were disc l o s e d” .


Then he deals with the arguments and reference to certain
authority.

     If you could move to page 457, the right-hand side, between
C-D, and he refers to what was said by Lord Denning in the Court
of Appeal to which I have just referred you, he says:

            "With these observations I respectfully agree.       It was
            suggested that the reasoning in the Triplex case had
            reduced the burden which formerly lay on a person
            claiming privilege but I do not think that that is the
            case.  In his judgment du Parq LJ reviewed the earlier
            cases and based his conclusions on t h e m . Lord Denning
            MR contrasted a real and appreciable risk with a remote
            or insubstantial one, and once it appears that the risl
            is not fanciful, then it follows that it is real.       If
            it is real, then there must be a reasonable ground to
            apprehend danger, and, if there is, g r e a t .latitude is
            to be allowed to the witness and to a person required
            to produce d o c u m e n t s .

           If the RTZ companies are compelled to produce the
           documents which they were asked to produce, I
           cannot reach the conclusion that it would be
           fanciful to suppose that that would expose them to
           no greater risk than at present of proceedings for
           the recovery of a penalty being brought against
           them.     The documents might well authenticate and
           support the information now in the hands of the
           c o mm ission” .

So what the learned Law Lord is saying, sir, in my submission,
that even though the Commission nad evidence before it which the>
had decided to take no action on, the production of these
documents, the production of additional information, may well be
sufficient to cause them to take a different view.

     There is just one further part I would ask you to look at,
and that is in the speech of Lord Diplock.  Page 465 on the
right-hand side of a page which begins, "The privilege claimed b?
the RTZ companies” . Could you go to the right-hand side, sir, a-
B:

           ”1 do not think that your Lordships are entitled to
           dismiss as fanciful the risk that if the documents
           relating to the cartel were produced at the trial in
           the Virginia proceedings and came, as they then would,
           into the public domain, the resulting publicity in thi:
           sensitive political field might result in pressure on
           the commission to take against the RTZ companies
           speedier and severer action than they might otherwise
           have d o n e " .

        that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute your
        client for any criminal offence arising out of the
        Hillsborough tragedy.    It is also correct to say that
        the disciplinary issues now have to be considered by
        South Yorkshire Police in consultation with the Police
        Complaints Authority.    I believe you are also aware
        there are outstanding civil actions being brought by
        various parties with an interest in the matter and that
        there are ninety-five Coroner's inquests to be
        reconvened.

        I am aware that at the interview on the 3rd of July.
        1990, your client intimated that once the DPP had made
        his decision in respect of the criminal issues he would
        consider being interviewed in respect of any
        disciplinary matters.   If that is still his wish then
        I am ready to conduct that interview, but it must be
        understood that the disciplinary matters are very
        closely related to the criminal issues so any interview
        would have to be conducted under a Police and Criminal
        Evidence Act caution and the transcript of the
        questions and answers would have to be sent to the DPP
        for further consideration of the criminal matters.

       your client as to how you, or he, should proceed, but
       it seems to me that you should be aware of the

     offence had been committed and that for other
     verdicts (except an open verdict) they had to be
     satisfied on the balance of probabilities.
     Furthermore, when directing a jury on
     manslaughter comprising unlawful killing alleged
     to have occurred because of neglect on the part
     of police, the coroner was required to direct the
     jury on four matters   "

I pause there.    My submission is this, against the
background of the submission I have already made, namely
that any question which Mr.'Duckenfield was asked would
have the tendency to incriminate that in relation to those
four matters that the Divisional Court referred to, if any
question is asked of Mr. Duckenfield which touches upon any
of these four matters, or of any of the four ingredients of
the first matter to which the Divisional Court refers,
there will be a tendency to incriminate him in the very
nature of the question itself because these are questions
which would be directed to the possible commission of a
criminal offence.    Those matters are these:

     "...firstly that they had to be satisfied, on the
     evidence, of four ingredients, namely (a) that
     the police were under a duty to have regard to
     the health and welfare of the deceased..."

So any question to Mr. Duckenfield as to his duty in
relation to the spectators at Hillsborough, or those who
tragically died, would require an answer which would have a
tendency to incriminate.  It continues:

     "...(b) that in the circumstances there was a
     failure to do what should have been done for the
     health and welfare of the deceased..."

So any question asked of Mr. Duckenfield as to what he did
or did not do that day which touched upon the health and
welfare of the deceased would be a question which would
require an answer which would tend to incriminate him.   It
goes o n :

     "...(c) that the failure amounted to a
     substantial cause of death   "

So any question asked of him - of course this is only a
privilege of self-incrimination - as to causation between
what he did and any death or deaths, or the deaths of those
who died in general terms, would be a question which would
tend to incriminate, that is, the answer' would tend to
incriminate and:
                                                         44




on that particular question Mr. Duckenfield or perhaps
myself saying, "Sir, I object to answering that question.
I rely on privilege".   The risk of prejudice so far as the
Jury is then concerned is overwhelming both in so far as
Mr. Duckenfield is concerned and indeed the position so far
as the South Yorkshire Police themselves as a body are
concerned (and here I intrude a little on to Mr Pavne's
territory).                                        3

     One can perhaps, no matter how carefully you are
directing, see the difficulty that would be in the mind of
the Jury if to every question the position of privilege is
claimed. They would be bound to think, "What has this man
got to hide?" You, sir, know and my learned colleagues and
I know, that such a privilege is said not to be taken
against a man but lay people and lawyers are quite
different and there comes a time when they say to
themselves, "There is something funny here. We are not
being told the whole truth and whatever".   My concern is
that even in the asking of a question that may be
disallowed by you there will be sufficient in the question
to prejudice the Jury against either Mr. Duckenfield or
others.

  ^ I come back to the point I made earlier about the line
being drawn.   Everything at the moment is above the line.
I am concerned there should be nothing below the line which
may prejudice Mr. Duckenfield.    May I go back to the
analogy you drew as to the straightforward case of the
reckless driver and the fatality?

     I anticipate that it would be your practice — let us
say no PACE interview had taken place - that the driver had
relied upon his right not to answer any questions, as has
taken place in this case so far Mr. Duckenfield was
concerned, and you would not in those circumstances with
the driver facing the possibility of prosecution say to the
           u must answer these questions as to what you did
and what you thought" etc. You would not expect the driver
to answer those questions in those circumstances. Mr.
Duckenfield is in exactly the same position.

      It may be said that Mr. Duckenfield is such an
important participant in the events of that day that
without him what is the point of going on at all but in my
submission that would be misconceived because the privilege
is only against self-incrimination.    There are many, many
people, both police officers and civilians who can give
evidence as to the facts and the factual decisions that Mr.
Duckenfield took on that day and so the Jury will not in
         be dePrived o f the opportunity of hearing about
what happened. They would just be deprived of not being
told by Mr. Duckenfield.
     I come back again to the point that I made at the
outset.   Whilst this is a high profile Inquest, it is
important not to disregard the rights of any individual who
has interests of his own and important interests which are
affected by the law.

     I finally say this - and I know I have been on my feet
for quite some time and I do not want to weary you
further - that if it be felt necessary by you, and both you
and I know, sir, that there are no PACE statements or
interviews by M r . Duckenfield, that the Jury must hear
something about what Mr. Duckenfield said about the day
then, sir, upon instructions - and it is only on this basis
that I put this - I have no complaint with what Mr.
Duckenfield said to the Taylor Inquiry going before the
Jury. I say that because that is all above the line as
opposed to anything new below the line.

     That has already been considered by the Director and
my concern is that there is something else. It may be
said, "We can ask him the same questions and if the
Director has already considered those matters, well then,
frankly what has he got to worry about?" Sir, the asking
of the question (a) is unlikely to be in the same terms and
(b) the answer is unlikely to be in the same terms and it
does not have to be an answer which is an admission of any
offence.   It only has to be, on the authorities, a step
possibly towards this, and again, sir, you have the dicta
where that is made abundantly clear.

      I fear, and I know you are mindful of this, sir, that
this is really the last opportunity for the families (and
one can understand their concern and I do not criticise
them at all) through my learned friend, Mr. King, or Mr.
Hytner who may well be brought in, as Mr. King mentioned on
the last occasion to, cross-examine Mr. Duckenfield or
other witnesses, to produce extra evidence to get that
which they have, which we see, been pressing for. It is in
those circumstances that seeking to protect Mr.
Duckenfield's interests, to be fair to him whilst being
^ai-r to others, and being mindful of the restricted area of
Inquests as this is not a Public Inquiry, this is not the
Spanish Inquisition, this is not the Star Chamber, not only
should be the questions which he is to be asked that he
should not be obliged to give evidence at all. Those are
my submissions, sir.

     THE CORONER:   Can I just make two small points before
I call anybody else? Perhaps it was my fault, I do not
recollect, but if I instanced an RTA where the driver was
reckless then I made a mistake because if a driver had been
reckless he would have been charged with causing death by
reckless driving and under Section 16 of the Coroner's Act
I would have had to adjourn it sine die. The point I was
trying to make was that under normal circumstances it was
the ordinary driver.

     MR. ISAACS:   Let us say, it is probably my fault,
careless driving or driving without due care.

     THE CORONER:   It makes no difference to the argument
but I just wanted to be clear that we were talking about
the same thing.

     MR. ISAACS:    It is important. The seriousness of the
crime is neither .here nor there. It is a privilege, as you
and I know, against self-incrimination in any offence. I
am obliged to you, sir.

     THE CORONER:   It is 1236 and in twenty minutes we
     be rising because at two o'clock we are starting with
the Jury. Can you indicate whether any of you feel you
wish to address me on the point which Mr. Isaacs has made?
What you are saying is that there is clear authority that a
person does not have to answer questions which tend to
incriminate him, to use the text of the rule, and you cited
the rule plus several cases. Do any of you feel you want
to address me on the point which Mr. Isaacs has made? As I
understand it, what you are saying is that there is clear
authority for saying that a person does not have to answer
a question which may tend to incriminate him and you cited
the rule plus several cases.  It is exceedingly difficult
to formulate questions where people are in danger of
prosecution which are meaningful and in the circumstances
what is the point of getting the man or the witness to come
into the box at all? You are not suggesting that a PACE
statement, if there is one, or anybody else should be
excluded?

     MR. ISAACS:   No, sir, not at all.

     THE CORONER:   Have I summarised very, very briefly
the heart of your submission?

     MR. ISAACS:   Indeed you have, sir. To call him in
those circumstances would only serve to disadvantage him as
well as others in addition to the prejudice which would be
caused. You have summarised it absolutely correctly.

     THE CORONER:   The fourth point you have made is that
the damage of refusing to answer the questions is out of
proportion to the benefit of having him here as a witness?

   — MR. ISAACS:   There is no benefit in having him here
because any question he is asked is bound to have the
tendency to incriminate him on the basis of the principles
I have put before you.                          Fimcipj.es

     THE CORONER:   I  look to Mr. King, first of all,
because he is the most likely person to address me on the
issues. Are you likely to address me on this?

     MR. KING:   Sir,   I would wish to. There are two
          0ne 1 woul<* wish to hear if anybody      else has
anything to say in support and, secondly, in the light of
what has just fallen from my learned friend's lips as to
the use of the transcript I Would like to take certain
instructions from those whom I represent.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Isaacs, it seems to me that it
would be wise, before I give a ruling on your submission,
to allow other people to have their say so that I can hear
?         points of view and secondly, it gives me a chance
to think about it as well. If you do not think U r u Z T
what I intend to do is not proceed with the point at this
stage because we cannot deal with the submissions on what
we                    Point actually in twenty minutes and
we will deal with it either at four this afternoon, subject
to your agreement, when the Jury go or if it is more

 future, so in that sense it is not urgent that we have got
 to nave a ruling this morning.                         8

     MR. ISAACS:   Sir, save for this, that I am afraid -
and you may have gleaned tnis from some of tne newspapers,
I thimc - tnat I will not have the privilege of being
before you on most days during this Inquest.

       THE CORONER;   I had not appreciated that.

     riK. ISAACS:    You had not, sir, but no, I am afraid
that is the position.     Without going into any details I am
afraid that the cost of representation would be so great,
and there is no sufficient funds for him at the present
time. The Police Authority have unfortunately failed to
agree that he or others in a similar position should have
taeir representation ;>aid for, so I am afraid that he will
not be represented during the course of this inquest, sir,
°tne*r than °n t*1-
                  e daY s when, if you do decide that he
should be called, he is actually giving evidence.

     THE CORONER:   And presumably on the days when any
statement - in fact, I think there is one, it is not very
long but I think there is one - were to be dealt with?

      MR. ISAACS:   That may or may not be the case, sir.
 but one can understand the difficulties. May I say this,
m   relation to what you said just a moment ago, and this
 perhaps is a little special pleading? You said a moment
 ago you did not want to be rude - I think I can soeak on
 S!               laarned^friends, it is a long time since
  e have been before a tribunal wiich is so courteous and
 we are very grateful to you for that. We are not perhaps
 usad to b^ing treated so well.                       *

       THE CORONER:   Will you be here this afternoon?

       MR. ISAACS:    I shall be here this afternoon, sir.
yes.                                                 '     '

     THE CORONER:    In that case shall we deal with it
this afternoon? Is that agreeable to all of you? I know
it makes it a longer day but I did say at our business
meeting that the lawyers nave to put up with the strain.
      *.lk? to su£ject my   jury to too heavy pressure,
 ecauae it is notfair on them, but we have just got to
put up with it, so to speak. Is that agreeable to
everybody? Good.

     Is there any other -- perhaps you could outline the
nature of your submissions, so I know what we have got in
store, so to speak.                                5

o f tne m a tte r is th a t the p r o b a b i l i t y is t h a t most o f the
people w 10 w i l l be on the Jury have never been on any

been on a C oroner’ s J u ry . With tne best d ir e c t i o n s in the

         I t is im p o s s ib le , in the words t h a t have been read to

the person. , and t h e r e fo r e th e re i s damage beyond measure
in even going to t h a t stage which suggests t h a t a person
snould be c a l l e d in t o a witness box, g iv e t h e i r name and

tne f a c t o f th e m a tte r i s they have got the w h i f f o f

begins to run w ild and we can have no c o n t r o l over what

          T h e r e f o r e , in adopting tne l e g a l submissions and in
not seeking to put them before you over and over again* I
have to say t h a t c on sidering what questions may be r a is e d ,
and c o n s id e rin g those c r i t e r i a which have been put before
you as to tiv? s o rts o f questions which c l e a r l y have to be

tns q ue s tio n s whicn norm ally would be asked and th e re is
tne Rule and the law, and t h a t i s what we, and you, s i r ,
a re here to uphold, the law, i f the law says t h a t a person
s.iould not be put in t h a t p o s i t i o n , c a t e g o r i c a l l y should

ihe Mandela Room has been l a i d out w ith a b ig screen l i k e

what is going on but does not want to be in the Court
they can go and watch and n ea r.               As I understand i t , i f we
use, f o r example, a v id e o , you w i l l see tne video but you
w i l l not be a b le to see the C ourt, because we have only
got one camera.            In the normal course o f events you w i l l
be a b le to see and near w hat’ is going on in Court but in
c e r t a i n circum stances you may have a s l i g h t l y l i m i t e d

          The o th e r room has been l a i d out and is intended

any o f you wish to speak to your c l i e n t s you have got a

have to judge how good they a re and whether you want to
use them.        They a r e th e re f o r your use i f you wish.

       , THE COitOHER;        The answer to t h a t is t h a t I took Mr.

s a id what I want and am not going to change my mind on i t .
I am going to s t i c k to what I have s a id , 3 .1 5 or

There are rules and limits, but they will have told you that, 'i
they have not, ask, so that you know how much you can spend
without being out of pocket.  It is adequate, you will find.

     One advantage of giving you sandwiches, was that we had you
nicely segregated from everybody else, and we won’t have that if
we allow you to run free, but after all, you go home in the
evenings as well, don’t you, so I c a n ’t see any good reason why
you should not do whatever you wish, but please remember the rul<
is no discussion with anybody about the case.     It is very
difficult, but you must follow it, particularly in a building
like this where you can see there are quite a lot of people here
I have met quite a lot of these people and I still d on’t
recognise most of them, and so it is very easy if you start
talking to strangers you may find you are talking to people who
you in no circumstances you should have opened your mouth to. S<
don’t talk to anybody. So will you please do that for me?

     If you find I am going on for too long, because we won’t be
rising quite as frequently as we did at the Medico Legal Centre
because it is slightly different now, but if you think I am goin;
on too long you are near enough now to attract my attention and
to say, "Can we stop and have a cup of coffee” , or something, an*
of course, if any of you need to stop because you are not feelini
well or because you were indisposed in some way then obviously
    ®us-t    me know, it is exceedingly important that you are
all here, because if we are not we have to stop. We have no
control over our lives completely, but unless there is a really
compelling reason why you cannot be here please be here. It doe.
not actually inconvenience me, because if I am not here I am
doing something else, but it inconveniences everybody else,
because we would have to adjourn it until we are back again, so
to speak, as a group

     I think that is all I need to say on domestic matters.* May
I ask, were any of you in Court this morning, because somebody
suggested that you were? None of you were in Court? That is
good, because we did not want you in Court. That is right, none
of you, members of the Jury, were in Court in the morning? That
is important, because if we have legal submissions and I ask you
to go out you must stay out. It may be when it isall over and
we have finished I will explain to you why we do that, but I
don't think I will do it now because we have not got much time,
and it can wait, I am sure.

     I am not going to tell you the potential verdicts which you
will have to consider because we    are going to heartheevidence,
and when we have heard the evidence I am going to sum it up,
hopefully, and I will direct you with regard to the law and
anything else I need to tell you, and then you will retire and
takeTyour time and so o n .

     I do want to draw one or two rules to your attention,
because it is exceedingly important that you should understand i
now and that everybody else should understand it. This is not
actually a rule but it is a general point. We are doing
Inquests. There are 95 of them but we are doing then together.
This is not a trial. Nobody is accused of anything in my Court.
It is not a Public Inquiry, so we don't roam beyond my brief.   I
is not adversarial in the sense that the parties can introduce
their own witnesses and put them up to me to listen to and then
make a judgment.  I introduce the witnesses. That is not to say
that if parties want to draw my attention to a particular witnes
or witnesses whom they would like me to consider, they can do
that and have done because a lot of water has flowed under the
bridge since we last met, but in the final analysis it is my
decision whom we call, rightly or wrongly, and it is an
inquisition.

     The next thing to understand, and this is very, very
important, is that this is an inquisition not on behalf of the
relatives, not on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police, not on
behalf of the club, not on behalf of Eastwoods, not on behalf of
the supporters generally,   it is an Inquiry by me, and if you
like because I am called Her Majesty's Coroner you may take it i*
is on behalf of the State or Her Majesty the Queen. So it is
important to understand that, and I have to keep on reminding
myself of this as well, because otherwise we get misled into
thinking we are doing this for others, and of course you realise
and I am conscious and so are you and everyone else, of the
families, so it is important that the evidence which we call
should seek to be intelligible and relevant and answers as far aj
one can some of the things which concern and worry them. It is
very important to know that'this is not done because they are
bereaved people.   It is because somebody has died and the Act
says that when that happens the Coroner should hold an
inquisition either on his own or with a jury. Well, we are with
a jury, of course.

     I have already indicated to you the overall limitations of
an Inquest, so i am not going to repeat that, but there is
another very important corollary to this, and that is Rule 22.
am going to read this rule to you because you have got to
understand it, because it may be relevant at some point. It
won’t be relevant today, but I want to get it right at this
stage. What it says is:

          ” (i) No witness at an Inquest shall be obliged to
          answer any question tending to incriminate himself.

          (2) Where it appears to the Coroner that the witness
          has been asked such a question the Coroner shall infori
          the witness that he may refuse to answer’’.

Now, this is a fundamental principle of Coronal Inquisitions, an«
it may well be a fundamental principle in a load of other courts
but I am not interested in what happens elsewhere. I am
interested here. An important thing to understand is that if
somebody exercises their right it is a right,  it is not that
         °r     not* They have a right jnot to answer questions
which may incriminate them. You must not draw inferences from
the exercise of their rights.
   ✓
      That does not mean to say that you may not hear evidence
from other people which may tend to incriminate them. That is
not the point, but you cannot expect somebody to stand up and
say, ”1 did it” . It happens in TV series, but it does not happer
generally speaking in real life, but it is part and parcel of the
overall structure of Coronal jurisdiction, and it is designed (a)
to protect the individual or individuals who may be involved, anc
Ct>) to ensure that if it were to be that some other proceedings
were to take place in some other court we have not muddied the
water.

                         /So there is actually a dual.
    ' MRS. McBRIEN:  S i r , and members o f the J u r y , I am

behalf of the Ambulance Service.

     MISS ADDELMANN:   My name is Andrea Addelmann of
Counsel.   I am instructed by Russell, Jones and Walker
and I represent the Police Federation.

     MR. RUSSELL:   I am Christopher Russell.   I am a
barrister.   I am instructed by solicitors called Barlow,
Lyde and Gilbert and I represent the interests of
Superintendent Greenwood*

      THE CORONER:  You might ask, having told you all
about this inquisitorial system and how I do it all:
what are they doing here?   The answer is that the rules
which I have already referred to permit interested
parties to be present, obviously.   The rules permit them
to ask questions which is why Mrs. McBrien is there, and
the rules also provide that people can be represented by
their legal representatives and that is why they are
here.

       Of course, if it Is correct and opportune they will
ask questions of the witnesses and within the limits
which I have outlined to you they will be permitted to do
■ so.' /             ■                       ■       .

     Now without any further ado, all Iwill say is that :
these inquests are concerned with a disaster which
happened at a football stadium known as Hillsborough
Football Stadium, on the 15th of April, 1990.  You will
learn as we go along nore details about it.

     Now I think the first thing is we will call Steven
Brown.

   enclosure 4.

Q. It is just an overview. - A. This photograph shows the
   perimeter fences separating the terraces from the pitch.

Q* (C.269)•    The people on that photograph had nothing to
   do with it.    It just happens that they were there. - A.
   This shows the top of those fences where the wire bends
   inwards towards the enclosures.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   Sir, have you a photograph of the
area past gate C, the no man's land area, where people
were not supposed to go but they went for safety reasons,
I think?   Have you any photographs where they could have
gone in that passageway?

     THE CORONER:   I know what Mrs. McBrien is after.
We will have a look and see whether we have got a
photograph of that area.   It is in fact on the aerial
shots if you look.   We will see whether we have got one
which might show that area for you.

     MRS. McBRIEN:    Thank you, sir.

     THE CORONER:   Thank you, Officer.   PC Brown will
be back probably tomorrow morning with the videos.

     Next Michael Layton if he is here.    You are sworn
actually, Mr. Layton so you don't need to be sworn again.

     Ladies and gentlemen, witnesses who have already
been sworn I can see no advantage in re-swearing. Are
you happy with that or did you wish to hear him sworn?
I cannot see any point in it.

  number of agencies.   This material which varied both in
  content, quality of picture and evidential value was
  viewed by members of the team, copied and scheduled.
  Each film and photograph were given a unique reference
  number.   The schedules prepared were in themselves a
  precis of the events shown on film.

  Ultimately, sir, a composite film was prepared in
  conjunction with the Treasury Solicitor's Department,
  which was shown at Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.   This
  film was designed to show what was felt to be the most
  important scenes and sequence of events.

   Sir, that film was given the reference number MRE.2.

Q. Is that the one that I... - A. That is the composite
   film, sir.

Q. The compilation? - A. The compilation, sir, yes.

Q. I think it is right • you have said it but I just want
    you to confirm it - this wasn't prepared solely by the
    West Midlands, it was done in conjunction with the
    Treasury Solicitors? - A. That is absolutely correct,
  •.sir.                                              **     «



Q. They had. somebody there who was looking? - A . Physically
   present, yes, sir.

   Likewise photographic material was obtained from various
   sources which was examined and scheduled in the same
   manner*   Continuity in respect of *11 this material is
   not necessarily complete since the person handing over
   the material to the police is not necessarily the person
   originating that material.




               In an effort to analyse...
                                                                   65

«n aJ? e^ or^   analyse the contents of the visual evidence
for the purposes of the Inquest some of the material has
been grouped into a number of key areas. As such the
sequence'Of events as referred to here in this statement do
not run m strictly chronological form, rather it deals
with a number of specific points.

   First of all, sir, having regard to the movements of
people at the Leppings Lane end of the ground I can make
the following observations with regard to the visual
evidence. On a video film reference TB2 which was filmed
on the South Yorkshire Police CCTV system using an operator
set database, in other words, this shows the date and time
on which the film was recorded, this camera has pan
facilities.

   It should be noted that videos RJH1 and RJH2 have no
such time clock and these relate to Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club*S'own video system. In order to try to
establish the times of events shown on these tapes a
comparison was made from events that occurred on the RJH2
tape which are also shown on the video referenced TB2 taken
from almost identical positions and which show almost                   ^
identical footage.

___To ke sPefi.fic at 14:47:38 hours on the tape referenced
TB2 a youth^is seen to jump from the roof of Turnstiles A
          *** concourse area. This same scene can be seen
on the tape referenced RJH2. On the tape referenced TB2
again at 14:52:30 hours a youth is seen standing a g a i n s t a
wall near to Gate C with his arm raised and an identical
scene is shown on the tape reference RJH2. The timings of
other events as they appear on RJH2 can then be calculated
using what is called a real time counter on a video player
from either side of these fixed points.

   THE CORONER:   Just pause for a minute.
Have you understood what he is saying?

Q. What you are saying is that two of these tapes did not
have a time clock on them? - A. That is right, yes.

Q. An operator one?    -   A.   Yes, that is right.

Q. Then you try to match scenes which were identical and
   once you had got a time for that scene'you could
   calculate backwards and forwards? - A. Yes, that
   is right, sir, using a real time counter.

Q. “Please carry on? - A. By using this method of
    calculation it is estimated that the tape, referenced
                                                                  M LAYTON
     RJH2, would have been switched on at about 12:56
     hours. The same will apply for all the tapes given
     the reference RJH because I understand they were all
     switched on at the same time by PC 1421 Guest of the
     South Yorkshire Police who I believe has since
     retired.

         On a video tape referenced TB2 at 12:00:48 hours,
     supporters are shown arriving in a slow trickle and
     entering the ground at the Leppings Lane end. At
     13:40 hours on the same video a steady flow of
     supporters are- seen entering the ground and at
     13:56:33 hours on the same tape the volume of
     supporters has increased. At 14:35:30 hours there is
     a very dense crowd in the courtyard and the perimeter
     gate area. A view of the courtyard is also shown on
     the BBC tape which has been given the reference
     number Map 9. This is a digital reference of 0602
     and the estimated time of that is at 14:35 hours.

Q. Can you just pause there for a moment?          -   A.       Yes.

,.       CORONER: Members of the Jury, are you happy with
       1 just wanted to be sure that we know what we are
talking about.

Q. I want to turn to the digital reference now?             -    A
   Yes, sir.

Q. The advantage of having the digital r e f e r e n c e i s t h a t
   you can find the frame, the scene on the tape,:but i t '
     does not tell you anything about times, is that
  ■ right? ■
A. At a period of time which in fact i have covered at
    the bottom of this page but it does not show an
    actual time.

Q*         on? - a . Again on Map 9, digital reference
     0842 a crowd is gathered in the Leppings Lane end and
     the courtyard is full. At a digital reference of
     0906 Superintendent Marshall is shown amongst the
     crowd. At a digital reference of 1034 youths are
     shown climbing over a metal ribbed gate on to the
     ???£ of Turnstile 16. Between a digital reference of
     1212 and 1239 Superintendent Marshall is shown
     outside the gates in Leppings Lane, the whole area of
     which is heavily congested. With regard to the tape
     reference Map 9, as I have said, there is an operator
     set digital database on the film. In the initial
     stages only an estimated time can be worked out on
     the basis that the BBC cameraman, Ian Young, states
                                                         67




                                                  M LAYTON

that filming took place outside the ground at the
Leppings Lane end between 14:35 hours and 14:50 hours
and indeed there are also apparent breaks in the
filming. In respect of subsequent filming inside the
ground it is accurately timed and time based between
15:03:30 and 15:16:58.


    On a video tape referenced RJH2 at an estimated
time of 14:46 hours a number of youths are seen to
climb on to the roofs of Turnstiles A to G from
outside prior to dropping into the stadium. On a
video tape TB2 at 14:55:21, supporters are shown in
the concourse area moving towards the tunnel. A
number of these changed direction towards a gap in
the wall which gives access to the north side of the
ground.

    On video tape RJH2 which gives an estimated time
of 15:05 hours, the turnstile area and outside
courtyards are clear of incoming supporters. An
Officer in a flat cap and two Police Constables are
seen to run from outside Gate C along the
drive towards the south stand. Seconds afterwards a
Police Constable runs through Gate C towards the west
stand closely followed from all the Officers in the
turnstile area.

    Sir, in respect of vehicle movement at  14:08s20
hours on a video tape reference TB1, a South       '
Yorkshire Police video,traffic flowed quite freely -     ■    V
and continued to do so until 14 s33:08 where it can be
seen that no traffic is able to flow due to
pedestrian congestion in Leppings Lane. At 14:33:27
on the tape TB1 a bus and two cars are seen moving
slowly through the crowd in the roadway.

     At 14:35:56 hours on TB2 another bus moves
through the crowd and at 14:36:24 a car. At 14:41:15
a coach moves through the crowd and at 14:45:01 what
looks like a white roofed vehicle is seen arriving in
Leppings Lane immediately behind a bus from the
direction of Penistone Road. At 14:45:03 this bus
passes another one coining in the opposite direction
but the white roofed vehicle remains stationary in
the crowd. Sir, from research of the 'written
evidence I believe in fact this vehicle was a Police
Landrover being driven by PC 1863 Buxton of the South
Yorkshire Police.

       THE CORONER:   He will be called in due course.
                                                                                     M LAYTON


Q. Please continue. - a . No further vehicles apart
   from this one are seen until at 14:55:35 hours a bus
   and a car are seen and a further vehicle at 14:57:25
   hours. These latter two vehicles come to a halt in
   Leppings Lane and remain stationary. In the tape
   RJH2 the vehicle believed to be the Police Landrover
   drove through the courtyard area passed Gate C on the
   perimeter drive at an estimated time of 15:06:49
   hours.

         In relation to the perimeter gate which
    separates the turnstile area from Leppings Lane I can
    make the following observation with regard to the
    visual evidence. At 14:35:22 hours on a video tape
    referenced TB2 the perimeter gates are open giving
    access to turnstiles and the area near to Gate C.

Q. Can you point to which perimeter gates we are talking
   about on the screen? Can you find the overhead and
   put that up too? - A. Yes.       At 14:40:26 hours on
   the same video all the perimeter gates appear closed.
   At 14:52: 57 on TB2 people can be seen to be climbing *
   over the closed perimeter gates. At 14:53:40 hours
   this second gate from the left as you look at the
    sinc r efront
             e n o p of
                     e n s Turnstiles

Q* * realise this is not the video you are referring to
   as this is a still but is that the gate we are • •                       ,<
   t a l k i n g a b o u t c a n y o u rem en b er? - A. Y e s , lo o k in g -
   at it from the opposite direction the video camera is
  ■ there.                -

Q. Prom the inside out and so it is the one that is on
   the right on this photograph? - A. That is right,
   sir, yes.                            v

Q. You heard the question from Mrs. McBrien about the
   sterile area, is that the area where the van is
   parked? - A. I believe it is slightly further in
   than where the van is parked.

Q. Further in towards the ground are you saying? - A.
   (.to the Court Officer) if you could just perhaps
   indicate Gate C for me I believe t h a t ‘the sterile
   area was more or less to the far side of that gate.

                HALE:         It is clear on the model, sir.
                                                  M LAYTON

     THE CORONER:   Could you please continue? I am
sorry to have interrupted you. - A. At 14:53:44
hours the left hand perimeter gates are open. At
14:55:17 hours the right hand perimeter gates can be
seen open. At 14:56:32 hours the area in front of A
to G up to the perimeter gates appear clearer and
Police Officers can be seen holding the crowd back to
the roadside of the perimeter gates. At 15:02:11
hours there is a close up view of the perimeter gate
area which shows that they are open and relatively
clear with supporters entering the ground.

     Four photographs taken by Michael Warburton Lee
of the'South Yorkshire Police show some damage to a
retaining bolt of the second set of perimeter gates
as you look from the groundside towards Leppings
Lane. These photographs are referenced as DPP190.
There is no acetate available at the moment for you
to view.

     In respect of visual evidence relating to
mounted Officers at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground the video tapes that cover this area are South -
Yorkshire Police CCTV and on tape referenced TB2,
also Sheffield Wednesday Football Club’s CCTV on a
tape referenced RJH2 and a BBC TV outside broadcast
on a tape referenced Map 9.

      At a digital reference of 0602, estimated time
 14:35 on video Map 9v t w mounted Officers can be
 seen directly in front of Turnstiles A
.Gate P.
                                       to  G near to
                                                   -o-v

Pause again. Have we got the acetate plan of the
ground and if so put it up please? Carry on reading
but start again with Mmounted Officers*1? - A. At a
digital reference of 0602, estimated time 14:35 on
video Map 9, two mounted Officers can be seen
directly in front of Turnstiles A to G near to Gate
B. At 14:35:22 hours on video reference TB2 two
mounted Officers can be seen apparently talking to
supporters in front of Turnstiles A to G.

      Between digital references 0839 to 0847 on a
 video Map 9, nine mounted Officers can be seen in the
courtyard area from the outer perimeter gates to the
 Turnstiles A to G. At 14:38:08 on video reference
 TB2 a mounted Officer can be seen attempting to ease
 the crowd back from Turnstiles and Gate C. At an
"estimated time of 14:48:23 on video reference RJH2 a
mounted Officer can be seen blocking the entry of
                                                            70




                                                   M LAYTON
supporters through Gate C. This can also be seen at
14:48:26 hours on vide reference TB2.

     At 14:49 hours on video referenced TB2 a mounted
officer can be seen outside Gate C controlling the
crowd. At 14:51:50 hours four mounted Officers can
be seen outside Gate C. At 14:53 hours four mounted
Officers can be seen controlling the crowd in the
area of Gate C. At 14:53:32 hours two mounted
Officers can be seen supervising the flow of
supporters through Gate C.

     In order to try and analyse the visual evidence
available in respect of the opening of the concertina
gates referred to as A, B and C, it is necessary to
      ^ three video tapes. Video tapes referenced
RJH2 and RJHl are black and white video, of poor
quality and with no sound. RJH2 refers to a fixed
site camera which overlooks the rear of Turnstiles A
to G and the concourse area. RJHl is also part of
the system and covers the area of Gate A and the
concourse area. The particular reference to the
concertina Gate C, sir, it is apparent, from visual %.,■
evidence on the day in question it was regularly
being used as an entrance and exit point for a number
of reasons i.e. the ejection of supports and the
movement of Police personnel.

     Being more specific on a tape referenced TB2
timed at 14:39:31 hours a boy is carried through Gate
      ?   e Officers. The gate appears to be closed        ' ;
at 14:40:45 hours. On * video tape referenced RJH2
with an estimated time of 14:48:04 hours Gate C was
opened to eject a support.

Sir, during thr course of the preliminary inquests I

bel;even that        deceasad were either alive or dead or
 ••oth in Enclosures 3 and 4. Plans were produced in
respect of individual deceased* Subsequently composite
 •1-tns were prepared of some of these locations, based
on my evidenc , by Miss Davn Goodall, senior plan
d.-awer of the West Hi-- -lands Police.  Because of t ie
pr'.olens associate^ wit a tr**i g to put all locations of
  eceased on t iese two >1ans» tney actually only show
the las* position established alive and th* first
wiere believed • eceased.

Sir, I pro !uce a composite plan ref renced DRG9 in
res _ct of t'ie 1 nation of the posi tions of deceased .
alive, and a composite plan refere .ced D.vGlO where they
were bej ieved to be eceased in the enclosures. Sir,
thire are over eads aval:able of the se two plans.

                                           M. LAYTON


Sir, there are overheads available of these two plans. There
is one point which I need to raise in respect of one of the
plans, sir. Since the limited Inquests, Mrs. Traynor. mother
of two of the deceased, has viewed visual evidence again. At
the limited Inquest a plan was produced which showed
Christopher in enclosure No. 3 at 14:45, and that location is
reproduced on the plan DRG.9. Since that time Mrs. Traynor
  s *ound Christopher alive at 14:45 outside the ground. So
in fact I would ask you to disregard the one location in
relation to the deceased No. 60 as shown on that plan.

What time was he shown on the plan? Would you repeat the
time? - A. 14:52 outside the ground, sir, and 14:45 was the
original identification by Mrs. Traynor inside the ground.

So what you are saying is Mrs. Traynor has now reidentified
him but alive at an earlier time than she originally thought?
- A. In fact alive at a later time. So in fact, the point I
am making is on the plan DRG.9 we should disregard the
location shown for that particular location.

We will deal with this again.

     THE CORONER:   This, Mr. King, is a typical example of
the corrections one would wish to make with regard to the
summaries.  I did not know what Inspector Layton has just tol<
me, but it is clear it needs amendment, and obviously we woulc
want to get that right.

       THE WITNESS:   I can tell you the original plan which
was produced at the limited Inquest was given the reference
No. C.140.

  THE CORONER:   Before you put that up can we number that
plan of the ground c.274, The plan of the ground is c.2 7 4 .
Can you put the next one up:

Inspector Layton, which one Is this? - a . If we go
chronologically as far as the statement is concerned it shoult
be the other way round. I do n ’t think it matters as such*

You mean the deceased first? - A. I am sorry, is this the
first one, sir? This is the deceased alive.

I think we will have the people alive first. - A. This plan
is DRG.9.

That is C.275. These are the people last seen alive as far a:
you can establish based upon the evidence which you gave at
the interim Inquests? - A. That is correct, sir, and it is
this plan which bears the identification which I have just
referred to in respect of Christopher Traynor.

I-'don’t suppose you know where he is? -   a   . It is to the top
just near to the top.   (Indicated on

Can we get Miss Goodhall to delete it? - A. We can do, sir.

      KSw tVey were c °Piecl the copies were viewed and a
    schedule, which is a precis of events shown on the film
    was prepared.   From that schedule really the continual
    process then was, as part of our brief, to try to locate
    the deceased either outside or inside the ground, and as
    part of that process we were continually viewing.

 Q. To see what events were occurring, any incidents that occurre
    and the like? - a . Primarily our brief was, having scheduled
    tne tapes, to locate the deceased for the Inquests.   There
    were other specific areas which were dealt with as the inquir
    progressed, but because of our brief to locate deceased it wa
    a continuing
    a            nrnracc
      continuing process,                                         a

 Q. But as you were saying, as well as doing that you would see -
    when I say ”you" _ you and your team WOuld see different
    incidents taking place on virtually each and every occasion
    you were^looking at the tape? - A. That is right. One scene
    on one video could show numerous people.

Q. As opposed to, for example, someone who was looking at that
                 and £arcel of the events of the day which would
   be quite different? - a . I am not sure I follow you.

              i ? ? i c a t e exactly what I mean. We have on the one hand
    r o n c e Officers for the purposes of Lord Justice Taylor’s
    Inquiry and for the purposes of this Inquest looking over and
    over.and over again videos taken of for example a certain
    section of the ground, whether it be outside or inside, and
: v           s 5*ethin* different perhaps or something else in
    addition? - a . Yes.

Q * ?n each viewing, and then we have an individual who may be
    looking at the Leppings Lane end for a fraction of a second as
    ?hlL°f          s events? - A. Yes, I accept your point.
           ?    difference between our trief, which was to view the
    videos to either obtain evidence or to schedule them so as to
    become a sequence of events as to what to what took place,
    there is a difference between that and purely viewing it
    perhaps on a monitor,

                    fr °? your point of view repeated lookings at,
   M                inele« ant Phrase, in order to get a complete
   ■SiSIUr       Df pending on Mhat we were seeking to establish.
   Certainly in relation to the deceased, yes.

Q. Thank you very much.

                      C r o s s - E x amined bv MR. k i n g -

Q. Arising out of that last question, if one is looking for
   precise details, a particular individual, you need to look at
   ajrideo over and over again? - A. Exactly, yes, sir
Q. If you are looking for a general impression, a build up of
   fans, emptiness of a pen, the fullness of a pen, the first
   time is sufficient for that, is not it? - a . Yes, sir.

       A.   Yes, if you     can just bear with me a second, please,
     you want the whole     section again?

Q.   The wording you used? - A. Page 10. I think, sir.      On a v
     tape reference RJH.2 at an estimated time of 1 4 :4 8 :0 4 , Ga
     was opened to eject a supporter.  Is that the bit?

Q. Yes. - A. Do you want me to go further?

Q. Yes, just a little. - A. At this stage a large number of
   supporters rushed through the gate into the concourse are;

Q. Yes. thank you.    It is the part that they rushed in, and :
   was established at the preliminary Inquest that the fans v
   actually allowed in at that time, as Police Officers therf
   mistakenly thought that Gate c had been opened in response
   Superintendent M a r s h a l l ’s request.

          THE CORONER:      Mrs. McBrien,     I will phrase your quest
     for you:

Q. Mrs. McBrien is asking you whether this was the incident c
   the timing as far as you can establish from the video
   evidence, where the gate was opened as a result of an orde
   opposed to not? - a . No, that is not that particular openi
   of the gate, not the one you refer to.

o.            MRS. McBRIEN:       The transcript of Superintendent
     M a r s h a l l ’s evidence at the Taylor Inquiry.___

          THE CORONER:      Mrs. McBrien,    I am sorry:

Q.   Inspector Layton, read the whole section through again, or
     you like specify the openings, because it may assist you.

          THE CORONER:      I think you may have your timings wron

          MRS. McBRIEN:   We brought this point out at the
     Preliminary Inquest, and it was altered in the Preliminary
     Inquest,  it was altered to ’’a l l o w e d " , "they were allowed"
     "They were allowed in".

          THE WITNESS:    The timing you are referring to is the
     occasion on which a person was ejected from the concourse
     ®rea via G ate C and out.  Certainly it Is apparent when yc
     view the video, and that is why I have differentiated with
     xt were, the official opening when people walked through,
     is certainly apparent on the video for this earlier openin
     they did not go in in the.same fashion.

          THE CORONER:   This was at 15:52, was not it?          So 14:
     was one opening? - A. That is right, sir.
                                                                   81 A

                                                  M. LAYTON



Q. What time was it closed then? - A. At 14:48:31.
      /



Q. How long was it open?   It was only open for 27 seconds?          -    a

   That is right, sir, yes.

Q. And then it was reopened at 14:52.         Is that right? - a     That
   is right, sir.

Q. And then it stayed open for how long? - A. At 14:57:40 the
   gate is shown closed.

Q. That is about 5 minutes? - A. Yes.         We are talking about two
   distinct openings there.

Q.         MRS. M c B R I E N : I was firmly under the impression that
     fans were encouraged through that gate at that particular
     time.

           THE CORONER:     We will be hearing evidence.     Inspector
     Layton has told you what he has seen on the visual evidence.
     He c a n ’t say any more than that.  It may be - it may be;     I
     say no more - that some of the other witnesses might be able
     to give you some more help on this.     I d o n ’t think Inspector
     Layton can.

          MRS. McBRIEN:      Thank you very much.

          THE CORONER:   When you say, Mrs. McBrien, there was a
     correction made at the interim Inquest, are you talking about
     the interim Inquest relating to your son?

          MRS. McBRIEN:      Yes.

               THE CORONER:      I will have a look at it.  I will check it
     and see what is actually said, but not now because I have not
     got it here.        A n y other questions arising out of Inspector
     L a y t o n ’s evidence?

          Tomorrow we will give you a copy of the abbreviated
     schedule, and I think everybody will find it is a lot easier
     once we have that to look at:

Q ' *ns Pector Layton, as always I am exceedingly grateful to you.
    Thank you for your help.    The only thing I would ask you is ij
    you could arrange to have that plan redrawn with the
    amendments, and also let me have a short statement regarding
    this matter, and we will either deal with it by way of
    documentary evidence or I will have to bring you back,
    depending on what I think.    It is a point that has got to be
    corrected. - A . . I think P.C. Brown should be able to assist,


          THE CORONER:      Ladies and gentlemen, we are aiming
     timewise to start at 10, rise about quarter-to-1, 1 o ’clock.
     Obviously we c a n ’t be absolutely sure.  We know that from

                 (In the absence of the jury)

     THE CORONER:    Yes, Mr. Isaacs?

     MR. ISAACS:   Sir, before ray learned friend Mr. King
makes such submissions he wishes to make in relation to the
submission that I made this morning, may I just take this
opportunity to draw to your attention the city late edition
of The Star.   If I hand my copy in - you, sir, have not had
the benefit of going out to the local news vendors.    If I
could be handed■another copy.

     First of all I would ask you to read it. First of all
against the background of the submission that I made this
morning my argument is this that nothing could be more
designed to add fuel to the submission I made than what,
sir, you will now read.

     THE CORONER:     Well, Mr. Isaacs, I have to agree with
you   that it was anunwise - if the quotation is correct and,
of course, I can’t say whether it is or.whether it isn't, I
think it was an unwise comment, bearing in mind that w6 are
sub judice here and it is a natter for this court, or my
jury, if you like, to take decisions on what will happen.

     MR. ISAACS:    Sir, that is another aspect of the matter
which perhaps I can refer to in a moment and which I ltnow t « ®
others will refer to and that A s _the question aa to whether
The Star, rightly or wrongly, have been party to an attempt
to influence the jury to bring in a certain verdict.     That
is certainly one aspect of the matter.

     T h e w o u l d seek to address you upon in relation
to the contents of this article is this, that clearly,
however you see these inquests, and, of course, you are in
control, those who represent...   I put it another way. The
families quite clearly see these inquests as an evidence
gathering exercise in order to produce fresh evidence which
will, they hope, enable them to persuade or enable the
Director to take the view that criminal charges should be
preferred.

     In my submission, so far as Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield is concerned he should not be put in a position
- should not even be put into the witness box where he could
be put in a position where, by asking him questions which
would then be disallowed, then be disallowed, then be
disallowed in the manner that I referred to this morning, so
as to increase the possibility, probability, what you will,
of the jury returning a verdict of unlawful killing.

     In my submission, sir, this article and the contents of
it do add a great deal of fuel to the submission I made and
                                                                                           84

          Discipline Regulations 1985, that constitute those
          disciplinary proceedings.   Perhaps I could invite you
          briefly to consider the nature of the complaints that have
          been made against Superintendent Greenwood because in my
          submission'they show that the wider the scope of the offence
          the more difficult it is to conceive questions the answers
          to which will not tend to incriminate Superintendent
          Greenwood or anyone else in a similar position.

           The allegations of complaint come from two
      complainants, both of whom I note from the contents of
      letters and other documents put before you this morning, are
      represented by my learned friend Mr. King.   Mr. Jones -
      Leslie Jones - the father of Richard Jones, makes four
      allegations which constitute his complaint against
      Superintendent Greenwood and 1 say at the outset these are
      allegations which are, and will be, refuted by
      Superintendent Greenwood:

              "A. You failed to carry out your assigned duty by '
%/'
W             placing yourself in a position by the players tunnel.
              Using your radio and your eyes you should have been
              aware of the dangerous situation and controlled your
              officers accordingly.

              B. You failed to give instructions to your officers to
 \            monitor the pens for over-crowding in relation to the
 Vi           crowd safety at your briefings*                  v;v:r-v.-#*
 I

              C. You were totally ineffective in mounting a rescue.
              That is, you made no attempt to organise the police
              officers in a way which would have helped to bring
              about a successful rescue operation.

              O. You failed to send officers to the rear of pens 3
              and 4 to relieve pressure when you were in control of
              the area.   This was when you knew that gate C was
              being opened to allow supporters in."

           Sir, Hr. Trevor Hicks, who also instructs my learned
      friend Mr. King, is the other complainant.   He nakes three,
      perhaps broader, allegations in his complaint:

               ”1. You failed to prevent a dangerous build-up of
      |       supporters outside the gates.

      I       2. You failed to control the movement ofsupporters
               subsequent to the opening of gate C..

     >/       3. You failed to respond to the developing   tragedy and *
      /       were slow to effect a rescue operation."

           I say again the totality of each of those allegations
      is refuted, but they do serve to show the wide nature of the
                                                         86




position of Superintendent Greenwood and the way in which
his position will have to be protected should he give
evidence.   I just invite you to consider the prejudicial
effect that the constant challenging of questions asked and
the jury being told that the officer need not answer them,
lf matters are dealt with on a question at a time basis.

     Alternatively, if there is dispute about whether the
answer to a particular question might tend to incriminate
Superintendent Greenwood when such argument, if there is to
be such argument, takes place in the absence of the jury,
the effect and the impression that that will have upon the
members of the jury.

     £n t!u>se circumstances I invite you to adopt the course
that has been suggested by Mr. Isaacs, that these officers,
certainly Superintendent Greenwood, should not be asked to
give evidence at all because of the prejudicial effect of
having to deal with each question on its merits and in
circumstances where it is difficult to conceive any question
which will not produce that response.




                  MR. KING:    Sir, the families*..
                                                                                            87




     tPHE CORONER:            Yes, Mr. King.

    MR. KING:   The families would have liked each of the
 senior Officers to have come to give evidence here
 voluntarily. That is what they would have liked. Thev would
 have wished that the truth of the events which led to these
 deaths could have come from their lips voluntarily so that
 the Jury could hear it. The families are mindful of the law
 as much as anybody else and I have advised them what the law
 is. They know and appreciate that it is within the right of
 any of those senior Officers that if any question is asked
 tending to incriminate that he can refuse to give it. To
 this extent they are in a dilemma because what they want and
 have always wanted, is for this Jury to hear the whole of the
 facts. It would be a very unreal world which this Jury would
 be living in if they did not hear in some way from the
 Officers playerS in        events, by which I mean the senior

      One could make trite examples. The one going through my
 m m d was hearing Julius Caesar but we did not hear from
 Brutus and the whole of the Senate. That is not meant to be
 trivial because these are vital witnesses.

                    RePort’;and the_whole of the transcripts
should be before the Jury. Indeed, they would wish they
would go there without agreement but again they accept
advice, as they must, that that is not possible without
agreement. If my learned friend on behalf of Mr.Duckenfield
is saying to this Inquiry he will agree and consent to the V
whole of the transcript of Mr* Duckenfield*s evidence being
read out aloud to the Jury so that they can hear it and
assess it then that in fact from the families’ point of view,
much as they would like Mr. Duckenfield in the witness bSx ?i
be cross-examined, will be far better in the effort they
generally have, not in making noises to the outside world- in
bringing the facts to the attention of this Jury.

  ...      ^ that is the position, then much as they would
 JP®       Duckenfield here, and much as I would say to you
 that he ought to come into the witness box and be heard to
 s a Y* I will not answer", if there is that alternative
 genuinely being put forward, then I would say on behalf of
 the families I represent that that is a course which is, in
'• J® 5 preferable as the lesser of two evils from their point
 of view. I say that not in any way reflecting on the right
 of Mr. Duckenfield to take the stance he has but from the

   fCR. ISAACS:  There are two ways of looking at it, with
respect. First of all, it can be edited by agreement and
indeed on your direction because you will have read his
evidence that he gave some time ago now to Lord Justice
Taylor's Inquiry. Alternatively it can go before the Jury
and you can give directions as to those parts which are
germane to the Jury's task in this particular Inquiry. I
should point out, sir, that the offer I made was made on the
basis that he was not called. I think my learned friend
understood that and it was not in the way of holding a gun to
your head at all. it was a view to being helpful.

   THE CORONER:     Mr. Isaacs, may I ask you this because it
seems to me that it might be possible to achieve the best of
all worlds in this situation bearing in mind the point which
you have made and the acceptance of the issue? It is my
reluctance in a sense to make a ruling that we were not
calling him because I am a little bit reluctant, despite the
very persuasiveness of a lot of what you said to me, but it
seems to me that your client would not be in any particular
danger of prejudice if the solicitors, Mr. King in
particular, were to agree that if we were to put Mr.
Duckenfield in the witness box having either read his
transcript either jy^ toto or edited by agreement, that he
would agree not to pursue questions which clearly were '
incriminatory because that would then give the advantage of
having M r . Duckenfield here and yet without having the thing
which I perceive to be your main fear is that he will have to
answer hundreds of questions all of which he will answer by
saying, "I am not answering that question because it is
prejudicial". What do you feel about that?

   MR* ISAACS*   What will happen is this, let us say it is
my learned friend and he will ask a question which he
believes does not have the tendency to incriminate.
yourself or Mr. Duckenfield or myself will say, "We take the
view that it is". The Jury will go out. There will be some
legal argument. There will be some reference perhaps to some
parts of the evidence he has given. That matter having been
resolved the Jury will come back in. The next question will
be asked and exactly the same thing will happen. I can
foresee unfortunately that one will have a morning, a day,
two days or three days and after every question that is asked
the Jury will go out, there will be legal argument and so it
will go on.




                      /With respect, sir
                                                                    93




With respect, sir, that cannot be right, and however much
you, sir, would like to see him here, unfortunately the
very nature of the difficulty that he is in, and I stress
against tie incki>rojnd that he does not accept that he has
committed any wrong-doing, but that others may take a
different view, that in those circumstances, and I say
this advisedly, the compromise that seems to have been
accepted is one which should commend itself to you, and
overcome what I appreciate to be your natural reluctance
not to call, even to say, "What is your name?", a chief
player. Sir, that is th~ only way that I can put it, but
I do hope tnat perhaps Soth myself and Mr. King can manage
in the event to persuade you to take the course which is
now being put forward, ->oth of us no doubt for different
reasons but, having said that, reasons that are to each
other reasonably cogent.

        TH.. COiiONER:         Did you want, to say anything more, Mr.
King?

        HR. KING:        Wo.

     THE COtlOHER:             Did you want to say anything, Mrs.
McBrien?

     MRS. llcBRIEN:  I thin!; it would be useful to use the
transcripts from the Taylor Inquiry but we all know that
the Taylor Inquiry was never to blame anybody, it was a
different sort of inquiry to this one, but it would be
better than nothing, I think. Rather thanhave mothing at
all I would be happy with that.

     TH1Z CORONER:  You are going along with what^ is being
proposed as the West?

     MRS. McBRIEN:   Yes, but I really would prefer Mr*
Duckenfield to appear   in person so that Icould put
questions to him, not   in an incriminatory way, just to
speak to him.

      TH.-' COilONER: I think I ought to say that I know
Lord Justice Taylor said that he was not going to blame
anybody. In fact, it      is only fair to say that an inquest
is in exactly .tae same situation. We are not here to
blame people we are hore to enquire into how a decease'!
person died and, in fact, the rules I have already
referred to expressly say that you must -not give averdict
which in any way blames somebody, and I would follow that
ruling exceedingly strictly,, I can assure you of that* I
appreciate that you may «'ant to ask the questions as
geiTfly as possible but that is not, in fact; the issue.
The issue is not wnetner you are asking a question nicely
or nastily, but what is the content of the question, and
does it tend to increase the risk even by a little bit
that a person might be prosecuted. That is the point. It
i                                                                         94

               is *:ot now you ask t ;e question, wnich I an sure you -..ill
               do in a ladylike manner, but that is not really the issue.

           B         MRS. McBi’IEN:      I think that he would be able to give

                      TIIl COUOilEU: Yes, but Mrs. HcBrien, I thin'< it is
1              only fair to sav, as I have already indicated, it is, in
               fact, practic llv impossible to frane a question, to put
               \ 'e question where a person is in the position of Chief
               Su^erintvnd^nt Duckenfield, which is not incriminating.
1              It may aot be incriminating but it is almost impossible to
               frame it and the point is that he does not have to answer
               that question. Wnet-ier it is incriminatory or not, you
1              c-.inot dry.: a conclusion from it. If I ask a driver,
               "Were you doing 40 miles an Hour in a 30 miles an hour
               area?", h: can say, "This is an incriminatory question, I
               am .ct usswering it". You cannot i'raw the conclusion that
1              h   w:hs doing 40 miles an hour from that.  He might have
               been but ne might not. He might just not want to answer

I              t’\a que ;tion and there is no way of finding out, not in
               this Court, and that is tie difficulty in this situation.
               It is a difficulty' wuich is almost insoluble I think.

               differenc . \ o u would be a ver„* clever lady if you could
               thiiik of a question which actually gave you an answer*

                    MRS, McSSJEil:    I would not be recriminatory.

     t at will give u-' a slightly’ easier day on Wednesday, and


H
*.'e have ,>ut it up at the back actually. It is there.
That is where we are going to put the list. We intend to
 put tne list up at the b3 ck so that it is visible. *j

     So tne plan tomorrow is morning, videos, afternoon,
four witnesses whose names I can't quite remember at the
moment.

     MR. KI^G:   The four witnesses at the top of the list
for Wednesday, sir?

     Til ; COROilEH: Yes, I think so. Certainly three of
* em but we may have had to shift the fifth and the fourth
arou d. It is the top end of the Wednesday list.

      I just vant to check one other thing. You remember I
meitionei the transcript?; to you at the business meeting?
We have heird from three firms. One said they did not
w n t one, two said thsy did. Is that correct? It is no
use turning up tomorrow morning and saying, "Yes, I did
w <nt a transcript". As I explained to you, it is entirely
up to you. It does not make :*ny difference to me whether
you have thoa or no:.

        Dear Madam

        HILLSBOROUGH

        Thank you for your letter of the 5th February 199 0 addressed to
        the Director of Public Prosecutions. I have been asked to reply.

        Following receipt of your letter I have been in correspondence
        with the coroner, Dr Popper, and your request for information
        has been discussed in detail /with the Assistant Chief Constable
        Mr J Mervyn Jones. We have a great deal of sympathy with your
        request and I have recently received Counselâ€™s opinion on this
        unusual point.     I am sure you will understand that the
        prosecuting authorities are under a duty to ensure that they do
        not conduct themselves in such a way as to prejudice either the
        criminal investigation or any subsequent criminal proceedings.
        Generally, none of the information which is collected by criminal
        investigation is released until the later time either of a
        decision not to prosecute being reached or the conclusion of any
        criminal proceedings.

         However, I have considered the matter fully and whilst I am not
         prepared to disclose all the copies of the statements direct to
         you I feel- that your request can be dealt with by a more formal
         disclosure in the arena of the coroner's court. I have written
         to Dr Popper confirming that the inquests could be resumed to
         hear evidence on a restricted basis providing only that
         information requested by you relating to the movements on the
         15th April 1989 of those who died, evidence of identification and
         medical evidence of the cause of death.

I believe that the release of such evidence in this way will
satisfy your request and provide the necessary formal framework
for the release of that information. I have copied this letter
to Dr Popper and to Mr J Mervyn Jones.

Should you wish to discuss this letter please do not hesitate to
telephone Michael Kennedy in this office who is dealing with the
case.

Yours faithfully

Head of Police Complaints Division

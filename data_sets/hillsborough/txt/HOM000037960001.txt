      Dear Dr. Popper.

      At the mini inquests we attempted to ask a se rie s of questions concerning
      the^tfterm ath a t Hillsborough, we were l e f t with the impression t h a t the
      queflFons would be dealt with a t a l a t e r stage.

      However since then you have ruled th a t i t 1s not necessary to proceed a f te r
      15.15pm and i t now appears th a t our questions will not be addressed, you
      did say th at in an Ideal world everyone would have ended up in hospital and
      you suggested t h a t we were naive 1n thinking t h a t the medical response was
      Inadequate, th a t so rt of answer is not conducive to the fa c ts as shown in
      the video, and reports from Medical Personnel who were trying v a l i a n t l y to
      a s s i s t the injured.

      The video shows 1t took t i l l at l e a s t 15.35pm before all the c a s u a ltie s
      were removed from the pens, a f a i r l y lengthy delay which obviously did
      nothing to help t h e i r chances of survival.

      Reports and recommendations from the Medical Personnel (please find
      e n c ^ |e d ) c e rta in ly imply t h a t in t h e i r opinion, the response l e f t a l o t to
      be U l i re d .

      We also know of people who were removed 1n an unconscious s t a t e , a prime
      example being Mr. Edward S p e a rr itt who according to Mr. S p e a r r it t was not
      admitted to hospital until 17.00 hours and who subsequently recovered, th at
      i t was possible for people in the crush who suffered severe i n ju r y to
      survive with a reasonable amount of a fte rc a re .

      At the very l e a s t t h is r a is e s questions 1n the eyes of the fam ilies that
      the Inefficiency of the major Incident response could have contributed to
      the number of deaths occurring a t Hillsborough and therefo re we consider
      th a t t h i s should have been part of your enquiries into the reason for the
      deaths.

      You have promised to look into individual questions of concern, th e refo re
      i t would not take a great deal of your time to enquire into t h is m atter.



                                                                                                                    i

      We would suggest the two most q u a lifie d Medical Personnel namely Or. John
      Ashton and Or. Glynn P h illip s be c a lle d to give evidence a t your in q u e s ts ,,
      so they can be questioned as to t h e i r medical opinion of whether th e
      response contributed a t a l l to the amount of f a t a l i t i e s .

      We think you r e a l i s e the seriousness which we place on t h i s m atter, and we
      feel t h a t i f you f a il to address t h i s s i tu a t io n , t h a t t h is f a i l u r e w ill
      obviously form part of a case for ju d ic ia l revidw no matter what v e rd ic t i s
      reached.

     Trusting you w ill give t h is matter your earnest consideration.

                                            Yours sin c e re ly

          7<s
/%.             At 9.00 a.m.   on Saturday 15 April     1989,    I reported for duty at

 &■%            Barnsley Divisional Headquarters and subsequently travelled through

                to Hillsborough Football Ground.        I then attended in the main North

                Stand for the pre-match briefing and a short meal break I attended at

                the Leppings Lane Terrace,    together with Police Sergeant           1341

                Crawford and other officers from the Serial           (14).    We had a further

                briefing from Inspector White who instructed all              re-searching of fans

                and emergency procedures.



                At approximately 11.30 the serial moved to the enclosure at the rear

                of Leppings Lane Terrace directly behind turnstiles A-G.               Turnstiles

                A and B were already open at this stage the remaining were soon

                opened.    All were open by 11.45 a.m.          I was given responsibility,

                together with Police Constable 2819 McManus for turnstiles F and G.

                Arrangements were made with the turnstile operators that              if they were

                in difficulty they would bang on the window at the rear of their

                turnstile in order to call our attention.
                                                                     PAGE     2
                                                                     R 1 10

At approximately 12 noon the first of the Liverpool       fans began to

arrive.    They were few in number and in good spirits.      I had a clear

view through the turnstiles and could see officers outside searching

them as they arrived.     I did not search these fans as they had

already been searched.     However, we were then instructed by Inspector

White to search everyone    regardless whether they had been searched

before or not.



By 1.30 p.m.   the number of fans increased but was not excessive.

Most were searched,    a few complained about the number of times they

had been searched but they were still generally good humoured.        There

was still a good view through the turnstiles and it could be seen

that the area outside was still effectively clear.



At approximately 2.00 p.m.    the turnstile operator knocked on the

window to indicate a     problem, he told us that a fan was trying   to get

in without a ticket.      He came through the turnstile and was ejected

straight through the gate    *0* to our    left.



In the process of doing this Police Constable McManus and I were

surrounded by a number of his      friends who were abusing us and

indignantly claiming that he did have      a ticket.



This happened approximately a dozen times in the next twenty

minutes.    I saw some fans offering money to the operators     in order to

gain entry.    This was refused,   however and they left the turnstile

pea cefully.



By 2.30 p.m.   large numbers of Liverpool     supporters had arrived and

were pressed up to the trunstiles.        The view through the turnstile
                                                                            PAGE      3
                                                                            R 1 10

was no longer possible.     It quickly became apparent that the

searching of fans was no longer practical        or possible.    The priority

became giving entry to as many ticket holding fans as quickly and

safely as possible.     Fans without    tickets were still being ejected by

Police Constable 2819 McManus and myself.



Whilst attempting to eject one man through gate         'C ’ , the Steward on

the gate refused to open it because he feared that supporters would

rush in.     He was ordered to open the gate and the man was ejected

without significant    problems.



Pressure    continued to increase outside the turnstiles and fans were

becoming trapped within them as a result         causing more   problems.

Large numbers of fans entering the ground were under the influence of

alcohol some quite heavily.        It was   impossible to eject them though

due to pressure behind both turnstiles and Gate         ’C ’.



By 2.45 p.m.    it has become apparent that there were serious problems

outside.     Fans entering the ground were near to collapse.         Many did

fall down through exhaustion on gaining entry.          Some fans were

crying,    nearly all were extremely angry abusing us and shouting at me

to do something.     I was grabbed by one hysterical man in his late

twentys who shook me violently and screamed into my face.



"Listen you fucking bastard they're dying out there ~ kids.            W h e r e ’s

your fucking    radio do something -■ do something".



I was without a radio and continued to assist other fans.            One fan

became trapped in the turnstile with his jeans hooked on the

turnstile,    it was necessary to use a knife to cut him free.
                                                                           PAGE
                                                                           R "IIQ



By this stage all the officers within Serial          14 were being subjected

to abuse,   threats,   being pushed and jostled around.        No supervisory

officers, with the exception of Police Sergeant           1341 Crawford,   could

be seen.    As I looked around I could see only 10 or 12 officers

mainly Serial   14, attempting to control     large numbers of fans inside

the ground in the area immediately next to the turnstiles.            We were

heavily out-numbered at the point,       I believe,     of coming under serious

physical attack from very irrate and upset fans.           I have never been

more concerned for my own or my colleagues safety.



A number of fans had begun climbing over the wall           into the ground,

but again we were      powerless to stop this.    Turnstile    ’D ’ collapsed

and wnr inoperative?



After a period of what      can only be described as chaos, a Senior

officer shouted for the Gate       ’C ’ to be opened.



I assisted other officers to open the gate.           No objections were

voiced by the stewards on the gate.        The crowd surged through and

people at the front fell down.        They were trampled on by the crowd

who flooded through the gates,      screaming abuse at Police,      striking

out at officers as they charged in.        I could see many fans carrying

cans of beer as they forced their way through but it was impossible

to do anything about this.



After the main body of supporters had come through the gate,           I helped

force the gate shut.      During the surge,    I had been forced back

against the wall    of turnstile    ’G ’. I stayed there for my own safety.

Fans who had fallen were helped to their feet.            I would estimate that
                                                                                  PAGE      5
                                                                                  R 110

around 2,000 people had entered through the gate.                  Within a moment

the gate was opened for a second time and about 200/300 more fans                     ran

in.    The numbers entering dwindled to a trickle and the gate was left

ajar to act as an additional            turnstile.    However,     there was no-one

left o u t s i d e .



The scene inside could only then have been described as a 'sea of

fans' all      congregating on the area behind the turnstiles A to G,               it

was as though they were all taking their breath to try and recover.

A large cheer went up inside the ground and I watched as within a

matter of 1-2 minutes           the area emptied entirely,        the majority of

fans running down the tunnel            to the central terrace.



I looked around to see the other officers from my serial more or less

in tact and thought           'thank god that's o v e r ’.     I stood up for a moment

to recover but           looked up to see a large number of Police officers,

about 30,      running around the foot of the West Stand and Leppings Lane

Terrace.       We      ran as a serial and joined them and made our way through

the South Stand onto the pitch.



As I stepped onto the pitch an announcement                  came over the ground

'ta n no y* requesting that Liverpool          fans   left the pitch.     I could see

a number of fans wandering up and down in front of the fence and more

climbing over.           I ran up to the front of the terrace ~ the centre

south enclosure and was met with a scene of carnage.                  Fans were

crushed tight up against the fence,             some were already blue faced.



Other officers          present were stood on the fence shouting for the crowd

to move back,          to no avail.   The gate at the front of the enclosure

No. 3 had been opened but this did little to help the situation.
                                                                          PAGE         6
                                                                          R 110

There   is a three foot step up to escape the terrace.        The man who

was directly behind the gate when it was opened fell forward due to

pressure behind him.     His legs were trapped below the level of the

pitch and people were packed tighter than sardines behind him.             Gate

3 became blocked.     I struggled with other officers to free people.

One or two were rescued.      The gate then became cluttered with Police,

a senior officer    ran up with a Loud Hailer and began shouting at

officers at gate three to move back to let people out.           Some officers

moved away but the problem of the trapped man remained.           He

effectively blocked the     gate   completely.    I helped a supporter out

and escorted him to the     penalty area of the     pitch.   He appeared to be

recovering so I placed him in the recovery position.           I looked up and

saw officers trying to pull down the fence in front of OS enclosure.

I ran to assist,    but this excercise    proved futile.     I helped some

fans over the top of the fence and returned to Gate 3.



Throughout this period the officers at the front of the fence had

been subjected to a hail of missiles from the crowd.          The blue crash

barrier that had collapsed was thrown from the crowd and landed on

officers at the front.      I was hit by a shoe     and I believe coins,

although I cannot be certain of what the missies were.          I assisted        at

Gate 3 and carried, with other officers,         eight bodies from the

terrace.    I attempted to resuscitate four of these to no avail.



The crowd up against the fence were still being crushed,          unable to

help themselves due to being weak through lack of air.          Another

problem was that    people had died in the crush and were       lying as M e a d

w e i g h t ’ on people who were still alive.    The ninth body I removed was

placed on a make shift stretcher - a piece of advertising board and I

carried him to the gymnasium.       I wrote my number on his hand and
                                                                                                          PAGE     7
                                                                                                          R 1-10

returned to the pitch where                     I attended to the injured.                      I carried a

young lad of about               12 years of age to the gymnasium for transport to

hospital.          I then remained with my body.



The body was subsequently numbered No. 31. He was a male white, about

50 years,        brown greying hair and moustache,                          5*11" tall, wearing a

blue shirt,          white T shirt,            grey trousers and socks,                   black shoes and

wearing a gold coloured Rotary wrist watch on his left wrist. He had

no identifiable             property - (£36 cash, a cigarette                          lighter and packets

of cigs).          I remained with the body carrying out duties as

instructed,          i.e. Gen 18 preparation for photograph etc.



At 8.30 p.m.           I handed the body over to a CID Officer and completed a

CJA Statement to that effect.



I went off duty              at 9.00 p.m.



I am aware that              it is inevitable that there will                          be criticism of

various aspects              of the      incident at Hillsborough.                      I feel,    however,

that given the            circumstances,            the decisions taken,                particularly in

relation to opening gates, were                        correct.          I fully support them and

feel     it was the          only course of action to take.



There     is little          point     in 'iffing'          and 'butting' about Police action.

The    circumstances were something that                          could never have been prepared

for and I am sure              if it happened tomorrow,                   most officers would behave

in the same manner.                 Very little,           if anything could have been done to

prevent the tragedy.

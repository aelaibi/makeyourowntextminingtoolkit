      end fHL the tunnel           so that's         the     reason     1 went    down    it.     As    I went    down

      the    tunnePsJ heard someone               behind me say that the outside                       gates    had

           wouIdn'U      expect at any Thatch.

      At    the end       of the t u n n e lthings were getting tight                     and    looking       back up

      the tunnel          I saw that          itwas,    by1 now f u l l ,                  and i decided          t,o

      things were         that    crushed      in there         that    I just    couldn't move.           I had        to

just      get out,         so I made my way up to the tunnel                      and     into the open area

at    the     rear of the stands.                  My    leg was hurting and            I was     limping,,        I

was wringing wet w ith sweat                       but once       in the    open area,        we were all

estimates,              I would say that when              Kwas      lying down,        I must      have        been

s h o u t i n g a t 1 h e cr ow d a t the           back of the terraces              to move       back.

People        in the terraces were                 telling him that           people were         aying         but he

coulaVt           really do anything.                   Because    of the way       the     crowd nad fallen,

they h a d \ a           be dragged cut          from the *ear         of the terraces            f'is^s t .      Also

get a serial            in t h r o u g h the back            to    pull       the    people      out.           Whether       he

did or       not      I d o n ’t know,            he seemed a little                non   plussed and walked

away.        I have      no    idea who           he was,,

I can      remember          pulling a boy of about                   16 yrs         from the       crowd who            had, a

broken arm.             By    that      I m ean      I could      clearly           see   that    the       bone       in his

above      the     people      in the        crowd and         shou t e d      to us that         he had          broken

his arm,         wit h a n o t h e r        officer we m a n a g e d to grab him and                          pull       him

through          the    gate a n d         onto     the    track.     He      just    than k e d us and walked

off.                     ’                                               ,,                   ....         ' ;.

Host     of' the        ones who were               pulled out,.who            we r e , a b l e      than k e d       us and

were     crying,         t h a nking        god- that       they''had got out.

As more and more                   o f f icers      a r r i v e d at' the     scene,       they began to tear

down the          fencing          wit h    their        bare hands,        trying, to get              to the         people        i'

the    peri.        Some       even    tried to kick, it down.                      Some    o f f icers were

hanging          over    the       fencing and            pulling    people over quite                     clearly         in

some     danger         of falling           into the        pen themselves..

At    this time          I m o v e d away           from the     gate and star t e d                 checking          the

on the        grass at this                time     but my e s t i m a t i o n w ould         be      in the          region       of

about 30 to 40.                    Other     Police        Officers     were        engaged          in a t t e m p t s      to

revive        p e o p i e .•

I    made     several          attempts        to    revive     people with artificial

r e s u s c i t a t i o n and w h e n e v e r        1    thought    I felt a pulse                  I would         shout        any

medical          personnel          who were         near at     hand.         I seemed to have                     found more

dead     than a 1 ive.

The    situation             in this        a r e a.was     quite    chaotic,         bodies all              over       the

place,        people w a n de r i n g         about        crying,    screaming,            shouting,              Police

Of f i c e r s    and what          few medical            personnel        were     there        trying          fr a n t i c a l l y

After        some      time at        checking           bodies and making            several           hopel ess

a t t empts       to    revive        people        it became       obvious         to me    that          there was

nothing more             that       I could do.             I was    feeling a b s o l u t e l y - p h y s i c a l l y

shattered.              By     this        time all       the   people      in      pen 4 had           been pulled out

and there           only       r e m a i n e d the       dead bodies        in      pen 3,        a large number of

  young     boy of about           12-14 yrs who was                 tota l l y o v e rw h e l m e d    by the

  situation.          Although         on saying         that    once       they had g a t h e r e d - t h e i r

  senses 'they g o t , s t u c k         in and w o r k e d      very hard.                                 ■

  I cannot        recall      at anyt i m e any senior                 officer       taking      command of the

  s i t u a t i o n or o r g a n i s i n g   anything,         I know as a matter                of fact     that

  c e r tainly did not           ha p p e n where        I was       irr e s p e c t i v e   of what     is .-now

  being     said.       The     organising         was    down to the P C ’s and Sgts.                    who were

  there     doing what          ne e d e d   to be done.

  W it h   regard        to the       beh a v i o u r   of the fans I can say that                     the ones          who

  were     seated        above      the      pens were        shouting and screaming abuse,                      but       the

  ones     who were       on the       ground got o r g a n i s e d           into groups         and    helped us

  with     the    injured etc          by carrying            them     an advert         boards    and were a

  credit- to themselves.

  As   I have      previously          stated      I have w o r k e d         football        duty at

  crowd.,        I would      consider        it one      of the        best Poli c e d        grounds     in the

  country,,        Whatever        happened        on this       occasion          to    cause    such a tragedy

  can only be             speculated, -upon,            but a gain          I have    never      seen as man y           fans

PHILIP HOOSON



Police Constable 42



to Saturday 15 April 1989, I was engaged on football duty at Sheffield

for the semi final football match between Nottingham Forest and

Liverpool Football Club at the Hillsborough Stadium.     My scale of duty

commenced at 8am at Barnsley DHQ.

The serial I was attached to was 'D' Division serial 16, which

consisted of other officers.

PS 2379 Swift

PC 42 Hooson (self)

PC 803 Tattershall

PC 3198 Akred

PC 2083 Packer

PC 12 Taylor

PC 1368 Mackenzie

PC 1453 Phillips

PC 2185 Cooper

We all travelled to West Bar Police Station by transit van and paraded

there for briefing at 9am.     Chief Inspector King conducted the

briefing, Superintendent Bates was officer in charge.

After briefing, personal radios were issued, one radio between two

officers, but it was found that there wasn't enough radios to go

round.   So myself and PC Tattershall teamed up with PS Swift having

one radio between the three of us.    We were then joined by two

officers fran the HQ Drug Squad, who were attached to our serial

working in uniform, one of whan was PC 3211 Priestley.    The other Drug
                                 -   2   -




Squad officers name I don't knew.            We were each given a packed lunch.

Our allotted duty was to attend at Midland Station and escort the

Notts Forest   fans and Liverpool fans who would be arriving by train,

separate them at the station and put than on a number of double decked

PSV’s provided by South Yorkshire Transport.            After the fans were

placed in their respective biases they were transported to the

Hillsborough Stadium being escorted by 2 PC's per PSV.            Then

marshalled off the buses and into the stadium.            The PC's would then

return to the Midland Station.       We attended at the Midland Station and

ccnmenced our duties at 10am that date.

My serial remained at the station all the time, not travelling with

any of the football fans on the PSV's.

All the fans   who arrived at the station were well behaved and co­

operated with our requests.    All appeared to be decent, genuine

football fans fran both teams.       There were exceptions when one or two

of the younger element fran both Notts Forest and Liverpool tried to

get through the cordon and into the city and using all sorts of

reasons.    The snooker tournament being one of them.

Each of these were searched and when football tickets were found on

them they were sent to their respect PSV's without putting up much

argument.   This was the way in which my serial dealt with the fans

filtering the non-fans through the station gates, but the vast

majority did vtfiat they were requested to do.         There were no unpleasant

situations at the station, everything was good humoured having a laugh

and a joke with sane of the fans fran both sides.

At about 2.25pm we were informed by the British Transport Police that

all the expected football fans who were travelling by train had

arrived at Midland Station and that they were not aware of any large
                                    -    3   -




groups of fans still being in the rail system.

In view of this my serial along with other officers from other serials

boarded the PSV's at Midland Station and were transported to the

Hillsborough Stadium.

The route taken by the driver of the PSV in which we were travelling

took us along Middlewood Road past Hillsborough Park and right into

lappings Lane.     I noticed that there were large crowds of people

walking along Leppings Lane towards the football ground.         These people

were walking on the pavements and into the road on both sides of

leppings Lane.     As we neared the c o m e r of the road where the entrance

road is to the turnstiles at leppings Lane, the area was completely

swamped with football fans.     I could only see Inspector Sykes who was

standing cm the corner to the entrance and he was totally surrounded

with Liverpool fans.     It was like a sea of faces in that area

stretching fran half way along the pavement fran the junction with

Vere Road and well past Gate C at the Leppings Lane turnstile.         This

area of "—he turnstiles was wall to wall people viio seemed to be packed

into that: area.    I could see several fans climbing over the top of the

gate.   I did not see any Police Officers in this area, unless they

were lost: in the sea of people.        I could see two mounted officers who

were cccpletely surrounded also and were quite obviously struggling to

control t±ns crowd of fans.     It would be fair to say that this area at

this time was totally congested with fans trying to get into the

ground at these turnstiles and still more large numbers of fans were

converging on Leppings Lane fran the direction of Penistone Road and

Middlewood Road.

With difficulty the driver of the bus in which we were travelling

managed ro work a way through the fans making their way along Leppings
Lane from the direction of Penistone Road, towards the turnstiles at

the rear of the West Stand.   I could hear on other officers radios

that officers at the Leppings Lane turnstiles were shouting for

assistance.   I couldn't make out any specific request only calls for

assistance and more mounted officers to attend at this location.

I have worked football duty at Hillsborough Stadium on more than

several occasions during my service including a number of semi finals,

but I have never seen such a large number of fans at the Leppings Lane

end at that time of day, the area was totally over-run.   This would

have been at 2.50pm.

At about 2.55pm we arrived outside the gates to the North Stand in

Penistone Road and debused.   My serial went straight into the

gymnasium where we were to be held cm standy as a reserve serial.     We

managed to get a hot drink and were just about to eat our packed

lunches, having only been seated for a matter of a minute when

Sergeant Swift told us we had to leave because we were required on the

track in front of the West Stand.   We iirmediately left the gymnasium

and went into the playing area of the stadium.   This was before 3pm

because as we entered the playing area I saw players from both teams

on the football pitch warming up.

We walked along the track in front of the North Stand towards the West

Stand and when passing sane fans in the North Stand I heard sane of

them "hissing".   As we made our way along the track, there was no

indication to us at this time, that anything was wrong in the West

Stand of the stadium.

My serial at this tine, including myself consisted of PS Swift, PC

Tattershall, PC McKenzie, PC Akred, PC Taylor, PC Packer and PC

Cooper.
We reached the corner of the track between the North Stand and the

West Stand and without looking too carefully I got the impression that

the area was not as full as the West Stand appeared to be.    As we

began walking along the track in front of the West Stand the noise was

deafening.    The whole stadium seemed to be shouting but I didn't take

any particular notice at this time, this sort of behaviour not being

unusual for a game of this importance.    PC Packer was in front of me

at this time.    As we made our way further along the track towards the

South Side I began to sense sanething was not quite right.     I could

see at this time that there were already three other Policemen

standing on the track in front of us.    As I neared Gate 4 I realised

that the people in the West Stand were not shouting but were

screaming.    I realised then that something was seriously wrong and I

heard people in the crowd screaming "let us out," "Oh God help us."          I

looked at the people in the crowd and I could see by their faces and

that people were crushed up against the fencing that they were clearly

in a desperate situation.    I immediately grabbed the officer on the

track and asked him to get sane assistance to us.    I knew that I had

to open the gate to get people out even if it meant getting a

bollocking.     I can remember thinking "If you're wrong Phil lad,

you'll get a right bollocking for this."    I then went straight tc Gate

4 at the fence behind the goal posts and shouted to Sergeant Swift who

was a number of yards away fran my position to my right: "I'm opening

the gate” and I opened the gate.    PC 3198 Akred was with me at this

time.

On opening the gate, the crush was so great that the people behind the

safety fencing in this stand could not move to free themselves.       With

PC 3198 Akred I immediately began pulling people out fran the crowd
and through the gate and on to the track.     Meet of the people that we

pulled out initially were able to walk and did not have any apparent

serious injuries.     Each and every person that we pulled exit fran Pen 4

took a great deal of physical effort, not one of them carre out easy.

Each one was trapped in one way or another by various parts of their

body.

After a short while at Gate 4 we were joined by Sergeant Swift and we

continued to pull these people free.     On more than several occasions

jackets, pullovers, shirts etc were ripped on peoples backs in the

effort to free them.

There was no doubt that the people in the stand were desperate for

their lives.     The best description would be to say that people were

drowning in a sea of people.     M l the faces that I saw at the front

were pale, grey, white or blue all with panic and pain written all

over them.     The people at the front couldn't scream for help only

stare, screaming at your with their eyes.     There were many whose eyes

were closed.

Whilst we were standing at the gate, I could see two iren on the floor

at the gate opening, we were frantically pulling people out as fast as

we could to try and get to the people at the front, but as soon as one

was pulled free the space was filled with another and pressure was

still being pushed forward fran the back of the stand.

I got down on my hands and knees and grabbed hold of cane of the men

who was on the floor face down, hanging out of the gate into the

track, I put my arm under his armpits and tried pulling him out,

whilst I was doing this people who were being pulled free above me

were standing can my back to get to the track, other officers present

grabbed hold of me and other parts of the man and with a great deal of
physical effort we managed to pull him free.   We carried him to tire

grass area behind the goal nets, put him down, established that he was

breathing and alive, he muttered sane words and we left him and

immediately returned to the gate and continued pulling people frtm

the pen.   I became aware that the man we had pulled out fran the floor

was in fact being attended to by another officer.

It is difficult to say hew many we physically pulled fran the pen but

it must have been in the hundreds, most of whan were walking, sane

unconscious, same dead, sane collapsed.   The ones who were brought out

unconscious were tended to immediately by whoever pulled them out.

They were brought round by slaps across the face or if they were

collapsed mouth to mouth resuscitation where necessary.    I didn't

count how many times I did this, I couldn't guess.   As time was

passing more and more officers were arriving at the scene, this was

quite obviously within minutes of opening the gates even though we

seemed to have been there a hell of a long time before anyone actually

came, but it was only minutes.

The main problem was that no matter hew many were pulled fran the

front, the crush was so great fran the back we couldn't relieve any

pressure to get to the people at the very front or sides who were in

serious trouble.

It became obvious that pressure needed to be released fran the rear

where there was new space appearing.   Officers were telling or

shouting to people to move back fran the front but they wouldn't so

the situation continued.

I made a request to one Inspector who was standing on the grass to get

a serial in through the back to pull the people out. Whether he did

or not I don't knew, he seemed a little non plussed and walked away.
I can remember pulling a boy of about 16 years frcm the crowd who had

a broken arm.     By that I mean I could clearly see that the bone in his

right forearm was broken.     He had somehow managed to pull himself

above the people in the crowd and shouted to us that he had broken his

arm, with another officer we managed to grab him and pull him through

the gate and on to the track.     He just thanked us and walked off.

Most of the ones who were pulled out, who were able thanked us and

were crying, thanking god that they had got out.

As more and more officers arrived at the scene, they began to tear

down the fencing with their bare hands, trying to get to the people in

the pen.   Seme even tried to kick it down.    Satie officers were hanging

over the fencing and pulling people over quite clearly in sane danger

of fallin g into the pen themselves.

At this time I moved away fran the gate and started checking the

people laid down on the grass, I cannot remember how many were laid on

the grass at this time but my estimation would be in the region of

about 3© to 40.     Other Police Officers were engaged in attempts to

revive people.

I made several attempts to revive people with artificial resuscitation

and whenever I thought I felt a pulse I would shout any medical

personnel who were near at hand.     I seemed to have found more dead

than alive.

The situation in this area was quite chaotic, bodies all over the

place, people wandering about crying, screaming, shouting, Police

Officers and what few medical personnel were there trying frantically

to revive people.

After seme time at checking bodies and making several hopeless

attempts to revive people it became obvious to me that there was
nothing more that I could do.     I was feeling absolutely physically

shattered.     By this time all the people in Pen 4 had been pulled out

and there only remained the dead bodies in Pen 3, a large number of

which had been taken out and placed on the field.

During the roost frantic moments of trying to revive the people an the

grass there were no medical personnel to speak of and the St John's

Ambulance Brigade consisted of what I could see, two old iren and one

young boy of about 1 2 - 1 4 years vrfio was totally overwhelmed by the

situation.     Although on saying that, once they had gathered their

senses they got stuck in and worked very hard.

With regard to the behaviour of the fans I can say that the ones who

were seated above the pens were shouting and screaming abuse, but the

ones who were on the ground got organised into groups and helped us

with the injured etc by carrying than on advert boards and were a

credit to themselves.

As I have previously stated I have worked football duty at

Hillsborough on quite a number of occasions and have always been

impressed by the pre-planning and organisation of the duties and

crowd.     I would consider it one of the best policed grounds in the

country.     Whatever happened on this occasion to cause such a tragedy

can only be speculated upon, but again I have never seen as many fans

at the Leppings Lane end at that time of day.

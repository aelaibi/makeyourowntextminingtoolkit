FOOTBALL: LETTER FROM MR SANDFORD

I     attach     a     draft      reply    to   Mr Sandford's     letter    to    you    of
21 November.


2.      You     will        see   that the attached draft is negative.            It says
that it would be a mistake for the Football League to plan on                           the
assumption           that     further significant tax concessions for football
will be contained in next year’s Budget.                   As I   mentioned       to    you
the     other        day,    my   own view is that we ought to make this point
quite firmly to Mr Sandford.                 The Government has already been very
generous        to     football.      It must now be for football to respond by
making a significant contribution out of its own resources to help
meet the cost of necessary ground improvements.

DRAFT LETTER FROM SIR TERENCE BURNS TO:




Mr Arthur Sandford
Chief Executive
The Football League Ltd
City House
Maid Marian Way
Nottingham
NG1 6BH                                                              December 1990




Thank you for your letter of 21 November.



I can understand that a move to full cost charging for policing at

football          matches        could   cause difficulties for some clubs.               As I

explained when we met on 1 November, however, it is difficult                              for

me     to     influence thinking in this area since responsibility rests

very much with the Home Office.                    For this reason, I          believe    that

the best approach would be for you to raise your concerns directly

with them.



You wonder whether payments to clubs as                       part   of   an    ear-marking

scheme       might           be regarded as capital money, and hence exempt from

tax.        I am not sure exactly what type of scheme you have in                        mind,

though       we        did     discuss   various      possibilities at our meeting on

1 November.             It    may   be   that   you     are   wondering    whether,        for

example,          TV    money paid to clubs on condition that it is spent on

ground improvements might be ignored for corporation tax purposes.

If     so, then I think the answer is that it could not.                        Payments of

TV money would be regarded as income in the hands of the clubs and

                                          UNCLASSIFIED

                                         UNCLASSIFIED


would        therefore       increase       corporation    tax liability, though the

capital works financed by the money might be eligible for                                capital

allowances.



In     the     last    paragraph       of     your   letter,      you   mention a rather

different scheme.             This would entail        a   levy    of    50p       or    £1    on

admission          prices.     It would be made clear to spectators that this

levy would be for ground improvements, and clubs would not be free

to use the income in any other way.                    You express      the hope that the

levy would be free of VAT                so   that     the whole        amount      could      be

applied to ground improvements.



I    think      I am right in saying that, with a scheme                 on these lines,

the levy would still be subject to VAT and                     would     also       be    taken

into     account in calculating corporation tax liability.                          The point

here is that the levy would still be regarded for tax purposes                                 as

part     of    the     entrance       charge, even though it was ear-marked for

ground        improvements.        Any      other    outcome    would        require      fresh

legislation.



It   may      be     that     the purpose of your letter is indeed to ask for

further tax concessions.               If so, I have to say           that     I    think      it

would    be     a mistake to plan on the assumption that the Chancellor

will want       to make        a   further significant          tax      concession           for

football       in     next    year's     Budget.       Thereduction in pool betting

duty announced last March should beworth around                          £100 million to

football       over     the    next     five years, and the previous Chancellor

said that a decision would be taken at an early stage                          on       whether

to   prolong        the cut in duty for a second five year period.                        These

                            UNCLASSIFIED

are generous concessions.   As the previous Chancellor   said   on   a

number of occasions it must now be for football to contribute on a

significant scale out of its own resources to the work that     needs

to be done.



If you wish to consider further the tax implications of a specific

ear-marking scheme, I am sure the Inland Revenue would be happy to

give their view of the law if you would set out in detail what you

have in mind.   I am sorry I cannot be more helpful.

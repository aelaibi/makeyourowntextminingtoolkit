FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILLS BULL POINTS


    The Bill was introduced in to the House of Lords on 16
    January has completed Commons Committee Stage and awaits
    remaining stages in the spill over period?

    The Bill provides
       i)      the statutory framework for a national membership
       scheme for football spectators to be drawn up in detail by
       the Football Membership Authority established by the Bill
       to administer the scheme?
       ii)     the courts with power to impose restriction orders
       on convicted hooligans to prevent them travelling to
       matches abroad for up to 5 years.
    The Bill proposes that 1ejveryone who attends a designated
    match in England and Wales should be a member of the scheme,
    or otherwise authorised by the scheme, and that designated
    matches should be played only on licensed football grounds.
    Troublemakers inside and outside the ground, would be banned
    from membership and thereby prevented from attending games;

     The Bill was introduced because of the need to take further
   . powerful measures to fight football hooliganism.  That need
     remains?
    In spite of the efforts of the Government and the football
    authorities over 5,000 police officers are still needed every
    Saturday to contain the problem, to protect the true
    supporters and those living near football grounds;
    The reputation of our football supporters abroad is as low as
    it can be.     The Bill will provide a major deterrent to
    incidents of hooliganism overseas, a more effective one than
    the withdrawal of passports under present arrangement since
    those concerned can simply apply for a British visitors
    Passport at the Post Office;
     The Government recognises that Lord Justice Taylor's Final
     Report may make comments which will be relevant to the scheme
     and of which Parliament would wish to be aware before any
     final decisions are made on the implementation of the
     scheme;

     Government amendments to the Bill have therefore provided
     Parliament with two opportunities to debate the scheme after
     Lord Justice Taylor*s Final Report - before the FMA is
     appointed and after it has submitted the scheme to the
     Secretary of State for approval.

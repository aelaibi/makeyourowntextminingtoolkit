        2.   It is good that RIBA and the Sports; Council havt ... ' . the
        initiative to arrange this seminar but unless the Hr as Secretary
        particularly wants to accept the invitation                     it
        can scarcely be regarded as an urgent ceil on - '. time,

        3.   The arguments in favour of attendance ara that      .. .. cry ...

        at a time when safety at sports grounds is still in the pucrto
        eye and to deelina the invitation might    .. . as though ths ion,-
        Office were not paying sufficient interest in a subject toi cnin
        we have responsibility*
        4.   However,       design (and construction)    of non buildings
        including sports grounds, is not a Hone Office responsibility,
        Our guidance on safety ia aiiaed at sports grounds., especially
        football grounds, already in use. That guidance in the absence
        Of any other guidance on the subject is           used vhen grounds
        are built or rs-developed but Building Sogolatins axist to
        ensure structure integrity of new construction corks end the
        Sports C o u n c i l may have an advisory     • ..   DoS Ministers
        therefore have an interest but might recscoadiy srneot the dome
        Office to tak® the lead given the native of the tayior n n a i
        report„
        5.   Lord Ferrers, as the Minister with sports ground safety
        responsibilities, could perhaps accept   • invitation on   .. .

        will not be the end of the r"   S.

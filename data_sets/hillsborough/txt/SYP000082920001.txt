S h o r t l y after         positioning          ourselves          at this      point a steady              flow of

mini    buses and vans               began       to arrive.          Most,      in fact,       nearly all           of    the

occ u p a n t s    of these         vans a c c e p t e d     our     instructions            and advise         regards

out    to them        it was        possibly          the   nearest       available          location to the

ground,      they were          going       to    find.       Whilst        speaking wit h the               s uppo r t e r s

as they a l i g h t e d        from their             vehicles,       it became         a p p arent     that      some     of

them had been drinking                     heavily,         w ith    large      quan t i t i e s    of empty beer

and    lager       cans      littering          the    floors       of their       vehicles,         although        the

general      m o o d of these           persons was           one     of high spirits and good humour,,



During      the     time      spent at          this    location the            level     of both veh icles              and

pedestr ians          passing        our    poi nt grew         progress i v e 1y heavier as                  the    kick —

off time          of the Semi- F i n a l          ajzfproached and           it was       n o ticeable        that       large

amounts      of     canned beer w a s / b e i n g            consumed by these                persons a l t h o u g h

their     mood was           still     one/of         good nature.



On numerous           occasions,           my    colleagues         and     I were      approached           by person

alighting          from m i n i - b u s e s      and    passing       out    point asking where                 they may

find a public               house    that was          open and where            they     could gain entry.

several          people       lying        on the floor with others                         attempting            to give           them

the      kiss     of    life.         The       scene as a whole               was, o n e      of great           c o n fusion

great       difficulty             in trying           to carr y what             appeared          to be more           injured

that       many    of    the       people        were       in a n     hysterical            state     almost          one     of

        They were all            very hostile          towards         us,    clearly very f r i g h t e n e d by wna

        had h a p p e n e d «       I could hear more             shouting and             screaming       coming      from

V   K   the d i r e c t i o n of the         terrace      and on reaching                 this    section,      I pushed m

        way     to the       left    of    ti"ie di v i d i ng fence         pas t , mo r e suppo r t e r s we r e

        issuing abuse towards                  us both verfcxarTly and               physically.



        As we     tried to get             to try? front         of the       terrace,       I could see         that       it

        was     blocked j f f ' per so          who were         f rant i call y t ry 1 n g t o g e t a n t o the

        pitch «        As    l\tri£Kf to get to these                  persons,        I, and other         officers,

        were     spat at,        kicked at and           punched at,           as    I attempted         to do so.           As

        reached        the    perimeter        fencing      surrou n d i n g        the    pitch,    I saw      in front

        of the      persons         still    pushing      to get        onto     the      pitch,    a pile      of

        approximately            two or three          bodies      lying at          the    base    of the      fencing.

        By this        time,     I had      become     detached from my Serial                     who   had o b v i o u s l y

        gone     to the       right       of the     dividing      fencing          but    together w ith a n o t he r

        P o 1 ice Q f f 1 cer who          I didn't      know,     1 drag g e d        one of these         bodies       by hi

        legs     out    of the       pile.      On doing         so,    j. saw that         it was a man w hose              tac

        an d    body was almost a s h e n             in colour,         and     eyes      glazed.       The    other

        P o l i c e Officers         b egan m a s s a g i n g    his   heart whilst              I began    to give         him

        the     kiss    of    life a l t h o u g h    I s u s p e c t e d that       he    could    possibly alre a d y

        be dead,,           I w ould say that          he was m e d i u m       to     late twenties,           o verw e i g h t

        wit h    dark       hair.



        As we     continued to try and                 revive      this m a n , I could sense                  that    other

        persons were           kicking       the     fencing away            just above          my head    in order         to

        create an opening.                  An officer          then s h o u t e d at me and stated                  that    the

        had     created a gap             in the fencing          and as a result                together w i t h the

        assistance           of other       officers,      we     lifted       this man          through the         gap and

        h a n d e d him to offic e r s          who    placed him onto               the    playing      s u r f a c e just a

    t hro u g h the      gap    in the fencing              but on seeing         that    the officers        had

             Throughout          this     time,    the mood of the stad i u m was                         one    of    panic and

             h y s t e r i a and at one         point,      I ge n u i n e l y feared              that    the    fans w o u l d      riot

             when all          the   injured      persons and             bodies        had    been     cleared from the

             playing          surface     of the goal         mouth area,               there was almost               a feeling        of

             numbness          about     the   officers and fans                   still      in this a rea as              if the

             en o r m i t y    of the     s i t u a t i o n had sudde n l y hit               them.       Numerous          fans were

             relatives          from w h i c h they had become                     detached.

            gently       usher       them from the          player              surface,      after    w h i c h we     returned to

                             MR. FRASER:   Sir, you will now hear evidence
                        relating to Christine Jones from Preston. Mrs. Jones|
                        family have chosen not to come to your Court today, sir,
                    B   for reasons personal to them and perfectly proper.
                        They are represented by solicitors who are members of
                        my group and I, therefore, appear through the usual
                        agency arrangements as a member of the Steering
                        Committee *

                              THE CORONER:     Thank you, Mr. Fraser.

                             This then is the resiimed Inquest which was opened
                        on the 19 th April, 1 9 8 9 . On that occasion Neil Anthony
                        Parkin, Acting Coroner’s Officer, said:
                                  "The body which is the subject of this
                                  Inquest lias been identified to PS 2 6 5 8
                                  Roper of the Soiith Yorkshire Police as
                                  that of Christine Anne Jones by Stephen
                    D             Jones, her husband. She was 26 years of
                                  age having been born on the 3rd November,
                                  1961 at Manchester.     She was a married
                                  woman and she lived at ______________
                                                 Preston, She was a senior
                                  radiographer by occupation. She died at
                                  Hillsborough Football Ground following an
                    E             incident there on Saturday, 15 th April,
                                  1 9 8 9 . PS Roper caused the body to be
                                  removed to the Medico Legal Centre and
                                  there he identified it to Detective
                                  Constable Simon 1/eigo Id who subsequently,
                                  identified the same body to Prof. Jones.
                                  It is the family wish that the body should
                                  be buried."
                              I then adjourned it and we wrote in the usual way
                        and Stephen Jones, her husband, replied and --- in
                        fact, by the time we wrote to him we had got the form
                        right because her age is actually, I tliinlc, 2/ but,
                        apart from that, everything was correct. On this
                        form her second name is spelt ’Anne1. Mr. Fraser, I
                        mention that because when I was looking through the
                        statements I noticed that in one of these statements
                        by Stephen he wrote her name down as ’Ann1. If you
                        have not got the information now it does not matter
                        biit, at some point, perhaps you could jvist verify which
                        way her name should be spelt?
                             MR. FRASER: Sir, the correspondence from the
                        solicitors does not have •e 1 on the end but that may
                    H   be typist's licence rather than anything else. I
                        cannot give you a definitive answer, J am afraid. I
                        am sorry.

       THE CORONER: It does not matter at this stage
because we have not concluded the Inquests anyway but,
a-fc your convenience, perhaps you could try and veiify
the correct spelling because do like .their names
correctly spelt. The other thing I need to say is that
her maiden name was Alderson. I do not think tneie is
any argument about that.
     Her alcohol was measured in the usual way by Dr.
Forrest and, in the case of Christine, the result was
negative.
              PROF. STEPI-IEN JONES Called:

                      By TIIE CORONER:

O. Perhaps you would be kind enough to give us the
   facts, Prof. Jones? - A. The body of Christine Anne
   Jones, which was labelled no. 35» was -identified to
   me by Detective Constable Ueigold at the Medico
   Legal Centre. She was a well-nourished young woman
   of^average stature. There was very marked cyanosis,
   that is, blue disc6 louration of the skin, of the
   head, neck and shoulders and fingertips. There were
   very scanty petechial haemorrhages on the conjunctivae
   of the eyelids, that is, on the inner lining of the
   eyelids. There were some very minor scratches on
   the forehead and on the nose, the bridge of the nose,
   and a little scratch on the right cheek. On the
   left side of the neck below the jaw there was another
   further abrasion, a little scratch and a bruise,
   and there was a horizontal mark across the front of
   the chest due to compression - a compression mark,
   Small abrasions were present on the knee caps and
   also on the back of the right shoulder. These
   external injuries were all of a very minor nature
   and they certainly did not, in any way, contribute
   to death. Oiir further examination showed changes
   associated with asphyxia. These were multiple
   haemorrhages, petechial haemorrhages, on the surface
   of the heart and the lungs. The heart showed a small
   amount of bruising on the surface as well. The
   changes were all entirely in keeping with the death
   being caused by traumatic asphyxia and the injuries
   that I have described were of a very trivial minor
   nature.
Q. And no natural disease? - A. No evidence of any
   natural disease.
        MR. FRASER:      No questions, sir, thank you.

        THE CORONER: Any questions of Prof. Jones?
   (No questions from the Jury)
        TIIE WITNESS:  May I be temporarily released to
   have a discussion ....
        THE CORONER:      Of course, yes.   We have got to

                           have another Inquest after this but subject to that,

                                TIIE WITNESS:  Sir, Matthew Robert Sawers,
                    g      Inspector, West Midlands Police.
                        Q. Inspector Sawers, can you take me through the summary,
                           please? - A. Yes. On Saturday, 1 5 th April, 1 9 8 9 , Mr.
                           Stephen Jones travelled b3^ car with his wife,
                           Christine Anne Jones, to Sheffield, arriving at about
                           1330 hours. They intended to watch the FA Cup Semi
                           Final football match and entered Hillsborough
                           Stadium at aboiit 1350 hours. Mr. Jones stood with
                           his wife in Enclosure no. 3 but became separated from
                           her due to a surge in the crowd at about kick off
                           time .
                           Following the severe crushing in the West Stand
                           terracing Police Constable Fenwick went into Enclosure
                           3 and attempted to resuscitate Christine who was lying
                    D      on the terraces,
                           Woman Police Constable Akred and Police Constable Hooson
                           assisted in carrying Christine Jones onto the pitch and
                           attempted to resuscitate her without success.

                           Mr. Jones went onto the pitch area and found his wife
                           lying on the pitch near the goal line. Police Sergeant
                    E      Roper went to Christine at about 1530 hours and her
                           husband, who was-with her, identified her to this officer.
                           Police Sergeant Roper was assisted to carry Christine
                           on a temporary stretcher to the gymnasium where the
                           temporary mortuary had been set up, Mr, Jones remained
                           with his wife.
                           At 1615 hours Dr, Allan Redgrave examined Christine
                           in the temporary mortuary and certified life extinct.

                           Police Sergeant Roper later escorted the body of
                           Christine here to the Medico Legal Centre and confirmed
                           the identification to Detective Constable Weigold,

                    G      On Sunday, 16th April, 1 9 8 9 , following identification
                           by DC Weigold, Prof. Stephen Jones carried out an
                           autopsy and submitted a report giving cause of death.

                                THE CORONER:      Any questions, Mr. Fraser?

                                MR. FRASER:      No questions, sir, thank you.

                    H           TIIE CORONER:  It is clear to you this, is it not?

                           Police Constable Fenwick has signed a plan of the

                           reference no. JGR/2. PC Qaiyum confirmed that he is
                           also shown carrying the hoarding. Sir, that reference
                    D      for that photograph is as given before, JMS2/5*

                           Fireman Brooke and Police Constable Nxeld also assisted
                           in attempting to resuscitate Christine on the pitch.

                           Police Constable Akred, sir, recalled that at one
                           stage Mrs, Jones was treated by two doctors but these
                           have not been identified.
                    E
                           Again, at the present time, Mr. Jones has not felt
                           able to view anything. We do understand that position.

                        Q. Yes, and also, of course, Mr.Jones is   obviously in
                           a unique situation because hewas with his wife
                           virtually throughout the whole episode? - A. That is
                           right, sir, yes.
                        Q. So he has, of all the people, least need to look at
                           the photographs? - A. Quite so, sir, yes.

                        Q. Thank you. - A. Sir, I wonder if you could indicate
                           whether you wish me to refer to all the terrace plans?

                        Q. I do not think we need all of them. I think it is
                           either Mr. Fenwick's or PC Akred»s which are virtually
                           identical. Shall we use LA/1? — A. WPC Akred's plan?

                        Q. Yes, LA/1, and the other one we will use ...*
                           A. It is actually JGR/2, sir,which is a plan of the
                           pitch.

                H       Q. C98, yes? - A. Yes, sir, the reference number is a
                           little bit unclear but it is JGR/2.

                        Q. And the only other one is yours which you might as
                           well have? - A. Yes, that has been given the
                           reference number MWJL/1, which is also a plan of the
                           pitch0

                        Q. can
                           1 or 2.
                               deal
                                    1, yes, sorry. That is C99* ~ A. Sir, if we
                                    with the plan LA/1, which is ,WPC Akred's,
                           she refers to Enclosure No. 3 and locates Christine
                    B      in this area here in No. 3« ln respect of Sergeant
                           Roper’s plan, sir, JGR/2, on the pitch he refers to
                           a location here and then, sir, in respect of the
                           plan M¥JL/1, that is a photograph as has been referred
                           to in the summary, and that is actually located here
                           at the Spion Eop end of the ground.

                                MR. FRASER:    No questions, sir, thank you.

                                THE CORONER:    Any questions from anybody?
                           (No cjuestions from the Jury)
                                THE CORONER:   That concludes the evidence in the
                           case of Christine. This was very tragic for her poor
                           husband because he was with her virtually the whole
                           time| there were just a few moments when he lost sight
                    D      of her as far as I can understand, and it obviously
                           must have been a devastating blow to him and perhaps
                           when you report back to his solicitors or direct,
                           as the case may be, will you convey to him and the
                           rest of the family our sincere condolence at his
                           terrible loss and also the rest of the family?

                    E           MR. FRASER:    I certainly will, sir.

                                THE CORONER:    We will rise for a moment.

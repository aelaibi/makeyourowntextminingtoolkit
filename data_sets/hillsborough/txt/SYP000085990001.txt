As    the time moved             on,    nearer       to three       o'clock      I could feel          t e ns io n and

anticipation             building       between supporters.                 At 2.0 0     pm w e s t a ti o n e d

our s e l v e s    outside       the Blue Ball             public    house at Wh ar nc li ff e S i d e .

This     pub was          full of      s upporters and more               vans were      stopping

co n t i n u a l ly to try to drink                 even w ith the         kick off time approaching.

We a t t e m p t e d to stop           persons       entering       the    pub but found         it dif fi cu lt

because         of numbers.            I tried to          reason w i t h several         s upporters        telling

theiri that        if     they didn't         leave       for the    ground they w o u l d n ’t get            in     on

time.         I was       met wit h      retorts          such as    ’W e ’ll get      in."     W he n told that

even with tickets                they w ou ld        be    pushed to get         in on time,          one y outh

told me         that     ’None    of us as          tickets,    but w e ’ll get          in.*     This was          said

quite     blase         fashion but       I had no idea what was                  to happen and           I simply

thought         to myself,        ’Typical,          we    can do with ou t your          sort.’        Whilst        on

patrol        I heard several            reports          from other      units,    passed v er ba ll y         that

several         pubs     had been drunk             dry,    by supporters.

Several         fights     had t aken         place       in our a re a during         the build up to              the

match     but these         s ee m ed to sort             t hemselves     out    prior    to arrival.           The

one    thing       that    really a p p e a r e d to stick            in my rnind was           the    q ua nt i ty    of

estimate           that there must            have   been a p p r o ac h in g     two thousand             people

turning        in the         road and       travelling     back     towards        the football            ground.

  some      person         I believe        he was   of the     rank of        Inspector         shouted         that

as      I was about 5 meters               from the f enc i ng           I saw t h ro ug h the fencing a

 reali s e d       now what was        happening.           At first        I recall      just    looking at

 dying         in front     of rne.

 I. went        to the small        g a t e a lm os t    d ir ec tl y    behind the goal,            there were

 people al mo st           thro ug h the gate           but still        t r ap pe d by the weight            of

 numbers.           Peo pl e were      tread in g       on top of        prostrate       people,       policemen

were       pulling at one anot he r             to get t h ro ug h the gate.                But      there was          no

 wa y    in.      A sort     of    cohveyo r belt was            set     up by fans and          police alike.

As      one man was         passed thro ug h        I dragged           him onto       the grass.        He was a

over       the   fence and          I used some           small steps             to follow him over            the

fence.

I remember         looking down to where                       I had to drop,            there was       nothing          J

could do other than fall                      onto    the       pile of bodies.                I landed and

climbed about 8 terrace                      steps    back,        there was a wall              of s upporters

standing         at the edge           of the     bodies         some were          kneeling      down hugging

people       others      screaming at me and others                          to help       persons.

I m o v e d along        lifting         people      from the             pile,   at    first    I was trying             to

move       everybody,         but    it then began to get                    clear      that    it was     no use

m oving      blue and white             bodies and all rny efforts                       were    put    into moving

anyone w ith the faintest                     s ign of         pink or       life      in their    faces.         It was

whilst       doing    this       that     the most         degrading          part      of the a f t e r no o n

occurred.          Whilst        I was       standing and             lifting       people      off the floor,                I

was    spat      upon,    several         times,      I d o n ’t know by who,                  but my    police

a n o r a k was    covered          in spit,      after         the       incident.        I could hear         people

shouting,         ’YOU B A S T AR D S C A U S E D THIS,               YOU S H OU L D BE DEAD NOT THEM.'

There were         people        still       pushing and a l t h o u g h            I was      never    f ri gh t en e d

for my own safety,                  I was a p p r e h e ns i ve and always                thought       that at any

time       I may be attacked.                 I heard          people       c on t in u al l y shouting       that        ’The

pigs had         caused the d i s a s t e r ’ a n d i 1 the                       black     bastards.’          Howe v e r

I must       stress      that       the m a j o r i t y   c           i    people      rallied around,          and
                                                          /
h elped      in every way                                             most    of the      bodies had        been

m ov e d    from the      terracing           I we/ht onto            the    pitch and gave what aid                  I

could.        Most    people were w a n d e r in g a ro un d                  in a daze,         a lot of       people

were       confused and annoyecr that                     no    i nf or ma ti on       had been    passed       over          the

t a n n o y , and that         they ye re unaware                of w h et he r        there    relatives       had       been

involved.          Where       they should           g o , to find out about                   relatives.         I felt

quite      useless       as    I had no        idea,       nothing          to my k no wledge          had ever       been

m e n t i o n e d at briefings as              to where a c as ualty                   bureau w ou ld      be set         up,

and    X t h e refore         d i re ct ed    people       to the          police      room at the       rear     of the
                                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                 S3025

             North S t a n d .

             The    pitch seemed to take along              time     to   clear?      but after        probably

             thirty minutes          I made my wa y to the           rear    of the N or th S tand            to assist

             in running a h ur r ie d ly set            up casualty       liaison       table for victims

             relatives.          I wo rk ed    on this    until    a p p r o x i m a t e l y 5.1 5   pm and    then

             a t t e n d e d at Clayw h ee ls    Lane    for meal.

             Apart    from    carrying        on w i t h normal    transit       patrols after          this    I took

             no further       part    in the     incident.

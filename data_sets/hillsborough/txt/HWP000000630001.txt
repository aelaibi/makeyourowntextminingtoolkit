                            AGENDA

I. MINUTES OF THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE CITY COUNCIL HELD ON
   17TH MAY, 1994.
II. TO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING DECISION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH
    WORKING PARTY OF 6TH JUNE, 1994, viz:-
   That -

    (A) In view of the disturbing evidence first disclosed by
        the Hillsborough Disaster Working Party in February
        1992 and referred to in the "Cook Report" Television
        Programme broadcast on Independent Television on 2nd
        June, 1994, concerning the circumstances surrounding
        the deaths of several of the victims of the
        Hillsborough disaster, and particularly in relation to
        the death there of Kevin Williams this City Council -

        (1) Demands that the Attorney General Orders a fresh
            and scrupulously independent inquiry to investigate
            this evidence and related matters as soon as
            possible;

        (2) Calls ons-
              (i) The City's M.P.'s in particular;
            (ii)   Any other M.P.'s whose constituents were
                   directly affected by this disaster;
            (iii) The Home Affairs Spokespersons of the Labour
                  and Liberal Democrat Parties; and

             (iv) The Association of Metropolitan Authorities;

            to fully support this demand.

       (3) Calls on the Trustees of the Hillsborough Disaster
           Trust Fund, which was set up by the City Council,
           to meet with the Chair and Opposition Spokesperson
           of the Hillsborough Disaster Working Party to
           investigate the possibility of those funds
           remaining in the Trust Fund being used to help
           finance the fight of the victims families to
           establish the truth of exactly what did happen at
           Hillsborough on April 15th 1989; and

   (B) This Council deplores recent news coverage in the
       United States, and in particular the Broadcast by CBS
       News on 31st May, 1994, which in reporting on
       preparations for the World Cup, has implied that the
       Hillsborough Disaster was caused by Hooligan behaviour.

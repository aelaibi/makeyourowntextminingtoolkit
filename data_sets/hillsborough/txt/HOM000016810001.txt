Dear Mr Devlin


You wrote to Mr Moynihan on 28 April 1989
enclosing one from              about the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Miss Bannister,
in her letter of 18 May 1989, mentioned that
your letter and your constituent's had been
forwarded to me as the Secretary to the
Inquiry.

I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice
TaylOr who has noted it.

Dear Mr

Thank you very much for your long and detailed letter telling me
all about your unfortunate experiences at Hillsborough.  This is
a matter which, as you know, the Government views with grave
concern and we have set up an Inquiry under Lord Justice Taylor
to look into the matter thoroughly and to draw its            own
conclusions about what happened and how such terrible disasters
can be prevented in the future.

With this in mind I am sending a copy of your letter to the
Minister for Sport, so that he can pass your letter on to the
Inquiry.    I note from several points in your letter that your
account is very similar to a letter which was published in the
Sunday Times, and I hope that the issues raised will be dealt
with very thoroughly by the Inquiry.

Thank you very much for sharing with me the full extent              of      the
tragedy you witnessed.


Best Wishes.


Yours sincerely




TIM DEVLIN, MP

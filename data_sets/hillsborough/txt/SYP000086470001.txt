                     I am a married man and I live at the above address with my wife.

                     I am presently semi          retired but I have a part time job employed fay

                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club as a turnstile operator                    i nave

                     held this position for two spells over 14 years.

                     On Saturday 15th April          1989,    I was present pa, the Hillsborough

                     Football Ground, at Turnstile               of the              in my capacity as an

                     operator.           This was a FA Cup Semi Fina/ be]           Liverpool and

                     Nottingham Forest FC.

                     I started work at the gate around noon.                 This was an all ticket match

                     and a sell out.           Between 1413 hrs and kick off,       1500 h r s , I was
o^pT
                     approached on about five occasions             fay unknown men I think they were
H        e          .
                     Nottingham Forest fans.              All five came to the turnstile and offered m

                     cash for me to allow them/er.               into the ground.     All five produced.

          ^ash and waved it at me asking me what    it was worth,    none of them

          actually stated a sum in particular - I understood that they wanted to

          pay me for entry.

          I told them they could not come through without a ticket.        One of them

          on refusal asked me again I refused for the second time then he left.

          I spoke to a. nearby Policeman about the people offering money he

          stated he would watch for such persons none of these persons got

          through my turnstile    neither did any person hurdle my turnstile.       1

          believe about 330 people went    in throuh my turnstile.    The crowd

          capacity was not increased by non ticket holders through my gate.

          I received no payment that day except for my £18    (eighteen pounds)

          match fee.

          My turnstile was    closed just after kick off on the instruction of the

          Police.

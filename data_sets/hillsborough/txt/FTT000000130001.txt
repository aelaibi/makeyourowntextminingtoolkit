135.   POLICY

      Various Trustees reported that the Pool Promoters Association had made representations
to them about their concern oyer the loan policy; Messrs. Taylor and Wharton had met
Messrs. Endicott and Faulkner, the Chairman had met Mr. Morton and the Secretary had
received a visit from.Mr. Davidson of the P.P.A.
                 1                  *
      Moreover, the Chairman produced a draft resolution which the P.P.A» were proposing
to submit to the Football Trust if the loans were not revoked. The resolution, if
carried, would: mean a review ,of the Football Trust's assurance that they would pass over
three-fifths of their Spottingrthe-Ball income to the Football Grounds Improvement Trust.

      All the Trustees took exception, to the manner in which the matter had been
handled by the Pool Protaotefs Association, but there was some divergence of views as
to whether the ultimatum should be complied with and, if so, on what terms of reference
for the future.

        It was decided to*meet Mr. Morton on Monday 23rd March 1981 at Liverpool at
2 .0 0p.m. in order to attempt to establish future terms of reference. .


136.   SURVEY

      Mr. Chambers of Messrs. Dixon Wilson & Co. w a s invited to join the meeting to
disbuds a survey into the financial requirements of clubB for safety and improvements
over, .the next ten years.

     After much discussion it was decided to restrict the survey to the broad range
of questions relating to safety expenditure over the next five years. Mr. Chambers was
instructed accordingly aiid requested to complete his report before September 1981
if that were practical.

Trustees, subject to the same proviso as was applicable for other loans for improvementfa.

      The Secretary was instructed tp write to Crystal Palace following their letter
informing them that the Trustees were to make a full Review of their policy and would
consider their letter of application, at a future meeting»

      It was suggested that perhaps it would be a good idea to give all clubs a 75%
percentage of work carried out since January 1980. Messrs•> Corderoy &; Co. were instructed
to look into this and produce figures for the next meeting as to what effect this
per&entae# would havi on the                            funds of frusta

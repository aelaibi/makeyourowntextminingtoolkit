The    North          and       North          West      Pen       of     the     Leppings            Lane       end     at    this      time

were    on       the       field           were     mostly           walking           around         in    a    daze       but     it   became

very    apparent                that         the    vast       majority              of    them       had       been     drinking

heavily.          They          were         venting          there        anger          upon    the       Police          and     whilst

stood       at    this          gate         to    the     North          Pen,       we    were       approached              by    a member            of

incident            which          had    caused           the          Liverpool             fans    to       attack          him    in    anger.

His      camera          equipment             which           he       had    with       him       was    being          kicked       and        spat

at      by    the       fans.       In a n       effort             to       protect          him    we    tried          to    keep       the

Liverpool               fans       away       but     they          were       so    intent          to    get       at    him.        The        abuse

coming            from       persons          still        left          in    the       North       and       North       West       Pens        as

well         as    from       on    the        field.          Whilst          there          coins       began       to       rain    down          on     us

from         the    terraces             at     the       press          man       and    ourselves.             The       only       way       we

could         protect          him       was     to       get       him       out    and       for       his    own       safety,          he     took

off      his       press       jacket           and       put       all       his    equipment             away.          Three       of    us       who

were         on    the       gate    then        formed             a    circle          or    sorts       around          him       and

attempted               to    run    through              the       Liverpool             fans       on    the       field       and       to

safety.            As    we    made       our        way       through             the    crowd          the    photog raphe rs                 camera

equipment               and    bags       were        kicked             all       over       the    pitch,          we    were       spat        on      by

fans         who    were       obviously              drunk             and    angry.          We    eventually                managed          to     get

him      to       safety       at    the        Nottingham                   Forest       end.           I then       went       back       to       the

 The     most       striking             thing        about             being       on    the       field       with       the       Liverpool

 fans        was    how       many       had     been          drinking             and       some       very    heavily.             It    was

 often        difficult             to     understand                   them       when       they       asked       for       information

 regarding              relatives              etc.       By    this          time       as    things          began       to    quieten             down

 on     the       field       and    the        decision                was    taken          to    abandon          the       game,       I was

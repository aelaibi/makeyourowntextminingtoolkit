Lead Department for Disasters in Sports________


1.   It is now some time since I discussed with Alex Stewart
whether it would be sensible to nominate your department to take
the lead in any central Government response to future disasters
in sports grounds.   At that time it was agreed that, although
responsibility for legislation had passed from the Home Office
to you it made sense to leave lead department responsibilities
with the Home Office.    This recognised the fact that the Home
Office already had contingency arrangements in place and that you
as a new department were still settling down.    The Home Office
would, of course, have worked closely with you had there been a
sports ground disaster; luckily there has not.

2.   I have recently visited all nominated lead departments to
discuss their contingency plans and in particular problems that
might arise should they need to be implemented.      Home Office
officials asked me whether the time was now right for you to take
over full lead department responsibility in this area.

3.   As you may be unfamiliar with the lead department concept
it might be helpful for us to meet and discuss the matter.     If
you agree will you please set your secretary to contact mine (Sue
Chapman 270 0096) to arrange a convenient date, time and venue.
You may wish to read Chapter 6 of the Home Office publication
'Dealing with Disasters' *ISBN 0-11-341044-1, HMSO price £7)
which explains how central Government fits into the response to
emergencies in this country in order to get some idea about what
is involved.
                     O /v ,
4.   I shall look forward to meeting you early in the New Year.

Planning Division).

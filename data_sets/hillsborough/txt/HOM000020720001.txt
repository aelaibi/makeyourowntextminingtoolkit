  Reference is made to the rules and the general definitions in the

  Ministerial Decree of 30 November 1983.

 ARTICLE 3

  In particular, access and manoevring areas for emergency vehicles must

  meet the following requirements !

  Free height s not less than k metres

in both directions, or equal to the total width of the exits if access is

possible in only one direction.

Otherwise, uncovered 6paces must be provided, of an area sufficient to

contain spectators, within a radius of 50 from the exits, supposing a

crowd density of one person per aquare metre.

 sub paragraphs of the ministerial decree of 16 February 1982 must use structures

 conforming to REI 90; communications being allowed through smoke-proof filters

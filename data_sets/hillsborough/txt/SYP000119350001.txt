             On or about 5th April,                  1989,    I was asked           to peform duties       in uniform

             in connection w it h the F.A.                   Cup Semi "-final match between Liverpool

             and N o t t i n gh a m Forest         football       clubs?       to take     place on S a t u r d a y , 1->th

             Apr i1„      1989,     at Hillsborough.              I was     informed that         insufficient

             uniformed offices              has v olunteered           to work on this date.

             On Saturday,           15th April,         1989,     I reported for duty in uniform at

             Police H e ad q ua r te r s r Snig Hill,              Sheffield,         as   instructed.       At 9.00

             a .m . that date          I aten de d at West Bar Police Station,                      Sheffield,       for a

             b r i e f i ng .

             At the briefing             I was     informed of my duties               for the day.        Together

             with Police S er geant 840 Wright                      of A t te rc li ff e Police Station.             I was

             to be       in charge of serial              numbered       13,    consisting      of eight     officers

             from that station.                 After     the briefing had            concluded,      wit h Sergeant

             Wright and the             serial,      I commenced duties at the S he f fi e ld M idl an d

             Rail wa y Station.             The    serial      together wit h other            serials,     under    the

             command of Police               Inspector Dewes was               involved     in football      supporter

                 reception at the          railway station.              The    first of the L iv erpoo l

             supporters          on service        trains arri ve d at around               11.00 a.m.       F ro m that

             time on the L iverpool                supporters a rr iv in g were             placed on special

             buses       laid on to take            them to the ground at Hillsborough.                      Eac h of

the buses      left     the station when full,              w ith a two man Police             escort,

taken from the serials                present.     Up until        1.00 p.m.       the two men

escorting a bus were                returning wit h the empty bus from the ground to

the station.           As    it was    to be our     duty to be on standby at               the ground

during    the match,          after    1.00 p.m.     officers were          instructed      to remain

at    the Police Room at H i ll s bo r ou g h until               the full    serial     was     re­

grouped,       I left        the M i dl an d S t at i o n on a full        bus of supporters,

together wit h two men from my serial,                      at around       1.30 p.m.      At that

time some of the serial                had a l re ad y    left for the ground,           Sergeant

W right   remained at the Stat i on to follow with the                        remainder        of the

serial    on later          buses.

I arri v e d at       the ground shortly after S . 00 p.m.                   I reported to the

Police R oom and grou p e d the serial.

By 2.30 p.m.          the full       serial    was av ai la bl e at the Police Roo m on

standby.     Shor t l y after         that time the serial           was    i nstructed to move               to

a position       behind the          turnstiles    (inside        the ground)       w hi ch gave

access    to the N o rt h Stand.              We were     r e- al located    call    sign serial         63.

O n arrival      at that       position       I could see      through the t urnstile s               that

there was a serious             problem with       crushing        inside.        There was      no

o rderly queueing,            people were       pushing     to get through the turnstile

gates.     The    people       coming through the turnstiles were                    in a very-

d istressed      condition.           It was    clear     that they had been           in a very bad

crush.     Some of the          people were       trying     to    catch their       breath,

a lt h o u g h none    1 saw     required      immediate     first aid.           Ot he rs who    came

through,     either         thro ug h panic,     shock     or drink,       were    very a ggressive

towards myself and other                officers     present.        Many of the        people had

obviously been drinking                heavily.

The    turnstiles are          positioned       in pairs.         At the    point where        I was

there was an elderly ma n operating                      the turnstile       to my     right,     a

youn g e r ma n wit h        long    shoulder    length dark hair operating               the
                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                       R296

turnstile       to my    left.       The elderly man at one                  point a sked me to check

a ticket     of one supporter             through his          turnstile who had           come through

the wrong       turnstile.          His ticket was            for the West Terrace,               It was

a pp arent   that a lot of other                people       had done exactly the same,                coming

through the wrong            turnstiles.          In an effort            to a ll eviate   the

crushing,       I a sked     both turnstile            operators          to forget about     checking

tickets and to just              freely    let    people       through.       This was an

independent       d ec is io n    I made    because          of what       I could see from       inside

the turnstile.          It was       impossible         to hear       radio messages at that

time.     At one     point       I saw a young          boy aged about          12 being     held

h or iz o n t a l ly above    the    crowd outside.             I reached through the

turnstile and        lifted him through                it.     I stood him wit h a Police

Offi c e r at a fence adjacent              to the turnstile,                instructing     him to

wait    there    for his father.            A short          time    later he was       re-united.

It was    impossible         to get outside            initially but when             1 saw the

crushing     had s ub si de d slightly,            I went       over the turnstile and

outside.        Push in g my way         into the       crowd,       I a t te mp te d to form        it into

orderly queues.            After     some time         I m an a ge d to achieve         this and the

crushing     stopped.

It was whilst        still       outside    the ground that                I heard the     radio message,

'ALL O FF IC ER S TO THE, P I T C H ’ .          I climbed back through the turnstile

and    instructed       two officers        still       inside       to follow me.         We joined

other    officers       running      towards      the S ou th Stand,

I do not know who any of these                    officers were,             I just    ran with them,

believing       there must        have    been some          sort    of    crowd trouble.        The

sit ua ti on was o b vi ou sl y urgent            because       as    I ran the       radio message was

repeated and       I heard a similar message                    come over the ground             public

address      system.       I then saw S er geant Wright was one of the officers

running wit h me.            I went      onto    the    pitch w it h other        officers       via the

S ou t h Stand.      1 saw a number of P o l i c em e n up on the fencing                        1

the Leppings Lane              end g o a l , people      from that enclosure               climbing    the

fence    to get 'out.           From what       I saw and heard over the                  public address

system       I i mmediately       realised       there was a problem w ith                 crushing    in

the    central       pen behind the goal,              numbered 3.        The      crowd at the

Leppings Lane          end,     both    in the    terracing enclosures and                  in the    stand,

was    very noisy.

Know i n g    it would       foe e xtremely d ifficult           to get     people        over the

perimeter          fencing and out        of pen 3,       I entered       pen number 2.             This

enclosure          had much more        space at that        time.       The gate         in the

perimeter          fencing     leading    into number 2 pen was opened for me to

enter.        I    was aware    of other       officers     following me           in there     but am

unable       to    say who   they were.         The    crushing       in number 3 pen was at               its

worst at the front.

People were a l re a d y trying            to climb the          iron railings from the front

of number 3 pen to get                 into number 2 pen.             I went       to the    railings at

this    point.        They are about           six feet    in height.             I climbed onto the

railings and started to assist                    people who were           climbing over.            Holding

one of the spikes              on top of the          railings with my left hand,                  I grabbed

people       inside    pen 3 and        physically       pulled them up and over               the fence.

I was a s s i st ed by people            in pen 3 who        pushed.        I was     conscious       of the

spikes       on    the railings     as people         came over       and used my           right   arm as a

cushioning          barrier,     lifting       people    upwards with            it and    simply

dropping          them backwards        over my head.           The   crowd behind me broke

their    fall.

After    pulling out several              people by this me th od                I began to select

people who          I could see were           clearly    in d i s t r e s s .     I could see       people

were    clearly having           diffi cu lt y breathing          from their f a c e s .           Some were

only being held up by the                 pressure       exerted on them by the               crowd,

literally out          on their        feet.     I shouted to         less d is tr e ss e d men       into

the    crowd to       pass me those        people.        The    lesser d is tr es se d me

                                                                                                      RS29&

impeccably,,      without      panic and    ignoring        their      own obvious           fears    for

personal    safety an d        passed me the        people      I shouted for.               It was

necessary to shout and scream to be heard but                            I pulled several             more

people over the fence and               I was aware        that other         supporters           behind me

we re tending      for   those most       distressed.

After    pulling    in the      region of twenty           people      over the           railings,    I got

my first view of a pile of               people     under     the    perimeter        fence.         They

were    laid in a heap reaching ten to twelve                       feet back        from the        fence,

six or seven deep and along               the    length of the fence.                 My     immediate

thought was       that   the    people    had just        fallen and because                some of the

crowding    had been      relieved,       they were all           going to get             up.     X then

saw a woman"s       face.      She was en ta ng le d         in the      pile towards             the top,

wit h her head hanging           backwards,         her    face was       purple.           I realised        I

had to get to that woman.                I shouted to someone to my                       right to    cup

his hands     to ac co mm od at e my foot,          a s si st in g me to scale              the

railings.      1 cannot        be sure whether         this     person was a Police Officer

or a supporter.          I got over the fence and started                       to try an d free

people    from the ent an gl ed         pile.      It became        immediately obvious               that

many of the       people were alre ad y dead.

Two    supporters were         trying to give         cardiac massage            to a y ou th of

about    twenty years.         They were        not giving m o u t h - t o - m o u t h .          1he youth

was    laid on the steps         of the terracing.              I got d o w n , could not             feel        a

pulse    on the yout h' s       neck.     I gave      the youth two quick                  lung

his m outh and throat with my fingers and tried to get more air                                       into

him.     I gave    further      heart massage         and m o u t h - t o - m o u t h .     the youth did

not    respond.     I left the two supporters w it h him trying                             to    revive

him.     He was obv io us ly d e a d .

free.      I was      s ur ro un de d by supporters             trying    to help but          some,

u n d e r s t a n d a b l y , looking    for    their    friends and       relatives,          were    just

getting       in the way.          I tried to organise             them    into a line          to    carry

bodies towards           the     perimeter       fence    gate,        1 knew there w ou ld be a

gate somewhere           in the       fencing and I hoped to get                 people       out    t hrough     it

to    receive help from the Police O ff icers and St.                            John's A m b u l a n ce m en

on the     pitch.        Whe n    I looked for the gate                I saw it was       still       closed.

There was a pile of bodies                     under    it.    People     from the      crowd were           still

pushing forward agai n st myself and other                         helpers.         The only P o li ce me n

I could see were              still     up on the outside          of the       perimeter       fence.

They were       pulling        people    over     it who were          still    rushing       forward,

scrambling       over     the    b o d i e s , and     c 1 imbi ng up it.         I saw Police

Constable       1775 Hu m ph ri es       on     the fence       pulling a supporter             over.        I

shouted to Police Con st ab le H umphries                       to get the gate         open and to get

some P o l i c e m en    into the       pen to form a line to carry                  people         out.     I

then saw Chief S up er in t en d en t Nesbit at the f e n c e .                       I shouted to him

and made the same              request.        The suppo rt er s        in the     pen were acting

in panic and          it was      impossible       to organise          them,

I had found a y outh             in the        pile still       breathing and        I was      carrying

him towards        the    gate,       a ss is te d by a supporter          not     in panic.          Whilst      I

was    doing    so,     the    crowd was        still    pushing       forward,      I was     kicked in

the    back,    someone        behind me        picked up a length of broken                   crush

barrier and threw              it over     the    perimeter       fence at the Police.                 I was

looking towards Chief S up er in t en d en t Nesbit who was                          organ is in g men at

the    gate    into a line and I saw the                  barrier       land near to him and those

officers.        As     1 neared the gate it was opened and a panicking youth

who    had seen someone            in the       pile of       people    he knew,     jumped onto            the

pile    in front        of me and        in front       of the gate.           The y o u th    laid on top

of the     pile,      crying and totally em ot io na ll y distraught.                          I had to_____

move    him to get        to the gate.            Hr Nesbit       saw this and         came     int

pen to assist.            The youth was         crushed through the gate.                 I was then

able    to pass        the y outh     I was    carrying,       a ss isted by Mr Nesbi t , through

the gate to officers              outside      the fence.           With Mr Nesbit      and other

officers        I began to move         bodies    from the area of the gate.

Once    this was achieved,             other    officers were able to enter                the    pen and

assist     to get       the    injured and dead out.                There was   no way to select

the    living from the dead             in the    pile.        Every    person was       pulled out

and    passed through the gate.                 Others were still          climbing       the fence

whilst     this was       going on.        In the struggle            1 twisted my       right    knee

and    1 felt a very sharp             pain.     1 shouted,          "My knee's    gone."        I was

unable     to s t a n d .     Mr Nesbit       saw this and          instructed me to       leave    the

pen.      He    remained       in there w ith other           officers.     1 recall Police

C on stable Hu m p h ri es      helping me thro ug h the gate and I w a lk e d onto                      the

pitch.         X was    p hysically exhausted.               After    sitting on the       pitch for a

couple of minutes,              the pain      in my knee eased.           I got up,       took off my

Police anorak           and tunic and rejoined the Police,                  taking a position

directly at the gate.                 Chief S up er in t en d en t Nesbit was           still    iri the

pen passing        the      injured through.           I was aware       of another       officer    on

the fence above my head w it h a loud hailer                          organising    the    line.     At

one    point,     after a number of            people    had been passed thro ug h the g a t e ,

the    line was        held up.       Mr Nesbit    shouted to me that the one he was

passing was        still      alive.     Due to the          line    being held up,       I carried

this    person from the           gate onto the         pitch with another          officer.        As we

put him down           I felt    for a pulse      in his       neck.     I could not       feel    one.

1 was     then aware          of Police Sergeant McCall               to my right       bending    over

the youth.         The y ou th had stopped breathing and Sergeant McCall

started m o u t h - t o - m o u t h   re sus ci ta ti on whilst        I gave heart massage.

A lmost    i mmediately after           starting       this,    two doctors       came to the youth

and    continued        to tend him.          I left    to    re-join the       line.     I went    back

inside the        pen after a while.             The    pile of people          seemed bot

they had been          piled several            people    deep    in the well      at the       front       of

the    terracing.          It was my only thought                to get all      the    people       in the

pile out onto the               pitch.     The    physical       effort     involved was

tremendous.          At one stage whilst                in the    pen    I saw S er geant McCall

again giving         heart massage             to an    injured supporter.             Another       officer

was    giving m o u t h - t o - m o u t h .     S om eb o dy shouted,,      " W e ’ve got this        one

going."       He was       lying on the steps             of the terrace.          Most    of the other

people had a l re a d y been taken out of the gate.                           Again,     my thought             was

to get     the supporter           out onto       the    pitch as quickly as            possible.           I

shouted,       "Come      on    let's have him o u t . ”          I went     to pick     the y outh up,

he vomi tted and           I got my fingers             into his m outh to make           sure       his

a ir w a y was    clear.         The youth was          coughing and s pluttering              but    I could

see he then continued to breath.                         A gain Chief S u pe ri nt en de nt          Nesbit

came    to help us and we               carried the supporter             to the gate and            passed

him through        to other officers.

We w or k e d until        all    the    people were       carried out.

1 then saw that a crush barrier had                        completely collapsed. There were

shoes,      coats and          personal       belongings     strewn all       over the front           of the

terracing.          I looked up to see a number                   of individuals         in the West

S t a n d above me shouting and screaming                       obscenities      direc te d at        the

Police.       Some of the          people       remaining       in the pen were         becoming angry

w ith each o t h e r .         Some alle ge d that         others       had been running         forward

and    picking up property from the                     front    terracing.      I was    in     the       pen

but had not         seen this.           A problem w it h a group of              men and        y outh was

s orted out and then              I o rg anised ten Police Officers                from the          pitch to

form a line across               the terracing          h a lf wa y down to preserve           the scene

and    protect      the    lost    property.           Whilst    still    in the    pen w i t h these

officers,        a Police        p h o t o g r a p h e r , De te ct iv e C on stable B o n d , came        into

the    pen to take         photographs          of the scene.           This a g g ra v at e d some of

a n a ggressive manner,          shouting     obscenities.            I r estrained one         of them

and saw Police S er geant McCall              restraining another.               They were       taken

back    behind the       cordon to the top of the terracing.                     D etective

Co nstable Bon d      left the      pen.     I shou te d to the         remaining       crowd    in the

pen to try and        remain cairn.         I exp la in ed that       the man w ith the          camera

had been a Police           photographer and that            he was not       press.      I

e xplained that       the    photographs      had to be taken for the Coroner,                        The

ma jo r it y seemed to accept         this,       others    replied with a b u s e .

The    property    strewn aro un d was        collected and piled on the                 track

around the       pitch.      The Police      in the     pen,   including myself,              then left

the    pen.

There were both Police and               supporters        on the    pitch.      Some    injured

were    still    be i ng a t t e n d e d , both P o 1 ice and supporters          involved       in

carrying      people on a dv er ti sing       boards       used as stretchers.           An

ambulance was       on the      pitch.      The    crowd in the West S ta nd was               not

quiet a lt ho ug h some       individuals were         shouting       obscenities at           the

Police and throwing missiles.                 At    this    time    I could only walk -around

totally shocked and           physically exhausted.                 I tried to console          some

supporters.        One    fan came    to me and identified me as having                       pulled

him from the       crowd.       I did not know whether               1 had or had not,          whether

it was me or one of the hundreds                   of other P o li ce me n there.             In any

event,    he thanked me for           saving his      life and walked away.               The whole

scene was       one of total       shock.     Po li ce Officers         I have    known for years

who are very e x pe ri en ce d men wa lk ed a ro un d with tears                  rolling down

their    cheeks.      Some    stood    in silent      groups whilst        others       tried to

         would    be abandoned.       The     crowd at the Lappings Lane         end a p pl au de d

         whilst    there was jeering          from the S pion Hop.         The   crowd then started

         to disperse,       I remained on the          pitch until    the m aj or it y of   it had     left.

         I found my helmet and tunic             but    could not    find my anorak.        I returned

         to the Police Room area behind the N or th Stand.                   It was   there    X heard

         over    the radio     that my serial      was on Hal ifax Road w ith the           buses     the

         Liverpool       supp or te rs were    to take back    to the    railway station.

         I made my way there and            re-joined my serial.         I remained with them

         until    we were    stood down from the ground at about 7.0 0 p.m.                  that date,

         I then returned to Police H ea dq u ar t er s and went off duty at 9 .00                     p.m.

         that    date.                                                       ----------------

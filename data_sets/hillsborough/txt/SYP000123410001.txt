TO:     SEE DISTRIBUTION:                              DATE:           20 March 1986

          SUBJECT:    SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS - SYP STANDING INSTRUCTIONS
                      FOR THE POLICING OF FOOTBALL MATCHES -
                      'EVACUATION AND STEWARDING'



          The Interim Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety
          and Control of Sports Grounds, under the Chairmanship of
          Mr Justice Popplewell, was published in July 1985 and has been
          supplemented by Home Office Circular 54/85 which urges, amongst
          other things, chief officers of police to respond quickly and
          constructively to the spirit of the recommendations. The report
          contained 24 recommendations including the following:

          Recommendation 1

          'Evacuation procedures should be a matter of police training
          and form part of the briefing by police officers before a
          football match.'

          Recommendation 10

          'Stewards in all grounds should not only be trained in fire
          precautions and fire fighting but should also be trained
          in how best to help the police in evacuation.'

           As you are aware, evacuation plans and the training of stewards
           have been examined. A cannon framework makes reference to plans
           far simpler and allows officers with limited knowledge of the
           stadium to contribute more effectively and with greater speed
           in an evacuation situation.

           In drawing up the suggested format it was acknowledged that
           considerable flexibility is necessary to take account of the
           many local factors that make each ground unique.

           Whilst responsibility for the training of stewards lies firmly
           with the club, the police have a vested interest in maximising
           the crowd management potential of non police resources at sports
           grounds. To this end it is felt the police should provide a
           significant input into the training of stewards and that the new
           appendix on stewarding (attached) provides a satisfactory basis
           for ensuring adequate standards are achieved and maintained.

           Appendix 'L', page 35 of the South Yorkshire Police Standing
           Instructions for the Policing of Football Matches, should now be
           removed and replaced with the new Appendix 'L' pages 35 - 43,
           attached hereto.
           Page 2 of the Index of the Standing Instructions should also be
           amended so that the last line reads - Appendix L 3 5 - 4 3
           Bnsrgency Evacuation Procedures/Stewards.
Following the abolition of the County Councils on 31 March 1986,
District Council Officers will be responsible for Safety of Sports
Ground Act matters as from 1 April 1986, together with representation
of the Local Building Authority, Fire Service and Police. It is not
envisaged that this will have any significant effect on established
procedures and the working party will continue to function as outlined
at paragraph 16.1, page 11, of the Standing Instructions. Reference
made however in that paragraph to South Yorkshire County Council
should be amended to read 'District Council'.

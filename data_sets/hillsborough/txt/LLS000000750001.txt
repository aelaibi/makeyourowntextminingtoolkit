THI S STATEMENT is m ade by me                                      of

                   Liverpool




1.                     I was b o r n on the 17th M a y 1966.             I am e m p l o y e d as

a                 by                                                       at




2.                     O n Saturday the 15th April 1989 I travelled in a

c a r b e l o n g i n g to, and d r i v e n by my mate                    to S h e f f i e l d

Our f e l l o w p a s sengers w ere                    (his brother) and two of

      's friends,       one of w h o s e name    was                  I do not k n o w the

n a m e o f the other., but I h ave found out his name is




3.                     We      arrived at Sheffield at about 1-30pm .                      We

w e r e p a r k e d about one m ile from the Hillsborough ground.                     We

w a l k e d to a public h o u s e near the ground.              I did not n o t i c e the

                        name.         W e all h a d a c o uple of pintsonolfy beer
                                                                               drank-
              A


shandy.            None o f us drank more than two pints and we w e r e not

drunk,    or more t han l i g h t l y inebriated.              After all we w a n t e d

to w a t c h the match, not get legless.                  I didn't have a p r e ­

p u r c h a s e d ticket but s u c c e e d e d in obtaining one in the p u b for

its face value.             I c h e c k e d to ensure that the ticket w a s not

fo rged by c h ecking it against                 >   ticket,    it was identical

apart    fro m the number.




                       We left the public house at about 2-20pm I with

        a n d the lad, whose n ame I n o w know as» went back to the car.

We h a d a couple of s a n d w i c h e s and walked back to the ground.                     The

o t h e r two m ade their o w n way to the ground.                When we got to the

g r o u n d we s a w large c r o w d s at the L e p pings Lane End.

h a d a t i c k e t for the S p i o n Kop End, together with                        Leppings

                                                                              to w a l k at
L an e E n d s e e m e d c h a o t i c and I    land I told
o n c e to the kop end.          |      |and I then walked to the L e p p i n g s Lane

End.       The n          r e m e m b e r e d that he was carrying       5   ticket and

w e w a l k e d back a way from the Leppings Lane entrance d o w n the Leppi n g s

Lane Road.            We met         and                  walked back to the m a i n gate

o u t s i d e the stadium.                 intended to walk round to the kop

e n t r a n c e to the s t a d i u m but there was such a crush when we got

t h r o u g h the gates that all 4 of us w ere carried along into the

g a t e w a y s that had b e e n o p ened inside the ground.




5.                     I w a s c a r r i e d along by the crowd.      I w a s facing

b a c k wards,     I c o u ldn't see w h e r e 1 was going but could hear crys

a n d s c r e a m s of p a i n from inside the ground whilst I w a s in the

t u nnel   .        I had a hat on my head, at one stage I managed to

r e m o v e it but then the p r e ssure o f the crowd was so strong that

I c o u l d n ' t move my a r m and 1 had to let go of the hat.




6.             «       W h e n I r e a c h e d the end of the tunnel a n d into the

s t a d i u m I m a n a g e d to tur n round,   it was completely chaotic screams

c r y s and t e r r i b l e pressure.       I h e a r d someone say "the gate is

o p e n" and I knew he meant the gate at the bottom o f t h e terrace.

S l o w l y the crowd m o v e d towards that gate.            I couldn't move at all.

N e i t h e r my arms nor my legs, although I tried tomake space                for

m y s e l f I w a s a b s olutely petrified.        Everywhere around I could

h ear p e o p l e screaming.         I too s c reamed to people to move b a c k 1

c o u l d h a r d l y breathe.       I must h ave been in there for 10 or 12

m i n u t e s a l t h o u g h it s e emed like forever.       Eventually I found

m y s e l f n ear the gate in the fence near me was a small b o y w h o

l o o k e d age 10 or 12 he had bee n p u shed downwards by t h e pressure

o f the crowd.          He had his arms up near his face, his f ingers forming

fists, his face w a s all white and purple w ith his lips g oing blue

I c o u l d n ' t tell w h a t he was wearing.        His hair w a s cut m e d i u m short
m o u s y brown.           I shouted out to h elp this c h ild out o f the c rush but

I c o ul d n ' t get to him.            I fell out of the gate.             I r a n b a c k t o the

gate and shouted at the Police Officer near the gate w h o w a s dragging

people o u t of the gate about this child,                   to t r y and get the c h i l d out.

I was p u s h e d out of the way either by the P o l i c e m a n or by esca p i n g

crowds.           I fell over.            I w a s dizzy and half crazed and shocked.

I saw another          Po l i c e m a n he was standing doing nothing I s a i d to him

"there's b a stards dying in there;                  there's a little boy in there,

get him out, you're killing us".                       I had g r a b b e d hold o f h i m by his

lapels to make h i m listen to me but he did not want to know and

t h r e w me away from h i m so that I fell down.




7.                         I picked m y self up a n d wa{fed a c o u p l e of y a r d s a n d then

c o l l a p s e d again.        First onto my knees and t h e n onto m y face.                 After

h a l f a m i n u t e I managed to sit up to look into the crowcL                    at the

L e p p i n g s Lane Stand.           I could see people looking down,              I c ould see

m a s s e s o f bodies lying on the ground, people c l i m b i n g over the
             A



fences.           I was n o w c r ying as I got up.




8.                         I s a w on my right a P o lice O f f i c e r w e a r i n g a g r e e n mac.

I r a n to h i m and told h i m "you're k i l l i n g us w h y arn't you doing

a n y t h i n g about it."           I was p o i n t i n g my finger at h i m a n d h e grabbed

me and w a l k e d me over to the Stands, w h e r e my u n c l e saw me a n d took me

o f f him.




9.                         I sat down for a bit telling h i m "there a r e p e o p l e dead

in there,        you don't understand."                People a r o u n d there didn't know

w hat was h a p p e n ^ O Q     they all l o oked at m e as if I was s o f t in t h e head.




10.                   After I calmed d o w n a little I real i s e d that I h a d not

s e e n my m a t e s s i n c e going into t h e tunnel.            I had to see i f they

w e r e a l r i g h t I w ent onto the p i t c h looking for them.
  11.
  ■                  I could see bodies, s o m e lying

  walked to the terrace and s t o o d l o o k i n g for my mates.                                           I s a w a pile

  o f b o d i e s on the terrace, all lying there bodies one on top o f the

  other u n moving a n d I broke d o w n c r ying again.




  12.                Eventually I saw my m a t e s who w ere also still alive, we

  e m b r a c e d each other and went b ack to my uncle.                                  At 4-15 we g o t the

  s t r e n g t h to leave the stadium.                  Near the car t h ere were q u e u e s of

  people t r ying to use the t e l e p h o n e s to            'phone h o m e to tell their

  fa m ilies that they w ere still alive.                      A kind h o u s e w i f e let |
                                                                                            ______ |into

  13.                Since then I h a v e b een to see my Doctor on Tuesday

  a n d a g a i n on Friday a n d then the following Tuesday.                                          I was o r i g i n a l l y

  s i g n e d o f f work for one week.




  14.                O n the monday I c o u l d n ' t sleep, I h a d bad dreams

  e v e r y t i m e I was alone, a w a k e or a s leep all I c o u l d s e e was t h e face

  o f tha t little boy.                    I w ent to the Doctor and broke down in front

  o f her.      Then she s i gned m e o f f for a week.




  15.                O n Friday I w e n t b ack to the D o c t o r still n e r v o u s and

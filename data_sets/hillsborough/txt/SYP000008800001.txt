We were          I*11    in u n if o rm and    I had my St.            Johns              bag

c ontaining             bandages,     t ri an gu la r    slings,       plasters,                 safety       pins,      cotton

wool,        gauze and wet           ones.     B e t w e e n the      g roup             I was with,          we had one

stretcher.               We also     had one     radio     b et we en the                 eight       of us.

As a Cadet my job at a football                          match       is b as i ca l ly the same as an

a dult       member,        that    is to assist         w it h a ny first aid                       required.

I took           up p os ition w i t h my group at a bout 2 . 3 5                          pm.        I sat on a wall

near     to the gate             leading    from Pen       1 West S t a n d T e rr ac e onto                       the    pitch,.

From     this        p os ition I had a clear view all a r o u nd yhe ground,

I w o r k e d at         the semi -f in al m at ch at this g r o u nd j/n 1988 b et we en the

same     teams.

I was        s u rp r is e d this year        to see      that Pen         1 West S t a nd terrace was

f ai r l y       empty.      T here was     some fans       in it but                    there was          plenty of         room

for more.

I sat on the wall                  reading a programme an d at about 2.5 5                                   pm

                   and                        returned      from the              toilet and spoke                  to the

rest     of us.           They     told us that         there was       some              problems          in the middle

st a n d i n g    terraces         of the L ep pi ng s L ana/end.                   I looked across at Pens

3 and 4 are a and                 it    looked very f ul y .            I also          looked at Pe n       1 w hich

still       looked       fairly         empty.                 /

                 ,              and P h i l l i p S A X T ON went           over    to the front        of Pens 3

and 4 to see what                  the    problem was.                       /

The      players were             out    on the    pitch just g e tt in g                ready to start        the

game,        I saw about               ten fans    climbing          tjhe fencing          from Pena 3 and 4

onto       the    edge      of the       pitch.     I also         saw a bout           five   fans being      pulled

up from the            back       of Pen s 3 a nd 4           to the s ea le d a re a of             the West

S t a n d . The       fans      that     had    climbed       over     onto        the edge of       the pitch came

over       to us and sat d o w n .                These fans         just a p p ea r ed brfeathi ess a n d            in

n ee d of a rest             to get       their    breath back.

Whilst       a s s i s t in g     these    fans    I saw that           the m a t c h      had started.         I saw

a    p ol i ce m an    going       onto    the    pitch to speak              to the        referee.      At   this

point       two m en        came       up to me wit h a young                boy age d about S/9 years.

One      of the men told me                that    the       boy was        having an a st h ma attack.               The

boy a p p e a r e d to be just                 starting      to have an attack                 so   I deci de d to

take       him to the           first     aid    room.        I walked        the      boy w ith the      two men

a l o ng    the      edge    of the       pitch by the S o u t h S t a n d and then across                      the

S p i o n K op to the             first ai d      room.

As    I passed the              players        tunnel    I    saw that           the    players were ma ki ng

their       way off         the    pitch towards             the tunnel.

I left       the      boy and the          two me n at         the    first aid           room.      I returned to

the      pitch an d just               before     I got to the         pitch        I met

I looked towards                  the West        S tand and saw that                  about ahund re d    people

we r e     lying      on the       pitch       in front       of the        goal.        T og ether w it h              I

we n t     down the         pitch towar ds         the West Stand.                  There was        fans all    over

the      West S ta nd end at              the    pitch.        We went        from fan to fan             checking

that       they were a lr ight.                  I could see          that       some     fans were     still

pi t c h .      T here was       some       p o li ce me n helping            fans    over    this    fence and

ot he r      p o li ce me n helping           fans       on the    pitch.

Mos t     of the       fans    that                  and    I went        to were      sho eked and

b r ea th le ss .        It was        d if f i c u lt    to decide who           to treat      first.

I went         from fan to fan a sk i ng                 them     if they were alright.                   If they

answered           by que st io ns        and    they      looked a l r i g h t       I left them as         they

w e r e n ’t s e r i o u sl y hurt.

Mos t     of    the    fans    lying        on the        pitch had been             placed    in the      recovery

p o s i ti o n by either          the       police or by St.               J oh ns    members.                and     I

came acr os s a fan on the                      pitch who         had     cuts    to his abdomen.            He was

lying        on the      pitch s o m e w h e r e at the West S t a n d                 end.     We    picked this

man     up and w al ke d         him to the              first aid        room.       He was    conscious when

we    f ound him and his                 injuries         did not a p pe a r         like threatening.             This

shaven.

As we        got     to the e nt ra nc e         leading        to the first aid              room wit h this

patient         I saw the first a m b u l a nc e                coming        onto    the    pitch.       It was    the

St.     J ohns ambulance.

Having         left    this     c as ualty at the             first ai d         room we      returned to the

pitch.          We were       called a lm o st            i m me d ia te ly    by a P o l i c e m a n to a fan

po i nt                           a S t . Jo h ns         Cadet    called me over             to a man with

b lo od      coming      out of his           ear.

The ma n w it h                 was    sat    on the     pitch smoking a cigarette.                   I looked

at    this ma n an d saw blood                  coming    out    of one      of his    ears-     This

i n di ca te d that        he may        have    had a skull       injury.          We told him to        lie

d own    but he         refused.       |        and   I had to force          him to    lie down.         He

appeared         very     confused.           He was a white man,             in his forties,           I think

he was       short,       p os si bl y w i t h a m oustache.

W hi l st    w ith      this man a s te w ar d         came to us an d a sk ed us            if we needed

so m et h in g     to    carry this          c as ua lt y a wa y on.        I said that we did and he

went     a wa y and       r et ur ne d w it h a h oa rding         board.       We    placed this m an on

the     board a n d the          cadet,!              together     w it h    some    fans who were        his

friends         carried him to the first aid                     room.

I r em ai ne d on the            pitch going          from fan to fan          checking      that     they were

air i g h t .

Fire     crews were            on the      pitch by this         time and were trying            to

r e su sc it at e       fans    lying a r o u n d     the goal.        T he re were     lots of fans           in

front an d behind               this     goal    w ith their      faces      covered up.        They were

o b v i o u s l y dead.

1 was       very     shoc ke d and         crying     by this     time.       I was w an d er i ng about

the     pitch and bu mp ed             into an adult St Johns               member.      T og et he r   w ith

that     member         1 went     back      to the    first aid       room.

In the       first ai d         room     I assisted       by talking        to fans and making           sure

that     they were         conscious.            I also    took    deta il s    of some fans and wrote

them     in the         casualty       book.

Most     of the worst            cases       had been taken to hospital                by this      time.

T hose      that were          left were w a lk in g w o u n d e d or         less    serious    stretcher

cases.          I remained         in the       first aid       room until      all    the   casualties         had

been t aken away.

I r et urned         to the      pitch but there was              no further         casualties       to deal

with.        11 was a bout 4 . 4 5            pm.     I d e ci d ed that      there was      nothing      else      I

could do so             I left     the     gr ou nd and    r et urned       home.

Thank you for your fax today. I am sorry to hear that the Hillsborough Family
Support Group are unable to m eet the Home Secretary on Saturday 21 March.

I know th at the Home Secretary w anted to continue the adjourned meeting in
Southport with you as soon as he w as available so that it w as fresh in
everybody's minds. I would be grateful if in due course you could perhaps
suggest some dates that would be more convenient for you.

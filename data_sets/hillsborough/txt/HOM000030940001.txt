       PREPARATION OF STATEMENTS FOLLOW ING THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

       Thank you for your letter o f 12 December 1997. Having carefully considered the draft I think it
       would be sensible for me to take some advice before deciding what comment if any to make.

       You asked that comment should reach you “if possible” by Monday 5 January 1998 and I wonder if
       you would be kind enough to extend this time to Friday 9 January 1998.

       Yours sincerely

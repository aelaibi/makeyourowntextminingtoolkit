             I am a married man and live at the above address with my wife,



             I am employed as an




             season ticket holder for the                       ’COP' and I attend quite alot of

             the away matches.

                                           obtained my ticket by sending away for it to

            Anfield.        He usually organises the purchasing of the tickets so as we

            all got either seats or a standing position together.                                  I believe the

             ticket actually cost £6 for the semi final match at Hi 1lborough on the

             15th April      1989 (150489) and was for the Leppings Ln entrance.

           At about half past eleven on the morning of the s emi -fi-fia1 I

            ollected from my home address by friends,               namely,             and

                     in their car.           We all then went to Hemsyprth where we swopped

           vehicles and collected
C          We all then travelled in the same c a r t o w a r d s Sheffield.              We stoppe<

      jVoff    on t^Ke way to go to a public fytftse but I don't know which district
                 /                          _
           this was in or the name of it. y^le had a few games of pool, and one

           rotjifld of drinks, mine beingySn non-alcoholic one.               We then preceeded

           af^ain towards Sheffield. X l believe along the A61 where we encountered

           a small traffic jam wh*ch delayed our journey by about five to ten

           minutes.            We finally ended up at a public house in Oughtibridge but

           again I don't ktWw then name of it.                The reason we used this

           particular pub is that it is familiar to us as we have used it before,

           when attending games at the Hillsborough ground.                   I can't

           really say exactly what time we arrived at this pub but I would say it

           would be about              13 15hrs.

           Inside this pub I saw about another twenty Liver pool supporters

           dr i nk i n n   a   n r T l<npin fnnr nf them.   These four were

                 t               and                 We obviously all had a drink, mine again
    %J >

           being non-alcoholic before setting off in the car towards the ground.

           I believe we left the pub at around about               1355hrs and as I have said

           drove to get closer to the ground.               We eventually parked the car

           in a side road about a mile and a half from the ground.                      We then

           proceeded on foot towards the Leppings Ln entrance.                  We knew where

           this entrance was as I have been to the ground before but on arrival

           there I was very surprised at the amount of people waiting.                        We

           probably arrived              at about ^ T ^ h ^ ) a t the entrance but there were no

           queues evident only a mass of people.                The mass of people expanded

           from the turnstiles across the expanse and all the way back to the

           metal gates at Leppings Ln.               Myself and my friends joined onto the
                                                                        PAGE     3
                                                                        S2046

back of this crowd and within a matter of minutes we were completely

penned in from behind by other people joining on the back.         It was at

this stage that I was separated from my friends and due to he sheer

volume of people in the crowd I began to get crushed.          In the crush I

was unable to decide where I was going as I was just being pushed

               force of the crowd.     The crush in places became so bad

                 intention became just to stay on my feet.       I saw amongst

               o police officers on horseback who were shouting at

               k off.     The one rider tried a manoeuvre to give people

                 gaps that he made were quickly filled and he

                o be adding to the problem.     After this I wasn't   really

                was going on around me as I was just concerned about my

                  I      eventually managed to get in the ground through the

               it I'm not fully aware which ones.       I handed in my ticket

as I went through and my counterfoil was torn off.

Obviously inside
          i      the ground there was alot more room so I began to

look round for my friends that I had been separated from.          I saw

          on top of the turnstiles    r oo f , he had already gained access to

           but/was obviously concerned about his uncle arid was
the ground but

                 g this as a vantage point to look outside.       He was

                a Police Officer to get down but he didn't until his

                      We all met up just inside the turnstiles at a couple

   minutes to three arid proceeded to the toilets.         Inside the ground I

couiu duviuub*y see the tunnel       leading to the terraces with the

                3ING' written above it.     We however knew that the tunnel

ground,   a     scause they are the most    puplar   position they always seem       '

                □wded.    We usually on previous visits to the ground stand          j

                this particular occasion was no exception.      We all walked

round     e corner towards the North stand,     went up a flight of steps

 which brought us out onto the standing terraces slightly elevated up

     from pen 7.      There was quite a lot of room on Jjjffi s terrace and it gave

     a good view of the pitch and ground.             0n ,   ching this point we had

     just missed the team kicking off so I quickly got engrossed in

 watching them play.               It as just after BEARDSLEY'S shot hit the bar

     that    I became aware of peoplr climbing over the fence onto he pitch

     area from the \ e n t r a l          behind the goal.   I couldnt actually see a

     great deal of wha^tSas going on in these pens but it was obviously

     that they were very crowded.             More and nwre people began to scale the
                                                     jr "
     fencing and it became apparant to mj^/fhat something was wrong rather

     than it being a pitch i n v a s i o n . y r h e game was stopped and people began

     to help these getting out. ^I nitially the police seemed to be pushing
\r                                     j/r'
     people back into the pejn^obviously believing that they were invading

     the 'Ditch.    However/H,hey soon changed their opinion and began helping

     out whilst a n o j ^ r   batch of police formed a line cross the halfway

     I   in e .

     Parts of the fencing was eventually torn down enabling more

     people to escape onto the pitch. That             part of the pitch then became

     very busy with people and I realised that some people had died as

     coats were     draped over their faces.         I wanted to get onto the   pitch in

     order to help but due to my elevated            position was unable to.    We

     stood watching the incident as more and more             people came onto the

     ground and eventually ^eft the stadium about             1615hrs.   I therefore had

     rio dealing    with any of the casualties and can't really describe any of

     these that     were obviously deceased.

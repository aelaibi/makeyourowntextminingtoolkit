              am writing on behalf of the FSA tc
            :he p r o po sa ls set out in the Taylor Report.

            As  you will   recognise,     the report    has  great significance  to
            football   suppor te rs and their    re la tionship  with the  football
            authorities, the c lu bs th e y support and the police services.

            Consequently, I would like to suggest a meeting with you anc! your
            De partment and o r g a n i s a t i o n s representing football supporters
            (The   Federation of        Football        Suppor te rs Clubs  and the  FSA) tc
            discuss   what role       football s up po rt er s      can  play in  helping to
            implement the report.

            I hope you can agree to this request.

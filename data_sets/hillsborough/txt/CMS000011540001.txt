Dear Mr

I have been asked to reply to that part of your letter to the
Prime Minister concerning Lord Justice Taylor's report on the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster.  I apologize for the delay in
doing so.

As you may know, the Secretary for State for National Heritage,
who has responsibility for safety at sports grounds, decided in
the light of the numerous representations received from the world
of football in favour of retaining some standing accommodation,
to review the requirement for all-seater stadiums at certain
categories of grounds.

The Government decided that it would be wrong to review either
the principle or the timetable for all-seating at First Division
grounds in the Football League (the new Premier League). They
believe that it is essential that our top clubs meet the
standards necessary to compete in Europe and make full use of
the resources available to them to provide grounds of which we
can all be proud as we enter the 21st Century.

Following consultation, the Secretary of State announced on the
10 July that the all-seating requirement would also be retained
for clubs in the present second division. However, third and
fourth division clubs will be able to retain some standing
accommodation at their grounds, providing the terracing is safe.
I enclose a copy of the press release which sets out the
Secretary of State's announcement in full.

Yours sincerely



Miss G Houldsworth

I've spoken to Sue Ward about this letter, and explained that I'm
passing it on to Alex. What I can't work out is why the letter
actually seems to have been copied to Alex already as Ms Ward
insists the only person in DNH she's sent a copy to is me (well
Barbara Buchanan who I replaced), as that is the only contact
name she has.

Anyway, I hope you can sort it out!

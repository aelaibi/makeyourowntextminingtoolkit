                Policemen            trying          to      keep     order          there       wa s    pushing           and       shoving.              I

                h ad    gates        on     them.              I think          they       tried        to    sh ut       them       but    I d o n ’t k n o w

                if t h e y      d id or         not.




                The     pushing           and       shoving          w as      getting         worse         then a Po l i c e m a n            backed             his

was     a    look      of     sheer        desperation.                  I knew      t hat    something             w as    very

wrong,          I could        feel        the     life       b eing      squeezed         out     of me.           I thought              I

w as    going         to    die,       I could          h ear    Policemen           screaming           at    us    to     get       back

but     the      pressure            was     tremendous.




To m y       left      I could          se e a m a n w ho             c o u ld    have     die,     he wa s         a grown man

all     his      f ace w as          b lu e a n d       his     e y es    were     wide      open       he    looked        dead,          our

                     saw    this       man    first       but      I told         h im    j ust    to    concentrate              on

breathing.                 I thought          we    were        all      going     to     die.      I couldn't              see w h a t

anyone          was    wearing          all       I could move             was     my     head.




After        what      felt       like a          lifetime         th/f c r u s h        ease d.        I pulled           the    other

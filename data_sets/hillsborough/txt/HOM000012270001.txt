 With        permission,              Mr         Speaker,          I    should           like           to       make        a

Lord     Justice            Taylor         also      recognises                 the        great        potential

value of          the p o l i c e      National              Football           Intelligence                 Unit    in

travelling              t o ma t c h e s     abroad.



As   I   have         said,       Lord       Justice          Taylor            takes         the      view     that

better      facilities             and      better           treatment               of    fans w ill          bring

better      behaviour.               Beyond t h a t ,               the       Re por t       recommends             the

creation           of       three      new        specific                offences              to      apply        at

designated            sports       grounds:              throwing              a missile;                chanting

obscene       or         racialist           abuse;                and        going        onto        the     pitch

without           reasonable               excuse;                  and         it         also        asks         for

consideration               to    be g i v e n      to       extending               the     courts'         powe r s

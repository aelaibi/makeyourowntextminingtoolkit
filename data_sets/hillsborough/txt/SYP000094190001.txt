                   the match with his father who was later also arrested for being drunk

and disorderly by another officer.                        was extremely drunk

and had to be handcuffed en route to the Charge Office.             After further

patrol    duties we attended at We' ^ Bar Police Station for meal, at 3 pm

(1300).

About 3. 10 pm (1510) we received a c:a1 iN^o attend at SWFC to give

assistance and we left West 8ar\imme dlately and made our way to

Hillsborough arriving there at 3,Et!iL pm (15S0).         We reported to the

Police Room and were       instructed to stJkjnjlby under the North Stand and

await further       instructions.   Along with numerous other officers I was

      standby until 3.30 pm (1530) when we were instructed to go onto

the pifc'sji.     At all times I was taking my orders from PS Stuchfield.

Once on the ^wAch I went to the centre         line and was    instructed to form

part of the cordon.        At that time I had cause to speak to many fans,

many of them the worse for drink, and as I was not fully aware of the

gtc^ve c i r curnstances of the situation at that time I initially thought

we w e r e M e a l i n g with a public order situation.   At 3,40 pm (1540)     I

was    instructed by PS Stuchfield to go with him and. other officers

into Leppings LaHe and we left the ground through t h e .uncovered

seating area and wen^, into Leppings Lane to assist dispersal           of the

Liverpool       fans.

At 4.10 pm (1610) with other officers         I went   into Penistone Rd to

assist fans leaving by buses and then I patrolled to the city centre

with PC 1354 Wortley and at 6.0 pm (1800)         I rejoined PS Stuchfield

at the Midland Station.

1 then    continued licensing duties until 3.0 am (0300).

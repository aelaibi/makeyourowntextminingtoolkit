CALCULATIONS OF COLLAPSE LOAD OF BARRIER 124A BY PROFESSOR R SMITH.
DEPARTMENT OF KECHANICAL ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD

Dr Nicholson has asked me co send you this facsimile transmission of the draft
report prepared by Professor R Smith on the collapse load oi Barrier 124A.

Please accept my apologies for the quality of the diagrams in the report, but
the originals were not very clear.

As you will see from the contents of the report, particularly Fig 2, Professor
Smith assumed that the tube forming the upper rail of Barrier 124A had a
uniform wall thickness and considered thicknesses of 4 nun, 2 nun and 1 mm.
                                                                c^t
RLSD has calculated the Plastic Section Modulus of the tube(each end of spans
2/3 and 3/4 where failure occurred. The results of R L S D ’s calculations are
shown on the four sheets following Professor Smith’s report. Numerical
integration, assisted by computerised calculation oi the areas associated with
each 2 mm elemental strip, was used to determine each Plastic Section Modulus.
The basis of our calculations was the cross-section shown on each sheet., this
being re-constructed from the measurements made at each end of the tubes which
had formed spans 2/3 and 3/4. This work was undertaken whilst Professor Smith
was making his calculations of collapse load.

RLSD then calculated a uniform wall thickness which corresponded to      each
Plastic Section Modulus using 60 mm for the external diameter of the tube, as
assumed by Professor Smith. The results of RLS D ’s calculations are summarised
below.

I have calculated the uniformly distributed load to cause plastic collapse of
span 3/4 (with clamped ends) as being 10.91 kN/m, using the expression in
Section 6 of Professor Smith’s report, with the appropriate Plastic Section
Moduli for Ma and Me from the Table above. I calculated the collapse load to
be 8.78 kN/m if span 3/4 is simply supported at end 4.

Almost all of Span 3/4 of Barrier 124A can be subjected to a crowd depth of
7 m, or 18 steps of the terrace. I used a formula suggested by my colleague
Mr Games, and subsequently developed by Professor Smith to that shown in
Appendix 2 of his report, to calculate the packing densities to cause span 3/4
of Barrier 124A to collapse. I used the parameters adopted1 by Professor Smith
and calculated that 8.2 persons/sq m on 18 steps behind barrier 124A would
                                                                   S^Vi 2


cause span 3/4 to collapse if both ends were clamped. If end 4 were simply
supported then a packing density of approximately 6.6 persons/sq m on 18 steps
behind Barrier 124A would cause span 3/4 to collapse. H S E ’s estimates of the
packing density behind barrier 124A were 8.1 persons/sq m (2nd row)and
7.6 persons/sq m [3rd row).

Summary

Collapse loads have been calculated for the spans 2/3 and 3/4 of barrier 124A
which was broken down during the Hillsborough Stadium incident. If the
barriers had been of the original thickness at the supports, loads of 2.2 and
1.6 times the test load of 6kN/m would have been needed to collapse the barrier
at spans 2/3 and 3/4 respectively. If the wall thickness had been reduced to
1mm, these ratios fall to 1.4 and 1.25 x test load.

These figures have been compared with barrier loads generated from a 'leaning
crowd' model. In 1mm thick condition for a crowd of measured density ~8/nr,
the barrier would have been broken down by a crowd of approximately 5.8m depth
behind the barrier. A crowd of some 7m depth existed directly behind span 3/4.
If the crowd density of 5.4/m is assumed, the same tube would have required
about 7.5m of crowd to break it down. It's survival would have been marginal.

        1     Introduction

              During the incident which occurred at Hillsborough Stadium on
              15 April 1989, two bays of barrier 124A, Fig 1, were broken down. Tnis
              report attempts to calculate collapse loads for the barrier and to compare
              these loads with the pressures likely to have been generated by the crowd.

               Examination and mechanical testing of the broken barrier by staff of the
               Health and Safety Executive (KSE) w , revealed that the horizontal tube
               had been manufactured from wrought iron and was probably over sixty years
               old. The upright supports were made from mild steel. The tube was
    ov*        attach^ to the uprights by straps, underneath which considerable corrosion
              ~of the tube had occurred. ^

        2     Material properties

              Tensile tests from 2 specimens taken from the tube gave average tensile
              strength of 366MPa, 0.2% proof stressips of 259MPa and an estimated elastic
              limit of 150MPa. For calculations ofplastic collapse loads a flow stress,
              calculated as a mean of the tensile strength and 0.2% proof stress, equal
              to 312.5MPa was used. A value of Youngs Modulus of 190GPa was assumed.
                                                                    "~~        <£o

               Fully plastic moments were calculated as a product of the flow stress fly
               and the plastic modulus:




               Values of these functions are calculated in Appendix l. The original tube
               had an outside diameter of~ 60mm and an approximate wall thickness of 4mm.

        4      Elastic deflections under test loading

               The elastic deflection at the centre of a beam of length L, built in at
               both ends and subjected to a -uniformly distributed load w, is given by
               wL4/384EI.v^ If the ends are simply supported, the deflection is
    y          increased by a factor of 5 . S

               For a span between supports (L) of 2.2m, subjected to the test loading of
               6)<N/m, a figure prescribed, by the "Green Guide"( >, a central deflection
               of 6.9mm is obtained! If-the ends are free, the deflection increases to
          v    34.5xrriu The deflection^observed frcm actual test records correspond more
               closely to the fixed end condition. In the calculation which follows, the
               central span (2/3) of barrier 124A has been treated as having fixed ends.
               Ihe outer span (3/4), probably nearly approximate to this,, but for
               comparison, calculations have been repeated treating end 4 as siirply
               supported.
        5     v-ip-1diner under test conditions

              For the span 2/3, the clamping moments are wL2/12. First yield will
              occur when these moments equal 2-CyI/D. If the estimated elastic limit of
              the material (150MPa) is assumed, then first yield corresponds to 3.4kN/m,
              or just over half of the test load. 0.2% proof stress gives a first yield
              load of 5.9kN/m. Subsequent loading up to test loads of 6kN/nt will be
              elastic because of the strain hardening capabilities of the material.

        6        relations of plastic collapse loads

              The wall thickness of the tube under the straps at 2, 3 and 4 was found to
              be much reduced by corrosion. The reduction in thickness was not uniform
              round the circumference; calculations of the exact fully plastic moments of
            &         the as-measured sections are continuing. The following calculations are
              based on the plastic moments of the original tube (wall thickness 4mm), and
v   ^         values for uniformly reduced wall thickness of 2 and Urtm. Using the
              measured flow stress (312.5MPa) , and Appendix 1, the following fully
              plastic moments were obtained (OD constant 60mm):

              where suffixes 1, 2 and 4 refer to 1, 2 and 4mm wall thickness.

              The general case of plastic collapse for a beam of length L is shown below:




                                                  /


              where m a and M q are the moments at the supports and MB is the moment
              at the centre of the beam. The collapse load is

                        wc = 4 (2Mb + Ma + Me)
                             L2
                                                                                                ~RS £

      The standard case we take is for the original beam (t = 4xnm) built-in at
      both ends, ie span 2/3 of barrier 124A. Denoting the collapse load for
      this case as w4 , and noting MA = M q = MB = M4

                   w4 = 16M4 = 13.2 kN/m
                       17
      Now denoting the moments corresponding to the reduced wall thicknesses of
      2 and Urtm as M2 and    respectively and noting that the moment Mg at
      the centre is not reduced by corrosion (ie always equal to M4), the
      following table results:

      All collapse loads in kN/m.             The hinge is not exactly in the centre.
      Accurate calculation gives              = 0.73, a negligible difference.


      As multiples of the test load of 6kN/m, the above table reduces to:

                                                                      (Span 3/4)

            t = 2mm                     1.7                                      1.4

            t = 1mm                     1.4                                      1.25



      Tests performed by Dr Eastwood on a similar, but not identical barrier,
      after the incident, shewed that a load of 9kN/m (test load x 1.5) was
      sufficient to cause very large permanent deformation of the tube. The
      r^lriniatgri collapse loads .therefore appear to be realistic values.

7     Collapse mode

      If the ph^T* strength is assumed to be 75% of the tensile strength, then to
      directly shear a lmm wall thickness of tube, a load of 48kN/m is required.
      This is -many times higher than the plastic collapse load of 8.4kN/m. This
    evidence, together with the bent shape of the tube after the incident,
    supports the view that barrier failure occured by plastic collapse of the
    tube. If prior collapse of the legs had taken place, the tube $ild not
    have been bent in the manner which was observed.

8   Estimates of crowd forces acting on barriers

    A model of the build up of crowd pressure due to spectators leaning forward
    to obtain a better view has been developed, see Appendix 2. Figure 2 shows
    the barrier forces generated by crowds of densities 10, 8 and 5.4/m on a
    terrace of step height and width matching those of the site of the_
    incident. The test load of 6kN/m corresponds to a crowd of approximate
    depth 6.2m behind a barrier if the density is 5.4/m2 . This reduces to a
    crowd of depth of 4.2m if the density increases to 10/m . Densitv
    measurements taken from photographs have given a density of 8.11m behind
    barrier 124A and 7.5/m2 behind barrier 149.

    Bracketed values for the collapse loads of tubes of 4, 2 and 1mm have been
    added. The upper value corresponds to both ends damped (Span 2/3) , the
    lower value to one end clairped, the other sirrply supported (Span 3/4) . For
    a density of 8/m2 , the approximate collapse loads for 4, 2 and 1mm tubes
    correspond to 7.2, 6.4 and 5.8m of crcs^i. Since the Span 3/4 of barrier
    124A was unprotected by barrier 136, a crowd of 7m was able to exert
    pressure on this part of the barrier. Given the approximation of the crowd
    loading model, these figures adequately explain the collapse of the
    barrier. If the crowd had been restricted to 5.4/m2 , then the depths
    needed to collapse the 2 and 1mm thick tubes are 8 and 7.5m, whidh are just
    in excess of the depths whidh existed and indicate survival of the barrier
    perhaps by a very small margin.

APPENDIX 2


A vleaning' crowd model to estimate the loads generated bv a barrier

Consider a person on the n ^ step behind a barrier. The whole crowd is
assumed to be up on its toes, inclined, forward at an angle 8, in a fashion
which would be adopted to obtain a view of an incident in the front of the
crowd. The spectator is leaning forward on a support provided by the person in
front and is thus subject to supporting force P^, from the front and to a
toppling force Pn_;i_, from the person behind, offset by the terrace step
height h.

For the person immediately behind the barrier, if the barrier is at the push
height, then clearly P_ would be transmitted to the barrier. In general the_
barrier is lower than this, and the push is probably transmitted to the barrier
by bending at mid-height for the few rows of people just behind the barrier.
If this were not so, the person at the barrier would be subjected to a large
turning moment. The exact details of this force feed to barrier height are not
yet clear, but for this purpose it is assumed that Pn , where n is the
number of steps behind the barrier in question.

If the step width is w and the crowd density N/m2, then we obtain the
force/unit length of the barrier as:

              F/unit length = N w iru H sin 6
                                      h


which is the expression evaluated on Fig 2. A 'lean' angle of 10c has been
estimated in the calculation; other parameters are declared on the Figure.

              I am a Police Constable              in the South Yorkshire Police at present

               stationed at Hackenthorpe,



              On Saturday 15 A p r i 1 1989 (130489)           I was on duty and I was         involved      ir

              duties   connected with the FA cup semi final                 taking place at

              Hi 11sbo rough.



              I commenced duty at 8.00 am <0800)               that d a y   ,starting   from C l a y w h e e 1s

              Ln traffic office.        During that day I worked with POL PC 2696 R A D L E / .



              After our briefing at Woodall Motorway Police Post,,                  it was our

              particular duty to patrol             the A616 from the Middlewood area of

              Sheffield to the crossroads at the Flouch Public House.                       This we did.
                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                  S3137

           for the majority of the day until approx 3.05 pm (1305)        that

5 . o £.   afternoon,     we were summoned by the operations   room to proceed to

D£ftcNvjU3\/TL-eppings Ln, Hillsborough at the junction with Catch Bar Ln.       We were
Qf         directed there to block the road on Leppings Ln, to the football
fbuc.£.    ----------     -----------------------------------------
           ground, to prevent all traffic, except emergency vehicles, from

           travelling on that road.      We arrived there at 3.15 pm (1515) and set

           up a diversion.      We were soon joined by other officers from the Road

           Traffic division who assisted us with the task.



           Soon after this the Liverpool     football   supporters emerged from the

           ground at the Leppings Ln end and many of them walked along Leppings

           Ln,   past our location to go to their various forms of transport.          Man

           of these supporters were shouting and hurling abuse at us, making

           comments     relating to the incident   inside the ground.   Many of them

           came up to us face to face to vent their anger.        It was here that     I

           noticed that the majority of them who were shouting and swearing had

           consumed large quantities of alcohol.        I realised this by the smell o

           stale   intoxicants on their breath and in some cases their speech was

           being slurred as they spoke.      The odd one or two of these supporters

           actually wanted to start fighting with us and it took a great deal of

           talking to them to try and calm them down.        No attempt was made at al

           to arrest them as we were aware of the feelings of these supporters

           due to what had occurred,     and secondly we were greatly outnumbered to

           deal with them had they started being violent.



           We continued to effect the road closure until we were informed to

           stand down at 5.45 pm (1745).

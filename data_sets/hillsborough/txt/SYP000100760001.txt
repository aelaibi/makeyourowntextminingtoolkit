NORMAN GEORGE B E T T U ^ O N

CHIEF INSPECTOR




I am       a Chief     Inspector       in     the   South Yorkshire      Police       and   work at Force

Headquarters,         Sheffield.        From time to time I attend a football match as a

spectator.           I had     few    commitments      during     the weekend         15-16 April        and so

obtained          a ticket    for    the F.A.       Cup semi-final game         between Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest.

My ticket was          for seat NN 28 in the South Stand uncovered enclosure.                              (The

seats number 1-230 from West to east, my seat was therefore relatively close

to the Leppings Lane enclosure on the 13th row from the front).

The day was fine and sunny, I left the city centre about 1.20 p.m. in my car

to travel to the ground.                     I drove   from Bridge      Street out of the city via

West       Bar,    Gibraltar    Street        and   Langsett    Road.      I    had    allowed     for    heavy

traffic but was surprised that there was very little problem until the usual

bottleneck at Hillsborough corner traffic lights.                              I travelled through the

junction towards Hillsborough Football Stadium.                            There were no hinderances

as     I    travelled        down    Leppings       Lane   onto    Penistone      Road      and    left    into

Claywheels Lane.

I parked my car in Claywheels Lane and walked towards Hillsborough Stadium.

The time would be about 1.45 p.m.                    (13^5)-

Many people were milling around, but there were no large crowds as I made my

way to the Penistone Road roundabout and along Leppings Lane.                                     All the way

along my journey I was continually asked for 'spare'                            tickets and 'swaps' by

young male Liverpool supporters.                     I politely answered the first few but the

number       of     enquiries       became    so    overwhelming    that    I simply walked          past    or

shook my head.

My ticket was green in colour and showed admission by a South Stand gangway

 closest to the South West corner of the stadium.                           I consulted the schematic

map on the rear and the natural route appeared to be via Leppings Lane and a
                                                                                                             (   2   .       i   f

service road which leads to the South Stand.                            The ticket 'bore no mention of

colour coding - I assumed until a long time after the event that ALL tickets

were green.

I saw no reference to colour coded direction boards.                              Furthermore, I reached

the   South    Stand    service       road     and        found   the    way     barred    by    a    serial         of

officers,     under     the     command        of    Inspector          Harvey,     ensuring         the   proper

segregation     of    fans.         I was    allowed to pass             through but an awful              lot of

supporters were        invited to walk round the block and enter the South Stand

from Penistone Road.            The point of relating this                     is to      indicate      that the

information     provided        on     the     ticket          itself    could    have     been      much    more

comprehensive and the direction boards more prominently displayed.

I took up my seat and saw from the electronic clock behind me that the time

was 1.5^ p.m.        (135^).        The ground was very sparsely populated.                          There was,

however, a quite densely packed area in the two centre enclosures behind the

Leppings Lane end g o a l .

I bought and read a match programme as I waited for the game to begin.                                                   I

remember at one stage, looking across to the West stand terraces and seeing

the   supporters       patting         a     multi-coloured             beachball      around        the    centre

enclosure.      The significance of this is that the crowd were not so tightly

packed as they were able to raise their arms and bounce the ball around.

The two teams came onto the pitch for a warm-up session.                                   I don't remember

the   time    precisely       but    remember       that       it was    early,     perhaps      2.30 p.m.           or

2.35 p.m.      (1430-1435).          When the teams left the pitch I remember that the

ground seemed more full.

About 2.45 p.m.        (1445)       I can't remember precisely,                  I saw several fans from

the   centre     enclosures          scaling        the    wall    and     climbing       into    the      seating

enclosure.      I interpreted this as mischievous rather than arising because of

overcrowding.        I saw about four or five police officers, one an Inspector
standing        in the aisles           of the seating enclosure close by the front of the

stand.           I was    not     surprised to         see the      officers     move       to     prevent          this

activity    and    thought        it    proper      that    officers      should eject           those who           had

managed to climb into the stand.                    He escorted the young man up                   the aisle and

out   of   the    stand.         The     climbing      from    the standing        to      theseating         area

ceased, apart from a very occasional person.

There appeared to be sufficient officers on the perimeter track around the

ground.

The two teams returned to thepitch at about 2.55 p.m. and I                                       considered it

unlikely         that    the     game    wouldbe able to start            at    3-00 p.m.          however,          the

preliminaries       were       curtailed      and     the   teams     were     in position             to kick       off

around that time or a minute afterwards.                           The crowd in the South Stand were

all standing.           I sat    down before many around me and thereby did not see the

kick-off.        As people       began to sit down there was a cheer from                          the crowd and

my    attention     was     drawn       to    the     'players      tunnel'.          I    guessed        that       the

Nottingham Forest Manager was taking his seat but could not see the subject

of this interest.

I saw very little football played because, seconds afterwards, my attention

was drawn to fans being allowed out of the Leppings Lane enclosure and onto

the    pitch.       I     immediately         assumed       that    the   centre       closure          had    become

overcrowded       and     that    the    Police       there   were     transferring             fans    to    another

enclosure.        I became concerned when I saw that the fans were just sitting on

the pitch and were              not moving towards other enclosures.                            Other fans were

scaling the perimeter fencing and dropping onto the perimeter track.

Members     of    the    public        around    me    who were       less     than       100    yards       from    the

incident interpreted this as a pitch invasion and there were many calls for

strong police       action        to    get   the     fans back      into    the      enclosures.             The man

sitting beside me suggested putting police dogs into the enclosure.                                           Because
the police officers were not just allowing but assisting the fans over the

fence and out of the emergency gates, I realised that this was not a pitch

invasion and was definitely a matter for concern.

I recall that the football players and officials continued the game for an

inordinate period after I had realised the need for the game to be halted.

Fans were actually sitting on the pitch.           The football match was not helping

the officers attempts to deal with the situation because there were cheers

and surges and the attention was drawn away from the matter at hand.

I saw Superintendent Murray come from the direction of the Police control

room and go to the perimeter track.            He went   to the    area behind Leppings

Lane goal and then walked very quickly, almost ran, to the linesman in front

of the South Stand.        He clearly wanted the game to be stopped.         I would have

thought the linesman could not have misinterpreted Superintendent Murray's

intentions and yet he simply ran away from him keeping up with the play on

the pitch.

My attention was now totally fixed on the Leppings Lane end of the ground

and I saw at one point         that Superintendent Greenwood ran onto the playing

area and     ensured that the match was stopped.

More and     more people streamed onto the playing area via the               emergency gates

at   the     front   of   the enclosures   or by   climbing   over the    fencing   at this

point.The first indication I had of the             extent of the problem was when two

Constables,    one was Police Constable Marsh,         'F*    Division,   carried a   young

boy from that area to the pitch immediately below where I was sitting and

began to give mouth to mouth resuscitation to the boy.                They worked with a

member     of the public to resuscitate the         boy for some time and appeared to

have been successful         as the crowd which had gathered round turned towards

the stand and cheered.

It seemed to be a long time until the single St. John's Ambulance appeared
on the playing area.               The scene was becoming more and more chaotic although

there were more than enough Police Officers who were doing everything they

possibly could to deal with the situation.

I thought that, as there were so many Police Officers on the pitch there may

be   a    lack    of     control          around    the     back       of    the stand      so,         at   about

3.25-3-30 p.m. (1525-1530) I left                   thestand and went           to a point at the South

West corner, immediately behind the Police Control tower.                                 There were other

Police    officers there,             none   of whom had radios.              I imagined that all the

injured would have             been      brought onto the pitch and would be evacuated at

this point.           It being the nearest access point for ambulances, I therefore

looked towards making the casualty                    station.         There was a Police landrover

parked    in just the spot where I considered the ambulances may park and I

wasted an awful lot of time getting the landrover moved - there were no keys

in the vehicle.

At   this time a middle               aged man with        a stewards tabbard rolled up in his

jacket pocket walked up to the young steward who was wearing his tabbard and

dutifully manning the gate at this point.                         The older man said "Oi, get that

jacket    off,    some       supporters      just   beat    a couple         of our    lads       up when they

found out they were stewards."

When I next looked around there were two casualties at this point.                                       One male

about     6    feet     tall       and    heavily   built,       28-30      years,    laying       on    a   metal

stretcher.        He was obviously dead.                  I helped a Policewoman and a member of

St. John's Ambulance in their attempts to revive him but was struck at that

time     by the futility of the operation.                       The   other casualty was very much

alive,        holding    his       arm.       An    ambulance          arrived and       after      attempting

resuscitation          for     a   few    seconds   on     the    deceased man        the    ambulance        crew

suggested putting him in the ambulance,                          I helped them to do that and then

told the group of 4-5 Police Constables at this point that I wanted one of
them    to    accompany      the     body.        A   young   male     constable       who     spoke      with      a

Merseyside       accent,       but    who       I'm   sure, was      wearing     the       uniform      of    South

Yorkshire Police, said "I'll go, I know his family."                              I was amazed at this

comment but had not time to follow it up.

The other slightly injured man got into the same ambulance and the ambulance

left.        There   was nothing          to do at       this point so I instructed the Police

Constables       to keepthe        area     clear     for   ambulances      and     walked        along      the

service      road    towards      Leppings       Lane    to ensure     unrestricted          access       for      the

emergency services which I expected to arrive.

As I turned a corner of the service road walking towards Leppings Lane I was

met by the full tragedy of the situation.                       There were a row of ambulances at

this point beside the perimeter wall                        of the stadium, numerous people were

receiving medical attention.                    But at least ten male bodies were laid out in

attempted recovery position along the fence beside the river and no one was

paying them any attention whatsoever, they were obviously dead.                                      Their skin

had a mottled blue paller and their limbs were completely limp.

There were literally dozens,                    if not   a hundred or more, Police Officers at

this    point       under   control       of    Chief    Inspector      Purdy.         I    was    in   civilian

clothes without a radio and felt completely helpless in this situation.                                              I

continued        to the     end      of   the    service      road    and   there      encouraged            several

supporters       who        weretrying to walk downthe Service road that they could not

do so until          the emergency          services     had departed.         I arranged            a group of

Police Officers who were not engaged with anything, into a cordon across the

mouth of the junction.

I now found myself outside the cordon and had felt of little use inside, I

decided to leave the stadium to telephone my wife to reassure her that I was

uninjured.          The telephones in Leppings Lane were, not unexpectedly, full and

had queues of people outside.                    As I walked along Leppings Lane there were
                                                                                                                  Kil4

                                                         -   7-




groups       of   Liverpool        supporters      standing              around      and     they    appeared   very

aggressive.          A Police car was driving up and down Leppings Lane, asking via

the P.A. system, for fans to clear the way for ambulances.                                          I saw more than

one supporter kick out at the slowly patrolling car.                                       I returned to my car

parked at the junction of Claywheels Lane with Niagara Road.                                         I decided that

I would drive to Hammerton Road,                   telephone my wife from there and assist in

any way I could at the Police Station.                              I arrived at the Police Station to

find it much calmer and well staffed than I had anticipated.                                          I telephoned

home.        After    a    short     time   the    talk           was    of    relatives      and    friends    being

received at Hammerton Road.                   I decided             that       this was an area         in which I

could offer useful assistance.

Together      with    other      officers,        notably           Detective        Chief    Inspector    Agar,    I

helped to transform the              ’n e w ’ CID Office at Hammerton Road into a relative

reception area.            In the early evening friends and relatives began arriving

at Hammerton Road,           I don't know how they had got there or who had decided

upon Hammerton Road as the point of reception.                                   It quickly became apparent

that    we    would       need   a   larger       area        for       them    to   gather     and    wait.      The

Hillsborough Boys Club Hall was suggested, the keyholder was known and so it

was arranged.             All the Social Workers/Helpers gathered there                               and received

the friends and relatives of supporters when we had obtained a formal report

about a missing friend or relation.

The system worked as follows:                 Somehow             (?) people who had lost contact with

friends/relatives           at the     time   of    the           incident      were   directed       to Hammerton

Road Police Station.               The team of officers working with me would complete a

M.F.H.   report and we would then pass the person making the report over to

the Social Workers at the Boys Club.

During the course of the evening/night our growing list of 'missing' persons

was checked with lists of casualties at hospital and with lists of arrested
                                                       -   8-




persons.       About 1.00 a.m. the.stream of friends/relatives ceased and,' after

contacting Chief Superintendent Mole at the makeshift mortuary, I closed our

operation down.

The   final duty was to drive              to the mortuary and check the M.F.H.                          reports

against the list of deceased.                  I handed all documents to Detective Inspector

Charles who was working at the mortuary and who said he would be working the

following day.          I left duty at 4.00 a.m. on Sunday 16 April 1989-

As    a postscript         to   this   report     about          the    incident,    I am    reminded      of an

earlier visit to Hillsborough Football Stadium in my youth when there was a

very large crowd.

The match was a first division league game between Sheffield Wednesday and

Manchester City.           It was the last game of the season and Sheffield Wednesday

needed to win the game to remain in the first division.                                  It would be about

1971.

It was an all ticket evening game and my ticket was for Leppings Lane.                                          I

arrived with a friend in good time and took up my position on the terracing

behind the goal but, before the start of the game, the terraces had become

so full that not only was I unable to see much of the pitch, but it was a

very uncomfortable situation.                  There was no room to move and I remember, at

one    time,    being      squashed     against       a barrier          to such an extent          that    I was

exerting       all    my    energies      to    prevent          injury    and     quickly    became      totally

unconcerned about the game.                I dreaded any goals or near misses as this was

followed       by    a surge      of   people    which           caused me    to    be   squashed       painfully

against the barrier.

By half time I had seen very little football and was thoroughly fed up with

the     situation.         Half    time    was       the        first   opportunity      I   had   to    move   my

position       and,     after     fighting      my    way        through     the    crowd    I   found     a more

comfortable position at the front of the south west corner of the Leppings
Lane terracing.   I had been in very large football grounds before and since

but had never experienced anything quite like the pressure that was created

in this crowd at Hillsborough.

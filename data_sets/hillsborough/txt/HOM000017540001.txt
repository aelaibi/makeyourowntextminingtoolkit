       FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL - SECOND READING

       I attach a copy of the draft speech which DOE have prepared for
       Mr Ridley's use at Second Reading of the Football Spectators Bill
       next Tuesday, 27 June.

       2. Mr Ridley will be considering the draft over the weekend and
       may revise it.

       3. The Home Secretary may care to see in particular paragraphs 6
       to 8 of the draft.   These deal with the intention to seek a
       resolution widening the scope of the Bill to enable it to deal
       with safety issues at designated football matches.   Mr Turney's
       submission of 20 June discussed this issue.

       4. We are recommending to DofE officials that paragraph 7 of the
       draft should be amended as shown in manuscript on the attached
       draft.

       5.    We have also suggested a number of other amendments to DOE,
       as have F8 Division, who will be letting Mr Hogg's office have a"
       copy of the final draft when it is available early next week.

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL - SECOND READING



DRAFT SPEECH FOR SECRETARY OF STATE



1. Mr Speaker,    I beg to move that this Bill                   be now read a second
time -

2. The Bill's purpose is to deal with the continuing problems of
hooliganism associated with football,                     both in this country and
abroad.   Part I of the Bill provides a framework for a national
membership scheme for spectators at designated football matches
in England and Wales. Part II gives the courts powers to impose
restriction orders on convicted hooligans to prevent                           them from
travelling to English and Welsh matches abroad.


3. This Bill comes to us having completed its passage in another
place. The House will be aware that the Government felt it right
to delay the Bill for two months following the terrible events at
Hillsborough Stadium on Saturday 15 April. Before I go on to talk
about the Bill itself,           I should like to add my personal sympathy
to that expressed by my Rt Hon Friends,                     the Prime Minister,          the
Home     Secretary   and        other     colleagues,       to     those bereaved        and
injured    at   Hillsborough,           and   to   the    people   of   Liverpool       as   a
whole. As my Noble Friend,               Lord Hesketh said on Third Reading of
the Bill in another place on 16 June, we must all share the hope
 that    this   latest     in    a   long      line      of tragedies     that    British
 football has suffered in the last forty years will also be the
 last.

 4.   Following   the Hillsborough disaster,                 my Rt      Hon   Friend,    the
 Home Secretary,     invited Lord Justice Taylor to chair an Inquiry
 into what happened there "                   and to make recommendations about
 the events of crowd control and safety at sports g^mnnris". It is
 not part of my intention today to anticipate what Lord Justice
 Taylor may say. His is an independent Inquiry and the content and
 timing of his reports are a matter for him.
5. I should note,               however,        that the Bill was amended on Third
Reading in another place not to anticipate but to take account of
Lord    Justice        Taylor's         Inquiry.            Parliament           will       now      have       two
opportunities to debate the national membership scheme, following
receipt of Lord Justice Taylor's final report:                                         the first before
the    body     that      will       draw    up      and     run     the      scheme,         the      Football
Membership         Authority,          is    even      appointed;            the      second         after          the
scheme       has    been     submitted            to    me    and      I    have       approved           it.        By
proceeding with the Bill now,                          we can put the framework for the
^national membership scheme on the statute book and be ready to
proceed rapidly with the scheme itself if Parliament decides to
do so in the light of any comments that Lord Justice Taylor may
make. But the final decision to implement the scheme will not be
made until 'it has been debated twice further.


 6. I am also proposing today that this House should instruct the
 Standing Committee which will consider the Bill that they have
 the power to make provision in the Bill relating to any aspect of
 the   safety        of    spectators           at     designated            football          matches.             The
 Bill1s scope does not at present allow for amendments on safety
 matters and the Hon Member for Holborn and St Pancras raised the
 possibility         of    an    Instruction                for    this      purpose,           in     questions
 following the Business Statement last Thursday.                                         I recognise that
 we    are     likely      to    hear       a lot       about       safety         today       and      that        the
 Standing       Committee         may       wish       to    consider          the     issue         during          its
 examination of the Bill.

 7.    I should        say      to    the     House         now    that      the Government                 is not
 planning to bring forward wide-ranging amendments on new safety
 measures          in this Bill.            Under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act

  legislation          does      not,       however,           give        the     Home        Secretary             any
  enforcement functions. We have it in mind to propose an amendment
  to this Bill to ^provide a power to^ give the Bill's licensing

  authoritv monitoring and enforcement powers, to back up the Home
  Secretary's         existing powers under the Safety of Sports Grounds
  legislation          -    though      only        in    relation       to    designated           football
  matches in England and Wales.


  8. It will be for the Bill Committee to consider any amendment
  which we propose and I will not                                               now. But it does
  seem    to    me     desirable            that    the    Committee       should be enabled to
  consider such amendments. The intention is not to anticipate Lord
  Justice Taylor's report but to pave the way for dealing with his
  recommendations, just as the amendments which we made in another
  place,    to provide for Parliamentary debates on the scheme after
  Royal Assent will allow the House to consider any comments that
^FLord     Justice         Taylor      may make           on    the membership             scheme    in his
  final report.


  9. The Hillsborough disaster and Lord Justice Taylor's                                             Inquiry
  into it are quite rightly very much on/our minds a*                                             — momenta
  That is why I have begun my speech today by explaining the way in
  which we have taken account of them. But, Hillsborough does not
  remove the need for the anti-hooliganism measures provided for in
  Parts     I    and       II    of    this        Bill    to    proceed       in    this     session      of
  Parliament.


  10. Hooliganism has been a fact of football life for all too many
  years.       Since the mid-1960s                  it has deterred millions of genuine
  football supporters from attending matches. Attendances fell from
  35 million in 1967/68 to 21 million in 1987/88. At the same time,
  football hooliganism has regularly made life very unpleasant for
  those who live and trade near football grounds. And the behaviour
  of England football supporters                               abroad    has    brought          little   but
  shame to this country.


  11.    But,     the       Opposition         will       tell     us,    all       this    is    changing.
  Attendances are beginning to rise again - so they are, slowly. We
  may even be told that a number of valuable measures have been
  taken in the last few years to tackle the problem. So they have:
   restrictions on the sale of alcohol at football grounds;                                           powers
   for the courts to impose exclusion orders on convicted hooligans;
   these    as    a    result          of    Government          legislation.         Stronger        police
   co-ordination                both        nationally           and      internationally.                More
co-operation         between     the     police      and      football      clubs;      effective
segregation       of    rival     groups      of    supporters         inside      grounds;          the
introduction of closed circuit television.


12. These measures have been worthwhile,                          I agree.        It is a shame
that they have been taken very largely as a result of pressure
from the public and from Government rather than at the voluntary
initiative      of     the     football      authorities.          I cannot       see     that       the
party     opposite       has    made     much       of    a     constructive       contribution
either.     The      measures      that      have        been    put    into      place    by        the
Government,       the police and the football authorities have largely
been    taken      in    the      last       few    years,        as    a     result      of     this
jbovernment's        efforts.      The    Opposition's            present      attacks     on        the
proposals in this Bill have not been balanced by any significant
counter-proposals.             Indeed     the      top    priority      for    action      on this
subject decided on at last year's Labour Party Conference was "to
highlight       and      encourage        strong         links     between        Labour        local
authorities and football clubs". I confess that I find it hard to
see    municipal        socialism       as    an    answer       to    football      hooliganism
either inside or outside football grounds.


13.    I have referred to the worthwhile measures                              that have been
taken by Government,             the police and the football authorities in
recent years. Unfortunately, they have not been enough. They have
just    about     contained       the     problem.        They     have     not   cured        it.    We
still need 5,000 police to control football crowds every weekend
of the football season - largely at the expense of the taxpayer
and the ratepayer.


 14. Even then violence continues to erupt all too regularly. The
 1987/88 domestic season ended with a number of serious incidents
of violence and was followed by the disgraceful scenes involving
 English football followers in West Germany in June last year. The
 season which finished             last month has seen regular outbreaks of
 trouble both at and away from football grounds,                              culminating in a
 number of serious incidents on 13 May, the last full Saturday of
 the season, less than a month after Hillsborough.
15.    On that day,          there was a pitch invasion at Crystal                             Palace
football ground by Birmingham City football supporters,                                      in which
16 people were          injured,          two       of   them with        stab     wounds.    At    the
match between Bristol City and Sheffield United, fighting between
rival groups of supporters spilled over onto the pitch and held
up the game. Away from football grounds,                            there were disturbances
up     and    down     the     country          -    in      Sheffield,       in     Cheshire,       at
Southampton railway station, at the Toddington Service station on
the    Ml     in   Bedfordshire,           in       all,     more    than     300     people       were
arrested on the weekend of 13 May at or on their way to or from
football matches.


16. This cannot be allowed to continue.                             The claim that football
hooliganism has ceased to be a problem inside footbaJLl grounds is
simply not borne out by the facts. Nor is there any case for
refusing      to     attempt       to   deal        with     football-associated           violence
away from grounds.            When Part I of this Bill becomes law,                            anyone
convicted of a relevant offence,                         inside a football ground or on
his way to or from a match,                     will be automatically disqualified
from    membership       of    the      scheme           -   and   from    attending         football
matches. I do not know how many of those arrested on 13 May will
be convicted but I find it hard to believe that any member of
this House would resist the argument that those who are convicted
should be banned from football matches.


17. The truth is that the measures which we have in place at the
moment,      in which I include the powers of the courts under the
Public Order Act to exclude people from football matches, have
simply not been enough to put a stop to football hooliganism.
Even    the    Chairman       of    the    Football           Association        reacted      to   the
events of 13 May by calling for a ban on all away supporters - a
significantly more restrictive control than we have proposed. His
own organisation promptly                  came up with             another      proposal      for a
membership scheme of a different kind. Neither proposal seems to
have found much favour elsewhere in football.
  18. Football Has had many opportunities to put its own h
  order, it has failed to                    take them, indeed before the d e c i s i ^ ^

Conclusion


28.     I     recognise           that   there        has   been        controversy          about       the
Government's            proposals,          in    the     police        force       and    in    football
itself. Of course the police are very concerned that the national
membership scheme should not be introduced until the technology
is ready. So are we. It is our intention that the Association of
Chief Police Officers should be consulted closely as the scheme
is drawn          up.       The   football       authorities           will    be    drawing       up    the
scheme themselves.                It will be their responsibility to produce a
scheme        that      best        suits     the       needs     of     football,         within        the
framework of the Bill. If they and the clubs will take a positive
rather than a negative approach to                              the scheme,          they and          their
supporters will benefit from it. Individual clubs should see this
as an opportunity to develop closer links with their supporters -
3s their members ~ not to put them off,


29.     I    began      my     speech    by      referring        to    Lord     Justice         Taylor’s
Inquiry. We will no doubt hear much more about the Inquiry this
evening       and       I    will    emphasise          again     now    what        I    said    at    the
beginning. Parliament will have not one but two opportunities to
debate the national membership scheme after we have received Lord
Justice Taylor's final report and in the light of any comments he
may make on the scheme. By proceeding with the Bill now, we can
put the framework for the scheme in place and make it possible to
move on rapidly with                  the scheme,         if Parliament             agrees       that we
should do         so when it has seen what Lord Justice Taylor has to
say.


30. It would be irresponsible to throw away the progress that we
have already made on this Bill by delaying it for another year
The case for both Parts I and II is as strong as it ever was.
Events       since          Hillsborough         have     shown    only        too       clearly       that
hooliganism continues to infect football. The national membership
scheme       offers         the   prospect       of     removing       that     infection         in    the
interests both of genuine football supporters and of others whose
lives       are   damaged         by the behaviour          of     football          hooligans.         We
should not hesitate to put the framework for the scheme in place.
I beg to move.

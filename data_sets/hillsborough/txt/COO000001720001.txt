FAST-TRACK PUBLISHING OF GOVERNMENT REPORTS


Following the concern expressed by the Prime Minister about the
time taken to print Lord Justice Taylor's final report into the
Hillsborough       Stadium disaster,       the    Lord President         asked me to
enquire of HMSO what steps would be needed to establish a fast-
track arrangement for the future publication of such reports.                        I
have now had helpful responses from the Chief Executive of HMSO,
Dr Freeman, and from the Home Office.


2.      Dr Freeman proposes that HMSO commit themselves to a formal
performance standard for the production of important reports like
Lord Justice Taylor's.           Where fast-track treatment of a report
was requested by the responsible Minister, HMSO would guarantee
the    following production       times,    subject      to    three working days
notice of firm dates for delivery of final copy and/or clearance
of proofs:


                           Typesetting                  Printing


       Up to 48pp            12 hrs                      2 days
       48pp-144pp            24 hrs                      3 days
       Over 144pp            3 6 hrs                     4 days


Depending    on     size   and   complexity,      it    might     be   possible      to
produce     some    publications       within    24    hours    should    that    prove
necessary.



3.      Dr Freeman points out that the key to the fast publication
of reports          is forward planning and subsequent adherence to the
agreed timetable by all concerned.                            Obviously it would make no
economic       sense         for HMSO         to maintain permanently               idle printing
capacity in case of an urgent requirement which might arise only
occasionally.             They therefore have to rely on buying the services
of private          sector printers,                which    can be     secured to meet the
performance             standard        outlined provided that sufficient                     advance
notice        is    given.              Adequate       advance     notice      is     particularly
important where reports are to include maps, photographs, etc.


4.      Departments may have difficulty in setting a timetable for
the     printing          of      a    report       sufficiently     far      ahead    because     of
uncertainty about when its final text will be available.                                      Further
problems       can       arise        if      final proof    stage      is used not just          for
checking typographical                       errors but as an opportunity to revise the
text.     This problem can be much reduced if the report is prepared
on word processing equipment which can output tape or disk in a
format    suitable             for direct           input   to the printer's           typesetting
equipment.                But         this    too    requires      collaboration          between
Departments and HMSO at an early stage in order to ensure that
the necessary technical requirements are met.


5.      The costs associated with the fast-track arrangements which
HMSO    can        offer       could       substantially      exceed     normal       print-buying
methods,       depending on                  market conditions.         It has long been          the
accepted practice that                        those purchasing reports should                  not have
to pay higher prices for them because of the urgency or security
required           in    a     particular           case.     Sponsor      Departments          could
therefore on occasion be asked to contribute to any exceptional
costs involved in fast-track publishing.                             What these costs might
be    could        only      be       determined       in   discussion        between    HMSO     and
Departments in each particular case.


6.      The    primary            lesson       of    all    this   is    the    need    for     close
collaboration and advance planning between Departments and HMSO.
Departments must identify well in advance the possible need for
fast handling of a particular report and consult HMSO at an early
stage about this and other aspects of the report's publication,
including           any        security         requirements.            If     this     is    done,
photographs and illustrations can,                   for example, be processed in
advance of receipt of the rest of the text, and word processing
can be used to speed up production of written text.                                For its
part,    and provided that the requisite notice is given, HMSO is
prepared to commit itself to the performance standards outlined
above.


7.      As    to    the    circumstances       surrounding      publication        of     the
Taylor Report, I do not see advantage in post morteming them too
deeply.       Suffice it to say that HMSO did not receive the complete
copy of the report until mid-afternoon on Monday 22 January.                              Had
they received the copy on Friday 19 January when it was first
available to Ministers, they could, given reasonable notice, have
published on Tuesday 23 January.                    Even starting from the actual
receipt of copy on 22 January, publication on Friday 26 January
would have been achievable, but there would have been some doubt
about the availability of copies of the report outside London.
The Home Office decided, rightly in my view, that publication on
Monday       29    January       was   preferable    to   a   ragged    and   at    worst,
risky launch of the report on the Friday, which is in any case
not a good day for a Statement.


8.      The   Lord    President may         wish    to report    the     lessons        to be
derived       from the Taylor experience              and HMSO's       new offer of a
fast-track arrangement to the Prime Minister.                          Departments will
certainly wish            to know of      the performance standard offered by
HMSO and we can usefully take advantage of the opportunity to
remind       them    of    the    importance   of    planning    the publication           of
reports       well    in    advance      (including    the    possible    use      of    word
processing)         and of close collaboration throughout with HMSO.                        A
draft minute for this purpose is attached.

DRAFT MINUTE TO THE PRIME MINISTER



FAST-TRACK PUBLISHING OF GOVERNMENT REPORTS


In the wake of the problems we encountered over the publication
of Lord Justice Taylor's final report on the Hillsborough Stadium
disaster,      I have looked into the steps which would be needed to
establish a fast-track arrangement for the publication of similar
reports in future.


2.      The   primary       lesson underlined by              our     experience        over the
Taylor    report      is the need           for close collaboration and advance
planning      between       the    Department        sponsoring       a    report      and HMSO.
Departments must identify well in advance the possible need for
the rapid publication of a report and consult HMSO at an early
stage     about      this      and      any      other     aspects        of    the     report's
publication,        including        any    security requirements.                    If this    is
done,     full      advantage        can      be    taken,      for       example,      of    word
processing to speed the production of written text.                               Plans can be
made for photographs and other illustrations to be processed in
advance of receipt of the rest of the text of a report.


3.      Departments         may    of   course       have    difficulty          in    setting    a
timetable for the production of a report sufficiently far ahead
because       of    uncertainty         about       when     the     final      text     will    be
available.          Further problems can arise if final proof stage is
used not just to correct typographical errors but to change the
actual text.         Again, this problem can be much reduced if a report
is prepared on word processing equipment which can output tape or
disk    in    a    format     suitable        for direct        input      to   the     printer's
typesetting         equipment.             But     this   too    requires        collaboration
between Departments and HMSO in advance to ensure that necessary
technical         standards       are met.         Advance      planning        and    subsequent
adherence to the agreed timetable by all concerned emerge as the
key factors in achieving fast publication of reports.


4.      It would clearly make no economic sense for HMSO to maintain
a    permanently       idle       printing         capacity     in    case      of     an    urgent
requirement which might arise only occasionally.                           HMSO therefore
have to rely on buying the services of private sector printers,
a handful of whom have been specially cleared for the production
of classified material.                Productive capacity can be earmarked for
precisely the right time, provided sufficient advance notice is
given.        HMSO have,     however,       reviewed their performance standard
for the production of important reports like the Taylor report,
and propose that where fast-track treatment is requested by the
responsible          Minister,          they   would    guarantee        the    following
production times,          subject to three working days notice of firm
dates for delivery of final copy and/or clearance of proofs:


                             Typesetting                    Printing


     Up to 48pp                   12 hrs                       2 days
       48pp-144pp                 24 hrs                       3 days
       Over 144pp                 36 hrs                       4 days


If simultaneous publication of a report was required at several
locations in addition to London, then an extra day would need to
be   added.      If applied            in the case of the Taylor report,             this
would have meant that, assuming the text of the report had been
received by HMSO on Friday 19 January (it was in fact received by
them     on   Monday    22    January) , it could           have    been    published    on
Tuesday 23 January.               Depending on their size and complexity, and
the degree of advance notice,                  it might be possible to produce
some publications within 24 hours, should that prove necessary.


5.   The costs associated with such fast-track arrangements could
substantially exceed normal                              jias iong
been the accepted practice that those/buying reports should not
have     to    pay   higher       cover     prices     to   reflect      the   urgency   or
security       required      in    a    particular     case.       Sponsor     Departments
could therefore on occasion find themselves asked to contribute
towards any exceptional costs involved in fast-track publishing.
The extent of such costs would depend on market conditions,                              and
could only be determined case-by-case.


6.      Colleagues     will       wish     to be   aware    of     the   new performance
standard        proposed   by   HMSO,   which      represents   a    considerable
improvement       on existing      arrangements.       They will     also wish to
have   in mind      the    other   lessons    I have    set   out which     can be
derived from our experiences over the Taylor report.


7.     I   am    copying    this     minute   to    Ministers       in   charge   of
Departments,       the Economic Secretary to the Treasury,               Sir Robin
Butler and the Chief Executive of HMSO.

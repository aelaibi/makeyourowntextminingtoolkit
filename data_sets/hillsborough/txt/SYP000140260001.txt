                       FOOTBN.L HOOLIGANISM

       POLICING FOOTBALL

       Introduction
1.1    This document has been compiled for the purpose of providing
       general advice to officers given the responsibility of arranging
       operational poltce planntng for sporting occasions. The level
       and degree of advance planntng must necessarily depend to a large
       extent on the particular fixture and the amount of trouble that
       may reasonably be expected as a result of Intelligence gathered
       by the poltce.
       Intelligence
1.2    Intelligence concerning the likelihood of crowd disturbance or
       hooliganism occurring will necessarily be obtained from a variety
       of sources and should be interpreted through experience and
       common sense. It is recogntsed that the degree of advance
       planntng for a particular game depends upon both the interest in
       the fixture and the amount of trouble anticipated, based upon
       Intelligence avatlableto the poltce. Aside from the importance
       of the fixture in terms of league position or ’cup’ prospects,
       football matches are often used by hooligans to celebrate
       previous encounters with particular sets of fans. It is
       therefore particularly important to be aware of the history of
       that fixture.
1.3    The prime source of football intelligence is the Police National
       Intelligence System which is based on the network of Poltce
       Liaison Officers (see paragraphs 2.1 to 2.11 et. seq.),
       Summaries completed by poltce officers of the home club Force are
       forwarded to the visiting club’s ltatson officer, making
       available Intelligence about fans behavtour at both home and away
       fixtures. Thts information wtll be collated and made available
       for future matches involving that club.
1.4    The summary includes details of those arrested, charged or
       ejected and complaints of mtsbehaviour both inside and outside
       the ground, Including public houses, railway/coach stations and
       other places where football supporters gather. This allows for
       regular offenders to be identified and targeted, resulting in a
       systematic build-up of intelligence. To ensure the maximum
       benefit of such tntel]igence it is essential that the match
       summary is completed accurately and coa~rehenstvely, and
       forwarded promptly to the Poltce Force concerned.

1.5    Mlsbehavlour by football supporters whilst travelling on trains,
       London Underground, or ferries, or whilst on British Rail
       property Is collated by British Transport Police as part of a
       national intelligence system operated by that Force. This
       information Is available to Force liaison officers through their
       British Transport Police counterparts (see paragraphs 2.13 to
       2.20 et. seq.).
 1.6   Sources of intelligence may be summarlsed as follows:-


                                                                      63
              (a)    Match summaries compiled by the ’home’ club will provide
                     a record of the same fixture on previous occasions.
              (b)    Intelligence from the ltatson officer associated with the
                     visiting club.
              (c)    Analysis of C.C.T.V. coverage to identify group leaders
                     and observe the ’tactics’ of the hooligans.
              (d)    ’Spotters’ supplted by the poltce associated with the
                     visiting club.
              (e)    The football clubs (ho~ and away).

              (f)    Travel agents, coach operators, British Transport Poltce,
                     supporters’ clubs.
              (g)    The development of Intelligence wtll take into account
                     the history of the fixture, the anticipated stze of the
                     crowd, importance of result to either club, strength of
                     ’away’ following, absence of other games in the area,
                     whether or not a derby’ fixture, press coverage.

    l
              Pre-Nmtch Planntng
J       1.7   Depending on the fixture footha11 matches wtll tnvolve the use of
              various branches of the Force (the mounted, traffic, spectal
              constabulary, etc.). It is important that the officer
              responsible for poltctng the match determines the pre-metch
              planning in the light of the Intelligence at hand. In many cases
1~,           an officer wtll be delegated the planntng task and. ttts
              recommended that as a routine the planntng officer, Intelligence
              officer and the officer in charge of poltctng the match confer to
              analyse ’Intelligence’ and determine tactics.
              Use of ’Away’ Offtcers (Spotters)
        1.8   The use of ’spotters’ from the Force area from which fans are
              travelling to ’away’ games may be of benefit, but there are
              difficulties, particularly iftobthee°fftcers travel with the
              supporters. A distinction has         drawn between, on the one
              hand, reutlne ’spotters’ who seek to provlde regular Inte111gence
              to the ’home’ Force and, on the other, covert Intelllgence
              gatherlng.
        1.9   In the fomer case tt ts recommended that arrangements be made
              beforehand with the ’home’ police; that the officers do not
              travel with the visiting supporters as police officers; that they
              report to and ltatse with the ’home’ poltce to assist with
              Intelligence. Whenever posstble their role should be solely to
              provide Intelligence and not to be dtrectly tnvolved tn the
              policing.




                                                                            64
             Briefing

      1.11   Officers should receive a full brieftng prior to taking up their
             duties which should include after match arrangements and clear
             instructions as to booking off. Where practicable such briefings
             should be carried out on site. In large scale police operations
             the operational commander should brief all officers not below the
             rank of Inspector, and Inspectors should be responsible for
             briefing officers of the rank of Sergeant and Constable.
      1.12   In accordance with the ’Popplewell’ recommendations the briefing
             must I ncl ude evacuatl on procedures and the dutles and
             responsibilities of stewards should be brought to the attention
             of police officers (see Duties of Stewards - paragraph 3.1 et.
             seq. ).
      1.13   Briefing cards may prove advantageous, particularly when officers
             are unfamiliar with the routines .of poltctng football. Where
             officers are unfamiliar they should°be provided wlth a map of the
             ground and its immediate environs identifying ’home’ and ’away’
             sections of the ground and the numbers or letters used by the
             club, so that they can answer questions for supporters.
      1.14   Briefing should pay particular attention to policy and practice
             as to searching, arrest and ejection and officers must know where
             to take prisoners. Inte111gence: as to 11kely offenders and
             common practices of disturbance should be carefully outllned.
             Supervisors in partlcular need to know the ground commanders
             ’publlc order strategy’.

      1.15   Copies of evacuation procedures and any briefing cards or other
             information passed out in documentary form during briefing should
                available within the ’police control ’.
      1.16   Ground regulations, which have national application, should be
             brought to notice as follows:-

                                                                            66
            18.       The Club reserves the right for its servants and agents
                      to remove from this ground any person who does not comply
                      with Ground Regulations and with the Rules and
                      Regulations of The Footha11 Association and The Foothall
                      League or whose presence on the ground is or could
                      reasonably be construed as constituting a source of
                      danger, nuisance or annoyance to other spectators.
            Away Supporters
    1.17    Intelligence officers should provide clear instructions to coach
            operators as to routes and parking facilities. Car and coach
            parks should be clearly signed and a police presence maintained
            to ensure security and prevent interference. The presence of
            police at such locations may also enable the early gathering of
            intelligence on the numbers and behavtour of visiting supporters.
    1.18    It may be prudent for police to escort supporters from coach
            parks to the sports stadium in order to ensure that they do not
            become the subject of, nor engage in, hooltgantm. Stndlarly,
            ratlway stations should be monitored by poltce and supporters
            escorted to the stadium where the match is to be played. Close
            ltatson with British Transport Poltce is recomended. Host fans
            are famtltar with escort arrangements and where posstble poltce
            should stick to routines which become familiar.
    1 .lg   After a match coaches leavtng the area may require a poltce
            escort unttl they are away from trouble.
            Flashpotnts
    1.20    Special attention should be given to any public house or other
            unofficial assembly point, and to the routes taken in general by
            supporters where confrontation between rival fans may occur.
            Also attention should be given to waste ground and derelict
            property along any such routes where missiles or offensive
            weapons may be gathered by hooligans. Bridges have often been
            used by hooligans and should be monitored.
            Stadtm Searches
    1.21    Before spectators are admitted into the stadium a physical search
            should be made of the ground and terraces by the officer in
            charge of policing the game to ensure that all fences and gates
            are sufficiently secure and that no objects which may be used as
            offensive weapons or missiles are to hand. There should be an
            arrangement with the club for an official to be available when
            the inspection is carried out to put right anything which is
            amiss.
            Entry Into the Ground
    1.22    Approaches to the ground are themelves flashpotnts and need to
            be well monitored. Careful plannlng to co-ordlnate as far as
            possible the routes taken by different groups of supporters to
            relevant turnstiles may reduce the opportunity of conflict.

                                                                                 I


      1.23   Clear marking of turnstiles is essential and all officers on
             football duties should be briefed as to the segregation
             arrangements.

      1.24   The searching of spectators depends on circumstances. The terms
             of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act afford a right of search
             only where there are grounds to suspect an offence is being
             committed, and the suspicion must relate dtrectly to the person
             searched. The Codes of Practice, however, exempt the need to
             make customary records if in the circumstances tt is not
             practicable to do so. Ground regulations reserve the right of
             the club to decltne admission to any person who refuses to be
             searched by a poltce officer, and this may allow for routine
             searching on entry to grounds, but poltce officers need to know
             the limtts of thts provision. Refusal to be searched may entatl
             a refusal to allow entry.
      1.25   Within the limitations officers should seek to prevent supporters
             entering the ground wtth weapons, missiles, flag poles etc.
      1.26   Drunkenness is recogntsed as a major cause of hooliganism and
             supporters may attempt to enter sports grounds whilst in a
             drunken condition or carrying alcohol. Where the conditions of
             the Sporting Events’ (Control of Alcohol Etc.) Act, 1985, apply
             the provisions should be enforced. The main conditions are as
             follows:-
             (a)    Section 2(la) and (lb) - It is an offence for any
                    person to have intoxicating ltquor or an ’article’ to
                    which thts section appltes in hts possession during a
                    designated event tn the viewing area or whtle
                    entering/trying to enter a ground during an event.
             (b)    Section 2(2) - It is an offence to be drunk in a ground
.t                  during a designated event or whtle entering/trying to
                    enter the ground.

             ’Arttcle° means any arttcle capable of causing injury to a person
             struck by it being:-
             (a)    a bottle, can or other portable container (including such
                    an article when crushed or broken) which:-
                     ( t ) t s for holdt ng any drtnk, and
                     (tt) ts of a kind which, when empty, is nonmally
_°~                        discarded, or returned to, or left to be recovered
                           by, the supplier, or
             (b)    part of an artlcle falling within (a) above.

             It does not apply to anything that is for holdlng any msdlclnal
             product (Medicines) Act, 1968).
      1.27   The Public Order Act, 1986, makes it an offence to be in
             possession of distress flares, fog stgnals, fireworks, pellets
             and capsules intended to be used as fumigators or for testing
             ptpei at a football match. Contained wtthtn~the same Act are the


                                                                            68
                  offences of affray, violent disorder, disorderly conduct and
                  threatening behaviour.
                  Exclusion Orders
          1.28    The Public Order Act, 1986, also gives the courts power to make
                  an exclusion order to prevent a person convicted of certain
                  offences attending a football match. The court can make an order
                  of conviction where:-
                  (a)    The person has been convicted of an offence which fulfils
                         one or more of the following conditions:-
                         (i)     The offence was committed during any period
                                 relevant to a prescribed football match whtle the
                                 accused was at, or entering or leaving or trying
                                 to enter or leave, the ground concerned.
                         (ii)    The offence was committed going to or from a
                                 match and:-
                                 (1)       involved the use of threat of violence
                                           by the accused to another person;
                                 (2)       involved the use of threat of violence
                                           towards property;
                                 (3)       was committed under Section 5 of the
                                           Act.
                         (III)   The offence was committed under Section 1(3) or 4
                                 or 1A(3) or (4), Sporting Events’ (Control of
                                 Alcohol Etc.) Act, 1985. These are the offences
                                 of possessing alcohol travelling to or from a
                                 footha11 match.
                  (b)     No exclusion order may be made unless the court is
                          satisfied that making such an order tn relationto the
                          accused would help to prevent vtolence or disorder at or
                          in connection with prescribed footha11 matches.
                  (c)     An exclusion order may only be made tn addition to a
                          sentence, probation order or discharge, following
                          conviction, i.e. it does not apply to person brought
                          before the court to be bound over under Section 115,
                          Magistrates’ Court Act, 1980.
                          If these conditions are satisfied, the court may make an
.,s
                          order "prohibiting htm from entertng any premises for the
                          purpose of attending any prescribed footha11 match
                          there;"
           1.29    A crucial factor in the enforcement of orders Is the availability
                   of photographs of those subject to the. Section 35 of the Act,
                   makes provision for the court, on application of the prosecution,
                   to order a photograph to be taken. However, where possible,
                   persons arrested for any offence which might result in the
                   impo6itlon of an order should be photographed at the time of



      +
                                                                                  69
       charging. Photographs taken at this time are likely to be of
       more value for subsequent identification purposes than those
       taken at or following a court appearance.
1.30   Photographs which should conform to the following specifications
       should be affixed to each police copy of an exclusion order:-
       (a) Standard passport size 2" x 2".
       (b)   To be in colour.
       (c)   To be in single aspect three quarter profile or full face.
       (d) Polaroid photographs are NOT recommended for this purpose.
1.31   Photographs held for the purpose of enforcing exclusion orders
       are for police officers only and n~st not be circulated to any
       other person.
1.32   Wherever an order is made, copies, together with photographs
       should be forwarded to the Chief Officer of Police for the area
       where the offender lives and to the Chief Officer of Police for
       the area(s) in which any club he is known to support is situated.
       It is recommended that any photographic negative also be
       forwarded to the latter.
1.33   Circulation of information relating to Exclusion Orders is
       incorporated into the football match intelligence system.
1.34   Football Liaison Officers wtll maintain schedules, together with
       photographs of those subject to orders who are known to support
       their club. Prior to each match, complete schedules should be
       forwarded to the away team ltatson officer. Schedules should be
       returned after each match, together with the completed football
       match summary form.
1.35   These schedules and photographs will be of particular importance
       to those officers operating C.C.T.V. equipment. When scanning
       crowds during the course of the game or when viewing videos of
       disorder after the event, operators will be able to check the
       crowd against the photographs.
1.36   Where weight of numbers of those subject to orders makes the
       supplying of full schedules i~racticable, circulation should be
       restricted to targetted hard core offenders.
1.37   Liaison officers will need to maintain several schedules of
       orders to cater for midweek games, late returns, etc.,
1.38   Where an individual first came to notice after 31.12.80, as
       indicated by his C.R.O. nu~er, suffix information relating to
       exclusion orders will be maintained on the P.N.C. within the
       subjects convt cti ons ft 1 e.
1.39   In certain circumstances, c,fences which ,right lead to the
       i~osttton of exclusion orders are not reportable to the N.I.B.
       Therefore, where an individual has no P.N.C. reco#d, or first
       came’co notice prior to 1.1.81 or where ther~tsany other reason


                                                                          70
         to believe an individual Js subject to an exclusion order, a
         check should be made with hts home Force.
                Where an order has been tn force for a period of 12
                months, application can be made to the court for the
                temination of the order. Details of Temtnation Orders
                will not be shown on the P.N.C.
Entrance to the Ground
1.40     Stadtum entrances must be stgned to tndtcate clearly the stands
         and terraces to be used by home and vtstttng supporters.
1.41     Officers wtth local knowledge should be posted to tornstlles to
         prevent supporters entertng a sectton of the stadtom allocated to
         supporters of the oppostng team. When possible, the same
         offtcers should be regularly used at locations considered to be
         of particular Importance, e.g. matn entrance, potnts of potential
         trouble etc.
1.42     It ts e~hastsed that effective turnstile pollctng ts the key to
         prevention of dtsorder tnside the ground. Offtcers should be
         encouraged to talk to those watttng to enter tn order to tdenttfy
         non-local accents, drunks, etc.
1.43     Queues fomtng at turnstiles should be closely monitored by
         pollce and stewards. It ts recommended that mounted officers,
         where available, are used for thts purpose. There ts often
         frustration at turnstiles tf queues rmatn after the game has
         started. Orderly control wtll mtntmtse the rtsks.
1.44     All ttcket matches also need turnstile control as supporters tn
         possession of ttckets for a particular sectton of the ground may
         seek to gatn entry to another sectton of the ground, whtch could
         result tn some secttons of the ground exceeding the 11mtt
         specified tn the safety certificate. Where 11halts are crtttcal
         polt ce should make arrangements to mont tot turnsttle counts.
1.45     Htgh tnterest ’all ttcket’ ftxtores have the effect of generating
         a black market tn ttckets and ’touting!. Thts wtll 11kely
         undemtne segregation. It ts therefore recommended that some
         sectton of the ground be set apart to accommodate Identified fans
         who support one stde and have ttckets for oppostng supporters’
         area. If circumstances warrant tt ’ttcket touts’ should be
         arrested, and efforts made to dtscover where the ttckets came
         from. For all ttcket games every effort must be made to ttghten
         up the sales procedure to asstst segregation pollcy, preferably
         by restricting sale of ttckets to those attending home ftxtures
         and se111ng ttckets wtthtn the ’hame~ enclosures.
         Tern Managers, Referees and Ltnemen

1.46     All officials concerned tn controlling the game should be aware
         of the police action that wi11 be taken If there Is any Invaslon
         of the playlng pltch, or serious dlsorder occurrlng wlthln the
         crowd. A11 offlclals concerned In contro111ng the game should be
         aware of any planned emergency procedure that maybe’taken In the
         even~of an emergency or bomb threat.


                                                                            71
    1.47   The conduct of players on the field can have a marked impact on
           crowd behavJour. Particularly where the fixture is judged
           volatile the club should be encouraged to arrange for players to
           leave the tunnel together and to shake hands at the end of the
           game. They may also be reminded of the importance of good
           behaviour on the pitch. It rests with the match commander to
           take up with the club any mJsbehavJour by players.
           EntertaJ merit
    1.48   The club should be encouraged to provide some form of
           entertainment to take place during the half hour preceding kick
           off, for example bands, displays and recorded music. A good
            ’announcer’ using the public address system can establish a
           rapport with the crowd and influence behaviour. Thought should
           be given to ltatstng wtl~ ’announcers’. to make suitable
           interventions if appropriate. This means may be used to advise
            ’away’ supporters as to arrangements for !~etr leavtng the
           ground, changed travel instructions etc.
           Crovd 01strJ buttons
    1.49    It is emphastsed that stewards should ensure that all sections of
            terraces and stands are filled to capacity before allowing access
           ¯ to further sections where possible. Thts wtll require monitoring
            turnstile totalisers and the use of public address systems Jn
            some instances. ThJs operatJon Js greatly assJstad by the
            compartJnentallsatJon of grounds, each c~artment beJng fJ11ed Jn
            sequence.
           Segregat|on
    1.50   Home and visiting supporters should be segregated inside the
           stadium by means of segregation fenctng and/or stertle zones, and
           steps should be taken to tmpose segregation before they enter and
           after they leave the stadtum. Each sectton of the stadtum
           designated for the use of particular supporters should have tts
           own totlet and refreshment facilities. Barrters and doors should
           be provided so as to segregate hon~ and vtstttng supporters and
           thus avotd confrontation at entrances/exits. Experience has
           shown that pollctng segregated areas is best achteved by plactng
           offtcers ’tnstde’ the segregation tf !:hts ts possible.

           Stemards
    1.51   Good 11atson between stewards and police should be established.
           (See OutJes of Stewards - paragraph 14.1 et. seq.) The offJcer
           Jn charge of the match should make perJodJc JnspectJons of
           stewarding standards and report results 1;o the club’s-management.
           The police control must be able to contact the ChJef Steward and
           Head FJre Staward at all tJmes.
            DJsposJUon of llmnpower
    1.52    Where no pJtch perJmeter fence exists a presence may be requJred
            by pollce and stewards Jn order to Jsolate the playJng area. In
            such cJrcumstances pollce ,offJcers should take up standJng
I           posJ!~tons away from and facJng ithe crowd when JncJdents occur to


                                                                            72
               arouse the crowd. Where fencing has been erected police officers
               and stewards must have keys for the gates and a universal locking
               system should be used. Pitch perimeter gates should remain
               unlocked and manned at all times the public have access to the
               ground.

       I .53   All bars, refreshment and toilet areas should be poltced tn order
               to prevent hooliganism occurring.
       I .54   At the conclusion of the match consideration should also be gtven
               to deploying poltce tn appropriate areas to mtntmtse a sudden
               stampede or pushing within the crowd tn their endeavour to leave
               the stadium qutckly.
               Pollce Reserves
       I .55   A number of pollce offtcers should generally be held tn reserve
               in order to deal with spontaneous incidents occurring inside, or
               immediately outstde the stadium.
               Persons Arrested or ~ected From the Ground
       I .56   Ejectton ts an optton whtch can be used where behavtour ts poor,
               but falls short of an actual offence (e.g. contravention of
               ground regulations). However, ~ectton should not be used as an
               alternative to arrest; where there ts sufficient evtdence the
               offender should be arrested and charged.
       I .57   It is recommended, where possible, that tn vtolent situations
               pollce offtcers tn groups should enter the affected sectton of
               the stedtum from above the Incident, maktng arrests where
°._J           necessary, and then maktng thetr way onto the perimeter of the
               pttch. Offtcers should not enter from the perimeter tf thts can
               be avotded. Arrest operations should be planned and controlled
               to avotd officers betng tsolated or overwhelmed.
 A~    I .58   A standard procedure should be adopted wtth regard to arrests and
  /            ejections. Prisoners should be taken to a forward reception
               potnt where detetls are recorded (including ejections), and
               prisoners photographed together wtth arresting offtcer.
       1.59    Persons ejected from the ground or supporters who are not
               admitted for whatever reason should be carefully pollced.
               Experience indicates that such persons often gain further entry
               to the ground either at half ttme or Immediately before the end
               of the match, and provoke confrontetton.
       1.60    In the event of a football match generating a large number of
               arrests, it is worth considering batltng prisoners to spectal
               courts in order that Magistrates may be fully aware of all the
               circumstances appertetntng to the events of that game. Early
               ]tatson wtth the Crown Prosecution Servtcets advisable to tnform
               them of the Intention to hold special courts, tn order that they
               can be fully acquainted wtth the background facts.




                                                                              ?3
            Contl ngency Plannl ng
    1.61    Pre-determined plans should be available to control such
            contingencies as serious disorder, pitch incursion and locked out
            spectators. Because of the great divergence in ground and crowd
            factors these plans must be ground specific. However, these
            plans must take into consideration the ’Popplewe11’
            recommendations with regard to the transmission of coded messages
            over the public address system, the availability of emergency
            telephones and a facility for the police to intercept the public
            address system.

            Emergency Evacuation
    1.62    Stewards must be familiar with the action to be taken in the
            event of an evacuation of the whole or part of the stadium.
            Police should assist in the rapid evacuation of a stadium in such
            circumstances. Stadia should have a universal locking system and
            all stewards should be in possession of keys for the exit gates.
            They should wear a distinctive tabard or other means of easy
            identification. It must be made clear to both the club
            management and to the Individual stewards that they must not
            leave their post without being relieved. It is essential that
            exit gates can be opened without delay in the event of an
            emergency. Simulated emergency evacuation exercises for the
            staff employed by the club must be held at least twice each
            season to test the emergency evacuation procedure. The crowd
            will not be involved but depending upon circumstances it could be
            an advantage to explain to the crowd that an emergency evacuation
            exercise is taking place. Experience has revealed that in an
m           actual evacuation it is essential to monitor exit doors when the
            crowd has left the stadium to prevent them wandering back into
            the stadium before the reason for the evacuation has been

m           completed.
            Retention of Visiting Supporters
    1.63    In some circumstances the officer in charge may decide to hold
            the visiting supporters in the ground until he considers it
            appropriate to release them. If such a tactic is employed then
            the situation will be greatly eased if the visiting fans are kept
            informed.
            Early Re-Deploymnt of Poltce Officers
    1.64    Police officers should be deployed outside the ground, in key
            positions, early enough to be seen in these positions by the
            crowd as it leaves the ground. Thts gives an appearance of good
            order and police control. "At critical points the use of police
            officers in groups under the command of a sergeant should be
            considered. The effective after-match deployment of police
            officers is dependent on the pre-match briefing and allocation of
            tasks.

            Vehicular and Pedestrfan Traffic
    I .65   At jthe end of the game early, dispersal of supporters is clearly
            beneficial. Most Police Forces will develop a traffic control

                                                                          74
           plan to facilitate this. Particular attention should be given to
           routes used by ’away) supporters. Supporters who are not local
           must always be able to find coaches where they got off them and
           generally it is good practice to convoy and escort coaches away
J          from the general area. Many grounds are in heavily built-up
l
           areas of old industrial towns and it is extremely difficult to
           move police resources in the immediate aftenuath - it is
J          therefore essential to detetl traffic and publtc order duties
           beforehand.
           Bus, Rdhey and Main Line St~ttons
           Foot patrol and mounted officers (in liaison with British
           Transport Police) should be used to control queues and prevent
           rowdyism occurring. Large groups of supporters should generally
           be escorted on to the station and, where necessary. British
           Transport Poltce may wtsh to constder travel 1 tng with supporters
           unttl they are dispersed.
           De-Briefing of Sentor Offtcers
    1.67   In the event of inadequacies being exposed in the police

     2.9    It is essential that home club ltatson officers advise, as a
            matter of course, their opposite number about the accuracy of
            intelligence provided by way of the football match summary fom
            including:-
            (a)        the estimated number of visiting supporters;

                       names and addresses of the keepers or operators can be
                       ascertained for future intelligence purposes.
     2.10   The importance of the accurate completion and prompt return of
            the football match summary forms is again stressed.
            Consideration should also be given to the forwarding of C.C.T.V.
            tapes containing intelligence about visiting supporters to the
            Police Force concerned,
     2.11   It is important that supervising officers encourage officers to
            submit any relevant intelligence to Football Liaison Officers in
            order to positively assist in the gathering of intelligence.
            InformmUon to Pollce Force Through Whose Area Vtstttn9
            Supporters are Expected to Trave!
     2.12   It may be necessary for tnfomatton to be supplied to the Force
            through whose area large numbers of supporters travel or on whose
            area notorious ’crossroads’ or ,watering holes’ are situated.
            This assumes a mere urgent aspect if there has been trouble at
            the ground; or if there is a history of violence between
            supporters likely to meet en-route to their respective away
            fixtures. Reports of such problems should be passed to the
            football liaison officers of the clubs involved by the Force In

                stewards, and accept responsibility for any damage which may
                occur on the train.

2.15   The responsibility for preventing and dealtng with incidents of
       hooliganism on trains carrying supporters of footha11 clubs to
       and from matches lies primarily with the British Transport Poltce
       and they should be given full co-operation and assistance.
2.16    If disturbances Involving travelling supporters have taken place
       during the game or outside the ground afterwards, particularly if
       arrests have been made, it is usually an indication that trouble
       may be expected on trains carrying supporters home. Any
       incidents which may have a bearing on the behavtour of supporters
       travelling by train should be reported as soon as posstble to the
       local office or Headquarters control room of the British
       Transport Police.
2.17   For their part, the British Transport Police wtll inform the
       local police at the termtnal station and, if necessary, at any
       stopping point on the route when hooliganism breaks out on the
       train or if they have any reason to suspect hooliganism is ltkely
       to occur either on the train or at the termtnal station.

           DUTIES OF STEWARDS
          The Effect of Safety Certificates Issued Under the Safety at
          Sports Grounds Act, 1975
    3.1   A level of control is provided by the Safety at Sports Grounds’
          Act, 1975, at those grounds which are required to be certified.
          The Local Authority, before issuing a Safety Certificate, is
          required to consult the Chief Officer of Police regarding the
          terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.

    3.2   Whilst police do not directly control the employmnt of stewards
          at football grounds, it should be accepted that there is a
          responsibility, within the wider context of public safety, to
          exert influence to ensure that the arrangements made by the
          management of the ground are adequate in this respect. It is
          most important that stewards are sufficient in number, suitably
J         deployed, well trained and capable mantally and physically of
          carrying out their routine and emergency functions. It is
          recommended that the police regularly inspect stewarding
          arrangements to detemtne they are in accord with certification.
          Identification and Supervision
    3.3   Persons employed as stewards at f00tba11 grounds sh°Ulddshoul be
          clearly identifiable, wearing coloured tabards. They         at
          all times be under the direct control of supervisors whose
          identities should be made known to the police officers on duty at
          the ground and who should be in contact with the Police Control.
    3.4   Stewards should be distributed throughout the ground in
          accordance with a detatled pre-arranged schedule, agreed between
          the police and management of the ground.
    3.5   Their duties may be divided into four main categories:-
          (a)       controlling or directing members of the public who are
                    entering or leaving the football ground;
          Cb)       patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, e.g.
                    raising alams, extinguishing fire, etc.;
          (c)       manning entrances, exits and other strategic points,
                    particularly exit doors, and gates which are not
                    continuously open whtlst the ground is in use;
          (d)       undertaking specific duties relating to emergency and
                    evacuation procedures.
    3.6   In accordance with the ,Popplewe11’. recommendations all stewards
          should:-
          (a)       be trained and instructed to deal with any emergency
                    relating to fire or evacuation;
          (b)       be given written Instructions about the ac~ton to be
                    taken in cases of emergency;
                J




                                                                           81
        (c)    receive practical instruction and training appropriate to
               their responsi bi li ty;
       (d)     not be employed as a steward unless they have been so
               instructed and trained;
       (e)     be adequate in number, physically and mentally capable of
               performing their duties, effectively deployed,
               effectively supervised and readily Identifiable.
       Eaergency Procedures - Stevards Role
3.7    Fomal emergency procedures at each ground require Jotnt
       consultation between poltce, the management of the ground, fire,
       ambulance and other services.
3.8    It is essential that stewards and their supervisors are fully
       aware of the part they have to play in the plans which are
       produced. The management of the ground should ensure that
       written instructions concerning the action to be taken in the
       event of an emergency are made readtly available to all staff and
       stewards and, in particular, that all the staff and stewards
       should receive practical instruction and training appropriate to
       their responsibilities tn the event of an emergency. Exercises
       for the staff and stewards should be carried out regularly to
       ensure the smooth operation of the procedure for dealtng with an
       emergency.

3.9    A record should be kept by the club authorities containing
       details of the training and instruction given and the exercises
       held, and should include the following matters:-
       (a)    date and time of the instruction or exercise;
       (b)    duration;
       (c)    name of the person giving the instructions;
       (d)    names of the persons receiving the instructions;
       (e)    nature of instruction or exercise.
       Consideration should be gtven to the Inclusion of these
       conditions in any safety, or spectal safety certificate.
3.10   After initial practlcal instruction a11 members of staff and
       stewards should receive verbal instruction, given by a competent
       person, at least once in every period of three months at regular
       intervals. Stewards should be given briefing cards relevant to
       partl cul ar points.




                                                                       82

          POLICING   FACILITIES   AT   FOOTBALL   GROUNDS
    4.1   There are marked differences in the facilities provided by clubs
          and it must remain a matter for local negotiation between poltce
          and clubs as to the standard of facilities, bearing tn mtnd
          average attendance and a need for poltce presence. It ts
          recommended that General Safety Certificates are reviewed on an
          annual basis in an effort to achieve continuing improvement.
          Prtsoner Reception Pot nt Iit thtn the Ground
    4.2   It is considered essential that a prisoner reception point should
          be available at the ground. The office should be sited, tf
          possible, so that there ts adequate access for the unobtrusive
          removal of prisoners. There should be either a G.P.O. telephone
          ltne or a direct line to the nearest poltce station. Ideally the
J
          police accommodation should have two detention rooms to separate
          ’home’ and ’away’ supporters.

          Parading and Briefing
    4.3   It ts desirable that poltce officers to be deployed tn the ground
          are briefed on site. Thts can usually be done under cover tn
          most grounds. A standardtsed form of stadium grtd reference used
J
          by police and club personnel wtll facilitate briefing and
          evacuation.
          Contxol Roem
    4.4    It ts desirable, and in some cases essential, that a contrel room
          ts provided to oversee poltce operations tn the ground.
          Provision should be made for a base statton to contrel the U.H.F.
          poltce radio. It should have a direct access to the ground
          publtc address system and either a G.P.O. or direct telephone
          ltne to the local poltce station, and the poltce office within
          the ground. The room should be of adequate stze to accommodate
          C.C.T.V. monitors and ancillary equipment. It ts desirable to be
          able to operate, tn addition, htgh Intensity ltghttng systems
          from the poltce contrel whtch may be switched on when there ts
          treuble or emergency.
    4,5   The control room should be sited to gtve an over vtew of the
          ground and to allow the match poltce commander ready access from
          the ’touch ltne’.
    4.6   The costs of the provision of the poltce office and control room
          and facilities should be borne by the club. The poltce generally
          provide radio communication and additional items such as loud
          hailers and binoculars.
    4.7   Safety at Sports Grounds! Act, 1975, by providing for
          consultation between the local authority and poltce (Section
          3(ttt)) on conditions to be tncluded on safety certificates has
          had ~d clear effect on improving ground facilities. Full use
          shou be made of these provisions to ensure adequate poltce
          facilities.

           C.C.T.V. AND STILL PHOTOGRAPHY
    4.8    The guidance offered in this section is intended to assist
           Commanders having operational responsibility for policing
           football. It is not a definitive work and should be read in
           conjunction with the report of the A.C.P.O. Working Party,
           entitled, ’Use of Video and Sttll Photography.
           Introduction
    4.9    The use of C.C.T.V. and still photography as an aid to the
           effective policing of football is a recent development. At the
           present time, all First and Second Division football grounds are
           provided with static video cameras and recording facilities,
           which enable the poltce to monitor crowd behavtour within and in
           the immediate vicinity of stadia. It is anticipated that
           vtdeoing facilities willbe extendedto all Thtrd and Fourth
           Dtvston grounds tn the near future but not necessarily of the.
           same type as in the two higher Divisions.
           The quality of the equipment and re-production of image presently
           available in football grounds is now always compatible with its
           adequate presentation before the courts, and its use has resulted
           in some confusion between its function in relatton to ’command
           and control’ and to evidence gathering. Experience to date
           indicates the greatest value ltes in developing a system for the
           use of C.C.T.V. and stt11 photography within stadta for the
           purposes of intelligence and evidence gathering.
           All systems at present in use at football grounds are capable of
           being enhanced and developed. When these changes are made it
           should be ensuredthat the replacement equipment is of sufficient
           standard that the quality of recording is such as to be
           acceptable for use as evidence in court.
           Accepting the need for identification and evidence gathering for
           prosecution to be the primary function of the system, the
           following points are worthy of consideration in the use of
           development of existing and anticipated facilities.
           Technical Considerations
    4.10   (a)     At the time of Installation, consideration should be given
                   to the siting of cameras and cables so as to prevent
                   interference or damage.
           (b)      As good video recording requires gocd ltght and as most
                    football fixtures are played during winter months, the
                    need for adequate ltghttng within and around football
                    stadia is essential to eliminate areas of darkness which
                    may be Used as cover for disorderly behavtour. Fans are
                    increasingly aware that such behavtour is monitored by
                    C.C.T.V. and they will attempt to evade detection by
                    seeking whatever cover is available. It is therefore
!                   important that cameras are sited in such a way as to
                    mintmtse bltnd spots and that facilities areprovtded to
                    increase ltghttng intensities in stands, e~. The siting
                 ¯ of video cameras should take account of sloptng roofs, to
                 enable recording at the rear of stands, This problem can
                 be overcome by the use of hand-held cameras.
                 Consideration must be given to all foreseeable problems
                 that may affect the performance of video equipment, A
                 good example that t S east ly overlooked is the path of the
                 setting sun. A video camera would be tneffective t f the
                 sun was shining dtrectly into the lens.
         (c)     Poltce Control Rooms contain valuable equipment and are
                 often vulnerable. Consideration should be given to taking
                 protective measures to tncrease securtty.
        (d)     Control Rooms should be placed tnofa position which
                commands a good all round view           the ground and
                consideration should be gtven to plactng the vtdeo
                monitors tn such a position that the operator ts not
                distracted by activities within the ground.
        (e)     Careful consideration to the type of ltghttng and the
                provision of glass partitions should be given to prevent
                reflection or distortion. The Control Room should have
                adequate background heating to protect the electrical
                equipment and for the comfort of personnel employed within
                the room. Heating should remain swttched on 24 hours a
                day during cold weather.
        (f)     The use of flash equipment tn the vicinity of sensitive
                video cameras may damage the tube t f discharged facing the
                camera. Even tf thts damage ts not permanent, the video
                camera would be unable to function for some time. As a
                general rule flash equipment should not be used tn the
                vicinity of operating video cameras.
       (g)      Police Control Rooms must be provided wtth multi-recording
                facilities tn order that the opportunity exists to capture
                all incidents which may occur tn different areas ~dthtn
                the stadium.
               Operational Considerations
4.11   (a)     It ts important that poltce officers are made aware that
               their actlons In dea]Ing wlth dlsorder]y behavlour within
               the stadium wi]] a]so be recorded on C.C.T.V.
       (b)     Consideration should be given to the preparation of a
               ground specific video, to be used in briefing officers who
               may not be famtliar wtth the stadium.

       (c)     It is important whenever posstble to use the same
               personnel tn police ground control room operations. They
               wtll more readtly identify regular troublemakers and
               ~target’ them within the ground. Over a period of time
               they wtll develop similar abilities tn relatton to
               visiting supporters.
       (d)      Immediately following a ftxture where arrests for
               misconduct have occurred, arresting officers "should be
               allowed an opportunity to view any ,recording of the


                                                                             85 ¯
                                                                                      l

                         incidents concerned to establish (1) the evidence for
                         their arrest and (2) whether the offender has committed
                         any further acts not witnessed by the arresting officer.
                         Intelligence Gathering
          4.12   (a)     Away fans arriving at grounds may be videoed as they come
                         through turnstiles, get off buses or leave railway
                         stations. This helps with identification and the tracing
                         of those responsible for causing trouble. It also makes
                         the fans aware that they are on record.
                         When grounds are full, the crowd my be filmed all round,
                         so that if trouble starts, identification wtll be
                         assisted. It wtll also make the crowd aware that they are
                         on record. To assist this procedure, it is always useful
                         to have identification marks around the ground so that the
                         fans’ locatton within the stadium can be pin-pointed with
                         accuracy.

!                (b)     Some clubs have followings from areas of the country many
                         miles from their home base. Therefore, when it is
                         necessary to identify persons from the crowd, photographs
                         and video recordings should be circulated to Forces who
                         have supporters) clubs of that particular football club tn
                         their area.
                 (c)     Each Force should compile sets of photographs and/or
                         videos of its own clubs’ hooligans and either (t) forward
                         on such compilation to each Force that is ltkely to host
                         the club during the forthcoming season, or (tt) one such
                         compilation be taken to each away game by officers
                         travelling wtth the club’s supporters.
                         Each host Force should supply the visiting team’s home
                         Force with photographs and video recordings of the
                         visiting team’s supporters, if their conduct is such as to
                         warrant this. This will keep Forces aware of how their
                         own club’s supporters behave away from home.
                 (d)     Some clubs have a section of supporters who are notorious
                         for hooligan behaviour. It would assist in future
                         investigations into serious disorder at other grounds if
                         the host Forces of these clubs prepared video recordings
                         and photographs of their hooligan element and established
                         the identity of those involved. Then by comparing this
 .°                      recording and the photographs with those of the incident
                         under investigation, identification should be greatly
                         assisted.
                 (e)     Known hooligans should be targetted and followed in video.
                         This requires local officers operating the vtdeo who can
                         be assisted by officers from the visiting team, s home
                         Force.
                 (f)       Identified fans displaying consistently, aggressive
=w                        behaviour, not amounting to a chargeable offence on a
      !                ¯ single occasion, but who. can be identified on other video

                                                                                 86
                                                                              I
                 recordings displaying similar conduct, should be traced
                 and charged on this evidence of system.
        (g)      The video recording of a footha11 fixture is a valuable
                  source of Intelligence which is often overlooked in the
                 absence of identified disorder.             It is strongly
                 recommended that all video recordings be viewed for
                 intelligence purposes, and that tapes be retained until
                 the corresponding fixture in the following season has been
                 played.
        Identification
4.13   In the event of large-scale andsertous disorder at a sporting
       fixture, there will be a need to develop a strategy to identify
       and arrest offenders, using the evtdence obtained by vtdeo
       recording and still photography. Practical guidance in thts
       process is as follows:-
       (a)      Photographs or sttlls from video recordings should be
                displayed for public view and identification wherever
                possible, e.g. T.V., newspapers, match programmes,
                posters, etc.

       (b)      A viewing studio should be created not only for the use of
                poltce officers, but for the public as well as such
                organtsattons as supporters’ clubs, stewards, residents’
                associations, soctal workers, probation officers, etc.
       (c)      Immediately after the incident, all press photographs and
                other media evidence should be obtained and statements
                taken from those responsible for taking the photographs,
                video recordings, etc. Attempts should also be made to
                obtain all amateur videos and photographs, and the
                appropriate statements taken. All this material, together
                with poltce photographs and video recordings, should then
                fom part of the viewing studio exhibits.
       (d)      Officers from the host Force should visit the visiting
                team’s area and other areas containing supporters’ clubs
                of the visiting team, where they should exhibit
                photographs and vtdeo recordings for tdenttftatton
                purposes as at (b) above.

       (e)      The size of the poltce team working on identification is
                critical. There should be sufficient to do the work, but
                it should be kept small enough to be cohesive.
       (f)      The task of viewing video recordings and photographs many
                times is tedious, therefore it is recommended that staff
                should "be selected who are interested in the sport
                involved.
       (g)       Once identified and traced, offenders should be invited to
                 view the video recordings and if they are able, to
                 identify themselves whtlst in non controversial
                 circumstances before being questioned ..about alleged
              i offences on video recordings and photographs.


                                                                         87
       (h)       Where people identify themselves Jn photographs, they
                 should be invited to indicate this on the reverse of the
                 photograph over their signature.

       (i)       Consideration should be given to videoJng suspects whilst
                 they are watchtng the recording of the Incident. Factal
                 expressions, bodtly movemnts and verbal exchanges my
                 form vital supporting evidence.

              specified Activity of such number of police officers as
              is in the opinion of the Chief Constable sufficient to

        5.11   No turnstiles should be classed as a means of escape.

    _   5.1Z   Under Section 10 (Emergency Procedures) of the Safety at Sports
               Grounds’ Act, 1975, a Local Authority is empowered, if it
               considers that due to any deficiency In safety procedures at a
               designated sports ground, to take certain steps to minfmise the
               risk to spectators. The Local Authority may apply to the courts
               for an order prohibiting or restricting a~tsston to the whole or
               any part of the ground until such steps have been taken to reduce
               the risk to spectators.
        5.13   If the court is satisfied, on the application of the Local
               Authority, that the risk to spectators at a sports ground is so
 ¯             great that, until steps have been taken to reduce Jt to a
.~             reasonable level, their admission ought to be prohibited, or
               restricted, the court may order, prohibit, or restrict, to the
               extent they consider appropriate in the circumstances of the
               case, the admission of spectators to the whole or any part of the
"~             ground, until such steps have been taken as, in the opinion of
_              the court, are necessary to reduce the risk to a reasonable
  i            level.
        5.14   If spectators are admitted to a sports ground in contravention of
               an order made under Section 10 of the Sports Grounds’ Act, 1975,
               any responsible person, and if a safety certificate is in
               operation, the holder of the certificate, shall be guilty of an
               offence.
        5.15   N.B. The Ftre Safety and Places of Sport Btll currently before
               Parliament amends the procedure under Section 10 of the 1975
               Safety at Sports Grounds’ Act by allowing the local authority to
               place an order of prohibition on sports ground managment if in
               their opinion the criteria at paragraph 16.12 above is satisfied.
               Thus disposing of the need to apply to a court for an appropriate
               order. The club management or holder of the safety certificate
               may appeal to the HagJstrates for cancellation or modification of
               the order.

                           Annual Inspection of Hillsborouqh Stadium as required
                                   by the Certificate of Ground Safety
      /
 /                  On.18 July 1988, I made an inspection of the ground
              duling the time that this year’s quota of crush barriers
              %’ere being tested by my fi.-m.
                   The results of =..he crush barrier testing are given
              ~ a separate report of today’s date.
                            I made ~ visual inspect-lon.of all the main structural
                      features of -~he ground. Particular attention was paid to
....                  gates ~nd entry .and exit routes and to boundary walls and
     ,/’~             ~ences. No’ significant d=fects were noted.
     [.,.f,~" ~.~,~{.       The roof of the South s~and was insDe~_ted from the oro~."-’.
                      I¢o deterioration in its condition was observed.
                            I certify that in my opinion the’various structures on
                      the ground are in a’satisfactory condition and appropriate for
                      the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid down in
                      the Cert!ficate’of Ground Safety.                           -- q

        Consider a parson on the nth step behind a barrier. The whole crowd is assumed
        to be up on its toes, inclined forward at an angle 0, in a fashion ~hich would
        be adopted to obtain a vlow of an incident in ft~at of the crowd. The
        spectator is ltmnf~g forward on a support pt~dad by the parson in front and
        is thus subject to supporting force Pn, from ~ fro~ and to a toppling force
        P~I, frma the parsaa behind, offset by the torraee step height h. -.

     18.3 Access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as possible
     in normal circumstances while, at the same time, providing the
     police with proper access to the terraces for the purposes of crowd
     control and enabling the pitch to be used in the event of serious
     emergency. One alternative to fencing is the construction around
     the pitch of a wall with a smooth surface which should be not less
     than 4 feet in height on the terrace side. This boundary wall should
     have gates or access points to the pitch which could be manned
     by the police or stewards. A walkway between the boundary wall
     and the terraces, which would be solely occupied by police, first
     aid and official club personnel, has been found to be effective as
     regards safety and security. In order to achieve this, it might be
     necessary to remove one or two rows of terracing and to protect
     the walkway from the terrace by a continuous line of barriers, so
     designed as to discourage access to the walkway except at authorised
     points. The access points from terrace to walkway should be
     reasonably near the access points from walkway to the pitch. (see
     paragraph 7.9). Where a walkway system is in use, sliding gates
     may be installed at the access points from the walkway to the pitch,
     ie where there can be no crowd pressure against them. (see paragraph
     6.14.2 regarding use of sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to the
     pitch is unnecessary where seating extends to the level of the playing
     area.

     18.4 Clubs should carefully consider their arrangements for the
     sale of alcohol. In any case all refreshments should be served in
     plastic containers.

     18.5 Home clubs should consider, in conjunction with the police,
     each of the matches and determine which should be all-ticket,
     and the allocation of tickets to the visiting club. So far as the

       the results of this investigation remove the doubt as to the safety
       of the barrier Or handrail, the barrier or handrail, as the case
       may be, should be deemed to have failed the test.

    7. A record should be kept of all the barriers and handrails tested
       and of their performances during the tests.

    Dear Dick,

                        Thank you for your letter of’2! April enclosing a copy
    of the co;munication from [                     You will probably
    know that there are several of these quick acting bolt devices
    on the ~arket. We have inspected some of them and have not
    yet been convinced that any of them are foolproof and good
    value for money.     The South Yorkshire Fire Service have
    also been keeping their ears to the ground and share our view.
            The one which is proposed by Mr.[      pounds to me
    to be possibly dangerous. Firstly, the gate is hinged about
    its bottom edge and falls forward on to the pitch surround
    when the explosive bolt is released.      It has to be kept in mind
    that police walk past the gates and clearly there could be a
    risk of injury.     It is also undesirable that the crowd should
    have tO walk out over the top of the gate which would be lying
    on the ground.
            The arrangement is also likely to be very expensive as
    it would be necessary to buy completely new gates and fit them
    ~n the safety fence. There will also be the cost of wirin9        -
    all the gates back to the central control point.
            It see~s the device is ~nlikely to be attractive but if

 Following lengthy discussions between The Fcotba!l Association

 joint signatures, a revised Memorandum on Crowd Manacer, ent.
This document sets out to a~.plify and clarify the "respcnsibi!ities
of Clubs in relation to this most difficult prob!em. Both our
bodies are fully aware of the enormous amount of tir.,e, money and
energy expended’by our C~ubs in ensuring tha: the public can
attend r..atches in safe~-y.  With the eyes of the ",’crld on us,
however, we cannot afford to relax for one r..:ment.
~4e ask you to study the Memorandum in great 4etai!. Failure to
act on any of the recon~:,e~dations "may be taken into accoun~ should
e Club subsequently be charged with misccnduc~ un;er Foctba!l
Association Rules 23 and 24.

      Dear Mr Chester
I,.

      SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS TO LEPPINGS LANE END OF ~ GROUND
      With reference to our conversation of last week regarding improv~-ents
      required to ~he west End of the ground, i fo-~ward herewith our thcughts.
      You will see that we favour the erection of a stone wall on the gTound side
      of the current terraces, with such wall housing a bank of turnstiles. Our
      belief is that once a spectator goes through the turnstiles he should then
      be segregated from the other fans, and this can be achieved by the erection
      of permanent high metal railings on T_hat concrete~entbehind
      the Stand. Similarly, there should be a hi~rail~cne centre
      of the West Stand. What is then created ~total segregatlon_n~all three
      portions of the Terrace and the two areas~_f the W~4~,,wlth each of
      these segregated areas having its own refreshment and toilet facilities.

      If you have any query on these recommendations, no doubt you will cc~e back
      tome.

      Yours sincerely




      Chief Superintende~

1. ~rpose of Meeting.
The p~rpose of the meeting was to carry out the "emmet" Lnspection of the
Stadium vith particular reference to the Leppinss Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

2.   Ground Inspection,.
A.    Leppir~s Lane End

The progress of the works to segregate visitln8 supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Working Party’s meetln8 held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastvood and Partners by the Chief Kxecutive*s letter
of 3Oth July) and Messrs. Eastvood & Partners reply of let August.

Messrs. Eastvood a Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
were likely to be required had now been sent to the ~,ildin8 Authority for
checki~and c~ent.

 On the inspection, the Buildin4; Authority pointed out what they considered
 to be the poor standard of workmanship in the constructicm of the new
 dividing vail which was being built behind the Stand. The position of the
 Police Personnel access gets and the stepping of the face of the wall by
 45 chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

 The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
 aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall
 and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on ~he plan suhnltted).

 As regards the single block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
 in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
 Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
 was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the wails were braced
 by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted
 the assurances given by Dr. Eastvood, but expressed concern that the

in the Male Toilets, it beln8 considered th¯t ¯ny hool~g¯n~sa or v¯nd¯l~sm
would be more likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

The Club pointed out that the new toilet facilities would not be ompletely
finished by the first match o£ the season (on 17th AuKust) but that
temporary facilities would be available and that no buildinK material would
be left on site.
The position of the new refreshment area under the most westerly staircase
up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This aKain had been built
straiKht onto the existinK onerete slabs.
                                                                  the

Central Terrace Pen.
As reK¯rds the upper se¯ted stand ¯re¯, Messrs. E¯stwood ¯nd Partners had
sent by letter dated 2nd AuKust plans of the new fences ¯nd barriers in
both the St¯nd ¯nd ¯t the Access level.

 IT WAS AGI%EED;-
 (¯) that the condition of the internal walls in the new male and female
 toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;
 (b) that the existins sate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
 extended or have steps to provide easier access from the new 2 m. wide 8¯p
 formed by the new r¯di¯l fence;
 () that a new sate in the pitch perimetar fence should be provided from
 the new South Centr¯l Terrace Pen;
 (d) that the advertislns hoardinKs at the front of the upper seated stand
 ¯ re¯ should be securely fixed to the concrete wall;

 (e)    that the sp¯lli~ of the concrete of the wall at the front of ~he
  upper se¯ted stand are¯ should receive ¯ttention ¯s ¯matter of maintenance;

  (f) tb~t the corrosion of the steel columns ¯t the rear of the St¯nd
  should receive ¯ttention on ¯ maintenance basis.

  B.       South Stand
  Messrs. East~ood & Partners reported that the condition of the upper
  concrete outer portion of the exterior wall of the Stand had been
  investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.

  It was noted chat the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of ~he
  Stand had been largely completed, and the spraylnK of the non-slip
  surface was to c~ence very shortly (and certainly be completed by ~he
  start of the season).
]! WAS ~l~ that the metal iheeti~ of the ~odtn upper portion of ~he
Stand should l~gely overcome the fla~nbility probl~s inherent in such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they would ensure that the
vooden intermadiate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the ~
layi~ c~ the metal sheetina~

C.    Spion lop

Hessrs. Zast~aood a Partners recalled that outline details of the Club’s
proposal to cover the Spoon Kop had been sent for the information of the
Officer WorkinK Party by letter dated 22nd July. As part of that scheme,
the bridKe portion of the Kop ~ould be removed. Its present condition
remained acceptable with continuinK maintenance.

In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
additional Kate in the p{tch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushins hazard which could
occur ~dlen larks crowds were present.
IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new ~ate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
arrar4ement to assist access and caress.

D.    North Stand
The temporary 8toraKe facilities created by the erection of a timber wall
(in front of the Ladies’ Chanain~ Facilities in the Sports Eall) were
inspected.

IT WAS AGREED that so long as li$ht combustibles (such as paint) were not
stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
basis.

 E.   Closed Circuit TelevisionFacilities.

 The advantaKes for Keneral cr.~d control and security (both in and outside
 the Stadia) which would be Kxven by the recently installed Closed Circuit
 Television System ~tre explained to the Officer WorkinK Party.

 IT WAS AGREED:-
 (a) that a 2| ks. C02 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the
 Police Control Box and’the Disc Jockey Box;

 (b)    that loose external vires on the outside of the Boxes should be made
 secure ¯

             For the attention of Mr. D. Vau~han

             Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                              .~-’ Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975
                                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                     Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
             outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.          We note
             the general comment that the calcul&tions have to be approved
L            by the BuildingSurveyors Department. We believe that all the
             calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
             checking and comment.
                     With regard to your detailed observations ourresponse
             is as follows ~"                             ¯                    ¯
              (a)       We are:not sure of the    location on the West terrace of
                                               -:
             the proposed.extra,~_ security gate. There is already a gate in
             the 2m wide;:g’a~fo~ed by the new radial fence for use by the
                 ¯   :.    , ..~t..
             pol~ce.    This same gate will still be available for the spectators
             in emergency a~-there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
             which will be under the control of the police.          This point may
             perhaps be clarified during the Working Party’s visit on 7 August.
             (b)         The foundations’for___this fence are in fact already aligned in

         the way you suggest.
         (c) and (d)
                We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
         single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
         walls. The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
         vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
         Studding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
         durability, and would probably invite vandalism.
         (e~     The refreshment area is under the most westerly
         staircase up to the north west corner terrace. There will
         ~ean opportunity to inspect on 7 August.
          {~f~ -. The handrail is to be at a height of 125Omm (4’i")
         above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
         step.
          [g~    The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45°
         ¢d!aunfers which will not form good footholds.
         (h) Mr. Chester says that the club will certainlynot
         object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
         the ~recise location can be discussed on 7 August.
                As with point (a), we are not sure what is intended,
         anc~ the matter can be discussed on 7 August.
                                      ..
         #j)-     Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
                care ofl by Mr. Chester.

                It will be much easier fo~¯ your Working Party to
         appreciatel w~at is intended when they see the works under
         c~nstruction~; There will aiso bean opportunity to see
         the metal, decking of the South stand. ~ .....

    letter dated 25th July from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners of arrangements
    for the segregation of visiting spectators at¯ the Leppings Lane End of the
    Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Nednesday Football Club. It was
    recalled that consideration of outline proposals had ta.ken place by the
    Officer Working Parry on 18th April, 1985.. Whilst formal application had been
    made for Building Regulation approvaX and some of the work had actually
    commenced, Messrs. Easrwood and Partners had apologised by ’phone that
    submission of the detailed proposaTsI for Safer7 of Sports Grounds Act
    approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure Of work and staff
    ¯ holidays. The plans also !ncluded de~ails .0f repa!rs to certain crush
    barriers on the Spion Kop ....

    between Turnstiles 16 and 17;                    "
    (c)    Plan No. 6705/9A - the slngIe block thickness of the interal walls

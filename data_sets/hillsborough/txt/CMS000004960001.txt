      of the Football League, asks the Secretary of State for a meeting
      to discuss finance for the Taylor recommendations on football

      stadia-

      2.   Finance has of course been overtaken by the Chancellor's
      concession on Pool Betting Duty. The Minister will have seen the
      Times report of 22 March (attached) which reports Mr Sandford's
      welcome for the concession.    Mr Sandford is reported as saying
      that the League will respond by ’drawing up a total strategy to
      meet the requirements of the Taylor report'.

      3.   The planning issues which the League are concerned about
      will be on the agenda for the forthcoming meeting between the
      Home Secretary, the football authorities and the Minister.            I

                               !

Thank you for your letter of 1 March to the Secretary of State

about the financing of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations on

football ground safety and the planning issues surrounding the

development of new and existing grounds.



The    Chancellor         of       the    Exchequer's         announcement      in    his    Budget

Statement about the reduction of Pool Betting Duty reflects the

Government's          concern            to    ensure        that   vital     improvements       to

football groundsare made.                      I have noted the remarks attributed to

you     in    the    Times         article         of   22    March.     Your    positive      and

constructive response underlines the Government's view that the

football authorities will now take urgent steps to provide for

the safety and comfort of their spectators by implementing Lord

Justice Taylor's           recommendations               as quickly as possible.               Not

least    of       these improvements               is   of course      the    introduction of

all-seater stadia.
              i




As    you     know    a   meeting             is   to   be    arranged      between    the    Home

Secretary,         yourselves,           the Football          Association      and myself      to

discuss the next steps in taking forward Lord Justice Taylor's

recommendations.           That meeting will also provide an appropriate

opportunity to discuss the planning issues raised in your letter.

             Dear Sir,

             SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB - HILLSBOROUGH

                          of our Engineering Department, has informed me of your
             latest communication regarding the alterations that have been discussed
             in conjunction with the Sheffield Wednesday camera position at Hillsborough.

             In previous correspondence, we did agree to meet one third of the cost of
             the new access walkway for safety reasons, but now I understand from
             that we are being asked to contribute a similar proportion for a lifting
             hoist and a canopy above the camera platform.

             I am advised that we can do without the lifting hoist and we do not require
i        i   the canopy above the camera platform, and in our present financial position,
             I am afraid there is no hope of us getting money to meet these additional
■4il         alterations.

             Yours faithfully,

For the attention of

Dear

           Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                       Camera Facilities
     Before Christmas John Aitken at the BBC rang to discuss
the camera facilities at Hillsborough. He told us that the
BBC are unwilling to contribute towards the work on the accesB
platform in the South stand unless the lifting beam is
included in the scheme. This leaves us and our client in a
difficult position for it is not clear who will be paying the
relative proportions for the work. It would therefore be
appeeciated if a decision could be made between the parties
                                                              •   :v;.- -
involved as to the extent of the work and also the financial
contribution each is to make. For the time being we have
stopped work on the project.
     In the same conversation with John Aitken he expressed
reservations about the erection of a 'permanent* scaffolded
camera platform on Spion Kop. He doubted whether the BBC
camera crews would use a 'permanent' scaffold structure.  (We
assume that it is Intended that the platform should be
shared). He was expecting a covered platform constructed In
structural steelwork with a proper deck and possibly clad *
with steel sheeting. If you do have erected a scaffold type
       structure and the BBC crews refuse to use it then there could
       be times when two platforms are present1
            Once again it seems that some agreement should be made
       about the requirements and a basic design brief prepared.
       South Yorkshire County Cpuncil have informed us that any
  structure at the top of Spion Kop will need planning
^permission and needs to satisfy the requirements of the South
       Yorkshire Act. These requirements should not create
       difficulties and we can go through the necessary procedures.

/'Dear Eric,
                     Television Facilities
       There is disagreement between ITV and BBC.
       Firstly BBC would prefer a more permanent structure at
 the top of Spion Kop, steel framed and clad in colour coated
 steel sheets. Obviously this is much better, but it would only
 be justified if the Kop is not likely to be roofed over in the
 foreseeable future.
       With regard to the facilities over the South stand, BBC
 are only interested in extending the platform and the new access
 ladder if a lifting beam is included.   Apparaetly YTV will not
 contribute towards the lifting beam, and in any case we have
 the complication of possible future developments behind the South
 stand.
       When your Board have had the opportunity to consider the
 matter I will call in for a chat.
       You will be glad to know that they do not appear to be
 quibbling about paying our fees for the abortive work on the
 platform in the South stand.

                                   Yours sincerely,

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

Lord Justice Taylor has asked me to thank you for your letter of
23 November.

On the question of legal representation at the public hearings of
the inquiry, you will know that an application by Mr Stuart Brown
of Counsel for the Police Federation to have separate
representation at the oral hearings in Sheffield was refused by
Lord Justice Taylor on 15 May.  Both Mr Brown and Counsel for the
South Yorkshire Police, however, accepted that there was at that
stage no conflict of interest, and it was on that basis that Lord
Justice Taylor reached his decision.   In doing so, he emphasised
that, should any conflict of interest emerge subsequently, it
would be open to those acting for the Federation to make a
further application for representation.   He said:-

      "You are free to come back at any time and, of course, there
      is nothing to stop the Federation from having someone here
      with a watching brief ..." (Transcript Day 1 15 May 1989 p.7
      - copy attached).

No such application was made to Lord Justice Taylor during the
remainder of the oral hearings.

On the question of evidence at the public hearings, you may
perhaps have seen the written evidence which the Police
Federation submitted to Lord Justice Taylor on 6 July, shortly
after the conclusion of the oral hearings in Sheffield.  The
second paragraph of that evidence read as follows

      "We are not as an organisation able to offer the Inquiry any
      evidence concerning the events at Hillsborough.  We are
      satisfied that the Inquiry has conducted an exhaustive
      examination of the policing arrangements for the match on 15
     April and of the events that occurred."

The material put before Lord Justice Taylor in the course of the
public inquiry at Sheffield included the evidence of 66 police
officers of many ranks, situated widely round the stadium and its
immediate surroundings on that day.  Throughout the course of the
oral hearings, Lord Justice Taylor made clear that every
opportunity would be afforded to any of the represented parties
to have any witness called whom they wished.  He expressed that
view at the outset of the hearings on 15 May and it was
reiterated on a number of occasions right to the end of the oral
hearings.  If such evidence existed, it should have been brought
to the inquiry's attention at that stage.  As has already been
made clear to the solicitors acting for the Police Federation of
England and Wales, ample opportunity has already been given to
present all relevant evidence, and Lord Justice Taylor is not
prepared at this stage to consider the matter further.

So far as evidence for the second stage of his Inquiry is
concerned, Lord Justice Taylor, together with one of his
Assessors, Mr Brian Johnson, the Chief Constable of Lancashire,
met representatives of the Police Federation on 28 November and
received oral evidence from them.  The representatives came on
behalf of the Police Federation of England and Wales Joint
Central Committee.  Lord Justice Taylor does not intend to hear
evidence from individual branches of the Federation.

I am copying this letter to the Private Secretary to the Home
Secretary.

15th APRIL 1989 HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER


You may recollect that on the 20th April 1989 I forwarded to you
under a covering letter my notes on the above disaster.  In a
conversation with a Parliamentary colleague, Michael Shersby who
is, as you will probably be aware, Parliamentary Advisor to the
Police Federation, he drew to my attention the fact that he held
a meeting with the South Yorkshire Police Federation on the 3rd
October.

Some of the events he related to me bear a close resemblance to the
events which were related to me by officers who had been on the
scene of the disaster.  Furthermore, a reporter has also reported
to me events which again repeat some of the points. Thus from three
separate sources information has been brought to my attention which
I believe should be considered as outlined in paragraph 19 of your
report to the then Home Secretary of the 1st August 1989 and I quote
the last sentence in full - " I shall now proceed to consider the
large body of written evidence which has been submitted.  I shall
want in some instances to have further oral evidence or discussion
in conjunction with my Assessors.  We shall also need to make a
number of visits and inspections".

Accordingly I consider that the Police Federation of South Yorkshire
should have a meeting with you and/or your Assessors in order to
ventilate and, indeed, give evidence as they claim they were nob
"heard" at the Inquiry.  I enquire if this has been done or can be
done within the very near future.

I apologise for the delay in bringing this information to your
attention, but it only recently came into my possession.

I am copying this letter to the Rt Hon David Waddington M.P., Home
Secretary.

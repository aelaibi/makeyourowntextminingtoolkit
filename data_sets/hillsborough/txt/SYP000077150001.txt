                                           and I reside at                                                                This

              address with                              brothe r

              Since the age of about nine or tejp years, I have been a very keen
                    c a -r
              supporter of Liverpool Fo^tJ^afTl Club and have visited their fixtures

              both at home and away,                      on a regular basis,               since this time.

              I am a member of the official Liverpool Supporters Club, at the

              Harrogate and District Clut/v located at the Odeon Cinema in Harrogate,

              which I attend on a regular basis,                             each week.

              My brother,                                       is also a member of the same club and

              together we go to the Liverpool                             fixtures,        due to the fact we are both

              season ticket holders.

              On April 9th 1988 (090488),                        together with my brother and other club
                                                                                        PAGE        2
                                                                                        82141

         members,    I attended the F .A . Cup s.em^final      fixture between Liverpool

         and Notts.    Fore $ J s T o o t b a 11 Club, at the Hillsborough Ground,

         Sheff ield,
c a t
         On that/particular day,       I held a ticket for the Leppings Ln area
IB 3 &
         ter rate ing, and I stood in the area of Pen Two         (as per the map).

                    occasion,   the crowd was heavy, and the day passed without any

         incident to my knp<5iedge.

         The p o 1icibaXarangement was in my view very good,          because there were a

         lot of Police,    both inside and outside the Ground, and unless

         spectators had tickets they were not allowed to get in the vicinity of

         the Ground.

         On Saturday 15th April      1989 (150489), Liverpool and Notts.         Forest were

         again the teams to take part in one of the F.A. Cup semi-final

         fixtures.     This fixture was again held at the Hillsborough Ground,

         Sheffield.

         Due to the fact     I am a member of the official Supporters Club and a

         season ticket holder,      I was able to obtain a ticket for the game as

         described,    by this means.

         My brother,                      also did the same, and we managed to get

         seat tickets for the W Stand seated area, although I cannot                 recall   the

         actual amount    paid.    I believe    it was    in the region of about fifteen

         pounds for each ticket.

         At approximately 10.30 am       (1030 hrs) on this date,      together with

                     I boarded the official      coach,   for this occasion,    outside the

         Odeon Cinema in Harrogate.
                                          c a t  c o ^v c h -
         I believe the name of the coach firm was Dodswqrtfr^Co4ch Company.

         When we boarded the coach,       other members of the Supporters Club were

         already on board, after being         picked up at

         From Harrogate,    we then travelled to the Metro Centre, Leeds, where we

         collected other members before we then carried on to Sheffield.

Whilst en route to Sheffield,         the coach actually stopped on a motorway

service area,     on the M1,     for the purpose of a rest and for refreshment.

Although there were other Liverpool           supporters   in the area,     they were

well   behaved and presumably they had stopped for the same purpose as

ourselves.

We stopped at the services for about twenty minutes before continuing

to Sheffield.

Although I cannot say what junction we left the motorway,               I can say

that   it took about 45 to 60 minutes to arrive at our dropping off

point, which was about a mile from the Hillsborough Ground from the

time we left the motorway.          The traffic volume was very heavy, and you

were travelling bumper to bumper.

The Police were controlling major junctions, and although we were not

subject to this,       some coaches and other vehicles were being stopped

and searched by uniform Police Officers.

When we were about a mile from the Ground,           Police directed us to a

piece of land, and the coach parked and we had to walk to the Ground.

Prior to leaving the coach, we did in fact           pass numerous pubs ap* the

main road into Hillsborough.          These pubs were full of       v e j/ tf a o 1

supporters drinking beers, although they appeared to be well                  behaved.

When we started to walk,         we just went with the rest of th^ supporters

to the Leppings Ln area of the Ground.

It was evident at this time that a lot of supf^o rt^fs did not have
                                              \ ^ ~------------- — —
tickets,    because we were asked       on numerous occasions for tickets and

you could see other supporters doing the same.

It was also e v i/C e n t   that supporters   in the immediate vicinity of the

Leppin^^^n/Sarea,       which amounted to hundreds     in numbers, were just

walking and sitting around.          They did not make any attempt to gain

access.

I cannot    recall   if they were drinking,      only that they were well

We arrived at the Leppings Ln turnstiles at about         1.30 jfm       (1330 hrs)

and entered through a turnstile      in the section markea 1-16 on the map.

At this time,    there was nobody around the turnstiles and with my.

brother,    I just walked straight   in, after giving my ticket to the

operator.

I did in fact have my ticket      checked by stewards and at this time, at

least two mounted Police Officers were observing us and the rest of

the spectators just outside.

Once   inside the Ground,   I had occasion to purchase a programme, and

then walked to the area which gave me direct access to the area in

front of the tunnel,    which leads to Pens 3          4 on the map.         It was

at this time, after    liaising with my brp'Cner, we decided to go onto

the terracing rather than the seats.
     CATT
We walked through the tunnel >^ncj/into the back of Pen 4.

The volume of people    in Pen 4 and Pen 3 was quite heavy, and people

were quite tightly packed together,      to such a degree that if for

example someone was trying to eat a sandwich or drink a cup of tea,

they would not have been able to do so.

As we looked around,    it could be seen J^Hat the side Pens, Pens            1, 2,

5, 6 and 7, were virtually empty.      J rn   view of this, we decided to go

back through the tunnel and tfcyyto get into the side Pens.               However,

when I got to the other end of the tunnel, I could not s      o   r
                                      Di«£j£jr-n c W
any stewards, and there were no signs telling^ me hoji/to get to the

sides.

I climbed up some stairs at the rear of the stand which gave me access

to the seated area.     I still   could not gain access to anywhere else so

I decided to go to our allocated match viewing         point, which was a seat

in the 2nd or 3rd row of the W Stand,         just to the right of the goal,

overlooking Pen 3.

            I took up my match viewing po\jt*'w in the seats, and at about S . 45 pm

            (1445 hrs)   I had occasion to go to the toilet, which is situated at

            the fear of the seats,    in the W Stand.    Also at this   location is a

            line of windows which overlook the turnstiles and the road area of

            Leppings Ln.

            The volume of people outside the Ground was very heavy, and I would

            say that there were thousands outside.       It was a total mass of people.

            People were slowly entering the Ground, and I did not think that there

            was any particular    problem outside.   I could hear the supporters

            singing, as like any other football game,       and as far as I could/liee,

            they appeared to be well     behaved.
                                                    O t\T u^/yum-
            I observed the crowd outside the Ground and I did sel^ o^ffe or two

            people climb over the turnstile, although I did not see any other

            people gain access other than through an authorised entry.          I did not

            see any gate open,

            I returned to my seat and a^lfer a few minutes,      the two football teams

            came onto the pitch.     Dr was at this time,    the spectators   in the
T e A M 3
   ON       seated area stood uf/and at the same time,       the spectators   in the lower
 P ir u t
            terracing suiNaed/rorward.     Unlike other games,   when supporters
            —            \
            surge forward and immediately come back to their original         point;   on

            this occasion the spectators surged forward and remained where they

            were.    This made the crowd become very ti g h t 1v^packed together.

            The spectators   could easily b e heard to stream and shout to move back.

            At the same time   people at the front/of the crowd had managed to climb
 c a t
            onto the front   perimeter fencingy^and they too were shouting and
^ N / c u C r indicating with their arm^to/fnove back.

            The game started, and suddenly about twelve supporters       ran from the

            back of the seated area behind me and ran to the front of the stand.

            Almost simultaneously,    a group of Police Officers    ran across the

            stand,   from my right hand side, and tried to push them back.

        My initial       reaction was that the supporters had gained access without

            tickets and the Police tried to intervene of my own accord,                I then

        moved away to my right, and took up my 2 nd match viewing                  point   (as per

        rnap) in order       I could continue to see the game.

C A T   When I moved,        I saw that a number of s u p p o r t e r ^ w e r e starting to climb ...

            the perimeter fence in front of Pens 3 and^'4 and gain access to the
             ---- —  ------------------------ — .  X   -------------------------------
            track area immediately behind the goajK   At this point, I recall a

            number of Police Officers       came to the area from the corner of the N

        Stand, and stood by the goal.

            I concentrated on the match but I did see spectators being pulled up

            into the seats area,      from the terracing below.
 m
 ^      I    thought    it was going to be a pitch invasion,         because more spectators

            tried to climb over the fence.

            At about 3.05 pm (1505 hrs),        I did in fact see a teenager        run up to

            one of the Liverpool      players and he spoke to him.         After this, a

            Police Officer    ran onto the pitch and spoke to the referee.              Almost

            immediately the game was stopped and both teams were taken off the

            pitch.

            At this point, my attention was drawn to centre Pens 3 and 4 behind

            the goal.

            More and more people were climbing over the fencing, and the area was

            generally chaotic.      The   poeple who had climbed over the fencing

            appeared to be very distressed.

        Some just       collapsed on the pitch?       some were walking around.in what

        appeared a state of shock, and some were running^fbout erratically                         as

            though they did not know what to do.           Soon      became evident that

            something had gone wrong because people/were screaming with fright and
           fbnac*£- A T
        Police were trying frantically to P4 4 I people out,               over the fencing.

        Although I obviously saw a 1o t \ o f A>eo pie being treated on the playing

        area, and being comforted,           I can only remember particular details

                     about one individual.
       ♦
                     This    person was a white male, aged about 30 - 35 years old.                    He was
IN S j f - f '
J)£ X P {\           average build and possibly 6 ’0 tall.         He was wearing blue jeans and a

                     black    leather jacket.

                     This    patient   (as marked on map) was about       10 - 12 yards from the back

                     goal    line,   lying with his feet towards the goal          line and the head

                     towards the Spion Hop.       He was     in a collapsed state,          lying on his

                     back.

                     Standing by the side of this man was a white              lady, with blonde

                     shoulder    length hair,   and wearing glasses.          Shj*' was    in a very

                     distressed condition.

                     The    patient was   lying down and a stew^r^f opened the shirt a nd pulled

                     his trousers down.      He then performed heart massage.                I cannot recall

                     if anyone gave mouth to mouth resusci tat ion , although other                  people

                     were around him.

                     The steward tried to revive the patient for about ten minutes.                       There

                     was no obvious success,      because the jacket was          placed over the

                     patient's face, which indicated to me that he was dead.

                     The situation on the pitch was chaotic, with other                   patients   apparently

                     lying dead and others being treated.

                     After about twenty minutes,          the Notts. Forest supporters started to

                     chant at the Liverpool supporters,         although I cannot recall what was

                     shouted.                                             _
                                                 C a -i
                     This chanting caused about       100 Liverpool    su#(forters to run towards the

                     Notts. Forest supporters      in the Spi^n H y p ,   but a large number of

                     Police entered the Ground and forcedMfhe Liverpool                   supporters back.

                     The Police then formed a cordon across the pitch,                presumably to stop

                     any possible fighting taking place.
                                                    o r r                f-toAi£0
                     Supporters then started to rip down the aciveVtLsement boards in order

                     to carry the dead and injured supporters to the other end of the

Sometime during the afternoon,    I did see the gates in Pens 3 and 4

open,   in order to allow supporters out of the jjjN^jsy'put I cannot say

who opened them or at what time the gates were opened.

My initial thought/as to why this tragedy took place is that in my
           (L s c ry t=vi>/<£*£JS c o
view, no stewyjy or Police control was in operation at the entrance te

the tunnel, which obviously allowed more supporters to enter Pens 3

and 4» than it was obviously built for.      The   capacity of people



                                                                 see enough



the vast   crowd.

My third view is that due to the numbers,      I feel that the Liverpool

supporters should have been allocated the larger stand,         ie. the Spion

Kop rather than the Leppings Ln.     This   is obviously because of the

larger number of Liverpool    than Notts. Forest   supporters.

I also felt there could have been better First Aid equipment than

there was on this day.

I eventually left the Ground of my own accord at about 4.30 pm

(1630 hrs) with my brother who I had met back up with in the W Stand,

sometime earlier,   although I cannot say at what time that was.

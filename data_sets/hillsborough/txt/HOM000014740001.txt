Dear Sir,

I write to ask you most strongly to ensure that Mr. Wright
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire is held responsible for his
officers actions and the honourable thing is done by accepting
his resignation.


I also enclose a copy letter which if you read it will show you
another case of bad management at work.

Having written to you on two occasions before and not receiving
the courtesy of even an acknowledgement I hope to receive a
reply to this letter.

Yours faithfully/

 Wembley Stadium Limited/
 We/bley
 LONDON

                                         15th August 1989


Dear Sirs,

On Saturday 12th August I attended Wembley Stadium for the
Charity Shield match between Liverpool and Arsenal.

I left St. Helens at 8.15 a.m. and arrived at Wembley at
1.05p.m.    At 1.30 p.m. I made my way to the Stadium.    I
went in Block F as per my ticket and eventually found
Entrance 78 as per my ticket.         I was stopped at the
entrance 78 by a Steward who looked at my scarf and said
you are a Liverpool       fan you have to go to another
entrance.     He told me the number and pointed in the
general direction.     I proceeded to this other entrance
where I was again told to go to another entrance.         I
eventually arrived at this entrance and a man took my
ticket off me without a word and handed me another ticket
and then said "You on your own, this is a good seat iust ao
up there".

I climbed up yet more stairs and then I started on a walk
which I thought was never going, to end.           I later
discovered I had had to walk from Block Fwhere my original
ticket was for to Block D.   I walked and walked along this
corridor which I later found out was the Olympic Gallery.
Eventually feeling very hot and bothered I found the seat I
had been re-allotted.    When I sat down in it I could not
see properly as there was a sort of yellow rail in front of
me and the only way I could have seen was to bend my head
right down.

By this time I was very annoyed.  I went out to the Steward
and asked to see someone in authority, he asked me what was
wrong I explained, and he said just sit anywhere and I said
and supposing someone comes in with a ticket for the seat I
am sitting in, I will have to move again.    He said it was
not his fault and I told him that was why I had asked to
see someone in authority.
                          2


He went away and returned with a gentleman in grey pants,
white shirt and carrying a walkie talkie in one hand and a
wad of tickets in the other hand, who asked me what the
trouble was.    I told him.    He said just pick your seat
and I will give you a ticket for it.     I said the seat I
wanted to sit in was the seat I had purchased at the
Anfield Ticket Office the day after the tickets went on
sale for the price of £15.     I told him I did not want to
sit up in the Olympic Gallery away from all the Liverpool
Supporters, away from my two daughters who were in another
part of the ground closer to to the original place I should
have been sitting and whom I was to meet outside Block F at
the end of the game.

He could see I was getting agitated and said that it was
not his fault when I asked him why I could not sit in the
seat I bought a ticket for.    He said that the Arsenal and
Liverpool fans had both been given tickets for the same
area and that they had decided to move the Liverpool fans.
When I again complained he said it was not his fault and I
asked him whose fault it was and the n he said 'those famous
words we heard so often last- year "it was just an
unfortunate happening".


I started the day with a £15 ticket for Block F Row 20 Seat
No. 4 which I purchased from the Anfield Ticket Office
after handing in the appropriate voucher from my Paddock
Match Book.     That ticket was taken from me and I was
handed a £35 Olympic Gallery ticket when I c nplained about
the view from that seat I was handed yet another £35
Olympic Gallery ticket.

I wish to protest most strongly as follows              -

How was it possible for tickets to be sold at Anfield to a
season ticket holder and also to be sold to Arsenal fans ?

Who is to blame for this ?   It is not "just an unfortunate
happening" it is gross bad management.

Why was this not realised before and why were the Liverpool
fans the ones to be moved ?

Why were we shoved upstairs to the Olympic Gallery which
was full of business men, foreigners and to add insult to
injury for me personally I was sitting next to two Arsenal
fans with an Arsenal fan sitting behind me.     I was told
the reason I could not sit in the seat I had purchased a
ticket for was because of the Arsenal fans being there but
I ended up sitting between the self same fans and infront
of them.

2he ticket I purchased was from Anfield, I gave the
appropriate voucher in and paid my £15 the day after the
tickets went on sale.   If I had bought the ticket from one
of the many touts who were selling them outside the stadium
and along Wembley Way I could have understood it but as

having   to go through such a terrible time and end up in a
seat I   did not want to be in surrounded by Arsenal fans and
other    people who were definitely not Liverpool Season
Ticket   Holders like myself.

I await to hear from you with an explanation of the above.

Yours faithfully/

Dear Hr. Hurd,
     Having followed fee course of Hie Hillsborou# tragedy and fee ®su i n g enquiiy
with great care, I am writing to you to express sujjort for the line taken by fee
South Yorkshire Police Comaittee in not accepting the resignation of the
Chief Constable.   I find the Interim Report of Mr. f'stic© a^[?OT. ^           «.e
unsatisfactoiy and totally biased agiinst a good Police Farce who have, over
years, controlled not only football crowds but a^ o teiiiger^t ^ k i n g m m e r s
and steelworkers without allowing 1he situation to get out of hand.

      To my mind Hr. Taylor has given insufficient consideration to five f a c t o ® :

a)     The Sheffield Wednesday football ground has for many years been selected^by
the FJL. as a venue      for Cup semi-finals.   There has never beenany suggestion
that   the ground was    dangerous, or crowd control negligent.

 b)    The ground was    selected in 1966 for International matchesin fee World Cup
 and as such met high FJE.F.A. standards.

 c)   The ground has been recognised generally both iraide and outside footballing
 circles as one of fee best grounds in fee Country.

 d)   The visits to fee ground by Liverpool F.C. and their                     J en
 frequent.   The Police fee re fore knew what they c o u M aspect, and from their
 experience feey must have known the best positions for crowd control.

 e)   What marked out feis occasion from all others, however, was fee
 numbers of Liverpool supporters arriving just before J ^ ^ t c h ® 3        to begin
 in a vary drunken state (and some without tickets), all determined to forcB
 J T S     i S T t h e ground at all costs to see the kick off.  * * * ■ » ■ » ? 1316
 sort of riotous assembly fee Police could have been expected to anticipate.

       I consider feat Mr. Justice Taylor has clearly             taken fee ‘ s o f t * option of _
  blaming fee Police rather fean recognising fee feet             feat in any civilized
  it is the duty of all citizens to behave themselves             in a decent manner.        Without
  such behaviour law e n f o r c e m e n t is impossible unless   we becane something akin
   ns«n-s«o-Stffte*        There were several witnesses at the enquiiy "ho testified to
t h e b e h a v i o i a r of many of the <tma' but tteir testimony « . <=1“ ^ ?
4         -in the desire to attach no bLame to ihe Liverpool ‘fans .        In short,
     i^b of the Police was made near impossible by these people’s behaviour.
It w u l d have n e e d e d hundreds of Policemen outside the ground to control such a
drunken mob»
     The Interim Report has the effect of exonerating 1fae louts ifco caused■ * «
tragedy and victimising the very people who saved lives xn an imposs

       Many people in Sheffield who were sympathetic at first are becoming sick and
tired of^hearing fee work Liverpool and the complaints from the so c a ^ e d fans
S T m u ^ t take a major share in the responsibility Ibr this tragedy which killed
many of their fellows*

British justice - NO - how can Lawyers or any persons connected with the
judiciary advocate a parallel between the police at Hillsborough and the
Zeebrugge tragedy (Daily Mail front page 5th August).

Police officers are human beings - NOT ROBOTS - they do the job they do
because they are, on the whole, a caring sector of our sick society. Perhaps
there were errors of judgements and slow responses to the overwhelming horror
of the unfolding disaster BUT can any other human being be adamantly certain
of his or her responses to any given set of circumstances?

In the case of the Zeebrugge disaster all the passengers were innocent and
faultless. This cannot be said of the Hillsborough situation when, had all
the supporters had tickets, arrived on time and behaved in a civilised and
sober manner, this calamity would never have happened and my thoughts and
prayers to-day need not be with the police officers involved. These officers
must be distressed enough after such a harrowing experience.

 It is time our Police Force received more support in its frequently thankless
 and dangerous task of maintaining law and order in situations which are often
 extremely volatile.


Yours faithfully

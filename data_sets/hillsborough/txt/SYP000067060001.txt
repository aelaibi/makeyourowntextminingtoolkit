                2 of the West S t a n d , a bove the L e p p i n g s Ln terrace.                             I had been

                particularly          relieved to ob t a i n seats                   this year       because at         last y e a r ’s

                game    in the       semi-final we were                 in the terrace          itself       (in the      right

                hand    corner       behind the goal)             and      it had been         t e r ribly      crowded and

                unpleasant.
     >          --------------


                On S a t u r d a y we found that outside                     the ground        there were a large              number

                of supp o r t e r s    trying         to get      in to a small             number    of t u rnstiles and

                that    there was          very      little Police           presence.         I saw no stewards             outside

                the ground.           There a p p e a r e d       to have been no attempt                 to marshall         the

                supporters          into    lines      in a d v a n c e    of our a p p r o a c h i n g   the turnstile

                areas.



                We m a n a g e d    to get      nearer       to the turn s t i l e s         but the      crush was becoming

     ^          unpleasant.            I heard a P o l i c e           officer       telling    the supporters            that

                it was         their own fault             for   coming      late.



                I d e c i d e d that       I did not want              to go on because           it was so unpleasant.

                        said       it w o u l d only get w orse and                  that    he was going         in.

                and                   insisted on going                 in w i t h            and they stayed where

                they were as          I w i t h d r e w to the w r o u g h t - i r o n fence.



                After a few m i n u t e s            I thought         I w o u l d try a g a i n .     I could not see my

                f a m i l y and a s s u m e d       that    they had m a n a g e d to get thro u g h the

                turnstiles.           When      I     approached again               it was    now m u c h worse and a g a i n
                                                                                                        PAGE       3
                                                                                                        S 1 132

I withdrew.            I was aware       of an officer           trying       to    close o ne of the

wrought      iron gates,         but he had no           chance on his own.                I noticed that

there was        now a Police        landrover         in the      lane j ust outside            the gates

and my instincts and              e x perience       of 30 years as Liverpool                  supporter

told me that           things were       badly wrong.             I went      to the Police         landrover

a n d o b t ained the a t t e n t i o n of one of the Officers.                         I said to him,

" Y o u ’ve got    to get a grip of this situation,                          it is out of        control,

there     is going to be a tragedy".                     He seemed bemused and unresponsive.

Peo p l e w ere    closing       in ar o u n d the       landrover and             I w i t h d r e w to the

other     side of the        road to see          if it w o u l d        ease off and        I could try

again.      The    time     now must       have been 2.4 5 - 2.5 0                 (1445 - 1450 h r s ) .



A f t e r a few minu t e s       I suddenly         realised that            eve r y b o d y had gone     in and

I was able to walk              up to the turns t i l e s and gain a d m i s s i o n without

d i f f i c u l t y after   t e n dering my ticket.



O nc e   inside the t u r n s t i l e      it was at first               unclear where        I should go.

T h e r e were    no     stewards in sight and the s e c t i o n                    labelling was

confusing.         I      realised w here         the entrance was to the West S t a n d and

w ent    to get    in after       buying a programme.                   At   this stage       I had no idea

that     things    had a c t u a l l y    now d e t e r i o r a t e d    to the extent that            they had

done.      It must       have    been just after 3 . 0 0                pm   (1500 hrs).



When     I went    to the gate           into the West          stand there were a few other

people     in the       process    of getting          in and two P o l i c e m e n were           checking

their     tickets.          I then became aware               of a m a n      crying and bese e c h i n g the

Police     "There        are kids dying           in there," He said,                " Y o u ’ve got   to do

somethi n g ".



He se e m e d to have        come out of the t e r r a c e d area.                   The P o l i c e were
                                                                                                         PAGE        4
                                                                                                         S1132

unresponsive           to him.      They       cheeked my ticket and            let me in.



Once     inside the stand a r e a              I turned up the         stairs,      now w o r r i e d    to

check that                                       and             were alright.        As   I got        to the

top of the stairs               it was    difficult         to make    progress      because       there were

so m a n y    people     in the aisle.            At the top of the stairs                 I could begin

to see why.            M any    people were       being      pulled    up out of the terrace and

into the front           of the      stand.



I could neither attempt                  to get down to           row 2 nor see the b o y s .             I

d e c i d e d to make my wa y along              the a d j acent      row.    E v e r y b o d y was helpful

and     I was able       to do this with o u t          difficulty.          It must have          been about

row 20.        W hen    I got     some w a y along          it   I looked down to see             if    I could

see     the boys.        First      I saw              then                  then                 I was able

to make my wa y down to them over                      the seats.



When     I reached them I could                  see that        there was a large         number        of

people       on the     pitch,      people       trying      to get     out of the terrace              on to the

p itch a n d     people were         continuing        to    come up in to the s t a n d .              There

s eemed      to be few Saint Johns A m b u l a n c e              people att e n d i n g    the    p e o p l e who

were     lying aro u n d the         pitch and         I could see       people     lying on the          pitch

unattended.            T here was a large          line of Po l i c e Officers across                   the

pitch at       the     centre     circle.         The    tannoy told the supporters who were

on the       pitch to get off            it.



The     pressure was           bad w h e r e we were so          I mad e my way back some               rows

w ith           and                       s tayed where he was            to help      pull    people up

f rom   the t e r r a c e .      W h e n we got further           back we had a        clear view of

what was       h a ppening       on the     pitch;     it seemed       incredible.         The     time must

have    been about 3 . 1 5         pm    (1515 h r s ) .

The    overwhelming           i m p r e s s i o n was    of a large and growing                  number      of

c a sualties and          not m u c h     response.         The suppo r t e r s were             now impatient

and a n g r y at the s l o wness              of the      response        to the emergencies.                   There

a p p e a r e d to be only one or two stre t c h e r s                     on the      pitch and one

a m b u l a n c e was ma k i n g    its w a y ar o u n d from the far                  corner.         The

su p p o r t e r s were    chanting        for a s s i s t a n c e    t o be brought           to the        injured

who were       lying on the           pitch.         The next        thing was         that m a n y of the

s u p p o r t e r s who were on the            pitch began to tear down the a d v e r t i s i n g

boards and organise                thems e l v e s      into s t r etcher         parties.        This       all

h a p p e n e d very quickly.



I heard the ta n n o y appeal                 for doctors        to help.             I could see that             the

s i t u a t i o n was    really bad an d          could      count        six    people who a p p e a r e d        to

be dead near            the goal mouth.              I made    sure        that                  and

were    safe w i t h a n d                that    I knew w here            they were and made m y wa y

out    down the back of the L e p p i n g s Ln S t a n d.



On the stairs a P o l i c e m a n was a t t e n d i n g               s o m e b o d y who was       injured.            The

injuries       did not appear             to be      critical        so    I a s k e d the P o l i c e m a n where

I should       report      to help.           He did not know.                  I went    back     into the stand

and    brought     the boys out an d down the stairs                             to   place them so m e w h e r e

safe and       in sight.           I then tried to find s o m e b o d y in charge to tell me

who    to    report     to.      I asked       several Officers,                 but none of them knew.

T here were       people       lying     ever y w h e r e    in the yard area betw e e n the S tand

an d   the turnstiles.               I a s k e d the officer who was                   in charge and he

ind i c a t e d a senior Officer.                 I approached             this Officer and told him

that    I was a Doctor and a s k e d him who was                           in charge of e m e r g e n c i e s and

where       I should      report.        He    said he did not know and that                        he had just

a r r ived.     By this stage             I realised that             there was          no o r g a n i s e d
                                                                                                                 PAGE          6

        response and         I was angry.           I a s k e d the Officer           for his number            but he

        did not appear           to have one.           I a sked for his           name.      He said he was

        Inspector Grace.              I left him and went             to see what          I could do.
S   t

        All a r o u n d were       people either          dead or unconscious,               or ser i o u s l y h u r t .

        The s u p p o r t e r s were     fantastic.         T hey were all          helping       each other and

        trying     to r e s u s c i t a t e   people.      Individual      Police         officers were also

        doing what       they     could.         At no time did        I see a n y b o d y attack a Police

        Officer,      nor did       I see a n y b o d y who was        drunk.



        I came to the          concl u s i o n that       s o m e b o d y needed    to take an o v e r v i e w of

        the s i t u a t i o n and     began to go         round all      the   casualties           to a p p r a i s e

        them.      T h e r e did not seem to be a n y S aint J ohns A m b u l a n c e w o r k e rs

        a r o u n d at all.        I became a w a r e      that some      casualties were               being     taken

        out    into L e p p i n g s Ln        itself and     I went    out there.            T here was one

        ^jtibulance.       The     time must       have     been about 3 . 3 0 - 3.3 5             pm (1530 - 1535

        hr s ) .



        The Pol ice were           beginning       to     put   people    into the a m b u l a n c e and          I

        realised that a system of                  p r i o r itising     by triage was needed.                   So I    did

        this.      I went a r o u n d an d either            checked     people myself            or a s k e d the

        person who was a t t e n d i n g          them.     There were two or three other hea l t h

        workers     in evidence who were assessing,                      r e s u scitating and doing what

        they    could.       There a p p e a r e d to be no medical                or e m e r g e n c y e q u i p m e n t .



        The dead were          taken to one         side and       I allocated          the other        casualties

        to    category one or           category two.           I told the Police who should be

        despatched        by a m b u l a n c e   next and who       could wait.            The O f f i c e r s were

        m o s t l y very good.         The y t ojak my ins t r u c t i o n s a nd a cted on them

        immediately.           By this time there was a steady flow of a mbulances.                                      it

     mu st have been 3. 4 5 or 3 . 5 0                    (1545 hrs or       1550 hrs).           I became aware              of

     a local        general      p r a c t itioner who had a r r i v e d at t h e scene.                      Over      the

     next     half an hour we w o r k e d together as a team,                            sorting       the    casualties

     an d de s p a t c h i n g   them       in the a mbulances.              An a n a e s t h e t i s t a r r i v e d   from

     s o m ewher e and f i re-eng i nes                 came wit h     r e s u s c i t a t i o n e q u i p m e n t , but all

     of this was            really too          late.        By 4.25    pm (1625 h r s ) it was all                over.

     The    serious         casualties          had gone to hospital              and what        remained were

     people w i t h minor             injuries,           shock and d i s t r e s s and         a line of dead

           pi e .     I went     to       check     that my family was alright and whe n                         I came

        ck a Police Officer a s k e d me to                       certify the deaths.                A general

     p r a c t it ioner      had a l r e a d y started          this at one end of the                 row of

     bodies.           I started at             the other.         I think          the time was 4.27 or 4 .29                     pm

        627 or          1629 hrs) and              I think     I certified        five     or six dead.           O nly one

L,   of w h o m      could be        identified from doc u m e n t s              on his body.



     During         this whole        period        the     public were      fantastic,         a l t h o u g h shocked

     an d angry.            On one o c c a s i o n at the end,              a group of young m e n               came    past

     the dead,         and one of them exp r e s s e d his a nger at                       police who we re

     standing          there.         I told him to            'cool    i t ’,      that     it was not helpful              and

     he stopped.             I saw        no other          episodes    like        this at all, a l t h o u g h there

     was a general            atmosphere            of a nger at what            had been happening.                I

     remember         thinking        how      restrained e v e r y b o d y was.



     It must         have    been about 4.3 0 - 4.3 5                (1630 -       1635 h r s ) .      There      did not

     seem to be a n y t h i n g            else for me to do behind L e p p i n g s Ln.                      I checked

     that                    a   n    d    w   e    r   e     alri g h t w i t h a n d            then made my way

     to the g y m n a s i u m a r o u n d          the side     of the ground to see                if I could be of

     an y help there.                I had become a ware             that    other      casualties         had    been

     taken to the gymnasium.
                                                                                                        PAGE       8
                                                                                                        S 1 132

At   first     I had d i f f i c u l t y    finding      it as    nobody      could give me

directions.             Whe n   I a r r i v e d there    I went     in and found that             it was all

over.      At one end there were               tables       (I think three)            w h i c h must   have

been used for            processing        details      of the    injured.          There were      now no

c a sualties      in this area.            At the near end of the gym were                       rows of

bodies.        On my way         past   I noticed a large disp l a y of                 photographs and

i n f o r m a t i o n on the wall       of the gym showing L i verpool                  supporters who

were    thought         to be    pickpockets,        etc.



1                 gym and        r e t u r n e d round to the L e p p i n g s Ln e nd to            check my

family again.             T hey were alright.              I thought       that      I should go back to

the gym to see            if there      w ould    be a debr i e f i n g      of     people involved        in

the e m e r g e n c y    response,      so all     four of us went           round.       This      time it

was d i fficult          to get     near    the gym because            there was a large            cordon of

Po l i c e ar o u n d    it.     I spoke to an officer and he                     let us thro u g h w h e n he

knew    I was a Doctor and              I left                             and I          safely behind

them and went            to the gym.



This    time    it was very d i fficult              to get      in.      There was tight           control       on

the door.         I exp l a i n e d why      I wan t e d    to go      in and was a l l o w e d to enter.



I a s k e d about a d e b r i e f i n g      but nobody       could h e l p .         Those who      had been

help i n g were         being    cleared     out of the gym.              Just      then a senior       officer

called all        the o f f icers       together at one end of the hall                     for a   police

briefing.         I d o n ’t know       what     it was about.           I left.



O n our way back to L e p p i n g s Ln we e n c o u n t e r e d a Police                   officer who was

in great d i s t r e s s a n d being           comforted by another.                  I put my a r m a r o u n d

him to     comfort        him as well.         He was       sobbing       u n c o n t r o l l a b l y and saying

that    now the         police w o u l d get the blame.                Anot h e r    officer was a n g r y
                                                                                                     PAGE        9
                                                                                                     S 1 1 32

a n d told me that he felt that they had been                          let down by the s e n i or

officers.          He     said that nobody had taken              charge a nd that w hen senior

officers          had come they had been of little                  use a n d just got       in the way.



We   left    the g r o u n d a n d     returned to the         car to drive home.            We must

have    left the ground by about 5 o ’clock                     (1700 h r s ) .



I would       like to say that           I have been f o llowing Liverpool               Football

Cl u b for over 30 years an d that                    I am familiar w i t h the normal           range of

beh a v i o u r    of    club supporters.            Before   the m a t c h on S a t u r d a y the

crowd m o o d was          buoyant an d gen e r a l l y good humoured.              I feel    that since

the Heysel          disas t e r an a t t i t u d e    of m i n d has   been culti v a t e d w h i c h

regards all             football   supports as memb e r s         of a s u b - h u m a n species       to be

contained.              As a result     crowd safety has          taken second       place.      On

Saturday          I believe     that    this belief about           football      supporters

c o n t r i b u t e d to the a p p a r e n t l y slow     initial      response   by the     p;ol i ce to

wha t was         happening.       It seemed that they mist o o k             the trag e d y for         crowd

trouble.



It is dif f i c u l t       to know how many           lives m ight     have been saved        if the

emergency          response     had been more          effective,      but   in m y opinion on this

occasion          it was vyoefully inadequate.

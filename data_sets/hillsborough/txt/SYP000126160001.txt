                   OUTSIDE AT ABOUT 2.40 - OUTSIDE WAS JUST A MASS OF PEOPLE THERE
                   WERE NO QUEUES WHATSOEVER. I AA A REGULAR FOOTBALL SUPPORTER, SO
                   I'M USED TO GREAT CROWDS, BUT THE TURNSTILE WHERE I WAS QUEING
                   WAS BAD, BUT I'VE EXPERIENCED WORSE. WHEN I GOT INTO MY SEAT I
                   DID NOTICE - IT STOOD OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB - THAT THE CENTRE

WERE ACTUALLY HEAVING THEY WERE SO FULL, WHEN THE TWO SIDE SECTIONS WERE
ALMOST EMPTY. LAST YEAR AS WELKL, THE SAME THING HAPPENED WITH IT BEING SO
FULL THAT PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OUT AND BEING PULLED UP INTO THE STANDS. IT
WAS OBVIOUS TO ME THIS TIME THAT THINGS WERE WORSE AND SOMETHING WAS QUITE
WRONG - I DIDN'T KNOW PEOPLE WERE DYING OF COURSE - BUT THEY WERE TRYING TO
GET THE POLICE TO HELP. THE POLICE FORMED INTO A LINE, AND WERE TRYING TO GET
THE FANS TO GO BACK INTO THE SIDE SECTIONS, BUT OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO
G ^ I N T O THE PENS BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO DISTRESSED. EVENTUALLY FANS WERE
ALLOWED TO GO ONTO THE PITCH AND THE MATCH WAS STOPPED. WITH REGARD TO THE
DRUNKENNESS OF THE FANS, THROUGHOUT MY JOURNEY TO THE GROUND I ONLY SAW FOUR
OR FIVE WHO WERE INTOXICATED - THEY WEREN'T AGGRESSIVE, JUST DRUNK - OUT OF
ALL THE THOUSANDS I SAW THERE. I SAW ONE DRUNK THAT THE POLICE WOULDN'T LET
INTO THE GROUND, AND HE WAS WEARING A GLASGOW RANGERS SHIRT - HE HAD A BROAD
ACCENT TOO. WE SET OUT EARLY FOR THE GAME BUT THE TRAFFIC SITUATION WAS SUCH
THAT IT TOOK AS A REALLY LONG TIME TO TRAVEL TO THE GROUND AND THAT MUST HAVE
BEEN A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. THERE WAS A POLICE CHECKPOINT STOPPING LARGE
VEHICLES AT AN ISLAND ON THE WAY INTO HILLSBOROUGH. THERE WAS NO TROUBLE IN
THE WAY OF AGGRESSION THERE, BUT IT DIDN'T HELP WITH THE TRAFFIC SITUATION.

I WAS WITH:

IT THEN REALLY PACKED. I TRIED TO GET OUT. I SAW ONLY 3 POLICE HORSES. I THEN
HEARD A POLICEMAN IN A CAR SHOUTING AT THE FANS TO MOVE BACK. I THINK HE
TRIED 3 TIMES TO MOVE THE FANS BACK BUT THEY WOULDN'T LISTEN. I COULDN'T
UNDERSTAND WHY THE POLICE DIDN'T STOP THE FANS COMING DOWN THE STREET INTO
THE CROWD.
I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH MY HANDICAPPED SON         18YRS SAME ADDRESS.

AS YOU LOOKED A T IT THE RIGHT WAS ALMOST EMPTY.I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND W HY THE
STEWARDS DIDN'T STOP PEOPLE GOING INTO THE MIDDLE. THE STEWARDS BY US COULD
SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING BUT THEY DIDN'T SEEEM TO HAVE A N Y COMMUNICATION, THEY
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. WHEN LIVERPOOL HIT THE BAR THE CROWD SWAYED FORWARD BUT
DIDN'T SEEM TO SWAY BACK.WHEN THEY STARTED CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE ONTO THE
PITCH, ONLY SOME POLICE SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING THE REST OF THE
POLICE JUST STOOD AROUND THEY DIDN'T HELP. THE FANS WERE RIPPING UP THE
bA    d s AND THE POLICE DIDN'T HELP ONLY A FEW WENT TO HELP AFTER. I COULDN'T
UNTJERSTAND
 JNjOTI       W H Y THE POLICE JUST STOOD THERE WH E N PEOPLE WERE DYING THEY JUST
WATCHED.

THE TURNSTILES AND HALF OF MY TICKET WAS TAKEN. ONCE THROUGH I NOTICED THAT
THERE WERE VERY FEW STEWARDS AND POLICE OFFICERS. I EVENTUALLY FOUND MY SEAT
AND COULD SEE THAT THE TWO PENS BEHIND THE GOAL WERE ABSOLUTELY PACKED.
LIVERPOOL NORMALLY HAVE LOADS OF SUPPORT BUT THIS WAS MORE THAN NORMAL. THE
PENS TO EITHER SIDE WERE ONLY HALF FULL AND I WONDERED WHAT WAS HAPPENING
DOWN THERE.     I SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE SIDE FENCING OF THE PENS BEHIND
THE GOAL TO GET OUT AND SAW SOMEBODY BEING PASSED OVER OTHER PEOPLES HEADS TO
GB^OUT. IT WAS ONLY JUST BEFORE THEY STOPPED THE GAME THAT I REALISED
So I e THING WAS BADLY WRONG.I WAS ON COACH WITH 29 OTHER PEOPLE INCLUDING ROY
HAMILTON 34 YEARS ADDRESS UNKNOWN WHO WAS ONE OF THOSE TO GET KILLED.

SEATS AT ABOUT 220PM, I NOTICED STRAIGHT AWAY THE CRUSH THAT WAS GOING ON
BEHIND THE GOAL, THERE WAS PLENTY OF ROOM IN THE OTHER PENS ON EITHER SIDE OF
THESE PENS, PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OUT OF THE PACKED PENS UP ONTO THE BALCONY
AND OVER THE SIDE BARRIERS INTO THE EMPTY PENS      IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THERE
WERE PEOPLE IN DISTRESS IN THIS STAND... THERE WERE POLICE ALL ALONG THE

WERE NO STEWARDS ABOUT AT ALL.. ALL THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF PEOPLE
H^fc BEEN DIRECTED INTO THE EMPTIER PENS....AFTER THE GAME HAD STARTED I SAW
PEOPLE BEING DRAGGED OUT OF THE STAND, I SAW A MAN BEING GIVEN HEART MASSAGE
BY A FAN AND A GIRL BUT THERE WAS A GROUP OF FIVE POLICE A FEW YARDS AWAY
DOING NOTHING...... I KNEW SOME PEOPLE WERE DEAD AS THERE FACES WERE
COVERED..... ALOT OF POLICE WERE HELPING BUT THE VAST MAJORITY WERE DOING
NOTHING.....THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ALL THE POLICE TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE PITCH NOR FOR THEM TO BRING ON DOGS

C O N T ..THIS SEEMED TO GET MORE SEVERE UNTIL FANS WERE CLIMBING THE BARRIERS TO
GET OUT.I KNEW THEN SOMETHING SERIOUS WAS H A P P E N I N G .AFTER THE DISASTER
STARTED TO UNFOLD POLICEMEN WERE BROUGHT ON TO THE PITCH TO FORM TWO LINES TO
PREVENT THE PITCH FROM BEING INVADED.THIS CLEARLY INDICATED THAT THE POLICE
SUPERVISORS HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING O N .THEY THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS CROWD
TROUBLE.THE LIVERPOOL FANS WERE TEARING DOWN HOARDINGS AND USING THEM AS
STRETCHERS TO ASSIST THE INJURED AND DYING.THE POLICE JUST STOOD AND WATCHED
IT ALL H A P P E N I N G .THERE WAS ONLY ONE TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT TELLING THE FANS TO
GET OFF THE PITCH.THERE WAS A COMPLETE LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND YET THERE IS
VIMjLO AND TELE. EQUIPMENT IN THE GROUND WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR THIS
V E W PURPOSE.I DID SEE POLICEMEN OUTSIDE THE GROUND THOUGH IT WAS MOSTLY LOW
KEY.I DID NIT SEE A SINGLE STEWARD TO TELL PEOPLE WHERE TO GO.I DID NOT SEE
MANY POLICE INSIDE THE GROUND.
I WENT TO THE MATCH W               I     T      H     ,M E R S E Y S I D E .I DO NOT KNOW THE
EXACT ADDRESS.I WILL TELL HIM TO CONTACT INCIDENT ROOM BEFORE IT CLOSES.

HELPING. MY BIGGEST CRITICSM IS THAT THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATIONS WITH PEOPLE
WHO WERE TRYING TO FIND PEOPLE WHO THEY MAY HAVE BEEN WITH. I THINK THAT AN

                   MATCHES AND IT WAS LOWEST LEVEL OF POLICING I HAVE WITNESSED AT A
                   MATCH OF THIS SIZE.

I WENT WITH ■I OTHER PEOPLE:
1.                ,I, HE WORKS WITH ME
2   .
3.
4.1       SOMEONE, I THINK A WORK COLLEAGUE OF
I CAN FIND OUT THESE PEOPLE'S ADDRESSES.
WE GOT THERE AT ABOUT 2.30, THERE WAS A CRUSH OUTSIDE THE LEPPINGS LANE END
BY THE TURNSTILES, IT WAS LIKE A FUNNEL AND I REMEMBER THINKING THAT IT WAS
BAD AT THE TIME. ONCE IN THIS 'FUNNEL' PEOPLE COULDN'T GET OUT. AT THE TIME
IJHENT THROUGH THERE WERE PEOPLE CRYING OUT TO HAVE THE BIG GATE OPENED, AND
I^pSLT THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD THE GATE OPENED. I THOUGHT AT THE TIME THAT
SOMEBODY WAS GOING TO GET HURT.
I WAS ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE CHILDREN OUTSIDE THE
GROUND, MY MAIN CONCERN HAD TO BE THE LACK OF POLICING OUTSIDE THE GROUND, AS
WITHOUT ADEQUATE POLICING THERE WERE NO QUEUES, JUST A CRUSH. ALSO THERE WAS
NO DIRECTION, PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO.
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WHEN THE TROUBLE INSIDE ERUPTED THERE SEEMED TO BE A
LOT OF POLICE, AND NO-ONE DOING ANYTHING, AND THEN THEY BROUGHT THE DOGS ONTO
THE PITCH WHILE THE BODIES WERE BEING BROUGHT OFF.

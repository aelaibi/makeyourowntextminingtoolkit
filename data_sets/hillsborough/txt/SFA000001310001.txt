1.       Mi nutes
         The Committee accepted the minutes of t h e i r meeting held on the 6th July
         1989, su bject to the amendment of the reference in Minute 2 (F) from
         General, Municipal and Boilermakers Union to Transport and General
         Workers Union.
2.       Items to be considered by the F ire and Civil Defence Authority

         The Committee considered the items t h a t were fo r consideration a t the
         meeting of the Fire and Civil Defence Authority on 18th August 1989 and
     ,   p a r tic u la r reference was made to the following;
         (a)    Hillsborough: Extracts from Interim Report. A member of the
                Committee refe rred to statements t h a t other a u th o r itie s
                besides the South Yorkshire Police had been blamed fo r the events
                on the day of the Hillsborough D isaster, and South Yorkshire County
                Fire Service had been referred to .

                The Chief Fire Officer was not aware of the statement. There was
                no d i r e c t c ritic is m of the Fire Service in the Interim Report.

         (b)    Conditions of Service - Full Time T i r e Service Personnel -
                Secondary Employment. The Fire Brigades Union mentioned t h a t the
                Chief Fire O fficer was not approving applications for secondary
                employment a t the present time. Their view was t h a t the s ta tu s quo
                should apply i . e . t h a t whatever p ractice was being employed should
                continue.
                The Chief F ire Officer had replied to the F.B.U. s ta tin g his view
                t h a t the s ta tu s quo was being applied. The whole matter was under
                reconsideration by the Authority and he f e l t i t would be wrong of
                him to go on granting ap plications for secondary employment w hilst
                t h a t remained the p o sitio n . The Chief F ire O fficer, and the Clerk
                and Financial O fficer, f e l t t h a t to have done otherwise would have
                pre-empted whatever decision the Authority might eventually make.
         The position of the F ire Brigades Union was t h a t they opposed
         secondary employment. The A uthority's represen tativ es agreed t h a t
         they would p re fe r t h a t members of South Yorkshire County Fire
         Service did not engage in outside employment but the Committee had
         before them a j o i n t re p o rt of the Chief F ire O fficer and the Clerk
         and Financial O fficer, including an opinion of Counsel, which s p e l t
         out the d i f f i c u l t i e s involved in imposing a blanket ban on such
         employment.

         The Committee discussed in detail what options might be open to the
         Authority. The Fire Brigades Union f e l t t h a t i f a blanket ban
         was not p ossible, perhaps a more controlled p rac tic e could be
         adopted than previously.
         In conclusion i t was agreed t h a t the Chief F ire Officer would make
         enquiries of other brigades said to have imposed bans on secondary
         employment; the Chairman f e l t t h a t the Authority may want to call
         for a comprehensive rep o rt sp ellin g out the options which might
         be av ailab le to the Authority; and including the suggestions which
         had been made during the meeting by the Fire Brigades Union.

         The APEX rep resentativ e refe rred to the A uthority's employment of
         part-time f i r e f i g h t e r s . The Chairman's view was t h a t he would much
         p re fe r fu ll-tim e f i r e f i g h t e r s but only the government could make
         av ailab le the sums of money involved.

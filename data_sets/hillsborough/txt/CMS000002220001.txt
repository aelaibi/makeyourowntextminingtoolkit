HILLSBOROUGH PUBLIC INQUIRY - COSTS


Paragraph 5 of my note of 6 February mentioned the HMSO costs
associated with publication of the Interim and Final Reports.
HMSO have confirmed that no figure is given (even in answer to
PQs)  for the total production costs incurred since such
information is treated as Commercial in Confidence. Work is put
out to competitive tender and contract rates are not revealed.

2.   Accordingly, in assessing Inquiry costs we need incorporate
only the cost of copies supplied direct to the Inquiry and Home
Office.    This has been confirmed as being £6,266.11 for the
Interim Report and £10,886.00 for the Final Report, a total of
£17,152 .11 .

3.   Figures for the total Inquiry cost will need adjustment to
reflect this.

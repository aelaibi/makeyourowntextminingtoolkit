I,   DR WILFRED EASTWOOD,        Ph.D.,   F. Eng. , F. I.C. E. , F. I. Struct. E

Of                          Sheffield,                 will say as follows: -




INTRODUCTION



1.    I am 65 years old.          I am Chairman of Eastwood & Partners

(Consulting Engineers) which I founded in 1972.                    The firm has

offices in Sheffield and London.            I taught at the University of

Sheffield from 1954-1970 as a Senior Lecturer and then became

Professor and Head of the Department of Civil and Structural

Engineering.        I worked as Managing Partner for Husband & Co,

Consulting Engineers,       from 1970 to 1972.         I am a past President

of   the   Chartered Institution of Structural            Engineers,      a past

Chairman of the Council of Engineering Institutions,                   and past

Chairman    of    the   Commonwealth      Engineers'    Council.      I   am    an

Honorary Doctor of Engineering in the University of Sheffield.

 Eastwood & Partners is an unlimited Company which has                     about

ninety     technical    staff,    including     seven    Directors     and     six

Associates with a total staff of just over 100.

                                                  Associate in the Firm.



3.      This statement is intended to be read in conjunction with

a    bundle      of   copy       documents        extracted          from the         Firm's       files

which       accompanies          this       statement.               When    referring          to     an

individual        document,           I shall      add the relevant page number in

the bundle.



4.      I    have      been      involved         with      football         stadia         including

Hillsborough            for          many    years.           My       first          contact        with

Hillsborough          was       in    the   late     1950's whilst               I    was   a   Senior

Lecturer      at      Sheffield         University.           I      advised         them on minor

matters.         My major involvement with football stadia came when I

joined      Husband         &   Co     as   Managing        Partner.             That       firm     were

Consulting         Engineers           to   the      Club,        Sheffield           United       F. C. ,

Southampton F. C. , Nottingham Forest F. C., Swindon Town F. C. and
Rotherham United F.C.               Whilst at Husband & Co I took particular

responsibility          for   their     work     at    these      grounds       and    I     was

involved in the construction of new stands at both Nottingham

Forest F. C. and Swindon Town F. C.               During this period there was

the disaster at Ibrox Park.               In the aftermath of this disaster,

I was involved in liaison with the Police concerning capacity

of    football    stadia.           Handrails    and    crush barriers            were       the

subject     of   much    discussion and I designed equipment                          to test

crush barriers which was used at the stadia of the six football

clubs mentioned above.



5.      It must be remembered that all this took place before the

1975 Act and the          1976 Guide.           Both the       1975 Act and the 1976

Guide were a product of the "Wheatley Commission" of 1972 which

was   set up to examine the safety of sports grounds                             following

the Ibrox disaster.            Sir Walter Winterbottom,                former Manager of

the England Football            Team,    chaired a working party to advise

the Wheatley Commission.                That working party spent a day with

me discussing safety at football stadia.



6.      Eastwood & Partners            are retained as Consulting Engineers

to    the     Club,      Sheffield        United        F. C. ,     Sunderland             F. C. ,

Chesterfield      F. C. , and        Rotherham United          F. C.      The    firm also

does occasional work for Hull Rugby League F.C., the Sheffield

Sports      Stadium which       has     Greyhound      Racing,         Rugby    League       and

until    this    season       had    Speedway    and    also      the    County       Cricket

Ground at Scarborough.
7.       I am        a very interested             football      supporter and have           two

seats in the south stand at Hillsborough very close to the West

Terrace.              I    attend        matches       frequently,       usually       with    my

grandson, who is now aged 12.                         He has been attending matches at

Hillsborough with either me or his father since he was aged 8

and     I     have    never       had occasion to             feel    that we were      in the

slightest        physical          danger,       or    that    the    Police    were    in    any

difficulty.               The most recent fairly large crowd prior to the

F. A.    Cup Semi-Final on                15th April       1989 was the match between

the Club and Liverpool on 14th January 1989.                                I attended the

match that day and the Liverpool fans were in the West Terrace.

I pass the Leppings Lane end turnstiles every time I enter the

ground.



DETAINEE-QF BASTWOOtt ft PARTNERS
8.      The     firm      was     first       retained    by    the    Club as    Consulting

Engineers        in       1978.         The    only    formal    letters    regarding         that

retainer are those to my firm from the Club dated 25th October

1978 and 1st December 1978                       (pages 4 and 7).         The firm were to

act      on    behalf       of    the     Club    in their dealings            with    the    SYCC

and/or the Sheffield Metropolitan District Council Hillsborough

in respect of the structural aspects                            of the ground following

its designation under the 1975 Act.



9.       I have been Director in charge of all work done on behalf

of      the    Club.        During our continuous                retainer since        December

1978        I have been ably assisted by Mr Strange of the firm.                                He

was     a Senior Engineer,                and has been an Associate of the firm
since        about     1982.          He    has     been   a     regular      attender     at

Hillsborough since he was a boy.



10.     Pages       1/2 in the bundle are a list of all the jobs which

my firm has done for the club since December 1978 (page 3 lists

those particular jobs which may be relevant for the purpose of

the    Inquiry       and     from the       files    relating to which          have     been

abstracted the documents of which copies appear in the attached

bundle).         The jobs did not only involve work required under the

1975 Act,          but also general up-grading and modernisation of the

ground.          Almost      every    year    there    has      been   some    significant

improvement of the ground.



11.     In liaising with the Club I have found that they have been

very willing to spend money to improve the ground and I have

found       that     the    Club's    Board of Directors             in particular have

been very easy to work with.                   Mr. H. McGee has been Chairman of

the Club throughout this time, and he has taken a keen interest

in safety matters including attending some of the meetings with

the Working Party              (which I shall describe in paragraph 16 of

this    Statement).            I have had frequent personal                   contact with

him.         He has        always    stressed the need for the ground to be

safe and has been a driving force in getting work done.



12.     Of    the     Directors,       Mr     Whitehead        was   the   Director      with

special responsibility for the ground at the time of the early

meetings.           He played an active part until he ceased to be a

Director in approximately 1983.                     He was succeeded by Mr K Addy

and    Mr    E     Baron.      They    have       a particular       responsibility       for
ground matters as Directors.                  I have had frequent meetings with

them on major matters and have found their attitude to be very

co-operative at all times.



13.   There have been three Club Secretaries since the firm was

first retained by the Club in 1978.                    The first was               Mr E

England.      He was a highly experienced man and was much involved

in the works at the ground.                He was succeeded by                    Mr R H

Chester      who     was    also    an   experienced    Club     Secretary        having

previously been Secretary at Sheffield United F.C.                       and Lincoln

City F. C. .       The present Secretary is Mr G Mackrell.                        I have

always found it very easy to work with him.



THE— 1375 ACT* THE 1976 and 1.98.6 .CPIPfig.AHP.THE "WORKING PARTY”.
14.   It may assist the Inquiry if I make some comments about

the relevant details of the 1975 Act and the 1976 Guide.                            Both

the   1975     Act    and    the    1976       Guide came    about     following the

"Wheatley      Report"       into    the       Ibrox disaster.         The     1975 Act

contains     no    technical       details.      These were      all    to   be    found

originally in the 1976 Guide.                 The current edition of the Guide

was   published in         1986.     However,     for most of the time I was

working under the 1976 Guide (not I believe 1973 as referred to

in error in the preface to the 1986 Guide).



15.   Section 1 of the             1975 Act permits the Secretary of State

to designate as a stadium requiring a Certificate,                       referred to

in the Act as a "Safety Certificate",                  any Sports Stadium which

in    his     opinion       has     accommodation      for     more     than      10,000

spectators.        As indicated the original retainer of the firm by
the Club in         1978    followed the designation of Hillsborough as

such    a   stadium.         Section       2   of     the    1975    Act    sets       out    the

required contents of Safety Certificates.                          An application for a

Safety Certificate is made to a Local Authority (as defined in

the 1975 Act) and is governed by Section 3, which also requires

that copies of the application be sent to the Chief Officer of

Police      and the      Building Authority            for the area in which the

stadium      is    situated.        These      bodies       are    consulted          about   the

terms and conditions to be included in the Safety Certificate.



16.     A Working Party was set up in Sheffield to deal with such

applications which involved representatives of the Police, Fire

Service,     Building Surveyors             Division and the Legal Department

of the Local Authority.              The relevant Local Authority was SYCC

until    1986 when the SCC took over. Representatives of the Club

would also attend some meetings of the Working Party when the

Safety Certificate concerning Hillsborough was discussed.



17.     The Guide is a voluntary code and has no legal force (see

paragraph         1. 1 1976 Guide and paragraph                  1 of the 1986 Guide).

Neither of the Guides is rigid,                     and they both contemplate that

deviation         from     their    recommendations              will     not     necessarily

detract      from    the     overall       safety      of    a    ground.         A    flexible

approach      is     encouraged       in       order    to       take     account       of    the

particular circumstances             at individual grounds.                     The relevant

criterion when assessing the adequacy of safety for spectators

in new work or re-construction is that of a reasonable degree

of     safety.           Both      Guides       use    the        words     "it       would    be

unreasonable,        even if it were practicable, to seek the absolute
safety of everyone attending a ground"                         (see paragraphs 1. 4 and

1. 5 of the 1976 Guide and Paragraph 8 of the 1986 Guide).                                   The

1986 Guide goes on to state in paragraph 6 that "the Guide does

not    attempt     to    set     a    minimum       standard"     for        any    particular

ground.          Rather,       it      attempts          "to   take     account        of    the

constraints and difficulties with are present within" existing

sports grounds (see paragraph 7                     1986 Guide).



18.    I shall deal later in this statement with the provisions

in     the   Guides      regarding        such          matters   as     crush       barriers,

perimeter       and     radial       fences.        However,      I    set    out     here   the

relevant paragraphs in both the 1976 and 1986 Guides: -

19.     There are no material differences between the 1976 and the

1986      Guides with regard to their comments on terraced steps

and     crush     barriers.             Other       sections      have        been     extended

                                           -    8   -
following       the    Bradford        fire       and    to    take    account     of    their

application to sports grounds other than football grounds.                                 The

section     regarding         radial      fences        has    been    extended     so   that

paragraph       103   now states        that such fences               "should be of the

strength of the crush barriers".                    Paragraphs 7.9.1 and 7.9.2 in

the 1976 Guide regarding perimeter fences have been replaced by

new     paragraphs      214    and     215    in    the       1986      Guide.     Finally/

additions       have    been       made      in    the        1986      Guide    concerning

estimation       of    safe     ground        capacity.              However,    the     basic

formulae remain the same.                 The 1986        Guide contains examples of

use of the formulae whereas the 1976                          Guide did not.



CRASH--BABBIBfia
20.     When the firm was first retained by the Club in 1978 there

were barriers         at the     Leppings Lane end                    oftheground but they

were     fewer in number than recommended by                          the    1976 Guide.     I

cannot speak from my own knowledge,                           but I believe that these

barriers had been installed in 1965 at the time when the West

Stand was constructed            just prior to the use of Hillsborough for

Group     Matches      in   the 1966 World Cup,                or     at an even earlier

date.



21.     I refer to my firm's plan No.                     1610/64E.           This is dated

January     1980,     but has been updated over the years to reflect

changes.          The original barriers which were in place in 1978

are marked       in red on the plan.                      They were insufficient in

number     to   comply      with     the     recommendations            as   to spacing     of

barriers in paragraph 7. 7. 2 of the 1976 Guide.
22.     Such spacing recommendations are contained in paragraph 12

of    the    1976     Guide.            They       are   dependent   upon    a   number   of

factors:              the gradient of the terrace;                    the area of the

ground       in   which     they    are       situated      ("peak viewing       areas"   or

''other viewing areas");                  and the strength of the barriers.



23.     Under paragraph 12. 2 of the 1976 Guide peak viewing areas

are described as the most popular parts of the terraces such as

behind the goal areas.                  The central pens at the Leppings Lane

end of Hillsborough fall within such category.



24.     As will be seen from the tables under paragraph 12 of the

1976 Guide,         (and Table 1 at page 38 of the 1986 Guide) barriers

may either be Class A or Class B as defined in the tables under

paragraph 13. 2 of the Guide.                      Class A barriers must be designed

safely       to   resist        a force       of    5. OkN/metre width      (3401bs   /foot

width).           Such    barriers        must be capable of resisting a test

load of 6. 0 kN/metre width                    (4001bs     /foot width) in accordance

with Appendix C of the Guide.                        The equivalent design and test

loads    for Class B barriers are respectively 3. 4kN/metre width

(2301bs       /foot      width)         and    4. 3kN/metre     width       (2901bs   /foot

width).       It is to be noted that the test loads are overloads,

being       approximately         20%    and       27%   greater than the        respective

design loads.



25.     When the then Secretary of the Club, Mr. England, wrote to

my    firm on 2 5th October               1978      (page 4) he sent a copy of the

guidance notes issued by the then Licensing Authority under the

1975 Act,         S. Y. C. C.    (pages 5-6).             Paragraph 5 of those notes
refers to the need to test crush barriers by an approved method

and in the presence of appropriate officers                          of the Licensing

Authority.



26.    In the     first instance my firm considered the number and

spacing of the          existing barriers             in regard to which           (and of

course other matters) we reported to the Club on 12th January

1979    (pages    10-22).          I refer in particular to sub-paragraph

(b) under the heading "Standing Accommodation"                           (pages 14-15).

We were then uncertain of the strength of the original barriers

and in particular whether they were Class A.                            We did, however,

recommend        the    installation          of     extra    barriers     to   permit      a

capacity of 7,200 persons               on the West Terrace               (including the

lower    level     at    the     North-West         corner)     which,    it    should     be

remembered,       in    1978   was     not sub-divided into pens                by radial

fences    (with the history of which I shall deal later in this

Statement).             Our calculations of capacity,                   in the light of

our    recommendations         for     extra        barriers,     was    carried    out    in

accordance with the relevant formula in paragraph 15.4 of the

1976    Guide.           In our report to the Club we summarised our

recommendations (page 21-22) The second recommendation involved

making    firm     proposals       to    the        relevant      authorities      for    the

installation of new crush barriers together with computation of

capacity.         The details of our calculations are recorded in a

document dated January 1979 (page 23).



27.     Our scheme for new barriers was prepared on the basis that

they     would     be    Class     A    and        that   where    necessary       existing

barriers would also be brought up to Class A.                            The spacing was
designed           by     reference           to the table in p a r a g r a p h                   12 of the          1976

Guide,       t a k i n g a c c o u n t of the gradient of                           x f ' .




28.     Wit h       the        approval            of     the      Club        we     submitted          our       formal

rep o r t    to     the       Police,         Fire        Service and the                 L i c ensing Au t h o r i t y

on     17th    January             1979       (pages        24-32).                   The       relevant       section

dealing        with        the     Wes t      Terrace         is      to   be       found      at pages        27-28.

With     the       report          we     sub m i t t e d    ou r      drawing          No.      1610/2X       showing

2 9.     The       working          party          met     on     2nd      April        1979      and    the    Minutes

(pages        33-37)          record          under        Sect i o n      B    in      respect         of   the     West

T e r r a c e tha t th e p r o posals were a c c e p t e d w i t h re g a r d to the new

barriers.                     On    8th       June        1979     S. Y. C. C.         forwarded         a    Schedule

the     working           party         and      which      S. Y. C. C.         felt          required       attention

(pages        43-49).                   Par a g r a p h     E2     records           the       agreement        by    the

Police        of    a     capacity            of   7, 200        persons         in     resp e c t      of   the     West

T e r r a c e p r o v i d e d t h a t the additional                       barriers            were installed.



30.     Th e w o r k i n the                la t t e r respect was                  put       in hand.         The new

of     the     existing             barriers)               and       we       supervised            the      work      of

installation.



31.     D u r i n g t h e events in q u e s t i o n o n                         the       afternoon           of     15th

April       1989        two   spans         of     a total         length        of       about    4.3       metres    of
barrier        No.     124A          on    plan    1610/64E             collapsed             under         the    crowd

pressure.              The      horizontal             rails       of    part          of    barriers         128       and

in    197 8,    w h e n the       fir m was        appointed.                Non e of the new barriers

designed         by     the       fir m      either         failed           or    suffered             significant

p e r m a n e n t deformation.



32.     Work          on        construction                   of        the           new        barriers              and

maintenance/strengthening                         of    the     origi n a l         b a r riers        was        carried

out b e t w e e n J u n e an d N o v e m b e r 1979.                      All the e x i s t i n g barriers

were    tested        p r i o r to the s t r e n g t h e n i n g w o r k i n o r d e r to define

which       needed      improving.                All the       i m p r o v e d barriers                and the          new

barriers         were      tested          after       c o m p l e t i o n of       the      works.          The        firm

carried        ou t    t ests         in    accordance             with       Appendix            C    of    the        197 6

Guide.



3 3.     In      order          to        carry    out      the         tests          we    designed             and     had

constructed           at o u r o w n e x p e n s e a t e s t i n g "rig".                             A photograph

of    the      rig    will       be       found    at pag e 5 ^ 0 ,               Our       rig   inc o r p o r a t e s    a

s y s t e m of    pin joints               to en s u r e t h a t        the i m p o s e d loa d is                 sp r e a d

reasonably            uniformally              along        the     barrier              rail.                This        is

i m p o r t a n t b e c a u s e w i t h o u t s u c h a s y s t e m the mi d d l e of the rail,

under       load,       will          deflect          (move       away)          horizontally               with        the

result      that      the       m a j o r l o a d is t h e n t a k e n up by the p a r t of the

rai l    closest        to      the        stanchions         where          of    course         the    a b i l i t y of

the      barrier           to        resist        pressure             is        at        its       greatest.

Misleading            results             would    then       be    obtained,                which      is    not        the

c a s e w i t h o u r rig.
34.     During the course of testing we had been liaising with the

Building Surveyors Department of SCC, as the appropriate member

of    the    working         party   (see      for    example   our    letter   of   19th

December 1979 - page 59).



35.     On 28th January 1980 my firm prepared a final report with

regard to testing              (pages       60-63).     Under paragraph      (b) of the

section       headed        "Crush   Barriers"        - page    61)   we describe     the

result of tests              carried out to the existing barriers and the

works    of repair/maintenance which had been implemented.                             We

also    record        that    all the strengthened barriers               had been re­

tested satisfactorily as also had been the new barriers.                               We

did    not    re-test        those barriers           which had already passed the

initial tests.                In this context I refer to the test as being

that applicable to Class A barriers.



36.     S. Y. C. C.    indicated that they wished to have l/5th of the

total       number     of    crush   barriers         throughout    the   ground tested

each year so that each individual barrier should be tested once

every 5 years.                On 15th July 1980 my firm wrote to S. Y. C. C.

(pages       64-65)    to indicate           that it would be easier to test a

block of barriers constituting l/5th of the total number at the

ground rather than to do so on a more random basis.                              We had

previously discussed this                   proposal     with Mr.     Sheriff of SCC's

Building Surveyors             Department        (a member of the working party)

and he agreed.                S. Y. C. C.    agreed;      see their letter of        18th

July 1980 (page 66).
37.    Within the relevant 5 year cycle,          indeed after          3 years,

the barriers in the West Terrace were tested again in 1983.                    I

refer to the firm's report dated 29th June 1983 to Mr.                   Sheriff

(pages 95-96).



38.    I should explain at this point that with the installation

of new barriers     in all terraces within the ground,                  the firm

carried out a process       of re-numbering of barriers             in January

1980   as   recorded on our drawing No.         1610/64E.         All    reports

thereafter,    including that of 29th June 1983 refer to the new

numbering.       I would also mention that the firm no longer has

copies of the detailed Record Sheets in respect of the testing

of the individual barriers in 1983.             It will be seen, however,

from the last paragraph of our letter of 29th June 1983 to Mr.

Sheriff that these were sent to him at the time.



39.    Again in accordance with the 5 year cycle, the barriers in

the West Terrace were tested in 1988.                 As part of the firm's

own checking procedure,          it so happens that just beforehand we

arranged     for an independent Company,         Sheffield Testing Works

Limited, to check the calibration of our rig.



40.    The calibration was        carried out on       8th July     1988.     The

Certificate     dated    15th     July   1988   and    the   record      of   the

calibration tests are to be found at pages               195-197.        It will

be seen that the        gauges    were shown to be working correctly.

The rig was then used to test the barriers on all terraces at

the west end of the ground.              The individual test records are

at pages     198-205.       We reported to the Club,          on 2nd August
1988    (pages        206-208).                    All    barriers      in the        central       pens

including that which failed and those which deformed slightly

on    15th April           1989,       met      the     requirements         of    the    1986    Guide

(which as I have indicated remain unaltered from those of the

1976 Guide).

(a) Perimeter Fences

41.     The    perimeter             fences      were     already      in position when               the

firm was       first instructed in 1978.                          I am not sure when they

were     erected,          but       it      was      probably        soon    after        the    Ibrox

disaster.            The    fences        are at the east              and west ends             of the

ground only.               There      are no perimeter fences in front of the

north    or     south       stand,         which         have   relatively          low    reinforced

concrete walls.



42.     By the provisions                 of paragraph 7. 9. 3 of the                     1976 Guide,

because       spectators             could      lean      on    the    perimeter          fences,      we

deemed        them    to        be    crush        barriers      and    so        they    had    to    be

strengthened.              The perimeter                fence at the         front of the west

terrace was          a vertical wire mesh fence about 2.7 metres high.

It was    strengthened in                  1979 both by the provision of bracing

against the existing perimeter concrete wall and the anchoring

of the wall itself with inclined steel stays fixed to concrete

block foundations.                   This work was required and approved by the

working       party        as    set      out      in    the    list   of     matters       requiring

attention prepared in June                         1979 by S. Y. C. C.            at paragraph G. 1

(page 45).
4 3.    At         some        later     date     the        Club   arranged        for     cranked

extensions          to be        fitted onto the top of the perimeter fence

leaning towards                the     spectators       at    an angle    of     45*      with   the

steel mesh cut so as to leave spikes sticking out of the top.

The firm was not asked to advise on this change and we were not

involved in its design or installation.                              I believe that it was

installed           at    the        request    of      the     Police,    but      I     have    no

documentary evidence of this.



(b) Radial Fences

44.     By the early 1980's it was becoming a common practice to

try to separate visiting supporters and home supporters.                                         The

Club were keen for such a separation and I believe that such

view was shared fully by the Police.                                I wrote to S. Y. C. C. on

2nd September             1981       (pages 69-70) to say that I had been asked

by     the    Club        to    arrange     for      the     installation      of    two    radial

fences in the west terrace.                       These two fences are marked 1 and

2 on plan 8945/1A.                    The relevant provisions in the 1976 Guide

are found at paragraph 7. 6.



45.     There were advantages perceived by the Club in installing

radial        fences.          It    meant that they could have both home and

visiting supporters in the west terrace but that they could be

segregated.              It would also assist the Police in crowd control.

As indicated in my letter to S. Y. C. C. dated 2nd September 1981

(page        69)    gates       were    proposed      at the        rear of each          fence to

allow        access        for       policing     during       matches    as     well       as   for

maintenance.               I pointed out in the letter that the gates would

be left open,             but fastened back, to connect the areas during a
game if adjacent areas were to be occupied by supporters of the

same team.            Approval     for the installation of the two radial

fences was given by S. Y. C. C. in their letter of 14th September

1981 (pages 76-77).               The approval was subject to the condition

(paragraph 1. c. at page 76) that the gates at the rear of the

fences should be under Police control.



46.     The    installation        work       was     carried       out   by     a    firm    of

Contractors,          Blessvale,        in    October       and    November      1981.        In

places the crush barriers passed through the radial fences and

there was discussion between Mr Strange and Mr England about

this,    as recorded in the memorandum of 4th November 1981 (page

79).      There       was    further     discussion          between      them   about       the

relevant barriers on 13th November 1981 (page 81).                               The Police

wanted those          barriers     which passed through the radial                       fences

removed because             otherwise spectators             might use them to climb

over     the    radial       fences.         Neither       the    Club,   nor    Mr   Strange

wished the barriers to be removed because to do so might have

affected safety.             If the relevant barriers had been removed, an

uninterrupted          “channel"        would       have    been     created     along       the

radial fence from the top of the terrace down to the perimeter

fence.        Also,    spectators tend to congregate at the top of the

west terrace rather than at the bottom by the perimeter fence

because their view will not be obscured by the small mesh of

the     perimeter.           It   was    agreed      in     the    discussions        on     13th

November       1981 that the barriers would remain in position for

the next match to see what happened.
47.     The next discussion between Mr Strange and Mr England took

place following the match on 17th November 1981 (page 82).                                       The

Chief       Constable        had     seen    the    barriers         in    position       and    was

content       that     they        should    remain        because        there   had     been    no

problems      at     the     match.         It was,        therefore,        agreed      that    the

barriers      would        remain in position passing through the radial

fences as they are today.



48.     I    wrote      to    S. Y. C. C.     on    14th     December        1981       (page    83)

updating       them     on progress           regarding the           installation of            the

radial       fences     and security gates.                  S. Y. C. C.     replied on 20th

January 1982           (pages 84-85).            That letter recorded doubts still

being voiced by the Police concerning the crush barriers which

passed       through         the     radial      fences.         I    therefore          wrote    to

S. Y. C. C. on 26th January 1982 (pages 86-88) with my views as to

why I felt that the relevant barriers should not be terminated

short of the radial fence.                    I pointed out the aspects of safety

and segregation which were involved and felt that what had been

done        was    a    "reasonable              compromise          between       the     various

interests".            These matters were discussed at a meeting of the

working party held on 4th February 1982 (pages 89-91).                                      It was

agreed at that meeting that it was                           preferable           from a safety

point of view to retain the crush barriers which passed through

the radial fences.



49.     The installation of two further radial fences in the west

terrace       were      considered          in     1985.      These        were    part    of    the

reorganisation of the west terrace which I shall refer to in
more detail             later in my statement.                    For the moment,           I shall

concentrate on the radial fences.



50.     I wrote to the Club on 2nd April 1985 enclosing the firm's

drawing No 6705/2 which provided for one further radial fence

adjacent        to       one    of    the      existing       radial    fences       to   create    an

obvious        corridor          of    11no mans'        land"     (pages      107-108).        (This

further        fence       is     numbered        3 on     drawing       No.    8945/1A).          The

drawing was forwarded to S. Y. C. C. on 9th April 1985 (pages 109-

110)        with     a     request         that    the     working       party       consider      the

proposals          at      an    early         date.      A      copy    of    the    drawing      was

forwarded by the Club to the                           Police. The Police response was to

suggest        a central             fence to           divide the middle section            of the

west terrace,              rather than to create the 11no mans land".                             This

is recorded in my letter tothe Club of                                 19th April 1985        (pages

113-115).            There were            various discussions             between Mr Strange

and     Mr     Chester          concerning        the    location       of     a further     radial

fence as recorded in the memoranda of 20th April 1985 and 25th

April 1985 (pages                 116-117).



51.     S. Y. C. C.        provided their comments                 in their letter of 2nd

May     1985       (pages       123-125).         The Police suggestion of a radial

fence to separate the central area of the terrace was accepted,

but     a    different           location         for    the      fourth      radial      fence    was

suggested.               There       was    further      correspondence          and discussion

concerning           the       location        of these       fences     during May and June

1985.        On 13th June 1985 I met Chief Superintendent Moseley and

Councillor           Smith       (who      I    believe    was     deputy      chairman      of    the

Police Committee at that time)                           to discuss         the further radial
fences.        The outcome of this meeting was recorded in my letter

of     17th    June       1985     to    the    Club     (pages     138-139).               Chief

Superintendent            Moseley, was         favourably     disposed           towards      the

creation of a "corridor" of "no mans'                      land" with a gate to the

pitch,      following the experience of his officers at the recent

match between the Club and Liverpool F. C.                          The corridor would

provide       an easy access            for the Police to the pens                    on either

side, via the gates at the rear of the radial fences.                                      I wrote

to    the     Police on         25th June      1985    about these proposals                 (page

142).         Mr   Strange       then    received      a telephone         call        from    the

Police on 27th June 1985 (page 144) in which there was further

discussion         about     the    radial      fences     necessary       to     create       the

corridor "no mans'              land" and also a central radial fence in the

west     terrace.           I    added a       manuscript     note        to    Mr Strange's

memorandum of the telephone call agreeing that a central fence

should be installed for the time being,                        provided that it did

not     make       the    packing       of     spectators     in    the         west       terrace

"impossible".



52.     Application         for    planning         consent   was    made        by    a    letter

dated       5th July      1985     (pages      145-148).      Detailed drawings were

submitted to S. Y. C. C.            on 25th July 1985          (pages          153-154).       The

relevant drawings               are numbered 6705/6 and             17.        The proposals

were     agreed      by     S. Y. C. C. in       their     letter   of     30th July          1985

(pages       155-156),      subject      to     the    addition of extra gates.                  I

wrote to S. Y. C. C. on 1st August 1985 (pages 157-158)                               to clarify

the position regarding the extra gates                        because I was unclear

what SYCC required.              There was a meeting of the Working Party at

the     ground      on    7th August         1985   (pages    160-162)         which       amongst
other matters discussed the extra gates.                          The positions of the

extra gates were duly clarified and agreed and I confirmed the

position to the Club in my letter dated 15th August 1985 (pages

163-165).         The        two    extra     radial       fences    were   subsequently

installed that summer.



(c)     Gates

53.     There are seven gates through the perimeter fence of the

West Terrace.           These are            shown on drawing 11424/2.           When the

firm was appointed Nos.                 1,    2, 4and 6 were certainly already in

place and have not been modified in the meantime other than by

the addition of a quick release bolt so as to ensure that the

gates    could be opened quickly and easily in emergency even if

the gate is subjected to the same pressure as a crush barrier.

(This    type     of    bolt       is   fitted to all        gates    in the perimeter

fence at this ground).



54.     We also believe that                 No.   5 is also an original gate (pre-

1978) but when the access corridor was created by installing an

additional radial fence in 1985, steps were added on the inside

to provide easier access for the Police.



55.     The origin of gate 7 is not known.                        It is not recorded as

being in place in our drawings of the ground in 1978.                              We have

not   been      able    to    find in        our   files    any     record of    it   being

constructed under our control.                      There is a possibility that it

has   been      there    since before we became                the Club's       consulting

engineers,       but we think it more likely that it was constructed

on the Club's instructions sometime between 1980 and 1988.                               We
know that it was in place in 1988, because when we ordered the

quick release bolts for the gates in 1988 (to which I refer in

paragraph 61) it was                 discovered that we had ordered one less

than was required.                 An extra one had to be made.



56.     The     gate    number        3 was    constructed under our control                  in

1985.          It was specifically requested by the Police,                             and was

approved by the licensing authority before installation.                                      It

was made to match gate No.                    4, which was in the other half of

the old central pen.



57.     The width of each of the gateways is as follows:



Gate No.                     1        2        3         4        5         6       7

58.     The width of gates                in the perimeter fences had been the

subject       of    discussion         on various        occasions        between   1978      and

1985.         The Police and the fire service both have an interest

in this matter.                  From the Police point of view, they are most

likely     to      need      the     gates    to   get   onto     the     terrace   to      quell

unruly behaviour.                  Various senior officers have said over the

years that the gates should not be too wide because that would

make it easy for troublemakers to spill out onto the pitch if

the Police open the gate to get into the terrace.                                    The fire

service are naturally mindful of the possibility that the gates

may     have       to   be    used     for    evacuation         of   the   terrace      in    an
emergency.              Hence,     at Bramall       Lane ground where there is a

stand part of which has some timber in its construction,                                        the

gates      from       the   terrace    in     front      have     been     made    wider    than

normal, so as to assist rapid evacuation of spectators onto the

pitch.



59.     It should be remembered that at all relevant times,                                     the

1976 Guide,           which   contains       no recommendation as                 to width of

gates      in    perimeter       fences,      was       in     force.       The     1986    Guide

suggests        at paragraph 215 that such gates should be a minimum

of 1100mm wide.               The size of the gates in the perimeter fence

at Hillsborough was of course approved by the Working Party.

As indicated,           the Police in particular have said that they do

not     want     gates      which     are    too    wide        because     of    the    risk    of

spectators rushing onto the pitch at times when the gates may

be    opened      by    the   Police        to gain access              to the terraces         for

crowd control           purposes.            All gates have been discussed with

the     Police        and   Fire     Service       at    least     once     a    year.          The

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club has always willingly provided

whatever gates have been requested by the licensing authority.

We    as        the     Club's      engineers           have     prepared        drawings       and

specifications to give what we understood was being requested,

and     the     drawings      have    then     been       submitted        to the       licensing

authority.             The drawings have been considered by the working

party,        including       Police        and     Fire       Service,      and    have     been

approved.             The Club have then had the gates constructed,                             and

installed under our supervision.
60.     Although the gates are not marked,                     they are very obvious.

They cannot be operated from the inside.                          They are designed to

be under the control of the Police. Therefore, they can only be

operated from the pitch side.                    Once the gate has been opened by

the Police its position is obvious.



61.     I personally had a concern about the ability to open the

gates with pressure of spectators against them (they originally

had simple bolts).                Of my own initiative in 1987 I designed a

"quick    release          mechanism".     The       design     can    be   seen   from the

drawings prepared by Mr Strange in August 1987 (pages 190-191).

This    design was          forwarded      to    SCC on       19th August        1987    (page

189).      They      replied       on   15th October          1987     suggesting       that    a

prototype be manufactured and fitted to one of the gates                                      for

testing purposes.             This was done and a meeting was held on 25th

February      1988 with SCC and the Police to see the prototype in

operation.           The    prototype was            approved and installed in all

gates    on    the    perimeter         fence.        We   have   recently       tested       the

opening       of   gate     No.     3   with     a    test    load     applied     to   it     of

6kN/metre.           It could be opened with the arm extended so as not

to be in line with the gate when it suddenly opened.



TUNNEL RAMP TO WEST TERRACES



62.     I understand that it has been pointed out by Counsel for

the Inquiry that part of the floor of the tunnel,                                leading to

the    West    Terraces       slopes      downwards          towards    the   pitch      at    an

inclination which is greater than 1 in 10 the figures mentioned
in paragraph 87 of the 1986 Guide (formerly paragraph 9. 7. 2 of

the 1976 Guide).



63.     The    tunnel    and     ramp were       already in existence when the

firm    was     commissioned          by   the    Club     in    1978    to    assist    in

obtaining       the     Safety    Certificate.                  The   tunnel     had   been

constructed as part of the West Stand development in time for

the World Cup games in 1966.



64.     The firm has carried out a survey of the levels within the

tunnel.        These are shown on the attached drawing 11424/3.                           It

will be seen that on entering the tunnel from the direction of

the turnstiles,         there is an upward slope for about 4m.                         There

is then a smooth transition leading to a downward slope which

gradually increases to about 1 in 12 at 12%m into the tunnel,

about     1 in 8 at       14%m,    and      finally at about 1 in 6 for                a 3m

length between          16 and     19m.           The ramp then             levels   outto a

quite gentle inclination where it passes between the gates at

the entrance to the terrace.                 The ramp is steeper than 1 in 10

over a length of about 6m.



65.     Although I had been very heavily involved in safety work

in    football     grounds       in    1970-72,     including         the     Hillsborough

ground,       the invitation to help the Club in 1978 was the first

occasion on which I had usedthe 1976 Guide.                           In studying       it I

made manuscript notes of important                       points.      These notes       were

placed on file.            Attached at page 6(A) is a photocopy of one

of the two sheets           of notes which I wrote.                     It will be seen
that the recommendation concerning slope of ramps is one of the

points in the 1976 Guide about which I made a special note.



66.    On   3rd November         1979 as evidenced in my letter of 27th

October      1978    (page      6(B))       I    met    the   Chairman    of    the    Club,

Mr.   McGee to discuss our appointment.                       I also made a detailed

inspection of the ground.                       Amongst the many matters which I

remarked was        the part of the ramp which had a slope of more

than 1 in 10.             It was noticeable that instead of creating a

constant incline, which would have had a slope of about one in

15. 4m, the designer had chosen to align the floor of the tunnel

so that       there was        an upward slope to             a hump,    followed by a

downward slope which was therefore steeper than would have been

necessary without the hump.



67.    At that meeting I was given a list of drawings of various

parts of the ground.                 This list had been provided in September

1977 by Husband & Co.                the Club's previous consulting engineers

at    the   request       of   Mr.    R.    Whitehead a director of the Club,

(pages      6(C)    to    6 (K )).          It will      be   seen that       the   list   of

drawings      refers almost exclusively to the North stand,                           and to

the    West     stand      including            the    terrace    and   the    North    West

terrace/      all    of    which      had       been   designed by      Husband       & Co.

There are 67 drawings referring to the West terrace and stand,

and the North West corner stand.                         Those of which I requested

copies      were    ticked,          and    were       included    in   the    list    which

accompanied my letter to Mr.                      England dated 6th November             1978

(pages 6(H) and (M)).
68.     One of the drawings for which I asked was number 24A which

is entitled ' Section Through Access Tunnel' .                   I felt that the

ramp in the tunnel needed investigation.



69.     I recall that the Fire Service representatives also noted

the slope in the tunnel           floor at an early date.                 I remember

having a discussion with them during a walk round the ground in

one of the early meetings.                It is possible this was on the

occasion of the very first meeting of the Working Party with

the Club representatives at the ground on 13th December,                         1978.

The Fire Service were represented at that meeting, according to

a note on our file            (page 9(A))   by                            and

            There are no minutes of this meeting on our file, and

I     believe    it   was   mainly    for the    purpose    of   inspecting        the

ground and expressing preliminary views regarding safety works.

However,    there were various subsequent meetings over the four

months December 1978 to April 1979, with senior members of the

Fire Service at the ground, during which we inspected the West

stand     and the tunnel.             Some of these were meetings               of the

Working     Party,      and    some     specially     arranged       meetings      for

detailed discussions with the Fire Service, and on one occasion

the     Building      Surveyors   Department     of    S. Y. C. C.   as    well,    to

discuss any improvements which either we or they felt might be

needed.         The various meetings and inspections at the ground at

which the Fire Service were represented were as follows: -

70.    At one of the meetings listed above, but I cannot specify

which,      I    recall    discussing      with       the     Working    Party,   three

matters      involving     ramps.          In   chronological          order we    first

discussed the ramp through the tunnel to the West terrace.                               We

then discussed desirability of adjusting the exit from the Kop

through      a   tunnel    at    the    North   East    corner of        the   ground.

Third,      we discussed changes to the existing ramp forming part

of    the   exit    from   the    back    of    the    Kop.          These   latter    two

matters      are   mentioned       at    various      times     in    the    Minutes     of


                                         - 29 -
meetings,       but because the general            feeling was that no change

was to be made to the ramp in the West terrace tunnel,                           it is

not minuted.             Generally,    it was only the respects               in which

action was required which were recorded.



71.    Since     1979,     the     complete   Working       Party     consisting    of

experienced        senior      representatives        of    the     various    parties

involved has toured the ground on many occasions.                          During the

time S. Y. C. C.      were the licensing authority,               these inspections

were made systematically twice per year.                      Since SCC have been

the Licensing authority,             the inspections have been reduced to

one per year.          So far as I know, during these ten years, there

has    never    been     any   suggestion     by    any    member    of   the Working

Party,     or   anyone     else    for that matter that the               ramp in the

tunnel    should be altered,           even if this were to be reasonably

practicable.



72.    In my view there is a lack of clarity in the 1976 and 1986

Guides.         Neither differentiates             between a ramp in which the

"heavy crowd flow" is downhill,               and one in which it is uphill.

The Guides       are clearly meant to cover only the case in which

the spectators         have to go downhill,         tightly packed,       at the end

of a match.            They acknowledge       that the period of "greatest"

(the     1976 Guide)      and     "great"   (the    1986 Guide)       risk to crowd

safety at football grounds is at the time of leaving.                          That is

the normal situation with spectators descending from stands or

embankments      to    ground level.          Exactly the opposite position

applies in the         case of the ramp       through the tunnel of the West

stand.
7 3.    When   spectators         leave    the   West    terrace,     there    will    be

congestion and jostling as they converge on the space between

the     two    wing    walls      at   the    start     of   the    tunnel.           The

constricting of the crowd flow at the start of an exit route is

in line with the thinking in the 1976 Green Guide,                            paragraph

6. 3,    and the      1986 Guide,      paragraph 50.          Once the spectators

have entered the parallel                 sided tunnel,      the flow will settle

down to a steady rate.                 There is a gentle upward slope for a

distance of about 4m between the wing walls and then the tunnel

walls,     before the main ramp is reached.                    When the spectators

are going up the ramp to leave the ground they will be safer

than if they were walking downhill.                     It is to be expected that

if the ramp had a downward slope and someone tripped,                          it would

be very difficult for the people immediately behind to stop to

give     him   time     to   recover.            Furthermore,       the   people      even

further behind have a downhill momentum which will be difficult

to resist.



7 4.    If the same density of spectators were leaving the ground

along a route of the same width,                 but with no slope,        conditions

would be reasonably safe.                 If someone trips, it will be easier

for the people behind to slow down or stop momentorily to let

him recover.          But if the same density of spectators were going

along a route of the same width,                  but with an upward slope as

here,     conditions     are likely to be safer still.                     If someone

falls,     the person immediately behind will                  find it much easier

to     stop,   and    also   to    bring to      a halt      the people who are          a

little further behind.
75.    In my view it would                 probably be safertoprogress              in a

heavy crowd of people up a                 1 in 6 slope, thanto be in the same

crowd going down a 1 in 10 slope.



76.     Spectators entering rather than leavingthe West                         terrace,

do, of course, have to progress down the slope which over about

a 3m length is at 1 in 6, and for a further 3m is about 1 in 8.

But the rate at which spectators enter the ground is controlled

by the       turnstiles.           The maximum rate          at which they can be

expected to enter is perhaps equivalent to filling the ground

in say one hour or rather longer.                     There should be no "heavy

crowd     flow".           They    will    be   fed   down   the    ramp   in     limited

numbers      over    an    extended period        (contrast        evacuation of      the

ground in       an emergency).              Individuals,      or little groups of

people,      are in no danger in passing down a 3m wide ramp which

has a slope of 1 in 6 over a short length.                         If one of them did

trip and fall,            there would be no question of a mass of people

piling on top of him.



77.     Paragraph 88 of the           1986 Guide       (paragraph 9. 7. 2.        of the

1976 Guide)         says "The maximum gradient acceptable will depend

on the ramp's length,              purpose and usage but a ramp subject to

heavy crowd flow should preferably not exceed a gradient of 1

in    10".          The    Guide    also    brings    into    account      'the    ramp's

length' .       In the present case the total length of ramp which

has a slope of steeper than 1 in 10 is only 6m, and the length

which is steeper than 1 in 8 is only about 3m.
78.     Apart    from these matters,           in considering whether it was

possible for the ramp to be broken out and replaced with one of

constant      slope,      there, were     structural          considerations.              I

surmised      that     the    consulting       engineer       who    designed      it    had

presumably had a reason for giving it an initial upward slope

when entering         from the    turnstiles.             I do not now have              the

drawing ofthe tunnel which was loaned to me in 1979.                              This and

others were returned to Mr.               Whitehead under cover of a letter

dated    14th November         1978     (page 6(0)).            I recollect however

that    the     drawing      showed   that     the     ramp   needed      to    avoid    the

foundations of the tunnel walls.                      The rear part of the tunnel

clearly       existed    before   the     West       stand    was    created in         about

1966.         The    brick walls        in the rear half are old,                 and are

obviously part of an earlier structure, whilst new brick walls

were    constructed in the front               (terrace)      part of the tunnel.

The foundations of the older walls are at shallow depth so that

the ramp could not be sloped down without chopping off the edge

of the     foundations,        and also having to underpin them.                         This

would    have     been     complicated even hazardous                to a degree,         and

expensive.           Questions of difficulty of works and cost did not

however enter the equation,               from my point of view,               but rather

the fact that any alternative arrangement (reversing the slope

or even levelling it) would not have led to greater safety.



79.     For     example,      another    way     to    reduce       the   slope    of     the

steepest 6m length of the ramp would have been to break out the

relevant section and to introduce some steps.                             But in my view

that would have produced a hazardous situation.                                Indeed both

the 1976 and 1986 Guides say 'The gradient should preferably be
constant         and       not br o k e n by steps'                        (paragraph              9. 7. 1 of the         1976

Guide        an d p a r a g r a p h 87 of the                  1986 Guide).



80.      To     summarise,                 the     Guides         should           not      be      misinterpreted.

The     guidance           regarding              the    slope           of    ramps          is    e x pressly        stated

to      apply        to        ramps        which        have        a        downward             slope        when     being

t r a v e r s e d by a h e a v y crowd flow,                         tha t is at the time of leaving

the      ground           not         when        filling           it.               The        circumstances                are

obviously         much          s a f e r w h e n the h e a v y               crowd       f low is g o i n g uphill

as     in the      case         of the           tunnel.             B e a r i n g in min d the relatively

short        length         of      ramp      which          is     steeper           than         1 in     10,     and       the

fact      that         when         the      ground          is      filling          up       spectator            flow       is

light,        because            it    is    controlled              by       turnstiles,                I believe        that

th e    r amp     is      consistent              both w i t h           the    spirit             and    the     le t t e r of

the Guide.

81.      In     the       s u m m e r of         1981    Mr.      England approached                       the     firm for

a discussion               of     the       entrance          arrangements                at the Leppings                 Lane

e nd    of     the     ground.                   We     opened         a      file    on       13th      August         1981.

Th e    arrangements                  as    t hey      then       existed          ca n m ost            easily        be seen

f rom    a     drawing            number          6705/1            (page       146)        which           was     in     fact

prepared         by    my       firm muc h l a t e r              in       1985.         I s h o u l d m e n t i o n that

wal l    shown            on     the       drawing           running            f rom       turnstile             No     23     is

slightly         mis-drawn.                  In       fact     it    runs       to      th e       co l u m n    (the small

square)         shown          on     the        lef t    (south)             sid e      of      the     drawing.             The

d r a w i n g s h o u l d be rea d in c o n j u n c t i o n w i t h notes                                p r e p a r e d by Mr
Strange in or about August/September                              1981 which describe the

then system in force.



82.     The two sketch drawings numbered 3563/1/ and 2 prepared in

August       1981    (pages 73-74) show my firm's preliminary ideas for

alternatives              involving         extra      turnstiles            and,    to     varying

degrees,       segregation of crowd once access had been gained via

the turnstiles.



83.     So far as I am aware the initiative for this study came

from the Club, though it is possible that one of the interested

authorities had raised the matter without our knowledge.                                          The

Club were of course interested in crowd control/management in

all     parts       of    the     ground,       not    just      in    the    spectator        areas,

including the areas of access to the turnstiles.                                     Egress from

the ground was also considered.                             Indeed paragraph 6.2 of the

197 6    Guide       says       that     the    period      of     greatest      risk     to    crowd

safety is at the time of leaving the ground.



84.     In    the        event,    the      firm      was    not      asked    to    develop      its

embryonic schemes               any further in 1981.                       I presume that,        the

Club did         not see the matter as being of priority at that time

This    was         understandable             in my view.            It must be        remembered

that     they       were    carrying           out    extensive        works    to    the      ground

overall        year        by     year     (described            by    me     earlier     in     this

statement).              At the time they were also in the Second Division

with    the     consequence            that     attendances           at    their home      matches

were smaller than they were                       after their promotion to the First

Division.                Nor to the best of my own knowledge had                        there been
any serious        difficulties at matches with regard to ingress to

or egress       from the Leppings Lane end of the ground.                              Neither

in 1981 nor later in 1985 was it ever suggested to me by the

Club or by any other body represented on the working party that

a     scheme     of     rearrangement         was   required       to     alleviate         any

difficulties of that sort.



85.     In     1985,     by   which      time    the    Club      were    in     the     First

Division,        Mr. Chester,           successor      to   Mr.      England         as Club

Secretary,        wrote       to   me    on     22nd February           1985     (page      100)

resurrecting           the    question     of    possible      improvements            at   the

Leppings       Lane end.           I do not have any specific recollection

but     believe       that the letter         followed a brief mention of the

matter in informal discussions a day or two beforehand.



86.     A meeting was arranged with Mr. Chester                     on 6th March 1985.

My     staff    prepared      a rudimentary         sketch     showing         the   existing

lay-out        (page 101).         Before the meeting I sketched a possible

alternative lay-out by marking up the sketch as shown at page

102.         A new drawing showing those amendments was prepared for

the purpose of my meeting with Mr. Chester (page 103).                                 At that

meeting I made further manuscript markings on the sketch (page

104).



87.     I then worked up a scheme (drawing 6705/2) two versions Of

which appear at pages               105 - 106.          Three copies were sent to

Mr.    Chester under cover of my letter of 2nd April                            1985     (pages

107-108).              The principles,        as reflected in my letter of 2nd

April 1985 involved the segregation of home and away supporters
not merely within the ground itself,                         but also after access had

been    gained      via       the    turnstiles        (as    indicated,       this    was    of

particular       concern            to   the    Club       and,     as   I   understood      the

position,       the Police).               Flexibility was          also provided by         the

possibility         of   allocating            either a large or a small               viewing

area to visiting supporters.                        With the separate "channelling"

to the       various      divided parts             of the west          stand and terraces

account had to be taken of the need to provide extra lavatories

and refreshment areas.



88.     As will be apparent from our drawing No. 6705/2 (page 105)

and drawing No.           6705/1 (the then existing layout)                    (page 146) we

proposed six extra turnstiles.                       Two of the existing turnstiles,

numbered 17 and 18, were to be demolished.                                   By dividing the

remaining sixteen by an additional internal fence incorporating

gates    (one       fence      already         existed)      Nos.     1/6 would   serve      the

north stand,          Nos.      7/12 the north-west terrace and Nos.                      13/16

part    of    the     seated        area       of   the west        stand (that   stand      was

itself     to   be divided into two).                        A new bank of turnstiles

(numbered       17/21 on drawing 6705/2)                    was proposed to serve the

central area of the terrace with a new wall being constructed

from    the     corner         of    turnstile       No.     16     in   effect   to   make    a

fundamental division between turnstiles 1/16 and the areas into

which they fed on the one hand and the rest of the turnstiles

on the other.             For those turnstiles to the south we suggested

a further three with internal fences which would constrain the

spectators       to      go    up    the    stairs     to the southern half of the

stand seating.                The remaining turnstiles led to the south-west

terrace.         Each of the areas so created was to have exit gates
of the appropriate width to permit evacuation of the ground in

less than eight minutes.



89.     Under cover of a letter dated 9th April                         1985 drawing No

670 5/2     showing       the     proposals       was    sent      to     S. Y. C. C.   for

consideration by the Working Party (pages 109-110).                               It will

be seen that Mr.          Chester had already supplied a copy of the

drawing     to    the   Police     with    whom    he    had    been     in     discussion

concerning        the     proposals.           This       is    in       line    with    my

understanding that,             of all    the authorities        concerned,         it was

the Police who were most involved because of their particular

interest     in    crowd        management    and       control,        especially      the

segregation of home and away supporters.



90.     On 12th April 1985 Mr Strange had a conversation with Mr.

Chester as recorded in his note which appears at page 111.                               It

will be seen that the Club               were still considering the question

of the number of turnstiles to be incorporated in the scheme.

On 17th April 1985 Mr Strange had a discussion with Mrs. Sharon

Lane a senior assistant on Mr. Chester's staff with particular

responsibility for ticket sales.                  Mr Strange's note appears at

page 112.          Mrs.    Lane suggested that there should be a total

of     34 turnstiles:       a further four to supplement the existing

six serving the north stand,                  an extra two to supplement the

six which we had suggested should serve the area assigned to

home standing supporters,                 and a reduction of one in the two

banks of turnstiles to be used by visiting standing supporters.

Mrs.    Lane wished the turnstiles to be in pairs.
91.     We duly revised the drawing of the proposed scheme.                                        On

19th    April        1985       Mr   Strange       wrote    to    Mr.       Chester     enclosing

drawing No.          6705/3      (pages 113-115).           As will be seen from such

drawing        we    accurately         reflected         Mrs.    Lane's          suggestion      for

numbers of turnstiles,                 and we included necessary alterations to

proposed walls and fences to ensure segregation and channelling

of supporters.



92.     On 20th April 1985 Mr Strange had a telephone conversation

with Mr.       Chester who indicated that he was still not satisfied

that    the     number          of proposed        turnstiles         was    right.          He was

still having discussions with his colleagues at the Club (page

116).



93.     On      25th        April       1985       there        was     another        telephone

conversation between Mr Strange and Mr.                               Chester        (page    117).

By then Mr.           Chester had returned a copy of drawing No.                              6705/3

with various manuscript markings of his own.                                        We cannot now

find in our files that particular copy.                                     We believe that it

will have been used by our draughtsman,                               Ian Wilson,          to revise

the negative of drawing 6705/3 to produce drawing 6705/4                                           (it

will be seen that the signature and date are identical in both

drawings).                In all probability the marked up copy received

from     Mr.        Chester      was    then       destroyed.                 Mr.    Chester      had

suggested           that     there      should       be    an    area       in      front    of    the

turnstiles           to    be    used       by   visiting       supporters          separate      from

those     areas        leading         to    the    turnstiles        to     be     used     by   home

supporters.           He wished to have gates enclosing this area.                                    He

also proposed              four banks        of three turnstiles                 together with a
gate which he suggested might be used to let spectators into

the   ground    at    all    ticket       matches.           It will    be seen on Mr

Strange's      note     that      the    latter      wrote    "disaster"        in    square

brackets      against       this       suggestion.             The     square    brackets

indicate that this was Mr Strange's reaction to that particular

suggestion.        I should also explain that as I am Chairman of the

firm and also Director in overall charge of work done on behalf

of the Club,        Mr Strange's notes of telephone conversations are

all   placed       before    me.       They   have    the    dual    function        both    of

recording what had been discussed and incorporating,                            always in

square brackets,        Mr Strange's comments/views where appropriate

in order      that I shall be aware of these before he                    and I come to

have our      owndiscussions.                 In the circumstances Mr                Strange

did   not     indicate       to Mr.      Chester      his    personal      view of          the

proposal      that a gate should               be used to permit          entry to          the

ground for all-ticket matches.                    If anybody was to communicate

those    views,      then    it was       for me to do so.               Moreover,          the

moment was not appropriate because we were still working on our

proposals.         Anyway we knew that once a scheme had been agreed

in principle with the Club it would have to be submitted to the

Working Party,        a process which indeed we had already begun,                           as

I have      indicated,       on     9th April        1985    by sending our drawing

6705/2 to S. W. C. C.



94.     Following the conversation with Mr. Chester on 25th April

1985 we sent to him new drawing No.                     6705/4 on 26th April                1985

(pages      118-119).          On   1st May 1985 Mr. Chester telephoned to

ask   for    our    "guess"       of    the   likely    cost    of   implementing           the

scheme in its then form (page 120).                         This was for the purpose
of a meeting of the Club Board of Directors due to take place

the    next       day.            On     the    following       day#    2nd       May     1985,    we

delivered our letter (pages 121-122) with our broad estimate.

This was          £66, 600.      in respect of the proposals                     for changes to

turnstiles,            fences     and        gates     appearing       on        drawing    6705/4

(including the proposed radial fence on the west terrace), such

figure       to    include       professional          fees; and      £60,700.,               again

including         professional          fees,        for the    necessary         consequential

works to lavatories and refreshment areas under the west stand.

We also mentioned certain other                        separate          works. However,           in

relation to the re-organisation scheme the total cost estimate

was £127, 300.



95.     On    2nd May         1985     S. Y. C. C.    confirmed       (pages      123-125)        that

our     earlier          proposals        submitted       to    them        in     the     form     of

drawing 6705/2,             which by now had been overtaken, was generally

acceptable to the working party subject to an additional gate

being provided between turnstile No.                           16 and the wall proposed

to    abut        it   as     shown     on     drawing    6705/2.           Requirements           for

minimum widths of gates in the areas outside the stadium itself

were    also indicated,               I understand at the request of the Fire

Service.           The relevant measurements are shown in manuscript on

the copy of drawing 6705/2 which S. Y. C. C.                           returned to us

(page        125).       Other    conditions          were     also    imposed           concerning

radial       fences      and extra gates in the perimeter fence                            (aspects

with which I have dealt elsewhere in this statement).



96.     At    this       time    we    were     involved       in discussions             with     the

Police primarily concerning the radial fences.                                      We were due
to have a meeting with them on 8th May 1985.                                    On the previous

day,    however,          we    received         a telephone          call     from Mr. Chester

(page     120)      to indicate            that the Club's             Board        felt unable to

expend £120,000.               on the general scheme as it was then proposed.



97.     On    13th May          1985       Mr.    Chester wrote to me asking                     for a

meeting       at     Hillsborough             "to      consider      the     full    implications,

operations and costings"                    of the proposed scheme.                   It should be

remembered that this was the Monday following the Saturday on

which     the      fire        at    Bradford          City    Football       ground      had    taken

place.        I duly met Mr. Chester on Friday 17th May 1985.                                    It is

my     recollection            of    such meeting that Mr.                   Chester voiced the

concern of the Club's Board at the likely cost of the proposed

scheme.            He    was        looking      for     areas       where    savings      might     be

effected.           He said that the scheme needed to be considerably

simplified,             also that          the existing turnstiles                   (twenty-three)

were     adequate         in        number,      but     he    requested       that    two      of   the

turnstiles which served the west stand should be re-allocated

to     the north stand.



98.     At     this        juncture              it     is     appropriate           to    give      my

understanding of the Club's position with regard to the cost of

ground improvements.                       I believe that the Club had built up a

reserve        for       the        proposed          works    of     re-arrangement            at   the

Leppings Lane end and for other major works in the ground.                                           The

fire     at    Bradford             Football        Club      took    place    as     indicated       on

Saturday        Uth       May 1985.              The south stand at Hillsborough had

timber        decking.               The    Club        therefore       realised,         after      the

Bradford fire,             that works would have to be carried out to the
south stand.              In the event the decking had to be covered with

continuous          steel    sheets      with non-slip surfaces               at a cost of

£59/280       exclusive          of   professional         fees.      This      was     a   new

commitment which/            of course/ had to be and was met promptly.



99.    Moreover,          during that 1984/85 season the firm had reason

to inspect          the     cantilever roof of the south stand which was

leaking.           When some of the roof sheeting had been removed we

found that the main bottom chord steel member of the cantilever

trusses were badly rusted.                    There had been significant loss of

metal.         It    was     essential        in   the    interests      of    safety       that

removal       of the rust and repainting be carried out during the

Summer        of     1985.              The   cost       was   £67,900        exclusive       of

professional fees.               Curing of the leaks cost another £12,640.



100. After the meeting with Mr. Chester on 13th May 1985/ I was

away for a few days and was unable therefore to inform

Mr    Strange       of    what    Mr.    Chester     had discussed with               me.     Mr

Strange's note of a telephone conversation with Mr. Chester on

22nd May 1985 (page 132) refers.                          The writing at the foot of

the note is mine, indicating to Mr Strange that he and I should

set aside time for discussion on 28th May 1985.



101. By 4th June 1985 we had prepared a revised scheme in line

with     Mr   Chester's          requests.         The    scheme   is    illustrated          in

drawings      numbered respectively 6705/5 and 6705/8A (pages                               135-

136) which were sent to the Club under cover of our letter of

that date (page 133-134).
102. The difference between the two drawings is merely that in

drawing    6705/5         existing     turnstiles     Nos.    17       and    18     were    to

remain but       the alternative in drawing 6705/8A involved their

removal and the realignment of the fence which at that time ran

from the        corner of turnstile No.             18 to the iron gates which

formed the boundary of Hillsborough itself adjoining Leppings

Lane.       As my firm's letter of 4th June 1985 indicates, we had

discerned        a    potential       "pinch     point"    when        spectators       were

leaving the ground.                 Were turnstiles Nos.           17 and 18 and the

fence to remain in position the scheme in drawing 6705/5 would

provide     inadequate         space       for   spectators       leaving       the    south

stand,    the     south west terrace and the west stand.                            The exit

time would have been in excess of the eight minutes recommended

by the 1976 Guide.             The revised scheme in drawing 6705/8A gave

a greater width             (an extra iron gateway) for spectators leaving

the ground at that point.                  We also proposed that the realigned

fence should be constructed from metal sheets so that home and

visiting supporters would be unable to see each other as they

queued to enter the ground.



103. On the 12th June 1985 Mr. Chester of the Club acknowledged

our     letter        and     the     accompanying         drawings          showing        the

alternative schemes.                  He was due to be away until 19th June

1985 and he asked me to liaise with the Police and/or S. Y. C. C.

(page     137)       to   ascertain    their     views.           We   were     uncertain,

however,    which scheme he wished us to put forward.                                On 17th

June     1985     Mr Strange        rang     Mrs.   Lane     of    the       Club     seeking

clarification but            she was       unable to help         (page      140).          Upon

Mr. Chester's return he informed us that the Club preferred the
scheme        shown    on     drawing      No.     6705/8A.              Because     of   the

particular        interest        of       the    Police      in    any     proposed      re­

organisation,          on   25th' June        1985 we       submitted      a copy    of our

drawing No.       6705/8A to them requesting comments                       (page     142).

Approval was given orally by Inspector Calvert in a telephone

conversation with Mr.            Strange on 27th June 1985.                        We sent a

full set of drawings to Mr.                   Chester with our letter dated 8th

July 1985       (page 151) and told him of the oral approval of the

Police.



104. On 5th July 1985 we had submitted a Planning Application

for the scheme to SCC as the Local Planning Authority                                  (pages

145-148).                On    the     same      day   we    had    also    submitted         an

Application for Building Regulation approval to the Director of

Design and Building Services of SCC.



105.     At    that     stage    the       firm    were      involved      in    urgent    and

intensive work in the preparation of detailed working drawings

both    to     place    before       the   working      party      and    for use     by the

contractors who were to carry out the work.                              The Applications

for     Planning       Permission          and    Building         Regulation       approval

required only the submission of outline drawings.                                   S. Y. C. C.

were,    however,       aware of our Application as will be seen from

their letter to us of 18th July 1985 (page 152).                                By 25th July

1985 we had prepared the necessary detailed drawings which we

submitted to S. Y. C. C.             under cover of our letter of that date

(pages       153-154).           Approval         of the working party given at

their     meeting      on     29th July       1985 and was         intimated to us            in

S. Y. C. C's letter of 30th July 1985 (pages 155-156) to which I
have    already       referred        in detail     in connection with               fences.

Paragraph       (b)    of     that      letter     refers        specifically        to     some

aspects of the proposals in connection with the turnstiles, and

to realignment of hand railing.



106. There       followed         a    meeting    of     the     working     party    at     the

ground on 7th August 1985 at which the Deputy Secretary of the

Club and I were present.                       Minutes        are to be found at pages

160-162.              The    working       party       were      able   to     witness       the

construction of the new works which were being carried out to a

very tight programme so as to have them completed by the start

of the next season later in August.                            They were duly completed

in time.



107. At a meeting of the working party on 22nd January                                      1986,

after    more     than       half      a   season        of    experience,      the       Police

reported        that        the       scheme     for      the     revised       segregation

arrangements      at the Leppings               Lane end "worked well on by far

the majority of occasions"                 (page 173).

108. I was not at            the match on 15th April 1989.                     I arrived at

the    ground     at     approximately           4. 40    p. m. and     carried       out     an

inspection       in    the        immediate      aftermath.             With    the       Club's

approval the firm did tests on some of the crush barriers the

next day,       Sunday       16th April.         The crush barrier             of which two

spans collapsed and those of which one length of the horizontal
rail had visibly deformed,                  had not been designed by my firm,

but   were      original      barriers       (probably        from        1965   or   earlier).

The radial fences and perimeter fence were all intact although

there    was       some   deformation        of    the    framing         of     the perimeter

fence.         I     understand      that    parts       of    the    wire        mesh    on   the

perimeter fence were cut away by spectators and/or the rescue

services on 15th April in order to gain access to the terracing

and to allow spectators to escape onto the pitch.



109. The two barriers which were permanently deformed on 15th

April Nos.         128 and 137 were tested in turn.                         In each case the

load was applied in increments of one-quarter of the test load

until    the test load of 6kN/metre specified in the 1986 Guide

was     reached.             The    forward       deflection         of    the    barrier      was

measured.            It was found to be behaving elastically,                            with the

deflection increasing proportionally to the applied load.                                      The

deflection was within the range expected for a barrier of this

type which is in good condition.                         When the load was released,

the deflection of the barrier was fully recovered.                                    It should

be noted that some permanent deflection is allowed by the 1986

Guide     (the recovery only needs to be 75% - see Annex C of the

Guide).            The test load was reapplied so as to give the three

cycles of loading,            each of five minutes duration,                      specified in

Annex     C.         Each    time    the    load was          removed,         there was       full

recovery.



110. It        was    then    decided       to    determine      the       approximate         load

which had been applied to the barriers during the incident on

15th April.            It is possible to infer what this load had been
uy     reloading        to      the     p oint    w here      the       barrier        ceases        to   behave

elastically.                     The      load         at     which       it      starts          to      behave

plastically,               and          therefore            begins       to      develop            p e r manent

deformation,          is      in      effect      the       load    which       had     b een     appl i e d     on

15th April.



111.    Barrier         128     was      the     stronger          of    the    two.            It     began     to

d e f o r m p l a s t i c a l l y at a l oad of              9kN/metre.             This     is      1. 8 times

the    design      load       of      5kN/metre,        and        1. 5 times      the      test       load      (it

will    be r e c a l l e d that the test l o a d is it s e l f an overload).



112.    Barrier       137 was           not quite so strong.                      It b e g a n to d e f o r m

plastically         at       a l oad      of a p p r o x i m a t e l y    7. 5kN/metre.                   This    is

1. 5 times       the d e s i g n loa d and 1. 25 times                     the test load.

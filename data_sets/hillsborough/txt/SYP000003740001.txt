              going     as    I had          been       to    the        ground          before.              I cannot             remember              which

              was    th©     only       way       in    to    the        standing             area       at       Leppings          LN     end.           Once              in

              that    the     central             area       at     the       rear       of    the       goal          was    very       crowded                  but

              either       ends        of    this       area       was        very       clear          of    people.              I saw        people

              stand.         As    the       game       went       on     I saw          people          climbing             over       the        fences

              which     run       along       the       terrace           towards             the       pitch          and    also       over           the

 ^            perimeter       fence          into       the       pitch            and        then       climbing             up the       fence          and

              pulling        other          people       over        into          the       pitch.           At       the    start        of       this           there

              stopped       I saw       the       police          and     others             trying          to    pull        and    rip at             the

              perimeter           fence       to       get    it    down.               At    this       stage          I did       not       realise

              that    the     situation                was    so    serious              but       then       I saw          people        lying          on

              the    pitch        and       being       given       mouth          to        mouth       and       people          banging           people

              about     to    try       and       help       them.            I then          saw      a n 8a m b u l a n c e       come        onto              the

              pitch     towards             the    Leppings              LN   e nd.

              I heard        an    announcement which                         asked           peopole             to    clear       the       pitch               it    was

longer          than          this    but       the       system       was       not    very       clear          and    you       could          not

hear       it       very       well.         Later         Kenny       DALGLEISH             came       onto       the       system          a nd

asked          people          to    do    what       was     asked         of    them       to    assist          the       emergency

services.

At    this          stage       I realised                there      was     a    serious          problem          but       not       so

serious             as    the       outcome          was.

There          was       another          a n n o u n c e m ent      over        the    tannoy          system          asking          people

not       to    rush          out    of    the       ground       and       also       telling          us    the       game       was       over.

I saw          people          being        carried         away       but       any    person          dying.

Later          we    left       the       ground          it w a s     very       congested             mainly          because          of       the

fire       engines             parked        outside.             Once       free       from       the       ground          it    was       quite

orderly             and       I did       not       see    any    trouble.              On    arriving             at    the       car       we

turned          on       the    radio        and      the     football            results          were       on    so       it w a s        about

a    quarter             to    five       ( 1 6 4 5 ).      We    asked          someone          where       a    telephone             bow        was

we    found          one       and    tried          to    ring      Liverpool           but       it    was       continually

engaged.                 At    this       time       our    concern          was       for    the       safety          and       whereabouts

of    J a m e s,         we    had    not       seen       James       at    all.

We    then          drove       to    the       Barnsley          area       to    try       and       contact          the       emergency

numbers             but       still       could       not     get      through.              Later       I returned                home       and

heard          that       James       had       died.

From       what          I saw       it a p p e a r e d       the      problem          was       increased             by    the       fences

which          ran       down       the    terrace          from       the       top    to    the       pitch,          this       did       not

allow          the       people       to     spread         out      at     the    sides.              Also       there       appeared              to

be    a    lack          of    signs       at       the    rear      of     the    stand          to    inform          people          that        you

could          reach          the    standing             area    by      going        around          each       end    of       the    stand

and       not       only       through          the       tunnel.           I had       been       to    the       ground          before          and

did       not       know       the    other          way    in.        Before          the    match          started          I saw          the

area       at       the       rear    of     the      goals       getting          very       full       and       people         were

gradually                leaving          the       area    and      then        the    rush       started.

In m y         opinion,             being       a    telephone            engineer,           there          was    certainly                not

             ringing       the    emergency      numbers     continually         until    after    midnight        and

             could    not    get    any    information       due    to    it   being    busy.     The    only    way     we

             found    out    about       James   was   by   other    relatives         going    back    to S h e f f i e l d

             and    being    told    there.       I did     not    know    about   James       until    about    4.30

               position             of    James          is     already          marked        on   the      photograph            by   the    number          9.

               I have          been       shown          a     series       of    photographs               referenced)             I/ 11A ,            1/12A,,

               been       indi c a t e d         as      possibly           being      James.            Having         viewed      these      photos          I

               can       say    that          the      person         indicated           is    not      James.

             James       lying      on    the       pitch.        I am      sure    that    in    respect      of    that

             photograph            that    it       is    James   as     indicated         by    the   number       9.

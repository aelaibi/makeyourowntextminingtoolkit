CIRCUMSTANCES PRECEDING COMPLAINT



R1    On Saturday,   15 April 1989 a Football

Association Cup Semi-Final match was to be played

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Football

Clubs at Sheffield Wednesday Football Stadium,

Hillsborough,   Sheffield.




R2    It is a matter of record that there was

serious overcrowding at the match and that shortly

after kick off at 1500 hours,   the game was

abandoned due to crushing in pens 3 and 4 of the

West Stand terraces.    As a result of the

overcrowding and crushing 95 supporters died and

some 730 received injuries.




R3   Following the disaster Hr G J DEAR, QPH,

Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police was

appointed to investigate and collate evidence for

HM Coroner for Sheffield (West District) and for a

Judicial Inquiry which was conducted by Lord

Justice TAYLOR.




R4   On 27 September 1989 responsibility for the

criminal investigation arising from the

Hillsborough disaster, together with all complaint
                 and disciplinary matters was also passed to Mr

                 DEAR.     With effect from 1 April 1990 these

                 responsibilities were transferred to Mr L SHARP,

                 QPM, Chief Constable of the Cumbria Constabulary.




                 CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION




                 R5      As a result of this disaster a full file of

Parts I - VII   evidence was submitted to the Director of Public

Main File       Prosecutions and to the Police Complaints

                Authority.




                R6       The nature of the complaints made against

                 Police Constable 1285 SMITH by the complainants

                 LACKEY and HENDRY form part of the evidence

                 submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions

                 for consideration of whether to prosecute Police

                Constable SMITH for Manslaughter or Culpable

                M alfeasan ce.




Main File       R7       The   interview with Police Constable

Part III        SMITH for      these alleged criminal offences was

                complaints and Captain E , N . TAYLOR was appointed

                to oversee the investigation




                DETAILS OF COMF1,ATMT




                M3     The specific allegations made by Mr LACKEY

                are as follows:-




                f&|    The police officer standing on the pitch side

                       of Gate 3 facing the crowd should have opened

                       the gate when asked because it would have

                       saved the life of some supporters.




                (b)   When the police officer did open it he pushed

                       one lad back into the c ro w d .




                The possible disciplinary offences evident in the

                allegations made a r e :-




                                                                       8
(A )   NEGLECT Of B O TY . by failing to. open the

       perimeter gate and release Mr LACKEY and

       other supporters.




       (Contrary to The Police (Discipline)

       Regulations 1985. Regulation 5.

       Schedule 1. 4(a).




(B)    ■m a B t ' - a e JjOTHOKITT. by pushing a supporter

       back into the crowd.




       (Contrary to The Police (Discipline)

       Regulations 1985. Regulation 5.

       Schedule 1 (8c).




These two allegations form part of the evidence

submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions

who is considering criminal offences against the

officer of Manslaughter and Culpable Malfeasance.




R14    The evidence required to consider

Manslaughter requires a high degree of gross

negligence or recklessness and there is no

comparable discipline offence to consider.
R15   However, the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

is an alternative offence to Manslaughter, and

although it is based upon the same evidence, it

requires a lesser degree of negligence or

recklessness and embraces neglect of duty.    Should

the Director of Public Prosecutions decide    that

there is insufficient evidence to prove the

offences of Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance,

no further action can be taken in respect of the

disciplinary offence of Neglect of Duty.




R16   The specific allegations made by Mr HENDRY

are as follows:-




(a)   He (Mr HENDRY) was getting crushed and could

      not breathe properly, so together with others

      he screamed at a policeman standing at the

      Gate numbered 3 who was facing the crowd,

      "Open the gate let us out".   Mr HENDRY says

      the policeman waved his arms and shouted,

      "push back, push back", but would not open

      the gate.




(b)   That when some supporters climbed onto the

      perimeter fence the same policeman grabbed

      one unknown person by the collar and belt and

      pushed him back over the fence into Pen 3.
R17   Two possible disciplinary offences are

evident and they a re :-




(A)   NEGLECT OF D UTY, by failing to open the

      perimeter gate and release Mr HENDRY and

      other supporters.




      (Contrary to The Police (Discipline)

      Regulations 1985, Regulation 5.

      Schedule 1, 4(a),




(B)   ABUSE OF AtJTgOt.ITY, by grabbing a

      supporter by the collar and belt and pushing

      him back over the fence into Pen 3.




      (Contrary to The Police (Discipline)

      Regulations 1985. Regulation 5.

      Schedule 1 (8c).




These two allegations form part of the evidence

submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions

who is considering criminal offences against the

officer of Manslaughter and Culpable Malfeasance.




R18   The evidence required to consider

Manslaughter requires a high degree of gross
                       negligence or recklessness and there is no

                       comparable discipline offence to consider.




                       R19   However,   the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

                       is an alternative offence to Manslaughter, and

                       although it is based upon the same evidence,      it

                       requires a lesser degree of negligence or

                       recklessness and embraces neglect of a duty.

                       Should the Director of Public Prosecutions decide

                       that there is insufficient evidence to prove the

                       offences of Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance,

                       no further action can be taken in respect of the

                       disciplinary offence of Neglect of Duty.

CONCLUSION



R27   Police Constable SMITH has worked regularly

at football matches at Hillsborough stadium since

1982 or 1983.   Invariably he has been posted to the

perimeter, track around the playing pitch and

usually in the vicinity of the Leppings Lane end

called the West Terrace.   He has performed duty in

this position at both league and cup matches,

including F.A. Cup semi-finals, where capacity

crowds attended.
R28    On 15 April 1989 he was posted to Serial 1 on

the perimeter track near to perimeter gate 3, a

position he had worked in the 1988 semi-final when

overcrowding had been experienced.   Although Police

Constable SMITH seems to have been unaware of any

specific crushing problems in the past and no-one

had ever brought such matters to his attention, he

admits that at previous events he has moved people

out of peps 3 or 4 into pens 1 and 2, or 6 and 7,

because of overcrowding.   He refers specifically to

past occasions when he moved children from pen to

pen.   A clear impression emerges that Police

Constable SMITH had dealt with minor overcrowding

in the past which he had dealt with on his own

initiative by moving people, mainly children,     from

one pen to another because the central pens     (3 and

4) had become uncomfortably full.




R29    He had a good working knowledge of the system

for policing Hillsborough including the basic

philosophy of fans being left to find their own

level on the terraces by lateral movement through

and over the radial fences into adjoining pens.     He

also understood the basic differences between

policing league matches and semi-finals when the

arrangements vary.
R30    Prior to the start of the 1989 semi-final

although he received both written and verbal

instructions, he was not briefed specifically about

crowd monitoring, distribution or overcrowding.

Although his responsibility was wider than manning

gate 3 he made sure that it was unlocked and he

understood that it was his job to try to ensure

that it remained closed throughout the match.

Although the written order refers to bolts on the

perimeter gates, Police Constable SMITH knew that

particular order was out of date because the bolts

had been replaced by a padlocked lever some years

ago.   He was also conscious of the order that the

perimeter gates should only be opened under

strictly controlled circumstances.




R31    Because of a new system introduced by Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD for 1989, Police

Constable SMITH was relieved from his post by

Police Constable HELLIWELL at about 1345 hours to

go for a hot meal, but some catering difficulties

meant that he did not return to his position

outside pen 3 until about 1450 hours.




R32    At that time he noticed that pens 3 and 4 had

filled up considerably while he had been away.
To him the crowd did not appear abnormal and fans

on the terrace behind gate 3 appeared to be happy

with room to move about.   The crowd at the front of

the terrace, close to the perimeter fence were not

showing any signs of distress and were not affected

adversely by one surge forward noticed by Police

Constable SMITH as being nothing out of the

ordinary, parts of the crowd moving forward and

then back.




R33   During one such surge as the teams were

coming out onto the pitch at about 1454 hours, gate

3 sprung open because of crowd pressure. No-one

tried to come through the gate onto the track,

Police Constable SMITH closed it, and there were no

signs of crowd distress noticed by him.   The

springing open of the gate had occurred at previous

events so it did not unduly concern the officer.

He describes his view of the terraces from his eye

level vantage point on the perimeter track as being

drawn naturally to the centre and back of the crowd

in the pens over the heads of the fans standing

close to the perimeter fence.   To notice the crowd

at the front would take a conscious effort of

someone on the perimeter track to look downwards.
R34      Gate 3 sprung open a second time because of

crowd pressure but on this occasion Police

Constable SMITH, and other officers, could not

close it and had to hold it shut.     Police Constable

SMITH stepped back to see what was causing the

problem with the gate, leaving other officers to

hold it shut and simultaneously he noticed cries of

distress from the crowd in pen 3 and people pressed

up against the perimeter fence.     He used his

personal radio to contact the Police Control Box

but his message was not acknowledged.     It may be

that this message was one which is reported by

Police Sergeant GODDARD as being unintelligible.

Police Constable SMITH was asking for the

permission of the Police Control Box staff to open

the perimeter gate in accordance with the Operation

Order.     Although he had opened the gate on his own

initiative at previous events, he explains that in

1989 there was a new Chief Superintendent in charge

and he had been told before the match that things

had to be done properly.




R35      Police Constable SMITH told the officers who

were still holding gate 3 shut to open the gate and

let people out of the pen so as to relieve the

pressure.    The gate was opened but there were too
many people trying to mount the steps from the

terracing to get through the narrow gate.      The

officer immediately stood on the advertisement

hoardings on the pitch side of the perimeter fence

of pen 3 and shouted and signalled for the crowd to

move back to relieve the pressure at the front.           It

was at about that moment that fans started to

scramble over the top of the perimeter f e n c e .   It

is likely that at this moment Police Constable

SMITH tried to radio the seriousness of the

situation to the Police Control Box.     There was no

acknowledgement that the message was received and

although the message broke up during transmission,

Police Constable HELLIWELL heard a portion of it.




R36   All of these events occurred in a very short

period of time and it is at least likely that what

Mr HENDRY interpreted as a police officer pushing

people back into pen 3 was in fact Police Constable

SMITH trying to get the crowd to move back.      In the

rush to escape people were treading on other people

who had fallen to the ground.    In his description

of that movement, Police Constable SMITH describes

how he pushed some of those people back in an

attempt to free those who had fallen.     Before the

fallen could be rescued he had to stop people from
treading all over them.   It is more than likely

that action was misinterpreted by Mr LACKEY.




R37   Apart from the movement when Police Constable

SMITH mounted the advertisement hoardings to signal

and shout to the crowd, he denies climbing up at

the perimeter fence and preventing people from

climbing over.




R38   Froin the facts which can be proved, together

with those which are likely or cannot be disputed,

there is no evidence upon which to base any

disciplinary charge against Police Constable SMITH.

I observed him closely when he was interviewed and

I am convinced that he was doing his very best

under enormous stress, to explain in detail what he

saw, felt and did on the day.




R39   The complains made by Mr HENDRY and Mr LACKEY

suggest that the officer should have opened

perimeter' gate 3 earlier than he did and if he had

done so lives would have been saved.   There is

no evidence to support that, nor is there any

evidence that other than for the best motives,

Police Constable SMITH prevented anyone from

escaping through the perimeter gate, or over the
perimeter fence.   All of the complaints are based

upon misconceptions and misinterpretations and they

are unsubstantiated.

DATED: 050689                                                 D LACKEY (SIQtfED)



           I am a single man and I live at my parents house in Walton,

        Liverpool.     I am a Liverpool supporter and always have been.

        Although I didn't have a ticket for the F A Cup Semi Final match

        between Liverpool and Notts Forest, I did want to see the match.

        So on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), my mate,                       and

        myself set off for Sheffield by train.    We left Lime Street Station

        at about 1110 am (1110) and eventually arrived in Sheffield at about

        1.30 pn (1330) or thereabouts.

        Although the train itself was a 'special' just set on for the

        football, we did seem to keep stopping for noapparentreason.        I

        think we were delayed by about half an hour.

        When we arrived in Sheffield itself, we were escorted off the train

        station by Police Officers.    There were about four Officers on horses

        and a few on foot who were stood on the road static as the horses

        guided towards Leppings Lane End.

        It was coming up to 2pn (1400) or just after by the time   we arrived at

        the Leppings Lane end.

        On my way to the ground I didn't see any supporters drinking alcohol




                                                                                      1

at all and I didn't see any fighting or drunkenness.         We were all

having a laugh with the Police Officers on horseback and there was a

good atmosphere all around.

When we arrived at the entrance to the ground, it was already packed

with people.       I was surprised to have even got this far without a

ticket, because last year the Police were checking along the road on

the approach to the ground.

In front of the big blue railings there were quite a few Policemen

frcm the bridge to the shop, about 15 or so in all.         They weren't

blocking the way, they were just stood there.

They didn't seem to be checking tickets at all - one of them said to

me, "Either come in or fuck off."

He didn't ask to see my ticket.         I just walked past him along Leppings

Lane to see if anyone was selling any tickets.                and myself

wanted to buy one.

We couldn't get any tickets at all, so we walked back up to the

leppings Lane entrance and sat on the bridge wall opposite the

turnstiles, by this time it was about 2.20 pm (1420) or thereabouts.

The crowds at the entrances to the turnstiles still

seemed packed. They weren't getting any better.        It was chaos.   There

was   ik)   organisation.   Several Police horses were in amongst the crowd

but they didn't seem to be doing much good.

             .eft me on the wall and went back down Leppings Lane towards

the garage at the end by the station to try to get seme tickets.

Whilst he was gone the crowd seemed to get bigger and it began to

spill out onto the road.

About this time a Police Land Rover pulled up right by the shop.

There was just one Police Officer in it and he stood on the ledge of

the door with the door open and started to shout through a loud hailer
LACKEY                  DAVID   ANTHONY                                        ;


to the Police on horses to 'Make a line across the gates.'

He kept shouting it over and over, but no one seemed to take any

notice, then he started to get angry.

I don't know whether they didn't hear him or what but they didn't do

anything.     It wasn't as if he was too far away from them.     I think the

Policeman shouting directions was a Senior one because he had braiding

or something on his cap.

I don't know what happened to him then because               came back to

where I was and had said that the gate had been opened.        So we both

thought we would go and get in.               still hadn't found us any

tickets.      We got down off the wall and went across the road past the

Policeman and joined the crowd.     We walked through the railings and

into the area in front of the terraces.        This area was busy but not as

much as it had been before.     There still weren't any queues at the

turnstiles. At this point            and myself split up and I headed for

a gate.     I followed the crowd basically.    The next thing I knew I was

at a large gate by the side which was open, so I went through the gate.

There were lots and lots of people all going through the gate with me

and none of us showed any tickets.        I didn't see any Policemen or

stewards on duty at the gate either outside or inside.       No one was

trying to close the gate. I was absolutely amazed the gate was open.

As soon as I was through the gate immediately in front of me I saw

the tunnel.    I noticed there was a couple of Policemen and two

stewards, I think, at the tunnel entrance. Everyone was walking past

them.    They weren't making any efforts to stop people going down the

tunnel. This must have been at about just before 3 pm (1500) when I

got to the tunnel.

I didn't really hang around in the yard area after going through the

gate.    I just went straight towards the tunnel but I didn't see any
LACKEY                  DAVID   ANTHONY                                       4


fighting or drunkenness and I didn't see anyone drinking alcohol.        It

still looted and felt like a normal Semi Final match.

As I got into the tunnel I felt it was more packed, but although it

was full the crowd was moving.     You had to go with the crowd though

and I was soon out into the terrace. At the end of the tunnel I went

into the right hand pen.     It felt packed, but I didn't realise it was

soon to get worse.     I went into the terrace and about three or four

steps down, I thought I would watch the match from there.     The goal

was slightly to my left and I would have got a good view. By this time

the players were out on the pitch wanning u p .

When I first got into the terrace I had enough space around me and was

fine.    Gradually I felt myself being pushed further forward by the

crowd behind me.     Then it must have been about kick off time, 3 pm

(1500), when there was a surge forward very fast and I found myself

right forward, about six foot from the front fence onto the

pitch. I had also been pushed across a bit, as I was more or less in

between a gate in the front fence and the right hand goal post.     I

must have gone down the gap in between the crash barriers because

there was nothing in my path all the way to the front.

When we stopped it was absolutely packed, my right aim was pinned to

my side but my left aim was up.     All I could move was my head.

I expected the crowd to move backwards as it usually does if there's a

surge forward, but it didn't it just stayed as packed.     That's when I

wanted to get out.

At the back everyone was singing, and at the front people were

shouting for help and to stop the match.

Although I was only about six feet from the front there seemed loads

of people in front of me, between me and the fence.

I knew they were having problems because I was myself.     I could hardly
LACKEY                 DAVID   ANTHONY                                         5


breathe in, there wasn't enough room.

It seemed like ages before anything happened, then I saw a lad getting

through the gate at the front, but to my horror a policeman pushed him

back into the terraces.     People were shouting all around me.   There

was a lad next to me on my left.     I said, "We're going to die here",

and he replied, "Yes, I know."

There was a middle aged man in front of me who was turned to the right

so I could see his face.     He was saying something about his son,

over and over.   I didn't know what to say.    I said, "Drag him up."

He said he couldn't.     I didn't know what to say, he was very upset.

I shouted through the railings to the police that people were dying in

there, but they took no notice.     Everyone was shouting it to them.

I didn't say anything else because it was just getting harder to

breathe.

The man in front of me who I mentioned earlier, his face was going

yellow, then his head slumped forward and I knew he was dead.        I don't

know how, just the way he was, his face.

I would describe him as being about 30 to 40 years old.     He had dark

shortish hair with a moustache.     He was quite tall, about six foot I'd

say.   It's hard to judge because he was on a lower step than me.      He

was a well built chap.     I have since recognised a picture of him in

the Liverpool Echo on the Monday 17th April 1989 (170489), after the

incident.   I recognised it was him.

In amongst the crowd as I looked around I could see lots of people who

I thought were dead.     Their heads were slumped forward and the colour

of their faces was a yellow and blue colour.     I don't know what

happened to that man I didn't see him again until when I opened the

paper the few days afterwards.     I think he was there by me, but I

thought I was going to die myself so my attention was elsewhere.
LACKEY                 DAVID    ANTHONY


I just didn't look.    From the newspaper I found out the mans name was

Thomas HOWARD from Runcorn.

The crowd was still just as tightly packed and there were about four

Police Officers shouting for everyone to move back.      They were

standing on the concrete bit of the fence.      Obviously there was

nothing we could do, the people at the back didn't realise what was

happening.

A few Police climbed on top of the fence when they realised what was

happening and began pulling people out, but because it was so packed

it was hard.

Eventually after what seemed like ages, I saw the gate to my right

open, there were police by it trying to pull people out and everyone

was just climbing out.    The crowd was so tightly packed that people

from behind were walking over the crowd to the front to get out the

gate.

One lad had his knee or arm on my shoulder trying to get up and

towards the fence.    I had to push him off me because I was going down.

I knew if I fell I wouldn't be able to get up again.

Later I saw           in the next pen to my left. He was climbing over

the fence onto the pitch.      I shouted to him for help but it was no

good.

Gradually we started to get more room and the crowd swayed to the left

and lots of people fell over, I turned around and there was a lad

behind me who had fallen too.     Some lads grabbed him and as he got up

he grabbed me to help me to my feet and pulled me backwards out of it.

There was loads of room behind me and I moved back, that's when I saw

so many people just dead on the floor all around me, that's why we

kept falling over, we were falling over than.

I just switched my mind off at that point and kept telling myself not
        LACKEY                  DAVID       ANTHONY                                        7


        to look around but to keep going.             I headed back towards the tunnel

        and went back through the way I had cane.            My head was banging as

        if it were about to explode and I was shaking as though I was going to

        collapse.     I walked round for a bit then sat down.         Then I went into a

        nearby shop and the man there gave me a drink and a tablet.             I then

        went to look for             and eventually I found him.

        At the match I was wearing blue jeans and trainers and a green

        sweatshirt thing.     I have got black hair and am about 5'11 tall.

        Throughout it all I got slightly injured, I had bruising to my ribs

        and chest plus under my arms and the back of my legs was bruised too.



        One thing I would like to add is that it could have been prevented if

        there had been proper controls and organisation outside the ground

        before the match.     The FA could have put more thought into the end we

        were given.     We have got far more supporters than Notts Forest.

           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I went to the Semi Final at

        Hillsborough Football Ground Sheffield.     When we first got there, we

           sat on the bridge by the Leppings Lane Entrance.

        My mate                  was with me.

        We eventually got into the ground, when I think it was Gate     'C '   was

        opened.    We went through the tunnel and then got separated, but I got

           into Pen 3 and stood near the back because of the people crushing in

        behind me.     I quickly got pushed to about six feet from the front at

        the perimeter fence.

        The crush around me was so great I just could not move anything other

        than my head and eyes.     This was just before the match started.

        Everyone around me and myself started to shout and scream at the

        Policeman Who was standing on the pitch side of Gate 3 facing towards

        us.

        We screamed for him to open the gate, but he just took no notice of

        us, when it was obvious people were already dead, and he could see

        this. Eventually the gate opened and a lad went to go through but the

        Policeman pushed him back into the crowd.




                                                                                     8

        I thought that was our last chance and thought I was going to die

        because I could not get my breath.

        I said to the lad next to me "We are going to die here" and he replied

        "I know we are", I could see a number of people in front of me already

        dead.

        A number of Policemen then arrived and started shouting and waving for

        us to get back, but we just could rot move.

        I wish to complain about the Police Officer on Gate 3.   He should have

        opened the gate when we asked him because it would have definately

        saved the life of seme supporters if he had have done so.   It seemed

        ages before he opened it and then he pushed the one lad back into the

        crowd.

        I received injuries to my ribs arms and legs and was bruised all over

        my body

    DATED: 010589                                                     S HENDRY (SIGNED)



               I reside at the above address together with my parents.

               I have been a Liverpool supporter for all of my life.      I am not a

            season ticket holder but attend all of the heme games and as I work

            every other Saturday only attend away Cup games.

            For the Liverpool - Forest game at Hillsborough I obtained my ticket

            a 6 pound standing ticket for the Leppings Lane entrance from a friend

            who had a spare voucher.         I don't know his name but he is a friend of

                          who I went to the match with.

            I travelled to Hillsborough in a private car together with

            of                        Huyton, Liverpool and                 I don't know

            there surnames or address's but            drove.   We left between 11.30

               (1130) and quarter to 12 (1145) and followed a Police route from one

            of the programmes along the M62, through Huddersfield and onto

            Sheffield. We didnt stop at all en route, but we were stopped by a

            Police Officer directing traffic in Sheffield for about 5 minutes

            before we got to the ground.

            We parked the car in Browning Rd at about 2.30pm (1430) and walked to

            the ground.       We walked down Halifax Rd and I saw about six Police




                                                                                           10
HENDRY                STEPHEN   PAUL


Officers in pairs at various places down the road just standing about

and not apparantly doing anything.      I saw numerous fans with the odd

bottle of alcohol but none of than were drunk.      When we got to

leppings Lane, there was just a mass of people and in the mass I

could see four mounted Police officers because of the amount of

people it was difficult to see their horses.                     had

tickets for the West Stand and North Stand respectively, and went off

to there respective seats leaving me and          [to find our way into

the standing area.   We intending to go to turnstiles 'B' but couldn't

get near it and found outselves outside the turnstiles for the West

Stand seating area, we managed to force our way out of this area and

through one of the open main gates and into the Leppings Lane

standing area turnstiles at Gate B this was      about 20 to 3 (1440). I

saw a lad being helped up onto the dividing wall between the standing

and seating turnstiles and into the ground by a Policeman.      The

mounted officers were moving about slowly in the crowd then swinging

them round causing people to panic about being trampled on.      There

were 2 outside the main gates and 2 in the fans waiting at the

turnstiles for the terraces.    We eventually after a lot of crushing

and pushing manage to get through the turnstile and into the ground

the ticket man took my ticket from me at the turnstile and gave me

back the stub which I still have.      Upon entering the ground I saw no

Police or stewards directing us or anything like that, we weren't

even searched.

Inside      went to the toilet and I waited outside there were plenty

of people about but not crushed or anything as I was able to bend

down and do nry shoe lace up, with no trouble at all.          came out

of the toilet and we walked down the tunnel together.     We were able

to walk through quite easily and found ourselves in Pen 3 near the
HENDRY                  STEPHEN   PAUL


back, it was quite packed then at about 5 to 3ish (1455) so we

thought we'd try to move down a bit out of the back, and before we

could move we were caught in a huge surge from behind us and I just

saw the Forest team caning out onto the pitch.     As I was being pushed

down to the front of the Pen, the crowd was so strong it turned me

round so I was facing away from the pitch.     I couldn't see anything

except a mass of people and I manage somehow to grab hold of my mate

     and we both turned back to face the pitch.     I had my wallet in

nry inside chest pocket and as I went to make sure I hadn't lost it

another surge pushed me onto a chap in front and I was crushed from

all sides, I was totally unable to move in any direction except for

being carried with the crowd, in these waves and surges that were and

had occurred.   The man in front of me had long hair and a cigarette

on, and I remember trying to keep out of the way of his cigarette by

moving my head so he didn't burn it, he dropped the cigarette and

then I was pushed closer into his hair and was unable to breathe, my

mates elbow was stuck in my ribs and I was totally unable to get my

arms out to do anything.     I began to scream and panic and I thought I

was going to die.     I know that the teams were out and playing and had

kicked off because although I personally couldn't move I was being

jostled by the mass and every now and then I caught a gliitpse of the

pitch and the players.     All of a sudden I heard a roar go up as if

Liverpool had scored then it died down as if we'd missed, I later

found out it was a shot deflected off the bar, as this roar went up I

was pushed further towards the front by another surge and still being

crushed against sane different people.          was still with me I

could see him, and the sweat was pouring off him, I'd see him take a

breath then this head would flop down and then he'd lift it loosely

for another breath.    I could just touch him but was unable to reach
HENDRY                STEPHEN   PAUL


because my arms were stuck against me.    I started screaming and

shouting "I can't breathe" and my attention focused on the gate at

the front of the terrace, the air was really thick around me and if I

could have got air it would have been like nothing to help me at all

it was awful.

I just couldn't breathe and it was so hot I just broke out in a

terrible panic and the more I panicked the less I could breathe, I

was still being pushed towards the front and I could see seme lads

getting over the front fence onto the pitch.    One lad straddled the

fence on one rail and leant in to help people out of Pen 3, he

managed to get a few out by grabbing their hands but a lot couldn't

lift their arms up for him to reach them so he began shouting then

screaming 'Push back Push back'. We shouted screaming at the

Policeman at the front of the fence 'open the gate' 'let us out'.

The Policeman did nothing except shout at the crowd 'push back' I

thought he could have opened it to let us out but he didn't, he did

nothing.   I saw a few more fans get over the fence and also saw that

play on the pitch was still going on and that it was now at Leppings

Lane end of the pitch.   We were still screaming at the Bobby to open

the gate and he still screamed push back, I saw one lad get over the

fence and the Policeman grabbed hold of him by his collar and his

belt and threw him back into Pen 3.    The crushing then was still

getting worse and then my hearing began to fade.    I could still hear

but not very well.   I still saw people getting over the fence but was

unable to move myself.   I got pushed towards a barrier which was

about two thirds of the way down Pen 3 and close to Pen 2 I could see

lying on the floor three or four lads with their eyes wide open and

bulging, their faces were purple and very dark under the eyes, there

bodies were contorted and there heads pointing up towards the
HENDRY                   STEPHEN   PAUL


crowds.    I didn't see any of them move.    I don't know if they were

dead or not.      One of them I'm sure must have been, because he was

lying on the steps and his face was looking down onto the steps.         I

saw several people walking on him not on purpose but because we were

still being crushed and pushed, this man wasn't screaming or crying

out at all.    The gap that had opened around these lads on the floor

just as suddenly as it had opened closed again, but during this short

time I was able to breathe again, I had lost my friend          and

again was crushed by the crowd I didn't see the lads on the floor

again.    I wanted to help those lads but I couldn't move my arms to

them at all.    I don't know if the players were still playing now but

I was still being crushed and pushed sideways towards Pen 2.        I was

still near to the barrier where I saw the dead lads.     I looked

towards the gate again and it still wasn't open the Policeman was

still standing there and across the pitch I could see more officers

ccming towards us, I don't know if they were rushing I could only

make out the uniform.     I saw the other end of the barrier coming

towards me and I managed to get my left leg onto the top of the

barrier, I was helped by someone I don't know who to get up onto the

barrier and onto the dividing fence of Pens 2 and 3.     I remember my

left shoe was half off my foot and my lace got trapped around a fence

spike, the people in Pen 2 shouted 'Jump, we'll catch you' and I sort

of stumbled and fell into Pen 2, and I was in a total daze.

I saw a gate open in Pen 2 with a load of Police around it.     They

were dragging people out.     So I made my way towards it, I got to it

and saw two lines of fans passing what appeared to be dead or

unconcious bodies out of Pen 3 near to the front of Pen 2 and out

onto the pitch.

I remember seeing an old man of about 60, he had grey hair, receding
HENDRY                  STEPHEN   PAUL


at the front and swept back, he was about 5'4 tall plumpish wearing a

brown coat dark trousers I believe they were black, I couldn't see

what he had on under his coat.      I can't remember anything else except

waking up lying on the pitch, so I must have passed out.     The St.

Johns Ambulance woman was standing over me with her hands on my chest

and I woke up with a jolt.     I said to her 'What are you doing' and

the Policeman who was standing nearby said 'Stay there, you've been

through a lot, just lie down.' So I stayed there and lay on my side

to get seme air into my lungs.     As I turned over I saw a young lad

lying on the grass, he was about 8 or 9 years old, a Policeman was

checking his pulse and pumping his chest, but I could see the kids

eyes were shut and his face was a pale bluish colour and then they

stopped and I had to turn away.     I can't describe him at all, I only

saw his face and know he was really young.     The St. Johns lady gave

me a drink of water and told me to stay where I was and she'd come

back later.     I stood up in a total daze and went dizzy, I saw a mass

of red and white and made towards it.     I found myself in the Forest

fans in the 1st block of the south stand.     They gave me a drink and I

stayed with them.     I didn't look back to the Pens at all while I was

in the seats.     I was far too upset and still trying to breathe

properly.     I eventually moved and made my way back across the pitch

towards the Liverpool fans, I was also worried about what had

happened to         |i looked for his green shirt amongst all the

injured and couldn't find him.     I saw someone with an oxygen

cylinder, I think it was either a policeman or fireman.     I saw them

put the mask on the man on the ground and turn the cylinder on then

they kind of panicked threw the cylinder away and carried on doing

mouth to mouth.     I looked away and walked towards Pens 6 and 7 where

I saw         in the West Stand, he saw me and I managed to get up to




                                                                            15
HENDRY                 STEPHEN   PAUL                                       '


him eventually.    We stayed there for a bit and looked onto the Pitch I

saw a solid line of Policemen across the centre of the pitch.       This

line opened up everytime someone was taken through.      We left

then and went to try to find            Leaving the ground we made our

way back to the car.

I would like to go back now to the people who were lying under the

barrier.   I would describe (1) as being medium build wearing a red

and white Rugby type top, I couldn't see what else he was wearing.

He had light brown slightly curly hair, collar length, he had blue

coloured eyes and was cleanshaven.      I think he was about 19 to 20 yrs

old.   (2) on the right of the barrier he had a red and white rugby

top on it was red at the top and white at the bottom he was lying

partly on his side so I couldn't see his face very well, but he had

dark brown hair like mine.    Prior to the game I had seen a friend of

mine Steve ROBINSON of                                 Liverpool, he was

wearing a top identical to the one this youth was wearing and he had

short dark hair like mine and I thought it might have been him but I

can't be sure.    Steve died during the incident at Hillsborough.

As for describing the other two who were under the barrier I'm afraid

I can't remember them.

I would like to say that if the Police man had opened the gate at the

begining of the crush, I don't think that there would have been so

many deaths also if there had been any stewards directing people to

the different areas. For a game that big and for the amount of

supporters that Liverpool have there were hardly any police to handle

the situation and I think this is totally wrong.

DATED: 101089                                                S. HENDRY (SIGNED)



        On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I went to the Semi Final between

        Liverpool and Nottingham Forest held at Hillsborough Football Ground.

        I have previously made a statement to the West Midlands Police on

        what occurred at the match.

        I wish to complain about the Police as follows.

        1.      I was standing in Pen 3 when a huge crush camefrom   behind, the

        teams had not come onto the pitch at this time.     I started to panic

        because I was getting crushed and could not breath properly.      Together

        with others I started screaming at the Policeman who was standing

        facing us at Gate 3 to "Open the gate let us out"

        He just treated us with total complacency by waving his arms and

        shouting Push back push back.    We could not move and continued to

        scream at him to open the gate, but he would not do so.

        2.    Seme supporters then started to climb over the perimeter fence

        and I saw one had reach the top and got half over.

        This Policeman from Gate 3 then went towards him, grabbed the lad by

        his collar and belt and pushed him back over the fence into Pen 3.

        I could not see if the lad had been injured in any way.      The crowd got




                                                                                     18
        HENDRY                 STEPHEN    PAUL                                   2


        really angry at this and I thought he should have helped the lad

        instead of pushing him back.

        After that I passed out and cannot remember much more what happened.

        I would describe the Policeman at Gate 3, as a fairly young officer

        clean shaven and possibly fair hair.     He was the only officer I had

        seen prior to these incidents in the area of Gate 3.

  In accordance with the requirements of Regulation 7 of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985, I hereby inform you of
                    COMPLAINT                                                                                 which has been made against you.

  N A T U R E OF         COMPLAINT


      On Saturday, 15 April 1989, at Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield, a
      disaster occurred in which 95 people died.

      David Anthony LACKLEY, of                               Liverpool, was present
      at the football game and says he was a spectator on the West Terraces in the
      enclosed area sometimes known as Pen 3. He has made the following allegations;

       (1)      The Police Officer standing on the pitch side of Gate 3, facing the
                crowd should have opened the gate when asked because it would have
                saved the life of some supporters.

      (2)       When the Police Officer did open it he pushed one lad back into the
                crowd.

      Enquiries made suggest you may be the Police Officer, Mr LACKLEY is
      complaining about.

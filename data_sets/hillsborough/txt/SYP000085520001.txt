                  at a p p r o x i m a t e l y    3 pm    (1500 hrs).



                  At about         3.08     pm    (1508 hrs)        we were     informed         by a senior           officer      that

                  our a s s i s t a n c e     was    u r g ently    required at       the      semi-final         at

                  H i l l sborough.           Upo n my arrival         at the       ground      I was      d i r ected     to stand

                  on the edge          of the        pitch facing        the suppo r t e r s        in the North Stand.

                  The      supporters         appeared        to be Liverpool         s upporters          who    seemed       very

                  d i s t r e s s e d and angry.           They we r e s hout i ng at           us and      po i nt i.ng t owa r ds

                  t!")e W e s t S t a n d (L e p pings L n ) .



                  We were       then d i r ected         to form a line across                 the middle         of the       pitch.

                  At    this    time all          the   supporters       were    getting agitated,                shouting       and

                  swearing.          I noticed          in the S outh Stand a group of N o t t i n g h a m

                  supporters         began fighting amongst                  themselves.           At     this    time N o t t i n g h a

                  Forest       supp o r t e r s and Liverpool            supp o r t e r s    began shouting at               each

                  other and we            feared a pitch            invasion.        I could see Liverpool                  fans      on

                  the      pitch    infront         of the West Stand.              Some were        lying       down,     some were

                  standing.          I saw Police,            am b u l a n c e and supp o r t e r s       leaning       over    bodies

                  apparently         giving         m o u t h to mouth      resuscitation.



                  As    I ran down to             the West Stand         I saw1bodies            on mak e s h i f t     stret c h e r s

                  being      taken from           the    pitch by Police, a m b u l a n c e         and supporters.

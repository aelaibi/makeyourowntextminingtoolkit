                   As    I am       familiar          with    the    Northern General                  Hospital          in S h e f f i e l d ,    I

                   decided          to m a k e    my way       there          in    case     I could      be      of a s s i s t a n c e    in the

                   event       of    casualties          being       received.




                   Due    to    the     location         of m y      house          I almost        immediately           e n c o u n t e r e d an

                   ambulance,           which         I assume       wa s      on    i t ’s w a y    to   the      ground.           It    had    i t ’s

                   lights       & siren          on,    and    I followed              immediately           behind       it,      w it h my

                   headlights           on.




                   As    it    passed      the H e r r i e s        Rd    entrance,           I turned         off      into      the N o r t h e r n

                   General          Hospital.




                   I entered           the A c c i d e n t    & Emergency               Department           to    be    told      that a

                   Paediatric           "cardiac         arrest"          wa s      expected        (via A m b u l a n c e        Control),        and

                   that       there was          an    incident          of    some     k i n d at     the H i l l s b o r o u g h        Stadium.

                   No    one    in the        department            was       aware     that      these      two     pi e c e s    of

                   information were                   related.

Whilst      I and another           doctor      were      treating        Lee,     the    second      victim

arrived.         He wa s     of    similar      age      (around        12 -    14 y e a r s),    with     blonde

hai r .




These      two   boys    had      taken    up the        space     immediately available                  in the

r e su s c i t a t i o n area,    and     the   n ex t    patient       I dealt       w i t h wa s    in the        A & E

Department        Theatre.




This      patient     was    aged around          tw e n t y ,

                                                                                             I wa s     able      to

                                                         and     left   him     in the     care      of a n o t h e r

doctor,




I next      saw another           unconscious,                                               pat i e n t , with

                                        hair,   and aged around                twenty.       I judged        his

airway      to   be a d e q u a t e ,    and    left     him     in the    care      of a n o n - m e d i c a l

member      of   staff.




The    next      patient     I dealt       with                                                                He      was

aged    around      twenty,



                                                  I was        assisted        by a d o c t o r   of a r o u n d       my

                                                                                              S3192

own age      from    the    football      ground.      I never    discovered    his   name.




I ne x t   saw a     patient      of a r o u n d    forty,




I then was a s k ed         to   see a    boy                                                   who

had already         ha d   resuscitative           treatment.    __________________________________




I believe         he has    since    made    a good     recovery.




I was      then    briefly       involved with a male




                                                                                         I believe

resuscitative          measures      on   this      patient   were   abandoned.

                   I later       dealt with a                        patient       who   came     into    the A & E d e p a r t m e n t

                   having       "arrested".                  was     not    from    the H i l l s b o r o u g h    ground             was

                   disaster.

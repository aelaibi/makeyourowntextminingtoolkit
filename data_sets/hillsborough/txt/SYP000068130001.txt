      the     ground            I saw a few P o l i c e m a n              in    the   street         some    standing and           som*

      with        supporters              going     towards          the entrance.              We went        first       to the

       ,urnstiles marked                       1-16 on the map.                 There were           no orde r l y queues            there

      just a           crowd       packed together.                   I c o u l d n ’t see m u c h with              the    crowd      but

      were marked                for      the    stands.

      We     got out          of that           crush and joined anot h e r                    crowd of s u p p o r t e r s         going

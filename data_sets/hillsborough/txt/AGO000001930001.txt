              Thank you for your l e t t e r of 5 February 1990 with its enclosures which I have
              shown to the A ttorne y G eneral. The A ttorne y is c o n te n t with the nomination of
              Mr Riddle as an am icus in this case.


              I think it would be b e s t if Mr Riddle's instructions w ere to come from the
              Treasury Solicitor and I am th e re fo re w riting to him to send him the papers you
              have enclosed.

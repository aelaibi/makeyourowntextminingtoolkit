3.    Actions of crews on arrival.

3.1   Rivelin WrT - StnO Swain in Charge

      Attended the Leppings Lane side of ground and encountered severe
      congestion that prevented immediate access to the ground.

      An immediate request for the use of a resuscitator on              a   casualty
      in the rear of an ambulance was answered.

      Rivelin 1 was made Contact Point in Leppings Lane for the incident
      with StnO Swain OiC.




                                   1   .
A request for resuscitation equipment inside the ground was
received from a Police Officer. In view of this a "Hake Pumps 10
for resuscitators" message was sent. Crew members were despatched
into the ground in an effort to make contact with Senior Police
Officers, and ascertain the extent of the incident.

Central WrT 1 and 2 - StnO Fletcher and SubO        in Charge

Attended at the Riverside Entrance off Penistone Road at the rear
of the South Stand.      The crews were not met or directed by the
Police so the officers made their way onto the pitch to the area
immediately ' in front of the West Stand where they found many
casualties on the pitch who needed first aid treatment.         No
rescues as such needed to be undertaken but it was obvious that
bodies and casualties needed to be attended to.

The crew members were then directed to perform mouth to mouth
resuscitation and first aid. Two resuscitators were used by the
crews.

A casualty receiving area was set up at the rear of the West Stand
by so directing T/StnO          and casualties were moved from the
pitch to this area by crews, police and spectators.

Approximately 20-30 persons were moved to this area. The obvious
dead being located in a holding area at the rear of the West Stand
and the injured removed by ambulance to         hospital.    Later
information received by StnO Fletcher told him to evacuate
casualties to the Gymnasium at the rear of the North Stand.

The crews of Central 1 and 2 were joined and assisted by those
from Darnall 1 and 2, Ringinglow 1 and the Emergency Tender from
Central.

When the pitch had been cleared of casualties all crews were
directed to the Gymnasium and carried out further assistance.

Central Emergency Tender - LFm Housley in Charge

Attended at Penistone Road but could not gain access to the ground
because of height restriction for the appliance.     Proceeded to
Leppings Lane and the Contact Point.

Stand and onto the pitch with a resuscitator treating casualties
both on the pitch and later in the Gymnasium.

       resuscitator and gave assistance to casualties on the pitch in
       front of the West Terrace together with the crews from Central 1

       directed and gained access to the pitch via the West Terrace
       rendering assistance to casualties with two resuscitators and

       were removed initially to the casualty receiving area which T/StnO
            had been directed to establish at the rear of the West Stand
       and subsequently to the gymnasium.

       On instructions from ADO Robjohns, SubO                   and his crew
       undertook a circuit of the pitch to a s c e r t a i n i f any further

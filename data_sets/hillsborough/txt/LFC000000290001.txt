TO ALL CLUBS


Dear Secretary,

     You will recall that at the last series of Group Meetings I said that we
had undertaken to provide Government with information on how clubs were getting
on with implementing the Taylor Report.

     Since then the Football Trust and the Football Licensing Authority have
said that they, too, need such information and need to know also what plans
clubs have for the future. Rather than have separate questionnaires frcm each
of these for you to fill in, I have agreed to co-ordinate the requests for
information through one questionnaire, which has been agreed with
representatives of Government, the Football Trust and the Football Licensing
Authority.

     I should be obliged, therefore, if you would complete the attached
questionnaire and return it to the above address no later than 31st January,
1991. It is intended to make the information which you supply available to
Government, the Football Trust and the Football Licensing Authority (except the
answer to Question 8, which is for our use only).

     Question 8 refers to seating requirements. Following on frcm the Stadia 90
exhibition, we now need to know how many and what type of seats clubs will
require and over what timescale, so that we can pursue the question of bulk
purchasing. We will only recanmend this to clubs if there is a clear advantage,
but in order to pursue it further we need to know your likely requirements.
There will be no caimitment on you at this stage, but you will appreciate that
we will need a realistic estimate frcm you if we are to negotiate satisfactory
contracts. Only when we can tell you what the terms of those contracts will be,
will we ask you for a firm cannitment.

                                                        Yours* sincerely,




                                                          R. Sand!

           At    some    t ime    around        1500       h o u r s , or       shortly          thereafter,             I was       in       the

           gym w h en     I became         aware        via      radio        traffic:          t hat       some    sort    of      incident

           was    taking        in the      ground.           This        informatio n was                   followed       by

           instruction,           again        over     radio          "all     officers          o n to      the    pi t c h * .        I then

           left    the    gym and         entered          the     playing           area       via     the    access       point         between

           the N o r t h S t a n d       and    the S p i o n          Hop.




           My    first    i m pr e s s i o n was        that       a    pitch        invasion           had    taken       p l ace       and

           believed       that     Officers           at    the        far    end w er e         dealing           with a     lar g e         seals

           leaving       the     field.         The     p o s i t i o n at         the H o p E n d          was     that    the

           Nottingham           supporters         had a p p e a r e d          to    have       had a        similar       impression

           and    there were            signs    of     unrest.

           apparent       what      the     situation            was      and      fans     began           bringing       surviving

           spectators           from     the    far     end.




           I aided       two     persons        and     then       assisted           in the          carriage        of    one      other

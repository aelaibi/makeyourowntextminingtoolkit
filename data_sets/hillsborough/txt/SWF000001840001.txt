                         Instructions for.Match Day Staff


Any continued disregard for the regulations in this schedule could lead to the
withdrawal of your pass.

Smoking is not permitted by any member of our Match Day Staff whilst on duty.

Please remember that you are paid to help the spectator enjoy a game of
football.

I.D. passes should be worn, and should be clearly visible, at all times whilst
on duty.

Match Day Staff are not to become involved with crown misbehaviour. This is a
matter for the Police - AND THE POLICE ONLY. Their assistance must be sought
on all such occasions and Match Day Staffare required solely to identify
persons who are breaking, or are likely to break, ground regulations. If
Police assistance is refused, take a note of the officer's number and report
immediately to the Chief Steward or his deputy. DO NOT GET INVOLVED.

Stewards do not have a responsibility for maintaining public order but should
be prepared to identify persons to police Officers who are either creating a
disturbance or whose presence is likely to create a disturbance - this covers
a wide range of activities contrary to ground regulations.

Please report to the Security Officer any damage or defect likely to cause
injury or danger to persons in attendance.

In the event of an emergency or incident the Senior Police Officer present
will take command.


GATEMEN AND TURNSTILE OPERATORS

1.   Gatemen and Turnstile Operators should report for duty no later than 2
     hours before kick-off, or ear-
                                  1ior if adviocd. Anyone reporting after the
     stated time cannot be guaranteed a job.

2.   All exit gates should be manned at all times. If any gate is left
     unmanned at all, the entire staff covering the gate will be instantly
     dismissed.

3.   Turnstile Operators on cash turnstiles will be given a cash float and
     batch of tickets. Full details of the banking procedure will be given at
     the induction meeting before the start of the season, and this procedure
     should be followed at all times.. All cash banked should be counted and
     placed in the correct bags. Continual disregard of these procedures will
     result in dismissal.

     The float, and unsold tickets, should be returned to the Turnstile Office
     together with banking details.

4.   Turnstile Operators on ticket only stiles should firstly check that the
     ticket they are accepting is a) for the correct match, and, b) for the
     correct area of the ground. The tickets should be sorted between season
     ticket vouchers, match tickets and (where applicable) shareholders
     vouchers etc.

5.   Any season ticket holder who has forgotten or lost their ticket should be
     directed to the General Office.

6.   Any season ticket holder not presenting the correct numbered voucher
Stewards must wear their official waistcoat on duty at all times.   This
will be allocated when you report for duty.

Stewards must report for duty no later than 2 hours before kick-off time.
Any steward reporting for duty after this time cannot be guaranteed a
job. This provision may be subject to amendment in the event of major
fixtures when prior notice will be given.

Whilst every effort will be made to allocate you the same job throughout
the season, you must carry out any alternative duty as directed by the
Chief Steward, or his deputy or an official of the club.

Stewards are reminded that they should remain on duty until the final
whistle and until their area is clear. The practice of stewards leaving
their positions before the final whistle will not be tolerated. Except in
an emergency. Stewards should not leave their place of duty without
consent of the Chief Steward or Senior police Officer who should, if it is
considered necessary, arrange for a replacement. At the end of the match,
when your area is clear, you should report back to your Chief Steward to
hand in your official waistcoat and receive your wages.

STEWARDS WORKING IN STAND

Stewards are responsible for ensuring spectators sit in correct seats (as
shown on tickets) where this is not the case, they have a responsibility
in the first instance for requesting them to do so, and only if there is a
refusal should they contact the police for assistance. Stewards are also
responsible for ensuring that gangways and exits are kept clear.

Stewards should prevent, as far as possible, standing on seats, and the
climbing of fences and other structures. It stewards are unable to comply
with this request due to the severity of the incident, they should report
the matter without delay to the nearest police Officer.

Where more than one steward is on duty at the same gangway, one steward is
to remain at the bottom of the steps until at least 10 minutes after
kick-off, or until any 'rush' is over, to ensure that the spectator uses
the correct gangway and remove any ticket stubs.

No gangway steward is to sit down until at least 15 minutes after
kick-off, and then only if there is a vacant seat on the end of a row in
the immediate vicinity of the gangway - all other stewards must sit as
close to their allocated position as possible at the end of a row. No
more than two stewards may sit together.

In the period leading up to half-time and at the end of the match it is
imperative that no one stands in the gangways watching the match.

Be aware of the location of fire fighting and medical equipment in the
area for which they are reponsible and being capable of effectively
operating the same. Familiarise yourself with all aspects of the Ground
Regulations.
EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURE

All Match Day Staff must be aware of the following procedure:

In the event of an emergency situation arising in the ground (ie. fire or bomb
call) which require evacuation of all or part of the ground, the following
procedure will be followed

    a) Police control Room will pass the following message "The attendance of
    Mr. Meadows is urgently required at police Control". This will be over
    the P.A. System and will indicate to police Officers and Stewards that
    emergency evacuation procedures are in force. Stewards will take up
    positions at their exits and gates, and the gates will be opened.

    b) in the event of an emergency evacuation being necessary, an oral
    message will be passed by the Police Officer in charge giving specific
    instructions as to action to be taken by the public.

    c) In the event of an all clear situation the following message will be
    passed "Mr. Meadows is no longer required at police Control".

Be on the alert to recognise potential fire hazards and suspect packages.
Such findings to be reported to the nearest Police Officer or in his absence
the Chief Steward or designated Club Official.

       Jk
        Before the s ta r t of next season I want you to arrange a Seminar for
stewards and programme sellers so th at they can be informed exactly of their
duties.

        It is important th a t you draw up a list of stewards and their
respective duties, and similarly with programme sellers. In the case of
programme sellers they must be instructed th a t this job is a selling job and
they must go out to our supporters to sell and make some vocal contribution to
it. They must be strategically placed and their perform ance monitored.

           Many of the above requirements apply also to stewards.

         Do you think it would be rewarding if other people such as our
turnstile operators were also properly instructed along these lines?

Could you please make the necessary arrangementsto organise an instructional
evening for turnstile o^rators and stewards similar to lastyear.

The response fron both the Police and Fire Services to that event was very
good and highlights the desire of S.W.F.C. to endeavour to provide a good
service and professional attitude towards their responsibilities.

V/e discussed such an event before the end of last season and it nay be prudent
for you to liaise with Basil Jones (Tel.K'o.£l<*>64 Home, 376501 -fork) and the
Riverside Suite as to the most suitable date.

Please retain a close liaison with Sharon and/or     myself re this event.

1.    Stewards.      The practice of organising an instructional evening involving
                     D.Lock, Fire, Police and part time personnel was established
                     last year. During the latter part of H5/n6 D.Lock and myself
                     discussed the repeat of same for this close Beeson and he
                     has it in hand to organise. As and when final arrangements
                     have been mede I will confirm.

      Sellers.       our 'phone conversation I have forwarded a copy of your letter

TO:   ALL MATCH DAY PERSONNEL       FROM:                             DATE:   7.5.87



One again I am writing to you all to thank you for your assistance during the
past season, in particular all those who made the semi-final the success it
was.

The season has not gone by without any "casualties" - persons dismissed for
various reasons - and Club policy for next season will continue to be strictly
upheld.

It is intended to make a few alterations with regards to various aspects of
the ground and to fully explain them and to do the usual briefing of match day
staff, the following nights have been arranged:-

Gatemen                         )
Turnstile operators             )           6th August at 7.30 p.m.
Commissionaires                 )
"sundry area" stewards          )
                                and

All other Stewards                          13th August at 7.30 p.m.

As before the briefing will be followed by a pie and pea supper and we would
like everyone to attend.

The stewards/gatemen passes for next season will be the same as last year but,
in addition, everyone will be issued with a security badge with a photo, which
must be worn at all times when on duty. An extra 50p is being paid to
everyone at next Saturday's game - would you please bring 2 photo's (from a
photo booth) with you to the briefing meeting.
MEETINGS OF STEWARDS, GATEMEN AND ANCILLIARY STAFF TOOK PLACE ON THURSDAY 6TH
AUGUST AND THURSDAY 13TH AUGUST 1987, BOTH MEETINGS COMMENCED AT 7.30 P.M.


Members of staff were welcomed by Company Secretary, G.H. Mackrell who
introduced:

    i)   Station Officer Miles - South Yorkshire Fire Brigade
   ii)    Inspector C. Calvert - South Yorkshire Police
  iii)   Duty Officer - Peter Wells, St. John Ambulance Brigade


Station Officer Miles: Showed staff present how to extinguish a small fire
using the relevant fire extinguishers. A practical demonstration took place.
Emphasis was placed on the point that stewards, gatemen etc. should only tackle
a minor fire, if in any doubt the Fire Brigade should be alerted at once.

Inspector Calvert: Went through the duties of stewards vis-a-vis members of the
general public. The emergency evacuation procedure was discussed and examined
in detail. Inspector Calvert answered questions from the floor regarding the
responsibility of stewards in the event of crowd misbehaviour. It was
emphasised that crowd control was the responsibility of the police. In addition
it was pointed out that the division of responsibilities was clearly set out in
the instructions for Matchday Staff.

Duty Officer Wells: Gave a demonstration of basic first aid designed to assist
in the resucitation of spectators. It was emphasised that if at all possible
trained members of the S.J.A.B. should be called to assist.

Doug Lock: Went through "instructions to Matchday Staff" and emphasised the
need to report for duty on time.


Graham Mackrell then closed the formal part of the meeting and thanked all those
present for attending.

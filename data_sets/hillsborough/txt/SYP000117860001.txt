                  On    this       date     I    commenced            duty       at    Hammerton          Road      Police           Station             at

                  9.00am       (0900).             I travelled              to    the       ground       where       1 attended                the       briefing

                  at    10.00am          (1000)»           I was       allocated             serial       3    which       was       the       South

                  Stand,       upper        level         and    turnstiles.                 I had       11    other       officers             to

                  assist       me     with       this      serial       and       I    believe          those       officers             were       as

                  foll o w s ; - -

                  PS    2759       Turner,        PCs      70    Whiteley,             1977       F a r t h i n g , 1364           Collier,          60

                  591    Tune,        1949       Storey         and    2817       Hudson,          all    from       F1.

                  The    South        stand       had      been       allocated             to    the    Nottingham                Forest       fans.

                  The    officer           to    whom      1 was       responsible                was    Inspector             Darling,             F1»

                  Prior       to     the    turnstiles            opening             my    serial       did    a    security             check          of    the

                  seating          area     of     the     upper       level          of    the    South       Stand.              When       the

                  turnstiles             opened        the      PCs    were       deputed          to    the    searching                of    fans

                  entering           the    s^tand w h i l s t         PS    Turner          and     myself         patrolled             the       sriack

                  bars       and     betting        booth.

                  About       2.50pm        (1450)         I heard          traffic          over       the    radio       that          large       numbers

                  of    farts w e r e       at     the     Leppings          Lane          end    and    trying       to       get       into       the

                  ground.            About       the      same    time       I heard             some    mention          on       the    radio          that    a

                  gate       had     been       broken.          Up    to    this          time     I had      periodically                   checked          the
seating          area       and       I was          amazed          at    the       apparent           slowness               of    the

Liverpool             fans       to       take       their          seats       in    the       North       and       West          stands             and

on    the    Leppings             Lane          terraces.                 By    about          S.50pm       (1450)             the       seats          and

terraces          were          beginning                to    fill       up    quickly          all       except          the       wings             of

the    Leppings             Lane          terraces             in w h i c h      there          was     still         plenty             of       room.

I think          it    was       before             the       players          took       to    the     field         that          I heard             a

request          over       the       radio          for       the    start          to    be    delayed.                 It    was          suggested

this     would         have       a       calming             effect       on    the       fans       outside             the       Leppings

Lane     end,         knowing             they       would          not    miss       any       of    the       game.           I gathered

from     the      transmission*                      that       a    large       number          of     fans         had       turned             up

suddenly,             swelling                the    already          large          numbers.              There          was       mention             over

the    radio          of    the       fans          outside          the       Leppings          Lane       end       'pressing                   forward*.

Around       the       start          of       the       game       I was       hearing          calls          over       the       radio             from

Superintendent                   Marshall                for    a    gate       at    the       rear       of       the    West          stand

terraces          to       be    opened             to    ease       the       pressure          outside.                 This       request                was

repeated          several             times.              Radio       reception                was    not       very       good          due       to       the

noise       of    the       crowd             around          the    officer          and       the     fact         he    was       having             to

shout.           There          was       a    note       of    desperation                and       f <*i gtit      in    Superintendent                         v

M a r s h a l l ’s     voice          and       I heard             him    mention             there       was       going          to       be

serious          injury          if       this       gate       was       not    opened.              The       order          was       then          given

to    open       the       gate.

The    game       was       about             five       minutes          old    when          I was       able       to       get       a    view          of

it    from       one       of    the          gangways          in    the       South          stand.           Play       was       in       the

goalmouth             at    the       Leppings                Lane    end       of    the       ground.              I noticed                a    fan

climb       over       the       high          barrier          which          divides          the     terraces               from          the

playing          area.           I saw          the       crowd       on       the    terraces             surge          forward             a

couple       of       times,          a       sight       which       is       quite       common.              1    could          not,      see

anything          wrong          from          my    position'4nd                dismissed              the         pushing          and          climbing

as    unruly          behaviour                of    the       fans.

! then       saw       a    senior             police          officer          run       onto       the    pitch          and       approach
the    referee.                 The       game        was       stopped          but       I    could          not    see       why       and    still

put    it       down       to    the        behaviour                of    the       fans.           Several          fans       came       over       the

barrier          and       I    saw       one      of      them       run       the       full       length          of    the       pitch       to    the

Kop    end,          Nottingham                 Forest          end,       of    the       ground          and       began       to       taunt       the

fans.           The    fan       was        detained             and       it    was       only          then       did    I    realise

something             was       seriously               wrong.

1. s a w       policemen             helping            fans         over       the       barrier          at       the    Leppings             Lane

end    and       other          beckoning               the      fans       in       the       centre          of    the       terraces          to

move       back.           It    was        obvious             that       fans       at       the       front       were       getting

crushed          and       I saw          some        of     them         apparently                unconscious                and    being

treated          on    the       pitch.

During          this       time       there           were       many       radio          'transmissions- a n d                     there       was

mention          of    fans          dying        and        getting            more       officers             to    the       Leppings             Lane

end    of       the    ground.

1    rounded          up       the    remaining                 officers             of    my       serial,          two       were       involved

with       a    prisoner             and        two     were         on    meal,          and       when       the    chance          came       I    used

my    radio.           I       informed            ground            control          that          the    Nottingham                fans       in    the

South          Stands          were       calm        and       orderly          and       asked          if    I should             take       my

serial          onto       the       pitch.             This         was    confirmed                and       on    we    went.

Once       on    the       pitch          and     at       the       Leppings             Lane       end       it    was       impossible             to

remain          together             as     a     group         as    there          were       many       people          lying          about

injured.              I made          my        way     to      near       to    the       touch          line,       ignoring             the

people          who    were          sitting            or      did       not    appear             to    be    in a n y        danger,          and

went       to    two       males          # 1 0   were          unconscious.                    I first             gave       mouth       to    mouth

resuscitation                   to    the         elder         one       who    I    could          only       describe             as    heavy

build          and    about          50     years          old.           I don't          know          how    long       I    continued             with

this       man       but       there        was       no     response.                Whilst             trying       to       resuscitate

this       man       I was       kicked            on      my    righ4          thigh          by    a    Liverpool             fan       who

shouted          at    me       "You        fucking             murderer."

I went          to    t h e 'next           man,        about         20    years,             wearing          a    bright          green       short

assisted             at    this          time       by    a woman             who    said       she       was        a    nurse          who      gave

heart       massage.                 This       continued                for       some       time    until              it       seemed         obvious

the    man       was       dead..

I d o n ’t       know          if    it    was       on       the       radio       or    by    someone              on       the       pitch         but

there       was       some          mention          of       removing             the    bodies.              With           the       help      of

three       or       four       Liverpool                fans       X placed             the    body       of        the          younger         man

onto       an    advertising                board             and       carried          it    off    the           pitch          via     the        South

Stand       to       the       service          road          at    the       south       side       of    the           West       Stand.             It

was    here          several             other       bodies             were       laid       out    and       I put              the    body         of       the

young       man       with          them.

1 returned                to    the       pitch          but       was       almost       immediately                    directed               with       other

officers             to    outside          the          Leppings             Lane       end    of    the          ground           where         I

assisted             in    ensuring             a    free          passage          for       ambulances.                     Numerous

Liverpool             fans          were    leaving                the       ground       by    this       time           and       many         of    them

appeared             to    be       drunk.           Many          of    them,       including             the           sober          ones,         were

very       abusive             towards          the       Police             with    comments             of        being          murderous

bastards,             the       opening             of    a    gate          and    of    not       having           sufficient                  tickets

for    their          greater             number          of       fans.

During          the       incident          I cannot                remember             any    breakdown                 in       radio

transmissions                   but       when       on       the       pitch       I was       probably                 oblivious               to

transmissions                   because             of    the       urgent          task       at    hand.

I went          off       duty       at    7.0       pm       <1900)          the    same       date.

Whilst          on    the       pitch       during             the       early       stages          and       afterwards                  outside

the    Leppings                Lane       end       of    the       ground          I and       other          officers                 were

subjected             to       abu s e , mainly                v e r b a l , from             the    Liverpool                    fans.          Every

one    of       them       seemed          to       agree          with       the    fact       that       they           had       not         been

allocated             the       parts       of       the       ground          which          would       have           afforded               them       a

greater          number             of    tickets.                 This       maybe       so,       but    I believe                    N o t t i nghaffi,

Forest          sold       all       their          allocation                and    could          have           probably;, so Id m o r e .

                 I did    not    hear    any    reports         or    see   any    evidence      of   them    crushing     at

                 turnstiles       to    get    into      the    ground      even    though,      with   the   allocation          of

                 tickets,       they    should      have       been    greater      in    numbers.      The   Nottingham

                 fans    appeared       to    get   to    the    ground      earlier       and   take   their     seats    and

                 placed    on    the    terraces         far    sooner      than    the   Livepool      fans.

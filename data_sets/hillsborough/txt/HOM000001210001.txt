            Hi 1 I s b o r o u g h .

            I support           Liverpool              Football         club         and    I went          to    the       ground       w i t h my

            I didn't           have       a ticket          for      the    match          but    my       freind                 had    a ticket

            for    the        stands.

            I went        in m y       friends          dads      car      to    the       match*

            We w e n t        straight          there       without         stopping,             we       didnt       go    on    the       motorways

            b ut w e      went       on     the    A    roads        and    there          was nt m u c h         of      a delay        getting

            there„

            I got        to    the     ground          at   about       1.15pm              (1315) a n d I s a w             q u i t e a few

            Forrest           end    of     the    grounds.

            When      I arrived             the    ground         there         were       no P o l i c e        escorts          to    or    from     th e

            We    parked        the       car     only      a few H u n d r e d            yards       a w a y in      as id e     street         near

before          less       than       a minute             we s     up.

Thers      were           thousands             of    f a ns      inside        the         ground            behind        the      outer       gates

by t h e        terraces.

There      were           lots       of    fans       still         outside             the       ground        but       not     as m a n y         as

there      were           inside.

When      the        gates       first          opened         by    the       side         of         the    terraces          I dont        know

wether          th e      outer       gates          were      opened          or       not.

There      were           Policemen             on    horses         outside             the           gates    they were              telling

t he    people            outside          to    calm       down and            to       stop           pushing          because        everyone

would      get         in.

I dont          remember             seeing          any     stewards           at       the           ground       or    outside.

At     about         2,55pm          (1455)          the    gates         of    the         side         of    th e      turnstiles           to      the

terraces             were       opened          again        the     outter             gates           were    open.

I waited             at    first          because          I thought            the         inner            gate     was      going     to      c l os e

again       like          the    first          time       bu t     they       didnt           so       I came        off      the     bridge         and

through          the       outer          gates       with        all     the       other              fans.

The Police                on    horseback             started            to s h o u t          to       the    fans       to    g et    b ac k       and

they      lined           the    horses          across           th e    outer          gates           to    the       right       si de    trying

to     keep      the       people          out.

towards              it.

moving           quite             quickly               and        I got             pushed                 towards                    the           r i gh t     of     the       tunnsll

I was           pushed             towards               pen 3              and       down              th e       terraces                          towards         the       gaol

thats           when           I began            to       start             feeling                    a lot              of        pressure                from         the       crowds

at     the       back.                 I wormed               my w a y               forward                 and           I realised                       the      pressure           was

getting              too m u c h              and        I knew              it       was        a waste                    of          time           trying           to go

forward              anymore.

I began              getting                pains          and         I couldnt                        breath                  properly                 and       I managed             to

crouch           down            forward              trying                to       get      my         breath                  but            t h a ts     when         it     got

worse.

Crouching                   down           made       it w o r s e               and        I thought                           I couldnt                   ge t     up    from        t ha t

I started                   feeling              the       pains             in my            chest                again                and          having          trouble

The          people              at           the        back       could,             have         rr*0 v e d        b a c k but         I dont          think          they

k n 9 w what                  was          going           on.

I came               out          of       the          t u n n e l 1 at               about          one       minute              to    three       and       I must             have

been            in     the              crowd           for      about            five             minutes             before            I got      on     top       of       the

c rowd.

I rolled                   down               on        people           towards              the         goal          and s t o p p e d        at       the    fence             and

someone                p u s h e d me                   from       the          back          of       the        crowd and there                     was       a man             on

the          pitch            side            of        the      fence            pulling                me      over.

I wa s              trying               to       get      over          but           the         spikes           in        the    fence       were        catching                  my

clothes.                      One          man          took       the          spikes              out       of m y              trousers       and       another

p u l l e d me                over,               my     trousers                 were             badly         ripped.

I got               onto          the          pitch          and        laid           down          trying                 to    get m y      breath          back

someone                came              over           to me        and a s k e d                  if       I wa s          alright          and     t o l d me             to

bend            over          and          breath             through                  my    nose            and       out         through my mouth.

When            I fe lt                 better           I wondered                     around               and       looked a r o un d              for       my       friend

b ut         I couldnt                     see          him.

I stayed                   on           the       pitch          u ntil           about             3.45pm              (1545)           or   4pm     (1600)             and       by

this            t i me        most            of        the      crowds                had         cleared and                    I went        through          the          gate

i nt o          the        terraces                     where          I had            been         and        ou t          through         the     tunnel         1   .

Although                   I saw              a     lot       of     people                 lying about                      and     oxygen         bottles              I w a s n ’t

aware               that          anyone                had      been           killed              in the             incident.

                 I live at the above address and I am a season-ticket ho 1der at

                 Liverpool Football Club.                   I am also a member of the L i v er p oo l

                 Supporters Club, London Branch.

                 I obtained a ticket for the Liverpool and Nott ingham Forest semi-final

                 on the 15th of April              1989 via a^postal application.

                 I ar r ived at the ground at ateput 2.40pm but was unable to get                              in
       h     '      -------------------------------------------------
      1          because of the mass of people around the entrance to the Leppings Lane

                 stand,

                 I was to have ente red via gata^ entrance                            *B * but/at about 3pm I noticed

                 that two policemen were                 pul/ing open some ^optertina gates                to the   left

                 hand side of my turnst i l^e /entrance ■                          I can't re ca 11 any th ing/about the

                 Policemen.           As I was unable to get to my turnstile                      I foj^owsd the

                 crowds through the opened gates.                              I stopped to buy V'programme and
                                                                                      PAGE      S
                                                                                      SI 050

                            then made my waya throa
                                               tunnel as I could see no other

            directional        signs to the viewing area.

            As the gates had been opened I did not use my match ticket and I

            produce        it as an exhibit,   exhibit reference |   [
                                                                     t, I have signed a label

            for the same.

            I did not experience any excessive          c/ush and eventually stood on Pen

            4.     I remained in Pen 4 and walked /out through the tunnel at about

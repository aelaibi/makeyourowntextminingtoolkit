                      I was     on       reserve        for    traffic            control         duties                and    remained          at     the

                      On arrival            at    the       ground      approximately                     5    to       10 m i n s     later       we      were

               The    Liverpool             supporters              then made              a    s urge            towards        the       Spion       Hop       end

                           MERSEYSIDE POLICE VIEWS ON HILLSBOROUGH


Yesterday I paid a long-planned visit to the Merseyside
Police in Liverpool.                       Inevitably we discussed last Saturday's
events at Hillsborough


The Chief Constable and his senior colleagues were careful
in their comments.                    Lord Justice Taylor is visiting them
on Friday.


It was, however, clear that they had a good deal of sympathy
with colleagues in the South Yorkshire Police who had had

to take decisions on Saturday.                                     One officer,who had been
present at the match, said how normal it all seemed - although
the level of policing (800) was unusally high.                                                    Nothing
would have suggested to him that trouble was brewing until
it happened.

The Chief Constable told me that hedeplored the                                                    Press's
morbid concentration on pictures of bodies.                                                    He was also
uneasy about the way in which Anfield was being turned into
a shrine.                   A key factor in causing the disaster was the
fact that large numbers of Liverpool fans had turned up
without tickets.                     This was getting lost sight of in attempts
to blame the police, the football authorities, etc.


Senior officers in Merseyside do not support the line being
taken by their local Police Federation.                                                     One officer, born
and bred in Liverpool, said that he was deeply ashamed to
say that it was drunken Liverpool fans who had caused this
disaster, just as they had caused the deaths at Heysel.
He thought that Jacques Georges, the French President of
                                 "     1     -        '"I

UEFA, had spoken the truth at the weekend.

                      Mrs Corrigan (Son - Keith McGrathl


                               Letter dated 8.10.97




Issues raised


* Wishes to discover in exactly what circumstances her son died

* Wants S. Yorks Police to provide photos of Keith’s clothing

* Dissatisfied with being shown abridged version of body file

* Why is PC Russon’s statement undated, not witnessed and has no caution

* PC Russon’s statement refers to an ‘unknown doctor’ who pronounced Keith’s life
     extinct. Why can’t the doctor be identified.

* Dr. Redgrave states that he pronounced 14 lives extinct but did not keep records.
      He relied on records made by police officers. This is not evidence.

* The W. Mids Police wanted to say that Keith was a late arrival. Wanted her to
      hand over his ticket stub - refused. Summary of evidence unsatisfactory.

* Does not accept that PCs Russon & Mason carried Keith on stretcher - wrong
     identification.

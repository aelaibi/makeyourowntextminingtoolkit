                                     HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

       The Health and Safety Executive has been asked to assist the
  Court of Inquiry into the disaster which occurred on Saturday 15
  April 1989 at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield. Lord Justice
  Taylor, who formally opened the Inquiry at the Sheffield Town Hall
  on Friday 28 April 1989, is to be assisted by Professor Leonard
  Maunder, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Newcastle
  University, and Mr Brian Johnson, Chief Constable of Lancashire.

       The HSE team headed by Dr Chris Nicholson, Deputy Director of
  the Research Division's Safety Engineering Laboratory in
  Sheffield, will be working closely with Professor Maunder.

          Research Division staff from several scientific disciplines
  and engineers from Technology Division have already been involved
  in some of the work of the investigation at the Hillsborough
  ground and will consider, amongst other topics, the siting and
  strength of crush barriers, means of entrance into and exit from
  the ground and the structural integrity of constructions at the
  ground.

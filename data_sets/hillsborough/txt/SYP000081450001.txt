At    about       1440 h o u r s           I wa s     still       on d u t y at         the    South Stand when                      I

heard       several          announcements                o ver     the    tannoy         system        regarding              the

Liverpool          fans          at    the L e p p i n g       Lane     end.       These       announcements                   came       over

a    15-20 minute                period and were                requesting          the L i v e r p o o l            f a ns    to    be

patient,          not       to    push?       and     t hat     there      w as    ample       r o om     in the           ground.




A few minutes                after        1500      hours       the     turnstiles            began       to     close.             Serial

At about          1510       hours        one    of      the    turnstiles          operators             informed             me    that

they       were    a    lot       of     people       on the        pitch.         At     t hi s    stage        I assumed            th at

there       was    a    public           order      situation.             I walked           up to       turnstile              19-22         on

the    corner          of    the W e s t        and. S o u t h S tand.             I went          i ns i d e    and       could      see

people       in the          pitch and           peo p l e      climbing          o ver    the W e s t          Stand         fencing

                                                                                                                              —~         ty

Chief       I n s p e c t or w h o        informed         me     that    many      people were                 in ju re d.          He

requested          that          I help       c l e ar    the     area     for     ambulances,                  Shortly          after,

two    f ir e     appliances              arrived        and      I made       sure       that      they were              parked         so

as    to    enable          access        to a m b u l a n c e s .




A f i re     Off i ce r t h e n           informed         t ha t     s o me   casualties             would          be    brought         out

from       the    turnstiles               19--22 to a w a i t          for    ambulances             and       could         I maintain

a    casualty          clearing           area.



As    casualties             were        brought         from     the     ground        I directed              them       o v er    to a
                                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                                   S2571

              nearby wall             so    that    there        was    still      sufficient        room      for    ambulances          to

              turn     around.             Some    of    these      casualties          were     walking       supported       by

              others,         some      on b o a r d s     and    stretchers.




              I then         r e m a i n e d at    the     South/West         corner       and    directed ambulances                in

             and     out.         I assisted            in k e e p i n g    the    road    cl ear   and     directing         doctors

              and    nurses        to      the L e p p i n g s    Lane      end.




             At     t hi s    stage        I would       make     one      observation.           That    is    that    it was       some

              time     before         I fully        realised          exac tly what        was     happening,         as   neither

             myself          or m y     colleagues          working         in t h at     area    were    in p o s s e s s i o n    of a

              personal          radio.

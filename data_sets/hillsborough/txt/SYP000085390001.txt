                        under      the s u pe rv is io n of PS 2 2 9 CABLE, I was i n i tially on duty at the

                       and       causing any           potentially        offensive/dangerous                items    such as        banners

                        staves       to be     left outside            ground      plus      ensuring       that   cans ware         not.,.

                       The       flow of      people       t hr o u g h the    turnstiles           was    very heavy over a

About     3 pin < 1500)      this     heavy      influx had         reduced to what              I w ould

describe as a light                influx     of    ’last mi n u t e         s t r a g g l e r s ’ running to the

ground.         In general      the    flow had d i m i n i s h e d to such an extent                      that     I

was able,         on several        occa sions       to go      into L a p p i n g s Ln         itself     sear chi a

O f f i ce rs    I then went        inside       the g r o u n d and took           up position          in the

central         t u n n e 1 giving access          to the     centre         of L e p pings Ln t e r r a c e . M y

exact     position was at             the    terrace      end of that            t u n n e 1.   I recall       that

standing         s upporters       were     b a c ked up from the             rear of the terrace                 steps

some                 into    the    tunnel       itself     from w hich          position sight            of the

game was almost             impossible and any view down the terrace                                  itself,

iniposs i bl e .

My   i mpression from           latecomers a t t e m p t i n g          to    penetrate         the    rear    of the

crowd at this          point was          that     pressure       in the       centre      t e r r a c e was

intense as they almost                wi thout       e xc e p t i o n   failed      to do so and           ran back

up the     tunnel      in an attempt             to find a more              suitable      vantage       point.         1

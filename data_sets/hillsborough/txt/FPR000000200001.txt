 Dear Sirs,

 A group of Doctors in Sheffield are preparing an article on the medical
 aspects of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster,    Perhaps the most graphic
 illustration of the cause of the .injury-was Appendix 5 (the west terraces
 at 2.59p.m.) found in the Interim Report of the Enquiry by Rt. Hon. Lord
 Justice Taylor, published, on the 1st August 1989 (Cm 765).

  We would be'grateful if you could consider granting us permission to
  re-produce this photograph in our article.    The article is to be
  submitted to the British Medical Journal and we believe that they are
 ■interested in publishing this article.

  Thank you for your help.   If there is any further information you require,
  please do not hesitate to contact me.

  Yours faithfully,




 J. WARDROPE   F.R.C.S.
 Consultant in Accident and Emergency Medicine

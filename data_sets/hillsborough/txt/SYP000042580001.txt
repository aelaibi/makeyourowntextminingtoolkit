Dear Sir

COMPLAINT AGAINST POLICE

I refer to my letter dated 27 April 1989 regarding your complaint
concerning certain members of this force.

Superintendent Stuart has now completed his investigation and I note from
your statement dated 25 May 1989 that you are satisfied with the action
taken and now consider the matter closed.                        ___

I have considered the investigating officer's report and noted your wishes
in this matter. I have, therefore, classified the complaint as
’informally resolved' and intend taking no further action.

Yours faithfully




Assistant Chief Constable
(Discipline & Complaints)

DISASTERS AND THE LAW


I am writing to seek your advice in view of your Division's
involvement in various disaster inquiries such as the Bradford
fire, Hillsborough etc.

Last December the Lord Chancellor's Department initiated a
meeting of representatives from various interested Government
Departments to discuss issues relating to inquiries into
disasters.  I enclose a copy of the minutes of that meeting.
The Home Office was represented by Caxoline Price from Legal
Adviser's Branch and myself because of E Division's
responsibilities for coroners law.

As a follow-up to the meeting the Lord Chancellor's Department
has produced the attached memorandum.  This is to be put to
    ^ord Chancellor with the view to circulation to colleagues
on HS Committee. We have been asked to comment on the draft.

The memorandum is biased heavily towards "technical" statutory
inquiries and I would welcome any comments you may have before
we respond to the draft.

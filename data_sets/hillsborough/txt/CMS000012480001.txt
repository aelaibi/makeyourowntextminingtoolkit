          The Department, we anticipate, would wish to be associated with this
     initiative and thrive*1 Government may be able to make finance available to fund the
     Regional Unit at a cost of £350,000 per year* for a period of three years. Within
     all the participating local authority areas it will also be necessary to take urgent
     action to strengthen staffing in order to directly help individuals and their families,
     according to the scale of the problems which they are facing. As yet these costs
     have not bean fully assessed but when aggregated are unlikely to be less than £1millic
     per year* spread aeroaa the North West. The Government we hope would wish to be aware
     of this and may consider making resources available to assist in direot service
     provision as well as the establishment of the Regional Unit.

          It is, of course, appreciated that Government has already donated £500,000 towards
     the National Disaster Fund,   This fund has quite properly focussed its attention on
     the relief of individual hardship and will provide financial help directly to victims,
     but will not do away with the need for other help of a non-finaneial kind to be
     provided-
f         Given the nature and extent of these services this letter has been copied to
Sf   the Secretary of State for Environment and the Secretary of State for Social Security,
\    and also for information to officers in other agencies.

          In view of the importance of the issues involved a copy has been forwarded to
     the Prime Minister so that she, personally, can be aware of the state of service
     development and needs.
          An early decision on financial support would be most appreciated as it is
     anticipated other potential sources of finance will await the response of Government
     before making a coffunitwent.

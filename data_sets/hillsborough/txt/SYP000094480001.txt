            I am employed by Sheffield Area Health Authority and work at the

            Northern General Hospital.                  I am trained in Major Disaster Procedures,

            O n Saturday 15th April             1989 (150489) at approximately              1510 hours

            (1510)   1 was out with my family when I heard on local                         radio that

            there was some sort of major disaster occurring,                            I immediately

            telephoned the Accident and Emergency                       (A + E)    department at the

            Northern General and inquired if the major disaster                          plan had been

            implemented.         I was       informed that          it had and was asked to attend at

            the hospital as soon/as               possible.
                                         /


            I. arrive at the hospital at approximately                       1515 - 1520 hours     (1515)-

            (1520) and went srtraight to A + E .                     There   I saw

                            my supervisor and she allocated me my specific j                       i

            was to document        casualties as they arrived at the hospit a 1                        This
                                                                                    PAGE    2
                                                                                    S3S74

included placing a pre--num.bered wrist band on each patient and then

completing,      in as much detail as possible, any relevant             information

relating to that        patient a on card.       In many cases   it was only
                                                                                /
possible to r e co rd sex and a p p r o x imate age.     The number on t,h/f card

tallied with the number on the wrist band and also the m a j o r disaster

file    relating to that      patient.    This number   is known as %
                                                                    /;\ e ma j a

numbe r .

The file would accompany each patient, and the card was                 placed in a bo;

Someone would then collect the card and transfer the details onto the

Major Disaster Register.

Some    casualties had arrived at the hospital          prior to the major

disaster      plan being    implemented and the normal Accident and Emergency

cards had been completed in respect of these             people.       It was

necessary for these people to be issued with a rnajax number to enable

them to be re corded/registered          correctly under the Major Disaster

Plan.    As far as       I am aware                   went to the relevant wards,

rooms,      etc, and    issued these   p eo ply with a rnajax number.

I remained with                               in the A + E entrance and continued

to receive and document               it's,
                                patieni

The majax numbers were not issued in numerical             order.      The casualties

were arriving so         quickly that they were     issued with the next available

number which did         not always follow on,

I have examined the major disaster files             in relation tothe/ deceased

people that      came    to the Northern General     Hospital and I J w v e not

completed any of the forms in respect of these             p eop1e .

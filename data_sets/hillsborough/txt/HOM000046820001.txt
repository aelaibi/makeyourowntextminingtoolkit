       Dear Mr Bone,

       Thank you for your letter dated 24th September mentioning the visit of Lord Justice
       Stuart-Smith to Liverpool and inviting us to the meeting in the Merseyside Maritime
       Museum on Monday 6th October.

       Although at the time of the disaster we were living in the North W est of England, you
       know from our address that we now live much further away in Belgium and on this
       occasion we are unfortunately unable to attend.

       W e would, however, like to take this opportunity to tell you that we very much
       welcome this re-exarnination of the evidence relating to the disaster in which our
       son Henry was killed. W e were not ourselves present at the time of the accident and
       can give no information which is not already known. Unfoi ^nately our other son,
       Adam, who was a survivor, died some six months later

       For the sake of our sons and of the other victims we hope that this attempt to reveal
       the happenings of that fateful day are successful



       Yours sincerely,




       S C & V M ROGERS


        Mr. & Mrs. S. C. ROGERS                                                                BELGIUM

Thank you for your fax of 2 October.

We were sorry to hear that you were not going to be at our meeting last week with the
families of those who died in the disaster. Following that meeting, Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith is continuing his scrutiny of the evidence. He hopes to report to the Home Secretary
by the end of the year, but please contact me again if there is anything you would like to
know before then.

At       10    am   Wednesday,          22   March       1989,     I attended         a    planning   meeting    at

Hammerton           Road       Police    Station,        chaired     by Chief Superintendent Mole,               to

 discuss the organisation of the F. A. Cup Semi Final tie between Liverpool

 and Nottingham Forest Football Clubs.



On       Monday,         27    March     1989,     I    was   promoted       Chief    Superintendent        of   1F 1

 Division and assumed responsibilities for the forthcoming football match.

In       the    period which            followed        leading     to the     semi       final   I liaised with

Assistant            Chief         Constable           (Operations)      Mr.     Jackson          regarding      the

arrangements.



-At 10 am Wednesday,                    29 March 1989,            I had a meeting with Superintendent

Murray, Chief Inspector Beal and Inspector Sewell in my office to discuss

the operational order and our arrangements for the day and to ensure these

were progressing satisfactorily.



At       2.30       pm        on   10    April         1989   I    had   a     meeting        with    the   Sector

    British Transport Police to discuss our arrar.gemon.




    At 2 pm Wednesday,         12 April    1989, 1 held a               c o n a t                iiiuasKjrzon

    Road Police Station and met v/ith media represents: ives.



    At 10 am Friday,         14 April 1989, I held a pre natch briefing in the North

    Stand at    the Hillsborough Football Stadium for officers of inspector and

    above.    See Appendix 'A'.




    The purpose of this was to give a full briefing to supervisory officers and

    then for them to have the opportunity to examine their respective areas of

    responsibility and familiarise themselves with the ground.




    I   conducted    the    main    briefing   with   Superintendent       Murray,         and   then    the

    respective area Superintendents held their own briefings, in and around the

    ground,' dealing more          specificially with    their needs, and requirements of

    their areas of responsibility.



    At 10 am Saturday,         15 April 1989, I briefed the officers on duty for the

    semi final      tie    in the North Stand of the Hillsborough Football Stadium.

    See Appendix 1B !.




    It was a shortened version of the previous day’s briefing.                         Superintendent

    Murray,   Detective      Sergeant    Charlesworth    and Inspector Sewell                also dealt

    with matters      such as Emergency Evacuation Procedure,                 Crime Intelligence,

    and Administration.




                                                - 2 -

, toured the area.



 1 re-entered the ground about i .15 pm and *•"! du-j Cv>;;'\so mado my way to the

 Police Control Box about 1.50 pm and liaised with Supe:•into::dent Murray.



 We left a short time later to see the referee and lir.esnjen to advise them

 of our emergency procedures.



 They were on the pitch and eventually they left and ve followed them to the

  official’s room.



  On leaving there about 2 pm we returned to the Police Control Box and met

  with Mr. Jackson, Assistant Chief Constable (Operations).



  In the Control Box were the regular operators - PS Goddard, PC Ryan and PC

  Bichard.'



  I had a general discussion with Mr. Jackson about the operation, which was

  progressing satisfactorily at this stage.     He left a little while later.



  About 2.30 pm, when examining the ground situation, I noted that the .Spion

  Kop was almost full with the Nottingham Forest fans, and that was the

  general view in respect of their other areas of the ground.



  A number of Liverpool supporters had obtained tickets for the Spion Kop and

  were accommodated in the North East part of this section of the ground.

  They were   segregated from the Nottingham Forest     supporters by a line of
       police officers.



       The North Stand       for Liverpool       supporters was possibly half full ’at this

       time,      the West Stand was       filling,     but there was     space at thefront and

       sides      of the Leppings Lane Terrace.           I asked for     a tannoy message     to be

       relayed for fans to move forward and spread along the terrace.



       I    can   recall about     this   tine Superintendent Marshall         asked for Leppings

       Lane to be closed and saw on the CCTV monitor the crowd situation and a

       SYPTE      double decker bus passing.



       I was      aware of a crowd build up buttraffic was still able               to     flow and I

       questioned in my mind the need for the closure.



       At    this   time   there   must   have   been    some    difficulty   in closing    the road

       because I remember more than one request for this to                   be done as though the

       first had not been implemented.



      ' I.was aware from the CCTV monitor of the increasing number of supporters in                     :.5

       Leppings Lane and in those waiting to enter the ground.                    Whilst examining      $

       the situation outside I visually made an assessment from the Control Box of                      I
                                                                                                        •••<

                                                                                                        -I
       his assessment of the situation, bearing                 in mind thecrowd outside and     the
■ •



       space inside at this time.



       This was about 2.30 pm and he said that with half an hour to kick off we

       should get them all in on time.




                                                        4 -
About    this     time   I    asked     Superintendent' Murray .to clarify                   with me   the

circumstances under which we would consider delaying tin: kick utT.



We had      previously agreed that if there was an identifiable problem, e.g. a

serious     incident,       accident on the motorway or fog on the Pennines which

would prevent large numbers of fans arriving on time we should consider a

delay    as    opposed       to    those    who    had    been    brought     to    the   area   within    a

reasonable time but had chosen not to enter the ground as soon as possible.



I took      the   view   that at       this       time,   with all      the    information available,

there were no grounds to delay the kick off.



Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm the crowd continued to increase and I monitored

the Liverpool        fans     on the Spion Kop and actions being taken by officers

there.



I examined the situation at the Leppings Lane End of the ground from the

CCTV monitor and saw the increasing crowd situation.



I was aware that action was being taken to increase the number of officers

at   this     location      as     horses   and     reserve      serials      were being directed          to

assist by Control Room personnel.



In addition, a tannoy message was being relayed to the crowd outside at the

Leppings      Lane   end      to    ease    back     and    not    to   push       forward   against      the

turnstiles.
About     2.40    pm    the   radio       developed       a fault    smd      Micro    were obvious

communication difficulties.



A request was made for a Communications Officer to attend and repair the

fault and he arrived almost immediately.



He restored communications and we were able to contact officers once more.



The crowd was continuing to increase at the Leppings Lane end turnstiles,

and Superintendent Marshall               asked    for PC Buxton to attend with the Land

Rover which is equipped with a public address facility.



In addition,       at 2.44 pm,        I requested a traffic mobile to assist and for

continued       tannoy messages       to the crowds outside to               relieve    the pressure

upon the turnstiles.



The     crowd    had   by n«">w increased         considerably      and fans were beginning to

climb over the walls          into the ground.



The     crowd    situation    was   changing       rapidly,    ithad   increased in        numbers,

Superintendent         Marshall     had    asked    for    a vehicle       with   a P.A.   facility,

tannoy messages were being relayed to ease pressure, Mounted officers were

having difficulty and extra resources had been sent to assist.



I looked at the situation on the Leppings Lane terrace and saw there was

room for supporters, and considered because of the deteriorating situation

whether or not to delay the kick off to ease the difficulties.                             I looked
                                       '        ’         .-                              ”_ : •      • "J

through the Control Box window to my right and saw a                       If ^circle of press            y

photographers on       the pitch at the players'               tunnel, obviously waiting for                "y

the teams to appear, and at that point , whilst considering the position ,                                      '

the first team ran out onto the pitch.



I considered this option had been removed.



I looked at       the CCTV camera trained on the service road at the Leppings

Lane end showing Gate C, and a Mounted officer was in some difficulty as

his horse was being jostled by the crowd.




It was about       this   time,     14.47 pm,    that      the first message came over the

radio from Superintendent Marshall with a request to open the gates.



I again looked at the CCTV monitor showing Gate C and my immediate reaction

was not to do        this. We had supporters outside the ground                who may not have

tickets,      some may be drunk or worse for drink, they were                  not co-operating                ~
       .                                                                                                ’ *-'v-
                                                                                                         • ' * . 7:

with' the police nor responding            to our requests.           To open the gates and                   >1

allow them into the ground would defeat our objective that no one would get

in without a ticket, who was drunk or may be carrying weapons.                        .


                                                                                                          1
The   crowd      situation    was    extremely      difficult     and   this   was   an   unusual

request,   and    whilst I was considering the position, assessing the space in

the ground and looking at the CCTV monitor,                     I saw Gate C burst open and

supporters enter the concourse area at the rear of the Leppings Lane stand

and terrace.



I remember thinking,         'the gate's open anyway': I had not given permission




                                                    7 -
but at that point a Mounted Officer, retrieved the situation ’and closed the

gate.                 .




A further message came over the radio from Superintendent Marshall to open

the gates and he used words to the effect that if the gates were not opened

someone was going to be killed.




This was an urgent message which conveyed to me by the tone of his voice

that this was a serious situation and was a demand rather than a request.



The   previous   thoughts     crossed   my     mind   once   again   about   monitoring   and

control of supporters entering the ground.




It was a serious step to take.            I looked at the CCTV monitor - there was

crushing   outside,       supporters    were    climbing     over    the   turnstile   walls,

officers were under pressure.




On the inside of the grouna there was space in the terrace, there was space

on the inside of the         turnstiles   in the concourse,          and room to ease the

situation.



If the gates were opened there may be crushing and injury on the inside but

the message I was receiving from the outside was that unless I opened the

gates and eased the pressure people would be seriously injured or killed.



Superintendent   Marshall      is a very       experienced police officer and if he

wanted the gates opened, which is not normally a consideration, then the

situation must be very serious indeed.
Whilst     I    am     considering   the   position -and   considering 7 the    options

Superintendent Murray said to me,



"Mr. Duckenfield, are you going to open the gates”?



I remember standing there and saying my thoughts aloud             sothat others,    if

they heard it, would realise it was a considered decision.            I said,



"If there's likely to be serious injury or death I've no option but to open

the gates - open the gates".



Superintendent Murray passed this message.



About this time I heard another radio message from someone who said words

to the effect,



"It does not matter ’•'hether you open the gates or not, this gate's going in

anyway".



I was advised this was 'A' Gate.



I took this to mean that crowd pressure on a particular gate was suchthat

it was in. danger of collapsing and people being injured.



My immediate         reaction   to that was   that if a gate collapsed due to crowd

pressure those immediately in front of the gate would fall and no doubt be

injured.       In addition, those falling may be trampled upon.
The     gate      to       the    North     Stand     was    opened       and   I   immediately . issued

instructions for extra resources to be deployed into that area to provide

cover on the landings and prevent a pitch invasion from nor. ticket holders.



I also asked for manpower for the perimeter track to monitor the position.



I watched         the      Leppings      Lane     terrace   intently      for any developments as a

result of the gates opening.



In taking stock of the situation I looked at the U’est Stand and it appeared

full.     The centre two pens of the terrace appeared to be almost full, but

there was still some room at the front of the two wing pens.



I saw a PC opening either gates 3 or 4 from the Leppings Lane terrace onto

the perimeter track and a handful of people were coming out on to the track

and walking towards gate 1.                       They seemed to be calm and appeared to stand

aimlessly on the track without any direction.                             The policewoman standing at

Gate    1,     who      was      only   a   few    yards    away,   was    totally    unaware   of   their

presence.         There was room at the front of this pen and there was a need to

open this gate and allow these people into this part of the ground.                                  Chief

Inspector McRobbie who was in the Control Room in civilian clothing went

down on      to      the      track     to assist     her and draw her attention to what was

happening.                                                                  '



There was an increasing number of people coming onto the track from Gates 3

and 4 area.            No radio traffic was being received and I was still unable to

assess the situation but considered there may have been a pitch invasion or
                           . ,                                                       -                    V    r.     ’

I asked for Superintendent Greenwood to- go to Leppings Lane ond and Tind

out    what    was     happening.            I    saw    him    coming    from     the    players'   tunnel,

walking along the perimeter track towards the Police Control Box and the

incident behind the Leppings Lane end goal.                          An increasing number of people

were    now    being    helped     on       to    the   track     through    the   gates and some were

climbing over the perimeter fencing on to the track.



The    supporters       from this       location were            now spilling on to the track and

were standing on the grass behind the touch line.                                I was not aware of any

radio    messages       but     then    saw       Superintendent         Greenwood       standing head and

shoulders above the people at the back of the goal, presumably standing on

an advertising hoarding and waving his arms.



He was waving his arms and crossing them as he did so, which indicated to

me he wanted the game to be stopped.                            I agreed the game should be stopped
                                                                                                                          / * ■:

and I sent Superintendent Mui-ray from the Control Room on to the track to

stop the game.          I then saw Superintendent Greenwood running onto the pitch

to stop the game.          Superintendent Murray then returned to the Control Room.



                                                                                                                          '■A!'
I saw officers trying to indicate to fans in the rear of the pens to move

back.



People    were       spilling    onto       the    pitch       and were     moving further across and

towards       the centre line.              I was       still    unaware of any radio traffic and

exactly       what    the problem       was,       but    some    people were        now sitting on      the

pitch.

The Assistant Chief Constable                  (Operations) Mr. .lackson joined me in the

Control Box and asked-.for an appraisal of the situation.                             I was unable to

give an accurate account of what the situation was other than a possible

pitch invasion which had resulted in us stopping the game.



The Assistant Chief Constable              (Operations) went to the pitch and a short

while later returned.



Superintendent Murray was asked to return to the pitch and try and get it

cleared    so   that   from    the       Control       Box   we    could     assess    the    situation,

especially as now people appeared to be on the pitch who were injured.



An ambulance was requested but I was unaware of any radio message asking

for this and was still relying on my visual assessment of the situation.



It was .'difficult     to    assess       as    the    crowd was     flowing onto the pitch in

increasing numbers,         police officers were present, and there was a movement

of supporters towards the centre line.



I   was   concerned    about       the    crowd       situation:     a     difficult    situation    was

developing and we could not control the pitch.                        It was necessary to form a

cordon to continue segregation and further assistance was requested to help

with the increasing injuries I could see in front of me from the Control

Box.



I called for ’Operation Support’ .                    In turn I was aware of a request for a

fleet of ambulances,         and         as a result of that message I became aware of
                                                              i. * -    * .          >         - *   „

I then began to give instructions to the Control Room stuff in conjunction.

with Mr. Jackson for the implementation of the Major Disaster Fian.



I asked        for the Casualty              Bureau   to be- set up,            to warn hospitals of the

large number of injuries, any doctors in the ground to Leppings Lane goal

for        deployment,       off      duty    police       officers      to     be   called          to   duty   and

rendezvous at Hammerton Road Police Station.



Mr. Jackson supplemented my requests, asking Superintendent Torr to attend

in respect of the Casualty Bureau; Detective Chief Superintendent Addis to

attend to co-ordinate the investigation side of the enquiry.                                         I asked for a

Counselling Service and Victims Support Staff.



I was aware of a request for wire cutters and following on from that the

attendance/of the Fire Service.




Whilst all this was taking place I asked PC Ryan to continue broadcasting

.for calm among the supporters and for them to clear the pitch so we could

determine what people were injured and where because the fans were milling

around and obstructing the view.



Advertising hoardings were by now being broken up for use as stretchers and

injured people were being removed across the pitch towards the exit by the

police room.                                     \/    .

          Leppings Lane goal. r            .



      The Fire Service cleared a gangway near the Police Control. Box in front of

       the South Stand to remove casualties           from the ground.by a more expedient

      route.



      Superintendent Murray returned to the Police Control Box and told me that

       there were many injuries and possibly some fatalities.



%     I was later requested to attend the Board Room with Mr. Jackson, the ACC

       (Operations),   and left Superintendent Murray in charge of the operation in

       Police Control.



       We attended the Board Room within the Directors Lounge at the football club

       and saw officials of both clubs and the F.A.


                                                                                                             %'i
      I was asked for an assessment of the situation and I told them there had
                                    ....                                                                         ^

      I was told by one gentleman that he had seen two dead supporters on the

      pitch.



      I related the situation as I saw it at that time; and that in my view the

      game would have to be postponed but that I did not want this communicating

       to the crowd.



      The reasons for this were that they may create an additional public order



                                                    14 -

                           ■'   ■■■  --'-v
it was essential that all the casualties and dead were removed from the

area before any announcements were made.;.



It was agreed the game would be postponed but                    that no one in the crowd

would be told until I gave permission.             Mr. Jackson, reinforced this, and we

very quickly left.



I returned to the Police Control Box with ACC (Operations) and continued to

monitor the situation.          The rescue was progressing, we now had fatalities

and a temporary mortuary had been arranged in the gymnasium.



I was approached in the Police Control Box by Mr. Clough and Mr. Dalgleish.



They asked for an assessment           of the situation and whether or not the game

was postponed.           I told them   it was my intention to postpone the game              but

asked them not to tell anyone          and gave my reasons for this.



Mr. Clough left but I asked            Mr. Dalgleish to make an announcement to the

Liverpool fans for calm and to bear with us for the time being.




It is my view that this was beneficial to the operation.



The rescue operation progressed and eventually, about 4 pm that afternoon,

there   was    only one     casualty awaiting      transportation to hospital and the

point had arrived where the crowd could be told of the situation.



I asked       for   an   assurance   that   all   trains   and    buses   were   available    to
I   transport the supporters away from ^th^gr^und^ all a v a x l ^ e :^^icer^ werq

    patrolling the streets and that we were-ready for t.hc crowd dispersal



    The    final      ambulance   'left the   ground      and   an   announcement    was   made   by

    Superintendent Murray to the crowd that 'the match had been postponed and

    they were asked to leave.



    The crowd applauded the decision and left without any major difficulty.



    After the ground and the surrounding area had cleared Chief Superintendent

    Mole arrived and took over responsibility for the ground.



    I left the Police Control Box with Mr. Jackson and walked across the pitch

    to    the    Police   Room.     We met    with   Mr.    Barron,    a Director    of Sheffield

    Wednesday Football Club, and passed comment about the disaster - he was in

    tears but praised the police operation.



    I left the football           ground for      Force Headquarters about 5-.15pm, together

    with        the   Assistant     Chief     Constable         (Operations)   Mr.   Jackson      and

    Superintendent Marshall.



    On    arrival      at Force   Headquarters,      about 5*^5 pm,       I met with the -Deputy

    Chief Constable, Mr. Hayes, and in due course the Chief Constable



    About 9 pm that evening I left Force Headquarters for Niagara Police Sports

    Ground to meet the Minister for Sport who was due to arrive by helicopter

    to meet with the Chief Constable

onto    his      back.      His    face was          like a dark             blue & both his                eyes

were    out      of their      sockets          on his      cheeks.           He was          o b v i o u s l y dead,

I can describe            him as a w hite male about 3r0 y
                                                         *r  s , he had

blonde        hair,    blonde      eyebrows.              He wore d          white       shirt & denim

J ea n s .      He was    quite     st o c k y & rnuscula^r about                   14 stones          o r so.          I

c o u l d n ’t tell you where                he died he          could have           died there            or some

             A'ere really shocked,                 all             could say was                 "Oh my G o d " .

I was       numb,     I couldn't          believe        that     just       one    person had died

never mind any others.                       The    crowd at       the       back     wall       started         to

ease as         people were        being        lifted above            us to the             stands.        ye made

We were         p ermanently stuck              there.          As the       crowd       cleared       I could

guess about a dozen were                      round there.              We    took       it    in turns          to go

to the fence           linking Pens 3 & 4 to try X jtf find                                           On one

shook       us up.       We w a l k e d      out    of the t e r r a c e d are a              back    down the

tunnel       at about 4 . 4 5 p m         (1645 ) . / At this              time     there was          no    crowd

or nothi ng , just            peop 1 e 3.ook i ng f o r f r i ends & such 1 i ke .                          We

managed         to meet     up w ith                              outside          the ground.              We were

all    so     relieved we         just       hugged each other.

The atmos p h e r e       on the way            to the m a t c h was             great,        laughing          &

joking,         1. saw no trouble whatsoever,                      just a few             rowdy,       singing

t hat's all.           Once we      could see             the    crowd at          the    entrances          all       the

j o v i a l i t y went and        lots       of tempers          were      lost.         I d i d n ’t see any

criminal         offences      at all,          some had been drinking                        but there were

                  no    real    problems.             I w o u l d say though that               drink     did      n't r i but e

                  to the       loss       ofsome       tempers.        After      the game         it           different,          I

                 was a s h a m e d        of one      in particular who a c c u s e d             this    bobby of being

                 why     that, tunnel           was    not    block e d    off.      I -p a lly    a gree with the

                 s h o u.I d b s s h u t .       There       was    total chaos wit h the               p o 1 i c e they

                  I cart slag some              off as well.           After      ay f    the     crowd    left    the

                 te r racing       I saw a p h o t o grapher              takj/ng    pictures        of the       barriei

           &     it.      There were a lot of                  people      in front, of me who              o bviously

                 thought        the      same    because       they jumped          on him & g e ne ra ll y         pumped

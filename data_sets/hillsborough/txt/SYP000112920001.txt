                            SHEFFIELD ON SATURDAY l^*APRIL 1989

On behalf of the Chief Constable^ Hr. Wright, I am gathering information to
enable the Fore# to present evidence to the forthcoming Committees of Inquiry.
This exercise has no connection with the investigation into the policing of
the F.A. cup semi-final which is being conducted by a team headed by Mr. Dear*
Chief Constable of West Midlands.

What I require from you is a self-written account of your actions on the 15th
April 1989. Please note that this is not a CJA statement and it should be
written on plain paper.  It would be helpful if your account could include the
following information.

 1.      What time did you come on duty?

2.       To whom were you responsible?

3.       Where were you deployed, and did you get deviated to any other
         location?

4.        What did you    see that is in   any way relevant to the incident?

5.        What did you do?

Please begin the account with your full name in block letters, your rank and
number and your sub-division/department.  Please conclude the account with
your signature.

The officer handing you this document will inform you how and when to return
it.   Please return it promptly and provide as accurate anaccount as you  are
able.

Please contact any of my staff if you have any queries or concerns in
completing the account. Force Headquarters telephonists will connect you with
someone who can help.

Thank you for your assistance.

T hank you fo r y o u r note of 11 F e b ru ary .


I have acknowledged th e correspondence from M essrs R ussell Jones and Walker.
A ttached opposite is a d ra ft rep ly to be sen t to th e ed ito r of the Daily T elegraph
if you a re conten t.

B eneath th is note is a copy of th e judgm ent of th e House of L ords in A ttorney
G eneral v . Times N ew spapers [1974] A C .275. I have highlighted the passages
re fe rre d to b y M essrs R ussell Jones and Walker to g eth e r with o th er passages
which seem to me to be significant in th e context of the p re se n t case - notably
passages in th e judgm ent of Lord Diplock.

The following points seem to me to be p a rtic u la rly significant:


1.     The te s t of contem pt p revailin g in 1974 was less ro b u st th an is now
a p p ro p riate u n d e r th e term s of th e Contempt of C ourt Act 1981. I am assum ing
fo r th is p u rpose th a t M essrs R ussell Jones and Walker do not seek to allege a
specific in te n t on b ehalf of the Daily T elegraph to influence th ese p a rticu la r
proceedings. R ath er, th a t is a consequence of th e ir criticism s of th e ty p e of
litigation in which th e South Y orkshire officers a re now engaged. In re fe rrin g
back to e a rlie r ju d gm en ts, Lord Diplock d escribed the typ e of m aterial likely to
be involved in th e following term s :

       "So the discussion in th e judgm ents ten d s to be d irected to
       consideration of th e question w hether th e publication complained of
       involved a risk of causing someone who might be called upon to serve
       as a ju ro r to be prejudiced ag ain st a p a rty o r to form a preconceived
       view of the facts before th e evidence was adduced in c o u rt, o r a risk
       of influencing someone who might be called as a w itness to a lte r his
       evidence or to decline to te s tify ."
f




    The effect of th e 1981 Act was to stre n g th e n th a t te s t b y re q u irin g th a t th e re be
    a su b stan tial ris k of serious p reju d ice .

    2.       Having recognised th e lower th resh o ld which prevailed in 1974, it is
    in te re stin g to note th e discussion in th e judgm ent of Lord Diplock a t page 312
    le tte r D about what is describ ed as "technical contem pt".     Lord Diplock said:


            "Since th e co u rts discretion in dealing with a motion fo r contem pt is
            wide enough to entitle it to dism iss th e motion w ith c o sts, despite the
            fact th a t a contem pt has been committed, if it th in k s th a t the
            contem pt was too venial to ju stify it bein g b ro u g h t to the atten tio n
            of the co urt a t all, th e distinction betw een conduct which is w ithin
            th e general concept of "contem pt of court" and conduct included
            w ithin th a t general concept, which in cou rt re g a rd s th e d eserv in g
            of punishm ent in th e p a rtic u la r circum stances of th e case, is often
            b lu rre d in th e judgm ents in th e re p o rtin g c a se s. The expressio n
            "technical contem pt" is a convenient expression which has been
            sometimes u sed to describe conduct which falls into th e form er b u t
            outside the la tte r categ ory; and I ag ree w ith my Noble and L earned
            F rien d , Lord Refcd, th a t, given conduct which p rev e n ts a real risk
            as opposed to a mere possibility of in terferen ce w ith the due
            adm inistration of ju s tic e , th is is a t v e ry least a technical contem pt.
            The serio u sn ess of th a t ris k is relev an t only to th e question of
            w hether th e contem pt is one fo r which the c o u rt, in its d iscretio n ,
            ought to inflict any punishm ent an d , if so, what punishm ent it
            should in flic t."

    The effect of th e 1981 Act seems to have been to exclude from th e ambit of the
    s tric te r liability ru le w hat had prev iou sly been reg a rd e d as "technical contem pt".
    I su sp ect th a t th e m atters re fe rre d to b y M essrs R ussell Jones and Walker would
    have fallen fa irly and sq u arely into th a t category.

    3.    The above point is b o rn out when one looks back to th e m aterial being
    considered b y th e House of L o rd s. The A ttorney General in th e Sunday Times
case had declined to b rin g su b stan tiv e proceedings fo r contempt ag ain st the firs t
article published b y th e Sunday Times b u t had sought to re s tra in publication of
the second.     R eferrin g to th e fir s t a rtic le , Lord Diplock said:


       "This does not mean th a t I th in k the A tto rney General ought to have
       taken an y action on it him self. It was a short passage in a long and
       trenchant article which was otherw ise unobjectionable. To draw
       renew ed public atten tio n to it b y a motion fo r committable fo r
       contem pt m ight well have done more harm th an good b u t I have no
       doubt th a t th e publication of th e su b seq u en t article which is the
       subject of th e p re se n t appeal would have been a grave contem pt of
       c o u rt, though fo r a d ifferen t reaso n , and th a t it was the d u ty of the
       A ttorney G eneral in the public in te re s t to seek to p re v e n t its
       publication."


Subject to a n y views you may e x p re ss, I do not propose to p u rsu e th is m atter
f u rth e r u n til we have a resp onse from th e Daily T elegraph.

    I      respectfully agree with the learned Master of the Rolls that one is

above all other considerations as I think in a case where the agreement is
in obscure terms, see whether an interpretation proposed is likely to lead
to unreasonable results, and if it is, be reluctant to accept it. The grotesque
consequences of an insistence on a right to rescind on any breach of clause
7 (6) do not require emphasis. It was suggested that one must concede
to the appellants the right to inflict severe terms, since they will have                                                   [h o u se o f lo r d s ]

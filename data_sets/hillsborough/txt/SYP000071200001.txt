            from Liverpool to Sheffield in my fathers car, and we were both in

            possession of football tickets bought previously from Airfield football

           My ticket was for the Leppings Lane terraces,                         face value £<£>.00, trry

            fathers ticket was for the North stand.                                                                      :■'

           We arrived in Sheffield fairly early, and parked the car, near to I

            park, approximately five minutes walk away from the ground,                                I went to

             the car. We did not stop in Sheffield for refreshments but had

             previously stopped/6'n the motorway services.

             On route    into^^hef f ie Id , I saw a lot of f^rts in .the street,                   drinking

             beerl from/cans, they did not appear to be d r u n k , infact it was a very

             ripped off, and the other half returned to me, as I

            fairly comfortable standi ng here, and had free movement during this

            time.

S 0.£       At approximately quarter to three,    I felt tremendous pressure from the

Z£,ov^£>    rear, myself being pushed forward,    I got thrown across a barrier,

            managed to get myself up, and was carried by the crowd,         to another

            barrier near to the front    perimeter fence,    I was alone at this t i m e ,

            and do not know where my friends had gone.

            Whilst being carried along by the crowd,    I had no control over my own

            movement,    I eventually stopped when I hit the barrier near to the

            front, and I was pushed against it, my stomach pushed against          it,

            leaning across it,    I managed to get underneath it somehow, as I could

            not breathe, and managed to stand up,    I was then facing the goal          line,

            I heard someone scream right behind me,    I managed to turn myself

            around and saw a white, male approximately 24 - 25 years of age,             I

            can't recall any further description he was being crushed against he

            barrier that I had just managed to get underneath. This man appeared

            in tremendous pain and seemed to have difficulty in breathing, I could

            see that his face was turning blue, the stomach was pressed against

            the barrier,   he could not move because of the crowd behind.       I pushed

            him back by using my arms against his shoulders, to try and release

            him from the barrier,    I saw his face turn very blue, and blood coming

            from his mouth,    I did not manage to get him from the barrier,       but saw

            his head slump forward that was the last I saw of him, as the crowd

            were still    pushing from behind against him,    I looked to my left and

            saw a small gap near to the fence separating pen ’s 3/4,        I made towards

            that and stood along the brick ridge,    on which the fence sits on,

            making me a few feet higher than the crowd, out of the actual          crush

            but still unable to move,    so I hung onto the railings and stayed there

            for at least five minutes,    I saw two other    lads make towards the front

            perimeter walking across the crowd,    in a crawling motion, and       h a u l       :

      himself up over the spiked fence,       it was these lads that gave me the

      determination to do it also.       I managed to put one foot on the railings

      and put my hand on the top of the spikes, sustaining a cut hand, I got

      pitch. The injuries 1 jrfistained were

                              if which I received

     Liv er po ol .

     This appeared to take place all        in about twenty minutes,      I never saw

     the players come onto the pitch, or a ball being kicked.

     When I got onto the pitch,        I sat down,   I did not want to look behind,

     as I could hear people screaming,        there were a lot of people already

     on the pitch from the stand,        I saw people lying on the pitch being

     helped by fans,    police officers and medical teams some of them being

     given the ’kiss of li f e ’ other people around me crying.

     I did not assist with any of the injured, as I was very shocked and

     injured myself.

     I eventually made my way towards the North stand,            in order to find my

     father,    I was stopped by a Policeman before getting to the North stand
m
^    and told by him,    I could not go any further,        I said to h i m ,

     "There are people fucking dying there and your

     telling me, what     I c a n ’t do" I pointed to the    fence and said,     "Whether

     you fucking like     it or not I ’m going" and went along the pitch,

     infront of the North stand,       I eventually found my father standing near

     the front of the     north stand.

     I shouted out to     him,    he eventually heard me,   and come running onto

     the pitch, we embraced,       I told him I had ripped my jeans and lost my

     watch,    I was obviously shocked, he said,      "Y o u ’re alive thats the

     main thing."

     He took me to the                       at the rear of North Stand,        to

                                     1 was given a drink of water my mouth was so dry,                                   I
ZAl          saw groups of Policeman hanging^about talking to each other,                                     I was

             so a n g y , I got up and wejr^r over to them,                    I started shout ing , "There

             dying, Help them,               them!" at this point my father pulled me away.

             I went over to the Policeman on a further two occassions and repeated

             my request,      but they just looked at me, my father eventually took me

             away from the                                  into thf> North Stand,     to where he was

             saying that the match had^Jar^en abandoned. W e left the ground soon

             after that, went back to \ h e                        car and drove hrime. We had the radio on

             going home, and the number of persons deceased was increasing,                                     it was

             not until   the next day, we realised ninety five

             people had died.

             This could have been avoided if the ticket allocation made,                                     could have

             been greater to the Liverpool fans, and better organisation given by

             Police and stewards on entering the ground.

            During and after events leading to the tra de gy , the reaction by Police

            and stewards was extremely slow. ,

            a Liverpool      supporter and attended the match between Liverpool and

            Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Ground in Sheffield on Saturday 15th

            April 1989.
                -------------------------                          H 1 5 0 \|
            I attended the football match together with my father, travelled up

             from Liverpool      to Sheffield    in my fathers         car, and we were both in

             possession of football       tickets bought         previously from Anfield football

            ground.

            My ticket was for the Leppings Lane terraces,                  face value £6.00,    my

            fathers ticket was for the North stand.

            We arrived in Sheffield fairly early, and parked the car,                    near to a

             park, approximately five minutes walk away from the ground,                    I went to

            the ground firstly with my father to have a look around and buy a
                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                           S1546

            programme,     we did not enter the ground at this time, and went back to

            the car. We did not stop in Sheffield for refreshments but had

            previously stopped on the motorway services.

            On route    into Sheffield,    I saw a lot of fans     in the street,      drinking

            beer from cans,     they did not appear to be drunk,        infact   it was a very

            relaxed atmosphere.    Approximately quarter to one,         I left my father

            where we had parked the car and walked to the ground alone, arriving

5o£         at the entrance approximately ten to one.          I went through the main

            gates, there were a few Policemen standing around, and I was searched

            by one, before entering the turnstiles.

            I entered the ground through the turnstiles without any difficulty as

            there were only a few people about.

            I went thorugh the turnstile and handed in my ticket,              part of it was

            ripped off, and the other half returned to me, as I

            entered through the other side       into the ground,     I was again searched

            by a policeman and I noticed that there was a Policeman standing at

            each turnstile.

            I walked down the tunnel which had free passage along              it,   I received

            no direction from Police or Stewards as I knew where to go, as I had

            been to a game staged at Hillsborough on a previous occassion.

            When I got to the end of the tunnel        I walked to the right hand pen

            (pen 3),    there was no Police or stewards standing near or at the

            bottom of the tunnel,     I stayed in Pen 3 for about an hour, and at this

            time    it was fairly empty,    people were actually lying down across the

            steps    it was at this time,    I decided to cross over into Pen 4, which I.

            did without any difficulty as I could see some old school friends

            in that pen,    these being                                      Liverpool

                     and                  whose address   I d o n ’t know.

            I was    in Pen 4 for about 40 minutes     prior to the game starting,

            standing near to rear,     by the fence separating Pens 3 and 4.             I was

                                                                                    S154&

         fairly comfortable standing here, and had free movement during this

         t irne.

S C>.£   At approximately quarter to three,        I felt tremendous pressure from the

         rear, myself being      pushed forward,   I got thrown across a barrier,

         managed to get myself up, and was carried by the         crowd,     to another

         barrier near to the front      perimeter fence,   I was alone at this time,

         and do not know where my friends had gone.

         Whilst being    carried along by the crowd,     I had no control      over my own

         movement,    I eventually stopped when I hit the barrier near to the

         front, and I was pushed against      it, my stomach pushed against        it,

         leaning across    it,   I managed to get underneath it somehow,       as I could

         not breathe,    and managed to stand up,     I was then facing the goal         line,

         I heard someone scream right behind me,        I managed to turn myself

         around and saw a white,     male approximately 24 - 25 years of age,            I

         c a n ’t recall any further description he was being crushed against he

         barrier that I had just managed to get underneath.         This man appeared

         in tremendous    pain and seemed to have difficulty in breathing,          I could

         see that his face was turning blue,       the stomach was pressed against

         the barrier,    he could not move because of the crowd behind.          I pushed

         him back by using my arms against his shoulders,         to try and release

         him from the barrier,      I saw his face turn very blue, and blood coming

         from his mouth,    I did not manage to get him from the barrier,          but saw

         his head slump forward that was the last I saw of him, as the crowd

         were still   pushing from behind against him,      I looked to my left and

         saw a small gap near to the fence separating        p e n ’s 3/4,   I made towards

         that and stood along the brick ridge,       on which the fence sits on,

         making me a few feet higher than the crowd,        out of the actual      crush

         but still unable to move,      so I hung onto the railings and stayed there

         for at least five minutes,      I saw two other   lads make towards the front

         perimeter walking across the crowd,       in a crawling motion,      and haul

               himself up over the spiked fence,         it was these lads that gave me the

               determination to do it also.         I managed to put one foot on the railings

               and put my hand on the top of the spikes,            sustaining a cut hand,         I got

               pitch. The injuries       I sustained we re a                                     and

P £ £ S O rJ
               Liverpool.

               This appeared to take place all         in about twenty minutes,        I never saw

               the players come onto the pitch,         or a ball being kicked.

               When     I got onto the   pitch,   I sat down,   I did not want to look behind,

               as I could hear people screaming,         there were a lot of people already

               on the pitch from the stand,         I saw people       lying on the   pitch being

               helped by fans,     police officers      and medical       teams some of them being

               given the 'kiss of l i f e ’ other     people around me crying.

               I did not assist with any of the injured,           as I was very shocked and

               injured myself.

               I eventually made my way towards the North stand,               in order to find my

               father,    I was stopped by a Policeman before getting to the North stand

               and told by him,     I could not go      any further,       I said to him,

               "There are people fucking dying there and your

               telling me, what     I c a n ’t do" I pointed to the fence and said,          "Whether

               you fucking like it or not I ’m going" and went along the pitch,

               infront of the North stand,         I eventually found my father standing near

               the front of the north stand.

               I shouted out to him,         he eventually heard me, and come running onto

               the pitch, we embraced,         I told him I had ripped my jeans and lost my

               watch,    I was obviously shocked,      he said,    " Y o u ’re alive thats the

               main thing."

               He took me to the                        at the rear of North Stand,         to

                                   I was given a drink of water my mouth was so dry,           I

      1     saw groups of Policeman hanging about talking to each other,           I was
                                                               _              "

            so angy, I got up and went over to them, I started shouting,           "There
CoNM£MT2>
            dying, Help them, Help them!" at this point my father pulled me away.

            I went over to the Policeman on a further two occassions and repeated

            my request,   but they just   looked at me, my father eventually took me

            away from the                  into the North Stand,    to where he was

            sitting originally and we waited there,     to hear what was happening.           We
                                                 I t a -t v m / o y
            sat there for a while,    and an annoucernent came ac r os s the tannoy

            saying that the match had been abandoned.        We left the ground soon

            after that, went back to the car and drove home. We had the radio on

            going home, and the number of persons deceased was        increasing,    it was

            not until the next day, we realised ninety five

            people had died.

            This   could have been avoided if the ticket allocation made,         could have

            been greater to the Liverpool    fans, and better organisation given by

            Police and stewards on entering the ground.

            During and after events leading to the tradegy,        the reaction by P o l i c e

            and stewards was extremely slow.

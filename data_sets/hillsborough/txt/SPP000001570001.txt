8. Extracted from bundle headed Mr. Sturt. I discussed the question o f How
when I went to see him in June or July 1989. (8.(1)) He put me in the picture as to
how he had proceeded. In a file note o f 11.9.90 (8.(2)) I record discussing with
him post incident and his advise as his illustration o f drama and backdrop. It would
seem from this that nothing had yet been decided. In another file note of 7 .11.90
(8.(3)) we again discuss the rescue. I indicate that I was not making a definitive
decision until I had heard the legal arguments. The rest of the documentation does
not seem relevant to the issue o f cut off In the events none o f the correspondence
etc with Mr. Sturt was used in the Principal response or otherwise

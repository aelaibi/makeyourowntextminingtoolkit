were       one    or    two       police          on h o r s e s        which were              getting         people          i nto     queues

a n d at     the       turnstile             we w e r e        searched.                There       were       one       or    two     poIi ce

in the       area       in b e t w e e n          the     bi g     gates       and       the     turnstiles               just       standing

there.

I handed my             ticket          in a n d        the       counterfoil              was      ripped          off       and    it w a s

returned          to me.            Inside         the       turnstile             we w e r e       again       searched             by P o l i c e ,

At    no    t i me     can       I recall          seeing          any      stewards.

Once       inside       the       actual          g r o u n d we        looked          round and          knowing             we    were

standing          behind          the    goals          we     made      for       the     only      thing          we    saw w h i c h was

the    tunnel          entrance.              I did          not     se e     any       signs       indicating                any    other         way

into       the    terrace.              There        were         no P o l i c e        or S t e w a r d s      at       the    entrance            to

the    tunnel          or    inside          it.        As     I was        walking          through           the       tunnel        I can

remember          it w a s        quite       dark a n d           there       were        a number            of    people          j us t

standing          in the          tunnel.            The       only      light          in the       tunnel          was       the     l i gh t

from       both       ends.        As    we       got     to      the    end       of    the     tunnel         we       came       up a g a i n s t

the    fence          which was          in the           middle         of    the       mouth       of    the       tunnel.            At     this

point       there       was       quite       a    lot       of    supporters              s t o o d a n d we            had    to     thread

our    way       through          them       to    get       onto       the    terrace           proper         to s e e        the     ga me.

          Those        supporters              w h i ch were            standing          at      the     e nd     of    the     terrace           were

    U »   standing         there          for     their          viewing        p o in t       and      they were           packed          tig ht.

          Once      we    had       g one      through           t h e m we     found          plenty         of    room.         This        was       in

          p en 3.         My    position was                 directly           in       line       with      the       rig ht    hand        goal        post

          as     you     look       from       the     terrace.             I was         three-quarters                   of    the w a y         back

          from      the    front          of    the     pen.            I was       not a g a i n s t         a    barrier.            T he      t i me

          now was         about       2.30pm           (1430),           it h a d        taken       us 2 0 / 2 3 m i n s         to       get     to     this

          position.             By    this        t ime      now,        w h i ch was          2.30pm         (1430)        there          was     a f a ir

          sized        c r o w d a n d we         was       shoulder           to    shoulder.                There        was    a    lot       of

          pushing         and       swaying          going         on a n d we           k e pt     getting         pushed        down        towards

          the      front       of    the       terraces            and    having          to m a k e       our      way     back.           This        went

          on for         10-15 mi nutes                u n til      the    pen w a s           so    packed         y ou    c o u l d n ’t m o v e           one

          way      or a n o t h e r ,       hwoever,             I was     being          pushed          slowly         towards           the     ri ght

          towards         the       fence.           I can         remember          I had my             one      arm     up a n d        the     other

          by m y       side     and       I couldn't               move    either           of      them.          There        was    a    couple           of

          middle-aged men                   behind          us     one    of w h o m w a s           skinny         faced and              he wa s

          quite        frantic        trying           to    get        out.        He    had a         chubby          faced man with                  him

          and      he w a s     asking          people           around        to h e l p         the     skinny         one     to    get       out.

          However,         due       to     the      solid         packing          of    the       supporters,             nobody          could         do

          anything.             I then          felt        something           on m y         one      caJ/f a n d        I realised              it

          was      the    skinny man who                    wa s    trying          to    climijt/up m y            back.         I remember

          then      seeing          the     team       coming           out and          t h j / r e was an a lm ig ht y crush from

          b e h i n d a nd we w e r e             swept          forward        towards             the    fence.           I can          remember

          being        crushed and              feeling            my    cheaC       being          crushed.             Th e    sweat        was

          pouring         out       of me       and     I was           scared       of w h a t         was       happening.               I d o n ’t

          quite        know what            happened             nexjE but          I found          myself         up a g a i n s t        a barrier

          lying        on the        floor        of    th e       terrace          b e t w e e n me a n d          the     fe nc e.          At      this

also       still          the    crushing           coming          from        the    b a ck        of    the     terrace            and

although          people             were      shouting            ’ p us h     b a c k ’ nothing               was      happening.                  I

was    up aga inst               th e       barrier          and    I was        trying          to       push m yself               away       from

it    so as       not       to       ge t    crushed when                I felt        my    feet          come       up a g a i n s t          what          I

know       was    a body.               Then       I f el t        someone          grab my ankle                  and when              I managed

to    l oo k     down       I saw a ma n                holding          h is    arm      up.         I grabbed               th e    arm       and

shouted,          " T h e r e ’s a m a n            do w n " .        There         was     two       or    three          police          officers

including             a    policewoman              on       the    pitch        in f r o n t         of me a n d             the

p ol i c e w o m a n who             I am      sure      h e a r d me,          just      looked           back       in d i s b e l i e f .

They       began          then       shouting           for    th e      crowds        to    push          back,         but       this     was

useless.

I then managed,                      with     a black          lad w h o         was      standing              n e xt     to me,          to    pull

the m a n        u p but         as     we    did       he    told       us     there       was       someone            else        down

underneath                him.        We     got    the       first        one      up a n d         got    him       to      his     feet       but

we    c o u l d n ’t see             the     second          one.        During        this          time       everyone             was    still

screaming             and       shouting           and       still       total        pa ni c.            The    man       that       we    got          up

was    so       shook       up he           could       only       just       manage        to       speak       a n d we          had     to    help

him    keep       on his             feet.         We    then       noticed           that       a ga te         in the            front        of       the

fence       to    our       left w a s            open and          we     began       inching             over       towards            thi s .          I

saw what          I thought                 was    an    open       space        by    the       gate,          but      as     I go t      close

to    it    I realised                that        the    space.-was             in f act         a    pile       of      bodies          just

lying       on t o p of              each      other^arfuT o t h e r s              then walked                 o ver      them,         no w a y

out.        We    managed             to     turn/round,              the       crush       by       this       time was             subsiding

and    people             could       be     s 4 e n to be l y i ng d o w n all a r o u n d .                              We      got     this

skinny man                over       to/the        fence       that        separates             p en 3 f r o m 2 ta n d w i t h                     the

                                 /

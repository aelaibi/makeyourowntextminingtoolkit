           at        p o s ition XI of The map.                 There were         very few people           in the West

               Stand.       We sat         down on the terr ac in gy               had a drink        of   coffee and    read

               the    papers.           E v e ry t hi n g was a l ri gh t    for about an hour             up until     1400

               hours     (1400.



               From     1400 hours           (1400)     there was a n oticeable               increase       in the    numbers

               of    people on the t e rr ac in g              but    just   normal      as one w ou ld expect.              By

               1440 hours          (1440),       the    crowd volume was a bo ut what                  I'd expect      for a

               game     of this         importance.           I noticed,       however,      that      the t erra cing       to

               my    left was          under   c ap ac it y    in supporters.



               P rior    to the great            influx       of s u p p o r t e r s , y w h i 1st we had been waiting

               had    noticed that the gate at                    the    rear y a r e a       four and giving access

               that     d o e s n ’t mean to say there W a s n ' t               ojre t h e r e .



           At about              1450 hours        (1450)      some     ofXthe     players     came out onto the             pitch

               prior     to the start            of the gairte. /it was at              this    time that        I became

           a wa re       of the         increased       pressure        of bodies      from my        right.     1 d i d n ’t see

           any        particular           person      pushing,       it was     purely the         volume of bodies

               c om pr e ss e d    into the small             area.     N o r m al l y at this        time the    s upporters

would       have    been    chanting           to support       their      team that was      now on the

pitch.        Instead       I was      only aware         of moaning          by fans about      the ground.

Comments       like     ''shitty ground'               were    common.        These   comments weren't

d i r e c t e d towards      any     part icular         person just          general   comments    made    to

one another.


                                                                       I N Q^2szr)TslD
I then       became a wa re        that        I had been movsra by the crush of bodies                    to

the    left    hand fencing            in Pen four a s / i n d i c a t e d at         point   X2 on the

a t t a c h e d map.       I had     become       sepa^alTed from                   and could not see him.



I was       by this    time about              half w ay down the fencing and two                 persons       in

from the actual             fence and having              one    person       in front of me      separating

me    from a crush barrier.



B y now we we re very u nc o mf o rt a bl e a nd bodi l^^riovements we re

restricted.            I noticed that some                people wjn~e climbing           the    inside of

the    fence at the           front      of the area a n d ^ e t t i n g         on to the      pitch.     The

game was       in progress,            but      I was morte/iriterested in trying                to make

n,y self     c:om^ ° rtable



I did not          notice anyone          helping        the    people who were         climbing    the    front

fencing       but    they were         o bv i ou s ly not being            stopped.     I was    not aware       of

a ny on e    being     in danger at             this    time.



I saw a w om an who was                sta nding        in front       of the    crush barrier      I was

behind,       who was       o b v i o us l y    in a very d i st r e s s e d state and was          crying.

I cannot       recall      a ny d e sc r i p t i o n of the w o m an           but her face was      flushed.

So m eo n e m a na ge d to get           her up onto           the    crush    barrier and over      the side

fencing       into the       corridor           to our    left.        One    or two other      peajne also

climbed on the             crush     barrier and over                the   fence.     I managj/i to do the

            n ot ic ed     that the          game    had stopped and              no    players    or officials were                   on

            the    pitch.



            I could hear              some    s c re am in g and shouting               from    people       at    the           front of

            the    terraces and              still     inside     the    pens.          T here was        a lot of               confusio

            Pe op le were            still    climbing         over   the    perimeter          fence and         1 m a na g ed to

            break      the fall            of a girl who         jumped from the               fencing.       The     girl       had

            blonde        hair and was w e ar i n g             jeans.       I cannot          remember a ny th i ng         else

            about      her.          She    landed alri gh t and w a n d e r e d           off    in      a daze. She

            appeared           to be alri gh t a part            from distressed.



            I had         been on the         track     for about       two minutes.               I was     feeling       quite

       I didn't       see any        physical         abuse    but there was          certainly some          verbal

       that    the    game was         not    delayed,        if such a      large        nu/fber of fans were

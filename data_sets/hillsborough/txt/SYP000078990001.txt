              were a large              number     of fans        outside         trying     to get     in,   but we       in fact

              did not         have a lot of trouble                 getting         to our      particular       turnstile,            we
                                                                                                                P AGE


did have          to push our wa y thro ug h the                    fans    but,    they did       let us th ro ug h

We got       in the ground,               having      g iven     in our     tickets and went and found

our    seats w h ic h were             in row        17,      of the Uiest Stand.           We were       in

posit io n a little after                    2 .30    pm.

The    first       time     I became aware               of any trouble was when              I saw fans             being

pulled off             the front       perimeter           fence    of the terraces          directly

b elow our         stand.        The    game    had been           in progress          for a few minu te s           by

then so          it must     have      been shor tl y after 3 . 0 0               pm.     It became       clear       that

there were             casualties       so    I deci de d        I had     better       go down to see          if    1

c          assist.          At first         it was        impossible       to get out as just             before

3.00     pm a large          number        of fans         had come       into    our    stand,    they o b v i ou sl y

had    not got          seats    to go to and so more                   just     standing    up in so doing

b 1ocking         the g a n g w a y s .              /

I was      still        trying    to get       Mwn         to the      pitch when        I heard t h e public

a dd re s s a n no un c e m e n t J^or / o c t o r s to go to the area                     behind    the goal             and

L ep p i n g s    Lane    end.      I • wjntual ly with the a ss is t a n c e                of a Police Sgt,

got    to the          pitch thro ug h what              I now believe           to be pen No 4 end a small

gate at          the    front.                                                      /

I tr ea ted four            people        on the      pitch.        The    firsa was a male           in his 2 0 * s

who    laying behind             the goal        Just         to the    rijym, as you       look at       the    pitch.

I took       over       doing m o u t h      to m ou th anpt cg^diac massage                 from a fan who

was w or ki ng           him but did not              seem X\yh e doing            it very well.           I spent

about 2 minu te s work in g                  on this          person,     but    it became    obvious          that       he

was    dead so          I m oved on to see               if    I could help anyone           else.        The    next

person       1 went       to was a g a i n a young man                  in h i s y K O ’s laying     in the          same

a re a but a little further                    to the          right.      There were       people with this

youth^and              I realised       v u i c k 1y that                 hre, was also      dead.        So    I m o v ed

         mouth       to mouth,       and he was           doing    cardiac massage.

                                                           we    put him on his front

                                                                          We then     returned him to his

         back,       there was       not a     lot of       life    but    there a p p e a r e d to be some              chance

         w i t h this     one so we         c ontinued to work             on him.       A fireman arrived.                    I

         saw he had a small               plastic airway,             I a s ke d   for    it,    then a nearby fan

         snatched       it and was          trying        to open the       packet       but he was         shaking       so

         m u c h he    could     not ma na ge        it.        Y took .it off him,         opened       the      packet

         and    inserted       the airway.            We/'carried on with m outh to m o u t h and

         massage.         Another        f i re ma n/ or    it could have          been the       same      one    turned          up

         w i t h a air     bottle w it h ^ a m a s k .            There was what a pp ea re d            to be a black

         ho:-;, between the h o U l e               and    the mask.

         The    fi reman     put the mask            on the y outh he held the mask                    on     in the      right

         way    but as     I watched         I could see           there was no movment                of the      chest.           I

         pointed this          out      to the      fireman,       but he said,          "This    does      the job

         m at e. "     I w a t ch ed for a short time more,                    then      I started to          loose my

         temper w ith the            fire ma n      I was       upset and a n gr y       that    the e qu ipment          he

         was    using was        not w o r k i n g .       I pushed him out           of the y a y       and

         re com me nc ed mouth           to mouth,         I was    then able        to ga^T air        into      his    lungs.

         With    help     1 then got this y outh on an a d v e r t i s i n g board and ran with

         him to an ambulance.                  At    the    other     ccirnerV oy the       pitch next            to the

         cornsr       of the k o p .W h e n      I returned         to the L ep pi ng s Lane            end    I went         to a

         man    of 3 5/40 years           heavy      bujjrLd, wit h a reddish beard.                   I thi nk two

     y   nurses were         dealing       wit h kfim when            I arrived.           I took      over        the mouth

         to m o ut h and then a f i r em an                came    up a g a i n with one of these air

         I was working           orf.     I spent about 5 minu te s                working       on this man before

         an a d v e r t i s i n g board a r r i v e d and he was             taken away to the other                     end

         of the       gr'cun/.       In total,        I think       I was    on the       pitch for 2 5/35 minutes

         b etw ee n 3.\l/> pm and 4.0 0              pm.        I then    looked ar ou nd        but    I could         not    see

              a ny f urther       people who      needed        help so    I returned to the stand met

              up w it h my father and            brother,        I was very       upset,      and    I just   wa nt ed

              to get       out   of the    ground,      so at    about 4 , 0 0    prn the     three of us       left      the

              gr o un d and      got a taxi      home.

              The m a i n thing      I want      to say is       that     the air   bottle and        mask     produced

              by the       f ir em an either    does     not     do the    job that     it    is supposed to,          or

              the    persons who was          us i ng   it had not        been t rai ned how to use            it,   it

              did not a ppear        capable      of    forcing air        into   the   lungs of someone who

              was    not      breathing.

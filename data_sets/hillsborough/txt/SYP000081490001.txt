supporters             would         not     clash       in vast         numbers         due    to    the    separate           entries

into     the        city.

During         the     course          of    the    afternoon,             several          supporters        asked myself

where     they were               to    go    if    they       had a       certain          coloured        ticket.            One

elderly         gentleman with                    his    so n a p p r o a c h e d      me    and     said    "Where          do we

go?"     producing              to me        a brown          t i cket.

At    t hi s    I directed              the       gentleman         towards         the      Leppings        Ln     entrance.              At

which     he        said       " I ’m s u p p o r t i n g      Forest,         t h a t ’s the L i v e r p o o l          end".       I

apologised and                  explained            t hat     that      was     the     only      entrance         he w o u l d         get

in w i t h a b r o w n            ticket.            It t r a n s p i r e d      t hat      this     man    had     in fact

obtained            his    tickets           from       the F A     dir e c t .

tickets         and which              entrance          the     various         supporters           had    to     go    through.

A    souvenior        seller        set     up       stall        in the          front    garden          of a h o u s e         on

ended     up w a l k i n g        towards        the S p i o n Hop.

At    around       1.30pm         <1330)     youths             were        walking       through          crowds          saying       "Any

spares,       any     spares".            These           youths        were       Liverpool          accented             supporters

and    one y o u t h      paid      twenty           p o u n ds    for a s t a n d i n g         ticket.              At    this       time

a group       of m i d d l e       aged     men       were        walking          up P e n i s t o n e     Rd     towards

friends.           This      g r o u p was       about          15 s t r o n g      a n d at     least        12 of         the    group

had    "four       p a c k s ';     of    cans        of     lager/beer.

After    advising            the    groups           of y o u t h s         walking       past     us      blatantly          supping

from    the       cans    that      they     would           not       be    able      to e n t e r     the      ground       in a

drunken       state,         and    would        not       be a b l e        to    take    the     liquor          into      the

ground.           It b e c a m e    an    impossible               and meaningless                 task       to s p e a k        to all

groups       as    there      were       to m a n y w a l k i n g            past.

The    time       by now was         around 2.15pm                     (1415)       and    people          were       saying       "Is

this    the       Liverpool         end"     walking              towards          the S p i o n Kop.              After      advising

them    "No       it w a s n ’t"      they were              saying          "Well       the    coppers          up    there

(meaning          Leppings         Ln)    have        sent        us    down       here".        This       problem arises

from    officers          not      having        a    list        of    the       colour       codes       mentioned          earlier

for    different          areas      of     the       gro u n d .           By 2.30pm          (1430)       the       list    of       the

colours       had     become        invaluable               due       to    the a m o u n t     of     supporters            asking

directions.

By 2.45pm          (1445)         supporters              were     becoming            frantic        to    get       into    the

ground,       asking         to    be a b l e        to    get     through          the    barriers           to      the L e p p i n g s

most    were       carrying         cans      of      intoxicants.

The mood          during      the a f t e r n o o n          seemed          one    of    good     humour, however,

drink     was        very much          in a b u n d a n c e ,       and    due       to    the    sheer        number         of

supporters            carrying          cans,         action      t hat     would          have    been taken                elsewhere

He    had walked             o ver    the     dual       carriageway,             and       deliberately                knocked        into

a Liverpool               supporter.            There      was       no    retaliation             but       the    problem           being

that     I had        to     shout      o ver      crowds       of    people          some 73 yards                to w h e r e       PC

Arriving          there        at a r o u n d      3pm    (1500)          I entered          the m o b i l e        can t e e n ,

                      was       not    blueing              and appeared                unconscious               not     dead.

                      One       supporter              tied       up a s e c t i o n           of    the      railings           with a         piece     of    rope,

                      t hi s     assisted              supporters              to      climb        through         the     fencing.

                      There       were        apparently                10 m o r e        bodies         inside         the      pen,      and    then my

                      attentions              were          then       diverted           to     removing           the     bodies             from    the     pitch

    I returned             to    the       pitch     to    find a             cordon        had    been      set      up a c r o s s     the

    halfway          line.        I there          spoke        to PC 2 4 9 9 S E R H A T L I C             and       other       A Division

    officers.

    At    one    p o int        one    supporters              was       hell       b ent    on    causing           trouble       and       kept

    trying       to    provoke an             officer           on the          cordon.            Friends           of   his     were

    trying       to    c al m     him       down.         An    unknown             Inspector         came       to m y s e l f        and     PC

    1741     SOWERBY and               said words              to    be       the    effect        "If     he    continues             with

    this     I want         you       to    quietly        arrest             him a nd       t ake    hi m a w a y " .           This    was

    the    first       p i ece        of    instruction              I ha d         been     given        since       entering          the

    ground.           A scuffle             broke     out       in the          lower        North        stand and          Policemen

    who    were       in the          cordon       instinctively went                        to    break        up    the    scuffle.               I

    then     s h o u t e d at         a genuinely              unknown Sergeant                    "To     hold       the    line".            He

    appeared          to    look at me             in a m a z e m e n t         and     then       said      "Oh yeh".            He    then

    held     the      cordon and             the     s i t u a t i o n was           calmed.

    After       some       considerable              time       the       only       communication               received was                that

    to    keep       tickets          and    they w ould             be       honoured.            People        were       approaching

    me    saying       they       had a       full        tic k e t ,         stub and        ticket,           which       had    not       been

After       a while          -and the w h o l e         s i t u a t i o n was         beginning           to    sink        in a n d      I

became         oblivious           of    friends       and      colleagues             talking          to me.           The      f ans

had    dispersed and                I walked          form      the       ground       and       down Leppings               Ln     right

down      Vere        Rd.     I walked          down     the        centre       of    the       road,     al ong        the      white

line      and     people          were    asking       me      to    go    into       the    house       and        have a        tea/

c of f e e .      I acknowledge                them     but     d e c l i n e d as      1 was          emotionally and

physically             shattered.              I turned         left       onto       Penistone          Rd N orth and

walked         b ack       towards       my    original         point,        as      I walked          1 was        watching           the

floor       a nd was a g a i n           totally       oblivious            of m y      surroundings.                    I looked          up

to    see      P C ’s J O W I T T a n d M U S K        on       the F i e l d i n g         Rd    junction.

and    questioned my welfare.                           I was        emotionally             upset and              t his    was

obviously apparent.                       He    kept     asking           me a n d     then a          l ady w h o       I now         know

and made          a    cup of        tea.

She    a l l o w e d me       to     p h one m y w i f e a n d             this      I did       but    was u n a b l e        to

p h one     f r i e n d ’s w i f e s          who    1 had      seen were             safe.

From      then        to    the    subsequent          de-briefing               break       at C l a y w h e e l s         Ln and

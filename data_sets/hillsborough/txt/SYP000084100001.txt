              RECOLLECTION OF FACTS RELATING TO HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

              BY PC 1834 WHARVELL




              I am a Police Dog handler of the Nottinghamshire Constabulary at

              present attached to the Force Support Department.



              At 7.30 am, Saturday 15 A p r i 1 1989,       I paraded for duty at Headquarters

              and then travelled to Niagra,        the Headquarters of the South Yorkshire

              Police, Dog and Hounted Section, where together with other Offi c e r s .

              I was briefed re the Nottingham Forest v Liverpool F.A. Cup Semi-Final

              to be played at Hi 11sborough at 3 pm the same day.
                                                      D. 2-63                   PAGE      2
                                                                                SH836

The briefing lasted.approximately three quarters_of an hour and then
                                   s.r.         O    I 3 0 S T           * t b S5
together with PC 1496 S C A R F F , a South Yorkshire Dog H a n d l e r, with whom

I was double crewed, we commenced our des ignated duties which we re to

patrol the Bus Station and surrounding streets on public d i s order ,

this we did also at times          covering the Liverpool fans exit from the

railway statiuon, where they were loaded onto the buses and taken from

the Station to the g r o u n d .



 t 1.30 pm I was involved in a                       d at about 3.20 pm, whilst

dealing with this at the City Ce                    vice Station, we were told that

a serious    incident was taking place at the Hillsborough Ground and we

were to travel there straight away.



We arrived at the ground at about 3.25 pm the same day to be greeted

at the Nottingham Forest end by several other O f f i c e r s , perhaps 50 in

all,    all of which then just stood around.              There appeared to be no

1 eadershi p at that time.

                                                      /

After    15 mi nutes all the Dog Handlers i^mre/tplo A o          take the i r dog into

the ground.     This we did but was a raastaM,             it (was^-obvious to me even

then that we should not have go'mr into the ground with dogs and this

was echoed by a South Yorks Dog Sergeant who ordered us out again

immediately.     This we did.



To clarify one point,      1 feel we should not have gone in with dogs as

it was becoming obvious that something more serious than a bit of

public disorder was going on.             Although at that time we had been told

nothing,    but from what civilians who were          leaving the ground told us

and the look of fear and disbelief - their eyes gave away,                 it was

obviously very serious.
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               S2836



Once outside again the dogs were returned to their vans and once again

we stood around,      for want of a better word, and then via the radio

system,      we heard that eight people were dead and a temporary mortuary

was to be set up.



At this point, although we had not been told anythi ng offi cially,                it

was obvious it was a serious        incident.     I felt useless and because of

this   I approached two South Yorkshire         Inspectors to request that we be

yttsed as Police O f f i c e rs to help in any way we could.       One totally

ignored me and the other told me to wait where 1 was for further

instructions.



After a short while all the Dog Handlers,           including m y s e l f , were

ordered into the ground with dogs and told to line up on the pitch

facing the Nottingham Forest supporters to prevent a pitch invasion.

Again we had been told nothing and what was even worse was the fact

that the Forest Supporters         had    been told nothing and thought the

Liverpool     fans had invaded     the   pitch.          I told some what had happened

They were obviously shocked but glad to know why things were

happening.       I think   it was wrong not to tell      people the truth of the

matter and treat them as adults.



After about 30 minutes we were ordered out of             the ground where myself

and PC SCARFF      resumed back to the City     Centre    and public order

dut ie s .



My tour of duty finished at approximately 10 pm the same day.
                                                                            PAGE    4
                                                                            SS836

           inforroation given to myself and oWler Offi cers at the Nottingham

          Forest end and the lack of any MsasfrerjChi j



          The two points mentioned above were In no way responsible for the

           terrible incident but if we had been given better information and good

           responsible leadership afterwards,   we may have reacted better and

           possibly saved lives.

                                                                           SIGNED

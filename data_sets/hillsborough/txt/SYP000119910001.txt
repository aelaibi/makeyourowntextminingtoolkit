             SATURDAY         15 A P R I L    1989

              I began duty on the above                    date w it h my duty group at 6,00am.                               At 8 « 00am

             the same        date        I began my official                  football       duty a t t a c h e d to       *F*

             D i v i s i o n CID.         My duties were            that       of an observer w it h             r el ati on to

              thefts    of and from motor                 vehicles ar ou nd the                 ground arid I was             riding

             a Police m o t o r c y c l e         in order         to    carry out           these    duties-

              I was    under       the overall          s u pe r v i s i o n of D e t . Supt.            M cK ay and after

              the    briefing at           the    ground,       I was         d ep lo y ed     in my obser ve r ca pacity to

              the FI Sub D i v i s i o n          in the v ic in it y of the ground.

              During     the     course       of the m o rn in g             I c on ce nt r at e d my efforts          to the

             Nee psend and Shirec'liffe areas.                               F oo tball      fans    began a t t e n d in g      in

              these areas at a r ou n d              11.00 am to              11.30 am.         At this       time    I became

             aware     of     large       c on ce nt r at i on s    of fans         in the      public       houses    in these

              areas    p a r t i cu l ar l y the       '’Owl*      and       ''Victoria’ public houses                 w hi ch are

              both s i t u a t e d       in N e e p s e n d Lane.            Fans were         m as se d outside these

              public     houses          both on the        pavement and spill in g                   into    the    road and

             appeared        to be boist er ou s and very high spirited.                                  This      trend

              con t i n u e d until        1 took my meal               at    the ground at a p p r o x i m a t e l y         1.00pm

              to S.00pm.           Whi ls t      on meal     I heard on my                personal       radio      that
                                                                                                             PAGE

assis ta nc e was       required outside               the    ''Victoria*      public         house    by two

special     constables         on duty there            in order       to control         the a ss e mb l ed

fans,     1 did not a tt e nd this               incident.

O n resuming       duty      I a ga in    c o nc e nt r at e d on the N e e p se n d and Shi reel iff©

areas and saw that             there were            still    large amounts            of fans       c on gr egated

outside     the    two a f o r e m e n t i o n e d    public    houses.        I then b egan a

co nc entrated      patrol       of the N e e p s e n d       Industrial       Estate.            Wh il st   there

X was    a p pr o a c h e d by two other CID officers who                      informed me            that an

incident was        ongoing at           the gr ou nd and at this              time      I s wi tc h ed my

personal       radio    from the CID            channel       in use up to that               time    to the

Channel. S3 G r o u nd Control             Channel.           I h eard that       there was an

incident       in the L ep pi n gs Lane              end of the ground and that                    bolt

croppers were          being a sked for.               All   CID     personnel         were    then    r equested

to return to the             ground.       I then made my way back to the ground

entering       from P e n i s t on e Roa d       into    the Police R o o m / G y m n a s i u m a re a

behind the N o r t h Stand.               On entering          the    g y mn as iu m    I saw other CID

officers a s s e m b l e d and at that time                  the     first   of the d ec ea s ed was

brought     into the gym.             T he re    then f ol lo w ed a steady st re am of                      other

the   deceased.         At    this    time      I felt       in somewhat       s h oc ke d and        ’q u i e t ’

state a nd was a l l o w e d         to take a short            break      in the sub divisional

  been    identified and           there were          no other      relatives        or frie nd s       present

  this    time     I have      been engaged           on duties      in all areas          of the       ground

  but    this    present       s ea s on    I    have been enga ge d mos tl y on tur ns ti le

  duties       in Leppi ngs Lane.                On most m a t c h days       there     is no        problems

  relating       to the       control       and a d m it t an c e   of fans at the L e p p i n g s Lane

  end of the gr ou nd but              on numerous          occ as io ns     I have seen         problems

  arise at that          end of       the       ground due     to fans       leaving      the    surrou nd in g

  public       houses   too     late and then a t t e n d i n g           en mass     to the L ap pi ng s

  course       is impo ss ib le and             pushing and shoving           has taken         place    from the

  fans     in order      to    ’speed up*          their    e nt rance     into the ground.              My own

  feelings       on this       d a y ’s events are          that    the    problems       o u t li n ed above

  have     taken    place on a much e nl ar g ed scale                    by drink a f f e c t e d      fans who

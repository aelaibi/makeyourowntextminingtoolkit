       Dear Sirs

       Re:        HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

       We refer to our recent request for copies of photographs and
       enclose a copy of your response thereto of 22nd August.

       We do have in our possession a copy of West Midlands Police
       Composite Album 2, and a member of the South Yorkshire Police on
       the 6th September did contact a member of your office to obtain
       confirmation that it was in order for the South Yorkshire Police
       to reproduce further sets for us by way of prints from prints,
       which copies are of course required for the Contribution Trial
       to be heard at the beginning of October. We understand that the
       South Yorkshire Police were advised copies by them could only be
       authorised if we obtained official consent from you and we would
       ask you to take this letter as that request.

          We await hearing from you.

          Yours faithfully

    Dear Sir

    HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

    I refer to your letter of 20 August 1990requesting copies        of West Midlands
    Police composite Alburn .1 and 2.

    Although these photographs and other documents and statements were available
    for the Public Inquiry of Lord Justice Taylor the situation changed at the
    commencement of the criminal investigation.

    That investigation, supervised by Captain E N Taylor of the Police Complaints
    Authority is still on going and all relevant material is subject to that
    investigation.

    i am not therefore m a position to release those photograptis               atthistime.
    However, if the situation changes I will  of course contact you.

    Yours faithfully




    M J FOSTER
    DETECTIVE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT

               DUTIES; Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489)



               At 2.00 pm (1400) on Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489),                  I paraded for

               duty at Main Street Police Station, Rotherham,                  together with the rest

               of the members of the Rotherham Crime and Vandal Squad.                   We were to be

               on “standby" duties at Rotherham,             ready to provide Force-wide cover

               for any incidents requiring additional manpower.



               I was Acting Sergeant with Inspector KERRY GRACE in overall command of

               the squad.



               At 3.10 pm (1510) that same day, an urgent call was received at Main

               Street for the squad to attend at Hillsborough Football Ground.
                                                                  PAGE      2
                                                                  S37S1

Whilst en-route to the ground we were directed to the Leppings Lane

end of the stadium.



At 3.25 pm (1525) we entered the stadium via the Leppings Lane gates

and went towards the Leppings Lane stand.     1 saw several bodies laid
out in the courtyard immediately behind the Leppings Lane stand (about

6 or so) and I presumed them to be dead as their heads were covered
with clothing.   Numerous other people were lying injured with others

(fans) giving first aid.



Members of our squad assisted in carrying the dead bodies to the side

of Leppings Lane where a temporary mortuary had been set up.     Wh i1st

this was happening, there were many Liverpool supporters in the

courtyard area, some obviously very upset, distressed and in a state

of shock.   There were also some Liverpool supporters milling about the

courtyard area shouting abuse at police officers and,    clearly, some of

these abusive elements were the worse for drink.



Realising the enormity of the tragedy, we appealed for calm so the

rescue operation could go ahead unhindered.



At 3.40 pm (1540), as a result of a report of trouble in J,he Leppings

Lane stand, the squad walked up the staircase into the stand which

appeared full with people.    We there assisted in calming the crowd,

many of whom were directing abuse at the police and photographers

(press) on the pitch below.    We advised persons in the stand that the

game was being abandoned and that they were to leave quietly and

slowly.



Gradually people filtered from the stand back out into Leppings Lane.
                                                                         PAGE
                                                                         33781



         At 4.50 pm (1650), members of the squad returned to our transit van

         and patrolled Sheffield town centre.



         At 7.00 pm (1900)r the squad returned to duties at Rotherham.

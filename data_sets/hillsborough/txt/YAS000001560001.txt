                                 states


        1.   I am employed as a qualified ambulance woman for SYMAS.


        2.   My date of birth          is 18th November 1956.



        3.   I have been        with SYMAS for three years and prior to that                   I
             had   spent       five years with        Leicester      and   Berkshire     as    a
             qualified ambulance woman.


        4.   On Saturday        15th April I was on duty from 0900 to 1630.                    I

             had been on        duty from 0800 to 1630 on each of Thursday and
             Friday.


        5.   I am based at Maltby Ambulance Station and on 15th April I
             was on duty with                    in the vehicle whose call sign was
             Romeo 601.


        6.   We were returning to Maltby Ambulance Station from Doncaster

             District General Hospital at about 1510 and we could hear

             over the radio control mobilising vehicles                       to go to the

             Sheffield     Wednesday         football    ground.                     radioed
             control      to    ask    whether    they      wanted    us     to   proceed     to

             Hillsborough.            We were    instructed    to    go    to Hillsborough

             where   we    were       told   there    had   been     crush    injuries      and
             fatalities.

7.   We arrived at the ground at about 15^S^approaching it from

     Herries Road south.        We turned left onto Penistone Road and

     then did a U-turn at a set of traffic lights, to be met by a
     group of police directing us          into    the ground.        We were

     directed into the service road to the south of the ground.
     Attached to this statement is a plan of Hillsborough.                 In

     the position marked X there was a fire engine and we stopped

     at Y.      I stopped the ambulance and                     | got out to

     assist a man who was breathless and who complained of chest
     pains.    We took him into the ambulance and gave him oxygen.

                 and I were by the back doors of the ambulance when
     a policeman approached us saying there were more injured

     further down.        We turned to our patient in the ambulance but
     he had disappeared.       We got back in the vehicle further down

     and      parked in    front ofsome blue      gates   in   the position
     marked Zon the attached plan.         There were crowds of people

     in this area and there seemed to be total chaos.             There were
     no ambulances in this area but there were some further along
     the service road.        We went to a man who was in a collapsed

     state.     A policewoman was administering cardio pulmonary

     resuscitation and a fireman was giving the patient oxygen.

     I took over and felt for a pulse; there was nothing and I

     continued the CPR instructing someone to ask my colleague

     forequipment     because       the airway      was    blocked.      The

     policewomanbrought this over        from the ambulance and I used

     it.       There was     another man holding    this   patient's     head

     saying "please don’t let him die".        My colleague brought the




                                     m
stretcher from the ambulance and we placed the casualty on

It.    We then turned round and left the way that we had come.

I drove     and   a policeman        travelled    In    the    back   of   the

ambulance to assist my colleague.                The police gave us an

escort all the way to the Northern General Hospital where we
went to the casualty department.          The patient was pronounced

dead on arrival by a doctor.           We were Instructed to lay the
man down on the floor In the plaster room.



We returned to the ambulance and went back to the football

ground,    again entering      the    same way.         There   were   still

crowds In the area.       The police Instructed us to park In

front of another ambulance and we stopped In the position
marked P on the plan.          There was a St.          John's ambulance

parked In the position marked Q on the plan but there was

nobody with it.      We then heard an instruction come over the
radio for all further casualties to be taken to the Royal

Hallamshire and "walking wounded" to be taken to Barnsley

District General Hospital, as the Northern General Hospital

could not take any more casualties.



We were informed by control that the area where we were was

now clear of casualties.             I turned     to    see    several dead

bodies    in a position marked         222 on     the   plan which were

covered up.



We    awaited   instructions   and were     told       to go    to the gym
       entrance and park there in order to assist in moving bodies

       from the gym to the mortuary.       We drove to Penistone Road

       and parked there and were then told to go to the bus depot
       on Herries Road and await instructions.



 11.   We were later sent back to the gym where we parked in the
       area to the rear of the gymnasium.



 12.   Whilst waiting there we were debriefed by Mr Jones who asked

       a number of the ambulance crews who were there who were
       supposed to be on duty, and who were voluntary crews.



 13.   We were then instructed, along with three other crews, to go

       to Northern General mortuary to convey the bodies that were

                             gymnasium.    Each ambulance took threeX/ttv
•e."5cci2'b&dxss ana xney were placed on the floor of the gym.         We

       then   waited   in   the   car   park   again   but   were   given

       instructions to go back to the Northern General to bring
       back a child who had just died.



 14.   Once the relatives had identified the deceased the bodies

       were conveyed, three at a time, to the Medico Legal Centre,

       each body having a police man or woman as an escort.            We

       made four trips to the Medico Legal Centre and were sent off
14.              and   I reloaded       the cots    Into the back of the
      ambulance.                    radioed        Control   for    further

      Instructions.      I am   not sure whether we received a reply
      from Control.


15.   Two police officers, one male and one female, asked me If
      they could have a lift back to Hillsborough, which I agreed

      to.   On leaving the entrance of the Royal Hallamshire

      hospital, our ambulance vehicle broke down and we pulled up

      on to some waste ground.          The police officers then left the

      ambulance and presumably made             there   own way down to
      Hillsborough.     We Informed Control of our situation and our

      location.    By chance, two mechanics from a garage around the

      corner appeared on the scene, and asked If they could help.

      After twenty minutes or so, the mechanics had managed to
      repair our ambulance.      We then radioed Control, who Informed

      us to standby at the Royal Hallamshire hospital.             As we were
      virtually stationed outside the hospital, we remained where

      we were.     It was envisaged that we were going to have to
      transfer     patients     to the King Edward VII hospital In
      Sheffield.


16.   After approximately 15 to 20 minutes, Control advised us to

      drive round to B road at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in

      order to collect some casualties for transfer up to the King

      Edward hospital.     There were a number of other vehicles in



                                 i<?&
     duty at 0200 on Sunday.

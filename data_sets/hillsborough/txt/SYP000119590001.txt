           At 1000 am on Saturday,       13 April   1989,    (130489)    I commenced duty at

           Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground for briefing.                  X was on Serial 3

           with PS 577 Gardner as Serial Sergeant.             My duties were supervision

           of the turnstiles on the South Stand.             The Nottingham Forest

           supporters using the South Stand arrived between 1200 noon unti1 Just

           after 3     pm <1500).     They were orderly and good humoured.

           At 3.05     pm (1505)    the same day as the turnstiles cleared along with

           other officers       I went to the rear of the South Stand to supervise

           supporters    in that part of the ground.          A short time later I looked

           towards the Leppings Lane end of the ground and saw what appeared to

           me and the Nottingham Forest supporters to be a pitch invasion by the

           Liverpool    supporters.      The opinion of the Notts Forest supporters was

           one of "Liverpool are at it again".          I saw a large number of Police

           make their way to the Lepping^s Lane end of the              gro u n d   and officers

           giving the    kiss of life to two or three supporters laid on the

           pitch.      At this stage PS 577 Gardner         regrouped the serial and we made

           ou way onto the pitch.         Once on the pitch the magnitude of the

           situation was realised.         Liverpool   supporters were all over the pitch

           and hindefing efforts to remove the dead and injured.                     I moved a large

           number of them away from Police aÂ»3 others who were trying to assist
                                                                      PAGE    2

 the injured.    A large number of the Liverpool supporters smelled

 strongly of intaxi eating liquor.     The supporters on the pitch were

 angry and shocked but the ones who had been drinking were the most

 voci ferous.    I was then directed to form a cordon across the pitch to

 prevent the Liverpool    supporters   reaching the Notts. Forest supporters.

 As things quietened down and the dead and injured had been moved off

 the pitch the Serial 3 members that were left and myself were

 directed to the rear of Leppings Lane end of the ground to clear

 Liverpool    supporters away from the central tunnel to allow removal of

 the dead and injured.     A large number of these smelled strongly of

 drink and were also angry and s ho cke d.    They nearly all blamed the

 Police for what had happened with the following viewpoint!

 YOU SHOULD HAVE STOPPED THEM COMING IN.       YOU KNOW THEY ALWAYS RUSH AT

 THE LAST MINUTE SO THOSE WITHOUT TICKETS CAN GET IN.

  It seemed   that those most angry were the supporters who had not     got

  on to the   Lappings Lane terraces or who were at the back and were

  amongst those who had been doing the pushing.

  The only stewards   I came into contact with were those at the South

  Stand and   they appeared to be doing their j o b .

  I was not   aware of any breakdown inradio transmissions.

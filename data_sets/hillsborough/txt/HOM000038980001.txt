 1                                               Monday,   6th October,   199 7
 2   MR.   BONE:     Good morning, everybody.   My name is Chris Bone,      I
 3         am the Secretary for the Scrutiny.       I have met some of you
 4         already and I will try to get to meet the others later on.
 5                 I am really grateful to you all for coming,
 6         especially since I know on a Monday morning a lot of
 7         people might have missed work perhaps to come here.
 8                 As we explained in our letter to you the purpose of
 9         this session is to allow you all to put your concerns
10         about this dreadful Hillsborough business directly to Lord
11         Justice Stuart-Smith in person.      He is here to hear what
12         you say, we want to know what you think.        We want to know
13         what your concerns are.
14                 As the session goes on we would like to have an exact
15         record of what people say and that is the reason why we
16         have our shorthand writers, who are sitting at the table
17         there.
18                 We are planning to continue until lunch-time, if we
19         can, without a break.     If you want to go out while our
20         session is going on please do so, there is no problem
21         about that, but it would help, of course, if people left
22         quietly and if you wish to come back take your invitation
23         letter with you so that the people on the door let you in.
24
25                 As the session goes on we want people to speak
26         freely.     Of course, this is not a court of law, you will
27         not need to be invited to speak by me or anybody else and
28         we want everybody who wants to say something to have the
29         chance to say it.     Therefore, because we have got our
30         shorthand writers here and because we need a full record
31         of what people say it is important that we only have one
32         person speaking at a time.       We ask that people use the
33         radio mike, which Mike is holding over there and Mike will
34         bring the mike round to people who want to speak and you
35         can show you want to speak by standing up or raising your
36         hand or in any other way.     All these things will help us,


                                        2
 1       we hope they will help you, they will help the shorthand
 2       writers .
 3             Before we all start Sir Murray has a few words to say
 4        about the Scrutiny and then it will be over to you to say
 5       what you want and ask what you want to ask.       Lord Justice
 6        Stuart-Sraith.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Good morning, everybody.     I thought
 8        it would help if I started by outlining the task that the
 9       Horae Secretary has given me to do and how I see the way in
10       which this morning here fits into that.
11             I expect that all of you have seen a copy of my terms
12       of reference which I have been given by the Home
13        Secretary.    They are perhaps a little complicated but in
14       fact they boil down really to two things.
15             First,   I must look at all the information that people
16       are now coming forward with to see whether it is fresh
17       evidence about the disaster.     Second,   I must decide
18       whether to recommend that any fresh evidence that I find
19        justifies a new public inquiry, new inquest or any other
20       kind of legal proceedings or action by the authorities.
21             It is a very important and serious task.       Nobody
22       coming to this issue for the first time - as I have done
23        since my appointment at the end of June - can fail to be
24       impressed by the dignified and dedicated way in which the
25       families of those who died have conducted themselves since
26       then.
27             I know that you will accept that I have to look
28       rigorously at all the information which is presented to me
29       to see that it is fresh evidence or not.       I will be
30        looking just as rigorously at what I am told by other
31       people, the police, the coroner's office and the emergency
32        services.
33             Of course I have come to no conclusions as yet.         I do
34        not expect to do so for some time but I think it is
35        important that we should all understand at the outset
36        exactly what is meant by fresh evidence in the context of


                                      3
 1   this Scrutiny.
 2        As we all know, there have been a lot of legal and
 3   other proceedings already.       We have had Lord Taylor's
 4   Inquiry.    There have been inquests on everybody that died.
 5   There has been a judicial review of some of those inquests
 6   in the Divisional Court and the Attorney General has
 7   considered applications for fresh inquests from some of
 8   the families.    The prosecuting authorities and the police
 9   disciplinary authorities have considered prosecution and
10   disciplinary proceedings against police officers.
11        Any fresh evidence must be evidence which was not
12   available or not was presented to these various inquiries,
13   courts or prosecuting authorities.       But it is not just
14   evidence from people who had not come forward before, it
15   has to lead somewhere and to show that the outcome of the
16   legal procedures that have taken place might have been
17   different or that those responsible for instituting
18   criminal or disciplinary proceedings might have taken
19   different decisions.
20        More than 50,000 people were present at Hillsborough.
21   Many of those were in and around the area, most of them
22   witnessed some part of what happened.       The police took
23   over 3,500 statements and 174 people gave evidence to Lord
24   Taylor's Inquiry.    No two people would necessarily see the
25   same thing or recollect exactly the same thing, but Lord
26   Taylor had no difficulty in establishing what had
27   happened.
28        Evidence which is broadly in line with what has
29   already been said, even if it tends to support one view or
30   the other on controversial questions, will not be of much
31   help me.
32        I think it might help if I remind you of the broad
33   conclusions that the legal and other proceedings have
34   reached over the years:
35        First, there was the Inquiry conducted by Lord
36   Taylor. That was a very through and wide ranging inquiry


                                  4
 1   designed to find out what had happened at Hillsborough and
 2   why.     It is not difficult to discern what happened.
 3           At about 2.50 the central pens of the Leppings Lane
 4   Terraces were full or nearly full.       At 2.52 Gate C was
 5   opened to relieve the dangerous pressure outside the
 6   turnstiles.     The result was that some 2,000 supporters
 7   came through the gate in a relatively short time.          Most
 8   went through the tunnel to pens 3 and 4.       The result was a
 9   crush of people substantially exceeding the safe capacity
10   of those pens, with the terrible consequences that we all
11   know.
12           The question of why the disaster occurred was more
13   complex.     The first question was why the police lost
14   control of the crowd outside the turnstiles.       This was
15   controversial.     The police said it was due to the
16   unexpected late arrival of a large number of supporters,
17   many of whom were determined to get into the ground on
18   time come what may.     They said that there was a larger
19   number     than usual affected by drink, that there were a
20   considerable number of instances of bad behaviour and that
21   many people did not have tickets.       The position was
22   exacerbated by people not knowing where to go through poor
23   signposting.
24           The police said that they could not stop those at the
25   back pushing forward and crushing those at the front.
26   They said they could not have anticipated such a large
27   unco-operative crowd in the last half hour before the
28   game.
29           The other side of the picture was given by the
30   supporters, and 50 or so gave evidence to Lord Taylor.
31   Many of them criticised the policing, particularly
32   compared with the similar operations in 1988.
33           Lord Taylor rejected the view advanced by the police.
34   He accepted that there was a small minority of supporters
35   who were affected by drink or determined to get in at all
36   costs and not co-operate.        But he concluded that the


                                  5
 1   police should have foreseen that substantial numbers would
 2   arrive after 2.30 and should have taken more effective
 3   steps to prevent a crushing build up in the restricted
 4   area by the Leppings Lane turnstiles.
 5        The critical question what was happened inside the
 6   ground.   Lord Taylor concluded that the influx of
 7   supporters going through Gate C after 2.52 should not have
 8   been allowed to go down the tunnel.       The police should
 9   have blocked the tunnel off and diverted people to the
10   wing pens.   He described their failure to do this as a
11   blunder of the first magnitude.       It involved a failure by
12   police to appreciate that the pens 3 and 4 were already
13   full and that the great majority of those going through
14   Gate C would go into them.       People could not find their
15   own level, they could not move to the side pens.
16        So Lord Taylor was highly critical of the police
17   operation.   He was also critical of the City Council in
18   relation to the Safety Certificate, which was thoroughly
19   unsatisfactory so far as the capacity of the West Terraces
20   once the radial fences had been installed, were concerned.
21        He was also critical of the club and their engineers.
22   The layout at Leppings Lane of the forecourt and
23   turnstiles was quite inadequate to cope with so many
24   people.   There was no satisfactory method of monitoring
25   how many people went into individual pens except by a
26   visual check.   The signposting, information on the tickets
27   and stewarding was inadequate so that many people did not
28   know where to go or that there was any alternative to
29   going down the tunnel.   Barrier 125 that collapsed was of
30   insufficient strength.   The crush barriers were poorly
31   placed and the gates in the perimeter fence were too
32   small.
33        Lord Taylor also considered the response of the
34   emergency services.   He criticised the police for not
35   appreciating earlier than they did was what was happening
36   and not summoning the emergency services earlier.       There


                                  6
 1   was no criticism of the services themselves, except by two
 2   doctors and Lord Taylor specifically refuted their
 3   criticisms.
 4   The Inquests
 5        The Inquests took far longer than the Taylor Inquiry
 6   but their scope was more limited.     As in all other
 7   inquests the Coroner was concerned with the questions of
 8   who the deceased were, when, where and how they died.
 9        The law on inquests allows coroners and their juries
10   only a limited choice of verdicts.     In practice the
11   Hillsborough inquests could have only two possible
12   verdicts: unlawful killing and accidental death.        Unlawful
13   killing is equivalent to manslaughter, not just negligence
14   or even negligence sufficient to give rise to civil
15   liability.     As we all know, the verdict in respect of
16   everybody who died at Hillsborough was accidental death.
17        The Coroner pointed out that a verdict of accidental
18   death is in no way inconsistent with the deaths having
19   been caused by negligence or breach of duty.     The Chief
20   Constable has paid compensation to those who were injured
21   and the families of those who were killed on a basis of
22   full liability.     I have not seen any formal admission of
23   liability by the police.     On the other hand they have
24   never contested that they are liable.
25        Many of the criticisms of the Hillsborough inquests
26   were considered in the judicial review proceedings by the
27   Divisional Court in November 19 9 3 and were not accepted by
28   that Court.     I cannot act as a Court of Appeal from the
29   Divisional Court.
30        I know that the many of you were disappointed with
31   the inquest verdicts and were critical of a number of
32   aspects of the inquests, both in the manner in which they
33   were conducted and the decisions of the Coroner.        What I
34   will be looking for in connection with the inquest
35   verdicts is whether there is any fresh evidence which
36   might show that some or all of the verdicts of accidental


                                  7
 1   death should be quashed and a fresh inquest ordered.
 2          I will also be looking at the decisions which were
 3   made by the prosecuting and disciplinary authorities,
 4   namely, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Police
 5   Complaints Authority.     I must consider whether there is
 6   fresh evidence which, if they had known of it, might have
 7   caused them to reach different decisions.     If there is I
 8   will invite them, through my report, to reconsider their
 9   decisions.    I will also consider whether the fresh
10   evidence discloses any other possible offences that might
11   merit prosecution.
12          Finally I must tell you that since my appointment I
13   have read the evidence given to Lord Taylor's Inquiry.        I
14   have watched the video tapes recording the events of that
15   day.    I have seen the Cook Report television programme and
16   that made by Granada Television.     I have also read Lord
17   Taylor's report and much else besides, including a number
18   of letters from many of you.
19          It is impossible for anybody who has done that not to
20   be profoundly moved by the appalling tragedy that occurred
21   and not to have the greatest sympathy with all of you who
22   have been bereaved.     I wanted to come to Liverpool, not
23   only to tell you that, but to try and explain what I can
24   and cannot do and to give you an opportunity to tell me of
25   any evidence that you may think will assist.
26          I have had written and oral representations from the
27   Family Support Group and their counsel, and I am arranging
28   to see the witnesses they have referred to me to including
29   Mr. Houldsworth and Dr. Walker.
30           I have arranged to meet a number of you individually
31   and in families who have asked for an opportunity to speak
32   to me yourselves.     If any of you here have not arranged
33   such a meeting and want to tell me anything now is your
34   opportunity to do so.
35          I have come here to listen to what you have to say,        I
36   have not made up my mind about the matter, obviously, and


                                  8
 1        so far as I am concerned the issue decided by Lord Taylor
 2        in the way that I have outlined it is not something which
 3        is open to review.     He came to the conclusion as to the
 4        cause of the tragedy and I see no reason to depart from
 5        that.     I have read the evidence which was given before
 6        him, it seems to me to support the conclusions to which he
 7        came.        I know that some of you may have felt a little
 8        upset by a flippant remark that I made to Mr. Hammond a
 9        few moments ago.     I am sorry if you did take offence at
10        that, it was not intended to be a serious remark in any
11        way.     It is not in any way an indication of my thinking up
12        to now, as I have just tried to point out to you.         I
13        accept fully the conclusions which Lord Taylor reached in
14        his very careful examination and they appear to me to be
15        supported by the evidence.
16                Having said that,   I hope that you, particularly those
17        of you who are not coming to see me individually, will
18        feel free to say what you want.      This is not a public
19        meeting, only those families concerned are        here so I hope
20        you will feel free to say whatever you want.
21                I know it may be difficult for you to know precisely
22        what evidence may be relevant,      I am afraid   that is a
23        matter for me to decide but the best thing you can do is
24        to tell me what you think, what you feel and if you know
25        of any witnesses who could be helpful to let me know who
26        they are.         Evidence really has to come from witnesses
27        who have seen something with their own e y e s .    It is not
28        usually sufficient simply to have a second-hand report of
29        what they say.     So if you know of anybody who has seen
30        something that you think is material then I want to know
31        who that person is and what they are likely to be able to
32        say.     Who wants to go first?
33   MRS. ROBINSON:     My name's Rose Robinson.    I would like to
34        comment, you fully support Lord Taylor's report in which
35        he criticised the police and other bodies.        One of the
36        bodies he criticised was the City Council, this was well


                                         9
 1        before the inquest.     As the City Council employ Dr. Stefan
 2        Popper do you not think this demonstrates a conflict of
 3        interest when the Coroner was employed by the City Council
 4        who were actually criticised by Lord Taylor's report and
 5        yet he oversaw the inquest?
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I know that this is a matter which
 7        has concerned many of you.        It was a subject,   I think, of
 8        criticism before the Divisional Court.        I think the way I
 9        see proceedings going this morning is not that I am going
10        to answer questions,    I am not proposing to do that.         I
11        think my views about what happened at the inquest and so
12        on are to be reserved until later.        So if I seem to duck
13        the question,    I am ducking the question.
14             I want to hear what you have to say about anything
15        which affects the matters I have dealt with.          Do you
16        understand?
17   MRS. ROBINSON:     I do understand and as long as you are aware of
18        that.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I am aware of that fact,      I am also
20        aware that it was a matter considered by the Divisional
21        Court, and, as I pointed out, I am not a Court of Appeal,
22        I am afraid,    I may be a Lord Justice of Appeal but I am
23        not sitting as a Court of Appeal and this Scrutiny is not
24        an appeal from the Divisional Court.
25   MISS BROOKS:     My name is Louise Brooks,    sister of Andrew Mark
26        Brooks.     I would like to know why you made that comment
27        this morning because I am every upset about that because
28        my brother was actually being crushed before ten to two
29        (sic).    The majority of the people who were being crushed
30        were at the front.     Now, they were obviously in that
31        ground well before the other people who were late
32        arriving.     Those people who were late arriving were due to
33        roadworks, it wasn't because they were dawdling or they
34        had just come out of the pub.
35                I can't believe you could make a comment like that on
36        the television.     People have got such a perception of what


                                       10
 1        Liverpool people are like.           I don't come from Liverpool,
 2        and I will be quite honest, they have been absolutely
 3        fantastic to me.        I absolutely think the Support Group
 4        have been wonderful.
 5                We need to make sure that people d o n 't get the wrong
 6        idea about u s .      I'm very annoyed about it and I would like
 7        to know why my brother was being crushed before ten to
 8        three because it just isn't on.           They did not arrive late
 9        at that ground and I have got photographic evidence to
10        support t h a t .
11                I would also like to make another comment.        I have
12        also got photographic evidence showing that my brother had
13        a bin-liner over his head in the temporary gymnasium
14        (sic).     I would also like to comment on a policeman who
15        was in South Yorkshire Police blatantly lied to my family
16        saying he tried to resuscitate my brother and he didn't.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Who was that?
18   MISS BROOKS:     Police Sergeant Peter Walton.        I am also trying
19        to trace two other witnesses who have not come forward
20        yet, I believe that they hold a lot of information.           I
21        have gone in the press and on T.V. and I still can't trace
22        them.     I have another witness, Mr. Brian Johnston, who
23        actually tried to resuscitate Andrew.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Have you got a statement or
25        anything from him?
26   MISS BROOKS:     Yes,    I have indeed, yes.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Would you let Mr. Bone have a copy
28        of that?
29   MISS BROOKS:     I will.     I would also like to state that my
30        brother was being sick on the football pitch at ten to
31        four.     I have witness statements in my file stating that
32        Andrew was in the temporary gym (sic) being certified dead
33        between quarter to four and ten past four.           There is no
34        exact time of death for Andrew and I don't understand how
35        if a doctor is certifying death they cannot be precise
36        with the timings, where there are some people in this room


                                          11
 1        who have got exact times of death.      When you certify
 2        somebody dead you actually give a time.       I would like to
 3        know what time my brother died.
 4             There is an awful lot of other information, which I
 5        don't want discuss, which obviously will be in my
 6        submission, but I would like to stress that my brother was
 7        being crushed before ten to three and I've got a
 8        photograph to prove that and he did not arrive at that
 9        ground late and he certainly was not drunk.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Are you one of the people that is
11        coming to see me individually?
12   MISS BROOKS:   No, I haven't had an invitation.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    You raise rather a lot of points
14        there.
15   MISS BROOKS:   I have got even more than that actually,     I can't
16        think off the top of my head.     I am going to make some
17        very, very serious allegations.     There are other things
18        which I am actually having investigated.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    About what?
20   MISS BROOKS:   To do with photographs.      Sir, I believe they have
21        been tampered with but I h a v e n 't got that proof at the
22        moment,   I'm having that actually looked into.     Please can
23        you answer to me why you made that comment this morning
24        regarding football fans arriving late?
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I made the comment and I now regret
26        that I made it.    It was an entirely flippant remark.        I
27        came down and I saw Mr. Hammond and there did not appear
28        to be many people around.    I thought maybe not people were
29        going to turn up because I could not see them outside and
30        I did not know they were up here, so I thought perhaps
31        they were going to turn up at the last minute.
32   MISS BROOKS:    I mean with a comment like that how do we know
33        that, you know, you're impartial to this?       The impression
34        I got, I'm speaking for myself now not for anybody else,
35        the impression I got if you're making comments like that
36        how can we expect a fair trial, if we do have a trial?


                                      12
 1        How do we know that you h a v e n 11 been swung in one
 2        direction?
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     You are not having a trial, this is
 4        not a trial.
 5   MISS BROOKS:    No, I know, but I mean---
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     It is an examination of fresh
 7        evidence, that is what I am looking for.        I am afraid you
 8        have to accept from me that I am impartial,       I have been a
 9        judge a very long time.     The Home Secretary and the Lord
10        Chancellor appointed me because they think that I am an
11        impartial person.     I hope that my record shows that.
12             I am afraid if people are going to interpret every
13        single comment that I make in a highly sensitive way then
14        so be it, I am afraid you may get that impression.           It is
15        not the impression I intend to give.        I can assure you I
16        have not made up my mind about this, there is far too much
17        that I do not yet know, that is one of the reasons why I
18        have come here, to listen to what you have to say about
19        the evidence.
20             I do want to emphasise that what I am looking for is
21        evidence of something which has not so far come to light
22        and something new which may affect the decisions which
23        have already been taken in the way I have indicated.
24             I am sorry that we have got off on a wrong foot.           As
25        I say, I apologise for making a flippant remark but if
26        people are going to interpret every comment that I make
27        in, as it were, a hostile way we shall never get anywhere.
28
29   MISS BROOKS:    There is one more concern I have got, it is
30        regarding something called VRM/2, which is a video
31        recording of the mortuary.        I have actually spoken to Mr.
32        Bone about this about three tim e s .     South Yorkshire
33        Police:    I actually started asking for all correspondence
34        before Mr. Straw's announcement about this Scrutiny and I
35        was actually receiving material within 2 days of my
36        request.     It is now some, what,    12 weeks and I still


                                       13
 1        haven't received information.
 2             Now when I first asked for a copy of VRM/2 timings
 3        from 02.08 to 02.12 inclusive and 02.17.       I was told that
 4        I could have that information, then I was told that I
 5        couldn't.    This went on about eight times.    This is
 6        speaking to P.C. Ken Greenway at South Yorkshire Police.
 7        I asked him what it was, why I couldn't have the
 8        information.
 9             After discussions with them he apparently sent me
10        some photographs, which should have related to those
11       various times.     After looking at those photographs they
12        are not the ones which I asked for.     They state that they
13        are and they are not because the person who should be seen
14        on these pictures is not in these photographs.
15             Now they actually offered to send a car - I was
16        living in Bromsgrove in Worcestershire at the time, they
17       offered to send a car from South Yorkshire Police to
18        collect me in Bromsgrove to go and view this video, but on
19        one condition; nobody connected with Hillsborough was to
20        attend with me.    I would like that matter investigated as
21       to what is so special about VRM/2 why I cannot have access
22       to it because what I find very strange is when it's
23        convenient for certain people they —     everything is timed,
24        everybody says: they were all dead by quarter past three,
25       blah, blah, blah.     But they have not got times of in the
26        gym when they are certifying people dead and I do not
27        understand why they did not time, you know, serious
28       matters like that.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Can you just pause a moment so that
30        I can try and answer some of these points.      Let us deal
31        with the question of the certification of death.       I hope
32        that you do realise that when a doctor certifies death all
33        that it means is that at that particular moment that
34        person is dead.    They are not able to say that he died 5
35        minutes,    10 minutes, half an hour and so on beforehand.
36        It is, I think, impossible to say precisely when any


                                      14
 1         particular person died.     It is quite clear that many of
 2         them were dead probably when they were brought out of the
 3         pens, equally     some were not, we know that some survived
 4         several days, certainly some hours.     So the time of the
 5         certification of death is really not very helpful,     save
 6         only to show that by that time the person was dead.        So
 7         please do not think that somebody is alive until the time
 8         they are certified dead, that is not so.
 9                 So far as the video film of what was happening in the
10         temporary mortuary is concerned I have seen that film, it
11         is a pretty distressing film.     I think the reason why the
12         police have been reluctant to show it to people is because
13         it is very distressing and it shows not only the dead
14         bodies of the particular person who is interested but all
15         the others.
16                 I would actually very much hope that you did not want
17         to see that film.
18   MISS BROOKS:     I have got those photographs,   some of them, of my
19         brother, but with regards to VRM/2 Dr. Bull, who was the
20         doctor who pronounced my brother dead, going back to his
21         previous witness statements stating what he actually did
22         that day basically it is impossible for Dr. Bull to be in
23         that temporary gym(sic) at the times he states.      The
24         Bionic Man could not have done what he did that day.       He
25         states he examined 40 people and, you know, resuscitated
26         at least a dozen.    You cannot do that in 35 minutes, it is
27         just impossible.
28                 That is why I would really like to know what time my
29         brother was certified dead because I truly do not believe
30         that Andrew was certified dead between quarter to four and
31         ten past four.     I have really tried to work it out, you
32         know, with the timing and I don't believe that he was, Dr.
33         Bull was actually in the gymnasium at that time.      This is
34         why I would like to know--
35   MR.   BONE:    Are you going to make all these points in your
36         submission to us, Louise?


                                       15
 1   MISS BROOKS:      I am indeed.
 2   MR.   BONE:     These are all things we want to look into very
 3         closely as part of our Scrutiny and I can assure you we
 4         will be doing so.        We have discussed this before, as you
 5         know, and we will be looking at what you say with great
 6         care with a view to sorting out all these problems as          they
 7         come up.     I wonder if other people could---
 8   MISS BROOKS:      Yes.
 9   MR.   BONE:     Thank you very much indeed for your contribution,
10         Louise.
11   MR.   If I can make a comment on what she's saying there.
12   MR.   BONE:     Can we have your name, please?
13   MR.   GLOVER:     I'm John Glover.     Just to make a comment on what
14         the lady is saying.        I actually went through two High
15         Court cases    to get access to that video that she's talking
16         about and I was not allowed to see it myself.       I have     been
17         fighting for eight years now, every single day for eight
18         years and I want to know who the doctor is that tried to
19         revive my son.       He is unknown.   I know for a fact that
20         doctor will be on that video and they will not show it to
21         me.     These are the things we are putting up with with
22         Hillsborough.
23   MR.   BONE:     The doctor tried to revive your son in the
24         mortuary?
25   MR.   GLOVER:     Inside the mortuary.
26   MR.   BONE:     Inside the gym?
27   MR.   GLOVER:     My other son was with the doctor and that doctor
28         is unknown.        That's according to the South Yorkshire
29         Police.
30   MR.   BONE:     That is one we will look at as well.     Thank you
31         very much.     Mrs. Sephton wants to say something I think.
32   MRS. SEPHTON:      My name is Mrs. Sephton and my son Andrew was
33         killed at Hillsborough.        I have been going through the
34         first day of the mini-inquest where Dr. Popper makes a
35         statement that people have criticised the gymnasium and
36         its use as a temporary mortuary.        He says he does not know


                                          16
 1         who thought of it, the idea of it becoming a temporary-
 2         mortuary but it was a marvellous idea to him and yet I
 3         have a statement by Chief Superintendent Addis who says
 4         that Dr. Popper decided it would become a temporary
 5         mortuary.
 6   MR.   BONE:     Chief Superintendent who?
 7   MRS. SEPHTON:      Addis.   A-D-D-I-S.    I am also extremely
 8         concerned about the amount of involvement that Dr. Popper
 9         had.     To me a Coroner---
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I think this is the same point that
11         Mrs. Robinson made, is it?
12   MRS. SEPHTON:      I don't know,    I don't think so.   The amount of
13         involvement that Dr. Popper had pre-inquest, the man was
14         there on the night with the police, he was there on the
15         night with probably a lot of other witnesses and a lot of
16         other bodies who were actually working there.         To me it
17         seems unprecedented that this man actually was taken from
18         his office, brought down to the gymnasium to approve, to
19         actually approve of the conditions there.         Now, surely
20         under that it's two things: firstly, he was witnessing an
21         awful lot.     The decision had been his to turn it into a
22         temporary mortuary.      Did he make a statement to the
23         police? Because I really believe that everybody that was
24         involved in that should have made a statement to the
25         poli c e .
26                 Dr. Popper should not have been reliant on simply
27         acting as a Coroner and then quoting to us coronial law
28         when he himself was an actual participant in that
29         gymnasium.     He actually went round and approved what was
30         what.     I have never -- I am not acquainted with the law
31         and I definitely am not acquainted with law of inquests,
32         but I would say that it is totally unprecedented that a
33         Coroner should have so much involvement and then actually
34         be allowed to sit at the inquest.        Thank you.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I do not know whether I can answer
36         that.     I mean the Coroner is entitled to be and should be


                                          17
 1        involved in the inquiry into the deaths right from almost
 2        the earliest moment.
 3   MRS. SEPHTON:   The inquiry, sir, yes.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I think that one of the rather
 5        curious things about coroners is that a coroner's inquest
 6        is not like ordinary litigation or a trial,      it is what we
 7        all an inquisitorial process.    The coroner is the inquirer
 8        into it, he has a great deal of discussion as to how he
 9        will go about what he does and although he is subject to
10        control by the Divisional Court if he acts illegally or if
11        he makes decisions which no reasonable coroner can make I
12        think that it is right to say that precisely how the
13        coroner deals with the matter, what evidence he calls and
14        so on is very largely a matter for him.       So I rather doubt
15        whether that is a ground for saying that there should be a
16        new inquest.
17   MRS. SEPHTON:   Sir, I agree with you.   He made that quite clear
18        that virtually his words were, not verbatim but the
19        attitude was:   In the Coroner's Court the Coroner is king.
20        But the Coroner was also a participant in what went on in
21        that gymnasium, not as a coroner but as somebody who was
22        there to simply oversee that everything was in its place.
23        To me that is totally unprecedented.    I have never,
24        perhaps I am naive, perhaps before Hillsborough I was even
25        more naive, but I am very cynical of a man who has so much
26        involvement prior to the investigations into Hillsborough
27        and prior to the Inquiry into Hillsborough.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I think the question really that
29        you pose raises is when does the inquiry begin?       I think
30        the answer might be, Dr. Popper might say: the inquiry
31        begins as soon as I am notified of the deaths.
32   MRS. SEPHTON:   But not usually by such physically close
33        involvement.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I take your point.
35   MRS. SEPHTON:   I am sorry, sir, but I honestly do believe that
36        that is influential to him.


                                     18
 1   MR.   BONE:   You think Popper was too close to the police?
 2   MRS. SEPHTON:      I think he was far too close, yes, to the
 3         police, but I actually think that he was far too close to
 4         what went on prior to the inquest and prior to the West
 5         Midlands investigation.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I have got that point?
 7   MRS. SEPHTON:      He appears to have had far too much say in what
 8         went on.     Another incident which also involves the Coroner
 9         is the fact that he stated categorically that no evidence
10         would be taken which would        throw various —   you know, a
11         bad light    on people and -- there again I am not voting
12         verbatim,    I'm simply trying to remember the facts off the
13         top of my head, but basically he said: we are here to find
14         out how, why and when or how, why and what.         We were not
15         allowed criticisms, we were told: it won't be dealt with
16         if it is criticised or if it is in the form of a criticism
17         and yet this same man let Roger Marshall go on ad nauseam
18         about the behaviour of fans, when in point of fact if they
19         were the ground rules that the Coroner had set it should
20         have been said immediately Mr. Marshall started being
21         abusive about the fans, he should have been told to sit
22         down and be quiet.     The Coroner let him go on at great
23         length and, as I say, ad nauseam and then said to the
24         jury: disregard.     Sir, once it is planted in your head you
25         cannot disregard it.     He set those ground rules himself.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am aware of this criticism,      it
27         was a matter which was raised in the Divisional Court.            I
28         do not know that I can answer all these questions for you.
29         I am aware that there were a large number of criticisms of
30         the way the Coroner conducted the inquest and his
31         involvement in it.     What I am really looking for is not so
32         much criticisms of the procedure.
33   MRS. SEPHTON:      Please forgive me, I am not criticising,      I am
34         making a statement.     I am saying the Coroner was not
35         impartial.     I'm sorry I have gone all round the world to
36         tell you but that is what I'm stating.


                                        19
 1   MR.   BONE:    We have a lady over here who wishes to say
 2         something I think.
 3   MRS. FOX:     What is the actual purpose of an inquest?
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       The purpose of an inquest is to
 5         find out who the person is who died, how, when and where
 6         he died or she died.       I am not sure that that is the right
 7         order but, when, where and how.
 8   MR.   FOX:     Then can you possibly explain to me why 8 years
 9         later I still don't know how my son died?         They have no
10         evidence —    my son was crushed at Hillsborough but he was
11         not there.     He had picture identification, he had a
12         driving licence, he had an organ donor card, which, you
13         know, being a young lad, a very healthy young lad who
14         should have been given priority because he had already
15         offered to give his organs away, he was not even taken to
16         hospital, he just didn't exist.
17                 There is still nobody that can tell me —     you know,
18         they couldn't even find him on a video or at least that's
19         what they told me.     So 8 years later I still don't know
20         and yet he's had an inquest.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Have you asked the police for what
22         they call the body file?
23   MRS. FOX:     Yes, they actually took me and showed me a video,
24         they asked me to find him because they couldn't.           They
25         asked me to attend and watch a video to see if I could
26         find him because they couldn't.
27   MR.   BONE:     This was the video people in the mortuary,       in the
28         gymnasium, was it?
29   MRS . FOX:     No, this wasn't   the     one   in the    mortuary, this was
30         the one in the actual      pen     because he      was one of — there
31         was 6 people, according to the Inspector, that they
32         couldn't trace and my      son     was   one of    them.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Iwill look at the evidence     that
34         the police have about t h i s .    I have looked at a number of
35         these body files and obviously the information in relation
36         to some people is much fuller than it is with others.              I


                                         20
 1        think one can forget about the bits of leaving home at 11
 2        o'clock in the morning and so on but you come to the time
 3        when they are seen to go into the ground and usually there
 4        is some evidence from a friend, or something of that sort,
 5        who went in with them.     There is then very often evidence
 6        as to where they were last seen alive.         It may be that in
 7        your son's case there is no such evidence, all that is
 8        known is that he was found in a particular place.
 9               There is usually then some evidence of people who
10        have taken the person out, whether they are dead or alive,
11        and, of course, at the time that that was done the people
12        who are doing it, whether they were police, fans,
13        ambulance people, what have you, had no idea who the
14        person was.
15   MRS. FOX:   He had picture identification in his pocket and his
16        driving licence but they never notified —         they hadn't
17        even notified me that he was dead.         I phoned up the
18        emergency line but it was friends at 11 o'clock at night
19        that actually phoned me and said that they had actually
20        found him.    The police never informed me at all.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I know there was a lot of criticism
22        and, please believe me,    I understand it, that people were
23        notified late or not notified.
24   MRS. FOX:    In a normal accident,     if someone has an accident
25        they get in touch with the next of kin, especially when
26        they have got identification on them.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I cannot explain,     I am afraid, why
28        that was not done.    It was just a massive---
29   MRS. FOX:   A massive shambles.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART SMITH:             disaster which overwhelmed
31        people,   I am afraid, and things like that happen.
32   MRS. FOX:   According to the autopsy he fell on numerous
33        occasions, he fell numerous occasions and picked himself
34        up numerous occasions and that basically is it.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Mrs. Fox,     I will look at the file
36        in his case that the police have and if you have not seen


                                       21
 1         it I see no reason why you should not see it.         The answer,
 2         I think,    is that the file is the best evidence that the
 3         police have managed to put together.      Why they did not put
 4         on the file the identification evidence that he had on him
 5         I do not know, but normally speaking the identification,           I
 6         think I am right in saying, has to be by somebody who
 7         knows the deceased because it is possible that somebody
 8         else is carrying credit cards, or whatever it may be,
 9         driving licence---
10   MRS. FOX:     Not when it's picture identification, photographic
11         evidence.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I will try and look into that but I
13         am afraid that one is going to be met with the problem
14         that in some cases the chain of identification is not
15         complete.     I think you must understand that that may     be
16         the case.     I do not know whether I have answered your
17         question, probably not, but I will certainly try and        find
18         anything more about it.      Yes, Mr. Glover?
19   MR.   GLOVER:     The thing I would like to ask you, sir, is---
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You are coming to see me?
21   MR.   GLOVER:Tomorrow,   I am making a point on that tomorrow,
22         like.     I've got that much stuff there's no way could I
23         speak to you in half an hour about what I've got.         Will we
24         get an opportunity to speak to you again?
25   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH:   We will see how we go tomorrow.
26   MR.   GLOVER:     I've got quite a bit of stuff.      One of the main
27         things,    I've got a couple of statements now from a couple
28         of supporters where it was never used at the inquest that
29         people who had stand tickets, now, stand tickets, that's
30         actually sitting down upstairs, they had stand tickets and
31         they were directed outside by the police to go through the
32         tunnel.     There has got to be negligence in that where the
33         police are directing people and no wonder they all went
34         through the tunnel because people from the stands were
35         going through there and t h a t 's one of the reasons why the
36         stands were, parts were empty.


                                        22
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Which stands were empty?
 2   MR.   GLOVER:     The West Stand, there was a lot of room in the
 3         West Stand but when they were asking the police for
 4         directions for where they had to go because of sign
 5         inadequacy they were directed through the tunnel .
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You have got statements from these
 7         witnesses, have you?
 8   MR.   GLOVER:     I can get statements from them, I have been told
 9         I can get statements from them but when I brought this up
10         at the inquest they didn't want to know because, you know,
11         even —     there is other points like the roadworks on the
12         Snake Pass, they brought it out that there was no
13         road-blocks at all, whatsoever travelling from Liverpool
14         to Sheffield and there was loads of them.     We are just
15         normal people who say they have covered it up.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I have certainly read evidence    at
17         the Taylor Inquiry where there were examples of, I cannot
18         remember now if it was the police or stewards at the
19         bottom of those staircases directing people into the
20         tunnel by mistake.     There were instances of that,   I have
21         no doubt, and it was another example of things not going
22         right.     If you can provide statements from these people
23         then obviously I will look into it.
24   MR.   GLOVER:     That's the type of stuff you require?
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes, that is the sort of thing I am
26         looking for.     Let me say that there is already a good deal
27         of evidence or there is some evidence that this was
28         happening.     As I say, I have read evidence at the Taylor
29         Inquiry given by one or two supporters who said that they
30         were misdirected into the tunnel when they had stand
31         tickets.     So that is, in a sense, not altogether new.
32   MR.   GLOVER:     That's correct, sir, but the thing is, this
33         information was not given at the inquest,    it was given at
34         the Taylor.     They would not allow the Taylor Inquiry to be
35         used at the inquest and I think that was the one big
36         mistake that was made in all this.


                                        23
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Do you mean he did not allow the
 2         evidence to be read?
 3   MR.   GLOVER:    Only little excerpts from it when it suited him
 4         with the South Yorkshire police, but anything that was
 5         going to put any sort of blame or whatever on to somebody
 6         he would not allow it and he actually said,        "We will not
 7         be using the Taylor Inquiry at this inquest", that's in
 8         the transcripts.      What was the---
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Just pause for a moment.     I think
10         that some witnesses were cross-examined, were they not, on
11         the basis that what they were saying at the inquest was
12         different from what they said to Lord Taylor?          I have
13         certainly come across,      I think,   some cross-examination of
14         Duckenfield or Murray, one of those two, where something
15         that they said at the Taylor Inquiry was put to them, I am
16         not sure who it w a s .
17                 The Coroner did not prevent cross-examination on
18         inconsistent statements, did he?        Perhaps you do not
19         understand quite what I mean by that?
20   MR.   GLOVER:    No,    I don't understand what you mean exactly.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Normally if somebody has made a
22         statement, whether in writing or orally, and they then
23         give evidence which is inconsistent with that, they say
24         something completely different, they can be cross-examined
25         on their previous statement and obviously if they say: oh
26         well, yes,    I am sorry,   I had forgotten, what I said first
27         is correct, then that becomes their evidence.          If they
28         say: what I said before was wrong and what I am saying now
29         is correct then most people would say: this is a pretty
30         unreliable witness?       Do you follow?
31   MR.   GLOVER:    Yes.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Normally you can cross-examine
33         people on the basis of that.       Did the Coroner not allow
34         that?
35   MR.   GLOVER:    With the police officers, he actually said to the
36         police officers: anything which will incriminate you in


                                         24
 1         your evidence I will warn you do not have to answer the
 2         question.     That never got given to the Liverpool
 3         supporters.     We attended the inquest every single day in
 4         Sheffield, we travelled there every day.       It was
 5         unbelievable.     There was a another case where they spent
 6         nearly a full day talking about the Trafalgar Square Riots
 7         and the Old Green Mine r s .    What has that to go do with the
 8         death of 96 people in Hillsborough?       Nothing.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think that that is a very valid
10         criticism.
11   MR.   GLOVER:     It needs to be investigated because it was a P.R.
12         job for the police, the inquest.       That's all it was, a
13         P.R. job for the police.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Can I just deal with the point
15         about the incriminating question because last week I read
16         the evidence of the inquest of Duckenfield and Murray.
17         You are quite right that the Coroner, not infrequently,
18         says: that is an incriminating question.       But I think I am
19         right in saying that only on about one or two occasions
20         possibly was the question not answered.       So the witnesses,
21         in fact, did not take advantage of the warning.         What they
22         could have said was: I have been told by the Coroner I do
23         not have to answer that question,      I am not going to answer
24         it.
25               There are certainly some occasions,     I think I can
26         came across one or two, and quite frankly I had a certain
27         amount of sympathy with the witness because he had been
28         asked the same question a large number of times and he had
29         already answered it and he said:      I have given my answer,   I
30         am not going to say any more.       So my impression is, and if
31         I am wrong about this I would like you to tell me and
32         perhaps give me chapter and verse, that although the
33         Coroner was telling people that they did not have to
34         answer questions because they were incriminating in fact
35         the witness did not take any notice of it and went ahead
36         and answered the question.


                                          25
 1   MR.   GLOVER:    That's right.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Equally,   let me tell you that I
 3         have the impression that Mr. Duckenfield was quite evasive
 4         in answering the questions on occasions.         But these are
 5         all matters which were      available, the jury heard him
 6         giving evidence.     They   must have formed an impression
 7         about him.
 8   MR.   GLOVER:   There's another thing,       sir, which I would like
 9         you to answer.     The pathological evidence and the evidence
10         from the pathologist was that the they all received their
11         injuries by five past three,       I think I'm right in the
12         time, five past three.      We've got evidence now, on
13         photographic evidence that people were still alive at
14         eight minutes past three and we can prove that they didn't
15         die with the sudden crush of the        chest, they actually died
16         by being trampled on the floor.         We can prove that but we
17         need to be able to do it to you.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        There are two things here, are
19         there not?   There is the question of when the injuries
20         were received and when the person died and they are not
21         necessarily the same thing.        As I pointed out earlier,
22         there are quite clearly some cases where the injuries were
23         received before 3.15, or whatever the cut-off point was.
24   MR.   GLOVER:   Five past three.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        The Coroner took quarter past three
26         as the time by which everybody had received their
27         injuries. But he did not say that they were all dead by
28         3.15.
29   MR.   GLOVER:   No, he didn't say, no,he said        they went on to
30         die.    But the thing is he did say that every one of them
31         died of traumatic asphyxia or crush asphyxia and they
32         actually were in the crush about 15 seconds and then went
33         unconscious and wouldn't feel any pain.         But we've got
34         evidence of one young lad who was lying on the floor
35         screaming and he was alive underneath on the floor.           He
36         never died of the chest compression, he was on the floor.


                                         26
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Who was that?
 2   MR.   GLOVER:     I'll give you the name, it was Mrs.Stringer's
 3         son and we were actually studying it last night.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Mrs. Williams'    son?
 5   MR.   GLOVER:     No, Mrs. Stringer.
 6   MR.   BONE:     Of course, we are going to see Mrs. Stringer later.
 7
 8   MR.   GLOVER:     We've also got evidence of another lad who was
 9         alive and doesn't seem to be in any trouble at eight
10         minutes past three on the video.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Perhaps you can give me the names
12         of those when we see you.
13   MR.   GLOVER:     That's what I was saying —     that's why I just
14         feel, sir, within half an hour tomorrow we can't       get all
15         our stuff that we need to get to you.
16   MR.   BONE:     We will hear what we can tomorrow and talk again
17         about how we can talk later.
18   MR.   GLOVER:     I'll keep quiet now because as long as I can say
19         tomorrow.
20   MR.   BONE:     Thank you very much.    We have a couple of gentlemen
21         at the back who want to say something I believe.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am sorry, what is your name?
23   MR.   JOYNES:     Sir, Peter Joynes, lost his son Nicholas due to
24         criminal neglect.     It was about the question that arose
25         before, that the Coroner did say to senior police
26         officers: you don't have to answer that question because
27         it may incriminate you.     That is the point I wanted to
28         raise.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Sorry, what is the point you wanted
30         to make about it?
31   MR.   JOYNES:     That was the point that I wanted to emphasise,
32         that the Coroner did say to senior police officers: you
33         needn't answer the question in case it incriminates you.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The Coroner is in fact bound to
35         warn a witness that he need not answer a question which
36         tends to incriminate him.        I am bound to say I think,


                                        27
 1         having read some of the questions, that they did not all
 2         tend to incriminate him but the Coroner interpreted the
 3         risk of incrimination somewhat widely.      The point that I
 4         am seeking to make to you, and again if you think I am
 5         wrong about this because I have not read every word of
 6         that evidence because I was looking for something
 7         different, but my impression is that although the Coroner
 8         warned Mr. Duckenfield and Mr. Murray that they did not
 9         need to answer questions in fact they went ahead and
10         answered them.     Am I wrong about that?
11   MR.   JOYNES:    We only had one representative acting on our
12         behalf, whereas the other people there had counsel for all
13         departments.     It did come out that Mr. Duckenfield and Mr.
14         Murray so far as we were aware did not answer.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       The Family Support Group I think
16         have copies of the inquest transcripts.      Are you a member
17         of the Support Group?
18   MR.   JOYNES:     I am indeed.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       If there are a number of instances
20         where the witness refuse to answer perhaps you can let me
21         know, but if the question is truly an incriminating
22         question then (a) the Coroner as a matter of law is bound
23         to warn the witness that he does not have to answer it and
24         (b) the witness can refuse to answer it, but in practice
25         my impression is that they did not refuse to answer it,
26         they answered the question, although, as I have indicated,
27         I think Mr. Duckenfield in particular was rather evasive
28         about some of his answers.
29                 This is not really a matter of fresh evidence, this
30         is more a criticism of how the inquest was conducted.
31   MR.   JOYNES:    While I am on my feet may I just bring up two
32         points that although it wasn't fresh evidence, the first
33         point:    I go along with when you outline the build up to
34         the tragedy.     That was the pens 3 and 4 being full at
35         2.50.     I beg to differ on that I think they were full at
36         2.30 and overcrowded at 2.50.


                                        28
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Mr. Joynes, my summary was a very
 2         brief one, as you appreciate.
 3   MR.   JOYNES:    Yes,   I would just like to point out---
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      All I was saying was that by 2.50
 5         at least they were full.       There was a lot of different
 6         evidence about at what stage they were became full.             You
 7         must appreciate I am not a fresh judicial inquiry into
 8         this.     I am not going to re-open the whole judicial
 9         inquiry and reach different conclusions about it.             That is
10         not my job.
11   MR.   JOYNES:    Sir, after eight and a half long years of
12         fighting for justice I will find every avenue to bring the
13         perpetrators that are in my mind into a court of law and,
14         hopefully, before your good self.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       It is not for me to prosecute these
16         people.
17   MR.   JOYNES:    The second point is that the Police Complaints
18         Authority wanted to see Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
19         and Superintendent Murray to answer questions.          The South
20         Yorkshire Police took it upon themselves to retire Mr.
21         Duckenfield on ill health.          At a meeting I had with
22         Richard Wells, the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, he
23         did say to me that on no circumstances would Mr. Murray
24         take the can by himself,      so therefore they retired him.          I
25         would like to know what evidence the Police Complaints
26         Authority had against      those two men.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      They       initially charged them, as far
28         as I can recall, with neglect of duty, the Police
29         Complaints Authority.
30   MR.   JOYNES:    In your opinion,    sir, was it right for them to
31         retire in such circumstances?
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I am not sure that I can really go
33         into that.    There was    a lot of medical evidence      that Mr.
34         Duckenfield was not fit to continue.          I mean you may take
35         a rather cynical view of that but the decision was taken
36         that he was not fit and, as you probably know, the Police


                                          29
 1         Complaints people do not continue after somebody has
 2         ceased to be a member of the police force.             Whether or not
 3         one may agree with that is a different matter.             I can
 4         quite understand that    people may take the view that
 5         somebody who has been in neglect of duty,        if     that is the
 6         case and it really probably is without much doubt because
 7         the police, as I have indicated, accepted liability in
 8         negligence. Whether or not it is right that because
 9         somebody retires complaints procedures are dropped against
10         them is not a matter which I can really deal with.                It is
11         a very important question which really requires
12         Parliamentary consideration I would think probably.
13               I may have my own views about it, I think it is
14         unfortunate---
15   MR.   JOYNES:    You're not prepared to tell me?
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      No,    I cannot,   I don't    think I can
17         really.    It is not a matter for me to inquire into,             I am
18         afraid.
19   PROFESSOR SCRATON:     My name is Phil Scraton,       I am a Professor
20   of    Criminology and Criminal Justice Studies at Edge Hill
21         University College.
22               There are a lot of things I would like to say but I
23         want to say to begin with is that I think there might a
24         slight misapprehension on your part concerning the
25         abilities of families to cross-examination evidence at the
26         inquest.
27               This is the first time, to my knowledge,           in any
28         controversial death situation that inquests were split
29         into two halves.     There were the mini-inquest to which all
30         the individual families went, then there was the generic
31         inquest and the conversation up to now has focused
32         entirely on the generic inquest.
33               The mini-inquest, which was the opportunity for the
34         families to hear the circumstances in which their loved
35         ones died, were held almost a year before,         I'm sure you
36         are aware of t h a t .


                                       30
 1        If we start from the premise that the inquest is an
 2   opportunity to examine how, when and why somebody has
 3   died, and by that we mean the circumstances of death,
 4   effectively this entire inquest, which was so extensive
 5   and went on for so long, denied every single person in
 6   this room that right.     There is no question about that.
 7        When you say, a few seconds ago in answer to John
 8   Glover, that the inconsistencies in statements could
 9   actually be tested through cross-examination, that
10   opportunity was not afforded to any of these families.
11   When Mrs. Fox says that she has no information concerning
12   the death of her son she's not alone and the reason for
13   that is because they never had the opportunity to hear
14   about the circumstances in which their loved ones died.
15        How does this come about?     It comes about because
16   again in an unprecedented way the evidence concerning each
17   and every death was presented by a West Midlands' police
18   officer to the mini-inquest in his or her summary.      It
19   wasn't a summary of evidence taken factually, it was the
20   West Midland investigating forces'    interpretation.
21        As a result of that being put to the mini-inquest the
22   families were forbidden the right to cross-examination any
23   of that information because, quite obviously, the people
24   who made the original statements weren't there.     They were
25   told that those unanswered questions would be dealt with
26   at the generic inquest.
27        Not only did that not happen but the other
28   significant issue is that when they arrive at the generic
29   inquest they discover that any events that occur after
30   3.15 are not going to be allowable, permissible within the
31   court, although on some occasions the rule was flouted,
32   but that was the rule that applied; that 3.15, as you know
33   only too well, was the cut-off.
34        So what we have is a whole range of statements 8
35   years on now beginning to filter out from the South
36   Yorkshire police which many of the people in this room


                                 31
 1   have never seen before.     They are now reading the accounts
 2   of the deaths of their loved ones for the very first time.
 3   It might not be new evidence to the inquest, to the
 4   Coroner, it might not have been new evidence to Lord
 5   Taylor but it's new evidence to them, the very people who
 6   had that entitlement all along.
 7          My concern about this is that people were
 8   systematically denied the right to cross-examination that
 9   evidence.     There is no question about that.
10          This leads me on to my next and most significant
11   point.      It is your definition, with all due respect, of
12   fresh evidence.     There are two ways that we can look at
13   miscarriages of justice, the first one is to look at fresh
14   evidence, there must be new evidence brought before a
15   court in order to demonstrate that a miscarriage has taken
16   pla c e .
17          However, there is, as    you,     I'm sure, are only too
18   well aware, another route,          and that is if the quality of
19   the existing evidence and the disclosure of that evidence
20   is not consistent with the facts.
21          Many of the people in        this room are only now
22   receiving     fresh evidence to them.        What they are
23   beginning to discover, and I have seen much of this
24   myself, is that much of that evidence does not tie up, it
25   does not relate, it contradicts itself but they never had
26   the opportunity to have it cross-examined, they never had
27   those witnesses in a position where they could test it.
28   That is absolutely crucial.
29          The second issue is that we are also now beginning to
30   realise that a considerable amount of that evidence that
31   was gathered in the first place might actually be
32   unreliable.      So it's not fresh, it's old evidence but we
33   have to test its reliability.          We have to be sure that
34   that evidence was taken in the proper circumstances, by
35   the right people,     following the right procedures.        That is
36   another crucial issue in relation to this case.


                                    32
 1             Of course, one of the biggest problems in trying to
 2        come to terms with all of these issues for many of the
 3        families, certainly in terms of scrutinising some of that
 4        evidence myself, is that for those 8 years people have not
 5        had the right of disclosure.     There is no right of
 6        disclosure in terms of evidence that was put before the
 7        Taylor Inquiry or put before the Coroner's inquest where
 8        that evidence was not brought into the public domain.            In
 9        other words, there is a whole body of material that they
10        selected out that never saw the light of day.
11             My concern is now that people are beginning to see
12        that evidence for the first time and it is little wonder
13        that people want to view what actually went on in the
14        gymnasium.   They don't want to go through that because
15        they somehow want to go through a morbid process.         They
16       want it because they know that there is a range of
17       material that they have a right to that has never
18        previously entered the public domain.
19             Unless this Scrutiny covers all of those issues I
20        believe that,    like all that's gone before, it will be
21        essentially flawed.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Thank you very much.    I have
23        arranged or am arranging to see you in London when you can
24        no doubt develop these matters.      What would assist me, I
25        think, particularly would be chapter and verse.      I am
26        looking for the fresh evidence which you say there is a
27        great deal of.     If there is that evidence then I want to
28        see it and to see to what extent it affects the question.
29             I am well aware that so far as the question in
30        relation to the video tapes are concerned it is the
31        contention on behalf of families that evidence was
32        suppressed, that incorrect evidence was given by the
33        police.   I am well aware of that.     I have listened to
34        submissions from counsel on that point,     I am going to see
35        Mr. Houldsworth about it and I quite accept, of course,
36        that if there is evidence which significantly undermines


                                      33
 1   what was said previously and shows that there has been
 2   flawed or dishonesty that may be a very relevant
 3   consideration.     I am well aware   of that.
 4        So it is not only evidence      in the sense that
 5   something completely new has come up.           If it is evidence
 6   which shows that previous evidence is completely wrong,
 7   particularly if it is dishonest      or fraudulent    then that,
 8   of course, is a matter of grave      concern.
 9        I think that in a situation like this you are bound
10   to get conflicting accounts of what      happened.     One only
11   has to look at the conflicting evidence which          was given on
12   behalf of the police in relation to why they lost control
13   of the crowd and the evidence given by the fans.           I have
14   indicated to you that I have read all the evidence about
15   that that was given before the Taylor Inquiry.           I have not
16   read all the evidence at the inquest about that and I am
17   not sure that I propose to do so.       I may have to but at
18   the moment I am not sure that it is necessary.
19        As far as I can see Lord Taylor's conclusions about
20   that were justified by the evidence      and I see     no reason to
21   reopen those issues again as to why      the police lost
22   control of the crowd.     I do not think that it would be
23   helpful to revisit those issues.       I have no doubt that
24   there are other people,    supporters who did not give
25   evidence to Lord Taylor, did not give evidence at the
26   inquest who will say much the same as all the other people
27   who gave evidence for the supporters.
28        Equally,    I have no doubt that the police and others
29   would come forward and give the account that they gave
30   before.   You have got a clear conflict of evidence there,
31   you have got clear findings by the Inquiry which was set
32   up to deal with them and I see no point in revisiting
33   those issues again.
34        So, equally, there will be people who have different
35   opinions as to how full the pens were at particular times.
36   Again, for my part,    I see no reason to doubt Lord Taylor's


                                 34
 1          findings on that.     They are clear and they are there.
 2               So the fact that there are witnesses who have not
 3          hitherto given evidence does not mean to say that there is
 4          necessarily fresh evidence.          I tried to explain that at
 5          the outset.
 6               I am sure you will understand that in a disaster of
 7          this sort, which was witnessed by so many people, it
 8          happened under so many peoples'         eyes, there are bound to
 9          be a large number of people who saw something that they
10          considered relevant but they have not given evidence.             So
11          please bear that in mind.          Mrs. Sephton?
12   MRS. SEPHTON:       Sir, you've said about the disaster and what
13          happened and loss of control of the police.           That was on
14          the terraces and that was seen by the public.           There were
15          two disasters that day, the second was turning the
16          gymnasium into a temporary mortuary and that was seen by
17          nobody.    Even the jury.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I have your point on that.
19   MRS.   SEPHTON:     But it has to be kept to, sir.        The 3.15
20          cut-off prevented everybody from finding out what happened
21          in there, including the bereaved.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Miss Brooks.
23   MISS BROOKS:      What I would like to know really is why Brian
24          Johnston was never called as a witness to the original
25          Inquiry?
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Who?
27   MISS BROOKS:      Brian Johnston, the man who attempted
28          resuscitation on Andrew.       When he could actually state
29          that Andrew was still alive at ten to four.           Just one
30          final last     comment really is with regard to the
31          photographs which I have got of the temporary mortuary
32          showing Andrew and other people with bin liners placed
33          over their heads and their bodies.          How could they
34          possibly do this before they were actually certified dead?
35          I can't see how someone can put a plastic bag over
36          somebody's head when they hadn't actually been certified


                                          35
 1         dead.     They could have actually been still been alive,
 2         which is quite possible and somebody has gone along and
 3         placed a piece of plastic over their faces.
 4   MR.   BONE:     Thank you, Louise.    I think Trevor Hicks wanted to
 5         say something and then we have a lady at the back.
 6   MR.   HICKS:     I will stand up, if I may.      There's about four
 7         points,    sir, altogether.    I am going to avoid anything
 8         involving Jenny and I because we will be seeing you
 9         tomorrow independently.
10                 I would just like to say in front of everybody,        it
11         may head off a lot of other questions.         One of our
12         difficulties still the moment is the body files are coming
13         out incomplete.     We are running against the wire, if I
14         quote our own examples, just purely as a means of example
15         and I will show you this tomorrow, you commented,           sir,
16         when we met on you on Tuesday that you were impressed with
17         the quality of the body files.         We think you may be
18         getting different body files to what we are getting.
19                 I know this only adds to the intrigue, if you like,
20         but I can state categorically in our own case that there
21         are a lot of statements missing from those body files and
22         obviously I'm sure that's the case with everybody else's.
23         So you must forgive us if we seem reluctant when we are
24         assured that these body files do contain all the
25         information.     One has to beg the question if they do why
26         can't we see it?
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Can I deal with the points as we go
28         along rather than dealing with them all at the end.            So
29         far as the body files are concerned I have only looked at
30         some sample cases,    I looked at one or two at random.            I
31         saw how they were made up.          I saw the sort of continuity
32         chart supported by the various statements, then the
33         photographic evidence and so on.          I may have been
34         fortunate that I looked at ones where there was good deal
35         of evidence but it did seem to me that a great deal of
36         trouble had been taken to chart the thing and to make sure


                                          36
 1         that it was taken through.
 2                 I was told by the police that they had sent to those
 3         who asked for the body files complete copies of them, with
 4         one exception, that they would not produce photographs
 5         which showed other dead bodies.        Whether or not that is
 6         right, that is what they told me.        I think the simplest
 7         way to deal with it is if those of who have received body
 8         files from the police and you are not content that they
 9         are complete if you would let Mr. Bone have them then I
10         will see whether there is anything.          We will look into it,
11         we will see whether there is anything missing and see if
12         there is any legitimate reason why you should not see
13         them.    Does that deal with the problem?
14   MR.   HICKS:     Yes, sir, one of the biggest problems is the
15         summary.     Unless you can get your hands on the summary---
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         The summary was given at the
17         mini-inquest presumably.
18   MR.   HICKS:     We are having to go back and rake those out.       I
19         think you made the comment the other day that the summary
20         was contained within the       body files.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I am not sure whether it is    or not.
22         I may be wrong about t h a t .
23   MR.   HICKS:     It is not, sir.     So that again gives us great
24         difficulty of knowing what statements are supposed          to be
25         in there.     Picking up on    some of the comments we have
26         already had, is that we will find a statement in one body
27         file that makes reference to another deceased person and
28         then when you look at that evidence it becomes
29         contradictory.     That is half the difficulty that we have.
30         I think that is a universal problem.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I do not know---
32   MR.   HICKS:     I am not saying there's anything wrong with the
33         procedure,    sir, I think it's the way that the families
34         have been brought into it and the way i t 's been made
35         available to us and it just further underlines the
36         suspicion that there's some skulduggery going on.


                                          37
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think the only way I can deal
 2         with this is the way that I have just suggested, that if
 3         you think that you have not had a complete copy of the
 4         body file when you have asked for it please let me have
 5         what you have received from the police and maybe we can
 6         copy it.
 7   MR.   BONE:    We can copy it and we can send you the original
 8         back straightaway.     We will take a copy and send you what
 9         you sent us back.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Then I will make sure that we look
11         at what the police have and see if there is anything which
12         you have not had and if there is any reason why you should
13         not have i t .
14   MRS. SEPHTON:      Excuse me, sir, I am sorry to interrupt but this
15         is back to Trevor up in actual fact.        South Yorkshire
16         Police when you sent to them for evidence are in fact
17         changing the ground rules every time you ask.        You ask for
18         something and they say: you can't have that, it was
19         already heard at the inquest.       Then you say:   Can I have
20         such and such a thing.     Oh no, you can't have that because
21         that didn't come into the public domain.        That was not
22         necessary for the inquest.        So where exactly do we fall
23         into this?
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think it may be that over a
25         period of time the police have been disclosing more than
26         they did originally.     If that is so it is partly because
27         they have been receiving some pressure from us.
28                 When I saw the police 10 days ago in relation to this
29         question of what had been giving I was told that you had
30         been sent everything in the body files other than
31         photographs where there are two dead bodies shown.          I am
32         not quite sure why they do not think that they should send
33         that but I think that is the position.        That is the
34         position, is it not, Chris?
35   MR.   BONE:     Yes, and the police have promised to send us what
36         they call a 'policy statement'       setting out in words of one


                                        38
 1         syllable exactly what ground rules they are now using for
 2         supplying families with the evidence in the body files.
 3         We have not actually seen that police statement yet and
 4         when we see it I will make sure that it is disseminated
 5         among the people present here today.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Just a moment,      I just want to deal
 7         with Mr. Hicks'   other points.     We have dealt with point 1
 8         so far.
 9   MR.   Yes, the PCA evidence, sir, you are quite right, they did
10         prefer charges of neglect of duty against Duckenfield
11         Murray.    Will you look at that evidence or are you saying
12         that that is contained within the body of evidence that
13         you will look at?
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      What    I think that I will be looking
15         is —   the evidence on which      they have preferred those
16         charges is perfectly obvious.
17   MR.   HICKS: You are missing my point,       sir.     I am sure there
18         will be police statements which would,         if you like, not be
19         placed in the public domain       and there will be comments       and
20         there may be evidence, if I could use that phrase,
21         contained within that information.       Because Duckenfield
22         and Murray, and obviously I had a similar experience and I
23         will be telling you a bit about it tomorrow,         I was given
24         the personal assurance of the South Yorkshire Chief
25         Constable that Murray would not be allowed to follow suit.
26         Then, of course, he went ahead and did it.          So, again, you
27         will feel that we are justifiably aggrieved at being
28         denied the opportunity.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The opportunity      of what?
30   MR.   HICKS: Of seeing what the evidence was.          Obviously I
31         would agree with you that it is as plain as a pikestaff
32         that they committed neglect of duty, if you like, but
33         there---
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I did not quite say that,       I said
35         there was abundant evidence upon which to proceed against
36         them so far as neglect of duty was concerned.


                                        39
 1   MR.   HICKS:   I apologise.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That has been in effect accepted by
 3         the police paying compensation.      They did it on the basis
 4         that there was a serious error of---
 5   MR.   HICKS:   Sir, one of the reasons we are    here   today is that
 6         what they tell you that they accept and what they make in
 7         their public pronouncements and the way they go to the
 8         press,   sadly, are not one in the same.    The reason we keep
 9         at what we are at and the way we believe South Yorkshire
10         Police are still behaving in the releasing of the evidence
11         is that they similarly are trying not to accept it even to
12         today.   They may say that they accept it legally but---
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I do not know that I can---
14   MR.   HICKS:   I don't expect a response.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        chop logic with the police.       The
16         fact is that they have accepted liability because they
17         have paid o u t .
18     At this point there was a reaction from many people present
19   MISS BROOKS:    They've only paid it to the police.
20   MR.   HICKS:   I think the reaction is very clear.      This the
21         difficulty we have all the time.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Just be quiet for a moment.      I
23         would like to know how many claims for compensation were
24         made by the families in respect of, it would be
25         bereavement and in some cases loss of dependency under the
26         Fatal Accidents Act.    Those would be the claims which
27         would be made in respect of the deaths.
28                    Further reaction from many present
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I do not want everybody to answer
30         that separately, perhaps you can give me the information
31         about that, can you?
32   MR.   HICKS:   We will give you it, yes.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I understand that there were two
34         actions which failed, there were the actions in the case
35         which is known as Alcock -v- The Chief Constable of South
36         Yorkshire which went to the House of Lords.       It was about


                                       40
 1         people seeing the disaster on television and so on.           That
 2         was a point of law which we need not go into at the
 3         moment.    I cannot reverse the House of Lords, but it was
 4         common ground in that case that there was no issue on
 5         liability in the sense that the Yorkshire police were
 6         negligent.    Lord Keith said so in terms in the course of
 7         his judgment.
 8                There was also,   I believe, although I do not know
 9         much about this, some test case in relation to pain and
10         suffering between the time of the injuries and the time of
11         death.    I do not know much about that except I think there
12         was some test cases on that point which were not
13         successful.
14   MR.   HICKS:    It was our two daughters and Colin Wafer, Jim's
15         son.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Those were rather specialised
17         aspects of it.    My understanding is that anybody who sued
18         the South Yorkshire police in respect of damages for
19         bereavement or loss of dependency,        if there was one,
20         liability was accepted in respect of that and compensation
21         has been paid.
22   MR.   HICKS:    We will check the documents,      sir, but it's our
23         belief that they haven't formally accepted liability.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       They may not have formally accepted
25         liability.    That, if I may say so, is really neither here
26         nor there.
27   MR.   GLOVER:    I think if they were over 18, sir, and they were
28         unemployed they weren't compensated anyway.
29   MR.   JONES:    If they were over 18 and they were working and had
30         no dependants they didn't get it, it doesn't matter if
31         they were unemployed.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I think I am right in saying that
33         you were entitled to some damages for bereavement even if
34         they were over 18.       I cannot,   I am afraid,   look into every
35         civil case.
36   MR.   JONES:    This is not about money because eight and a half


                                         41
 1         years on we haven't had any justice, we've had no
 2         accountability and we've been whitewashed the whole way
 3         along and it's still happening today because your remark
 4         outside was disgusting, you were prejudicial as you walked
 5         in.
 6   MR.   SPEARRIT:     I, for one, second that and I won't accept his
 7         apology neither.
 8   MR.   HICKS:   I apologise,   I have drifted off.    The main point
 9         which I would like to try and have some clarification from
10         yourself on was the Divisional Court and the failure of
11         the judicial review.     I fully understand and I think the
12         families will fully understand that you are not able to
13         sit and hear an appeal against the judicial review.
14               What we would like some explanation of, if it's
15         possible, is that any of the evidence contained within
16         that or any similar evidence that was not contained but,
17         if you like, dealing with a similar issue will still
18         receive full weight and it won't be ignored just because
19         it's similar to what was looked at in the judicial review.
20         It's not quite the same, as you will appreciate, as asking
21         for an appeal on the judicial review.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     No, I fully take the point.      If
23         there is fresh evidence which means that the decision of
24         the Divisional Court on a particular point may be
25         undermined or may be wrong then that is a matter which may
26         have to be reconsidered.     I fully accept that but one has
27         got to be careful about what one is talking about by fresh
28         evidence.     The question is, is it such that it might have
29         affected the decision of the Divisional Court?        Do you
30         understand?
31   MR.   HICKS:   Not quite,   if I'm totally honest,   sir.   Are you
32         saying that anything which is closely connected with
33         judicial review you won't be commenting on in your report?
34
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I will obviously have to deal with
36         the point which is very much,    I know, in your minds; the


                                       42
 1         3.15 cut-off point.      The Divisional Court dealt with that.
 2         The argument which     is put   forward and was put forward last
 3         week is that there     is now    further evidence which suggests
 4         that the cut-off point was wrong.
 5              If I come to the conclusion that that really is so
 6         then obviously that is a matter which will require
 7         reconsideration, or might require reconsideration.           But I
 8         think that is an area of the evidence which I have got to
 9         look at very carefully.
10   MR.   HICKS:     What I'm looking for, sir, is an assurance that
11         you will look at it.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Of course I will.
13   MR.   HICKS:     That you will not     dismiss it on the grounds that
14         it is too close to     the Divisional Court therefore I shall
15         have to ignore i t .
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I hope that I have explained how I
17         propose to look at it.      The mere fact that there is some
18         fresh evidence which was not before the Divisional Court
19         will not necessarily be significant.           It depends on the
20         nature of the evidence and whether or not it affects the
21         reasoning of the Divisional Court.           This is the basis upon
22         which any court looks at fresh evidence.
23              I am directing myself,          so to speak, on the way that
24         any court would approach the question of fresh evidence,
25         whether it be a criminal court or whether it be a civil
26         court.     Without any technical rules involved the fact that
27         it has not been produced before is neither here nor there.
28         There may be good or bad reasons why it was not adduced
29         before but I am not so much concerned with those.           What I
30         am concerned with is whether or not the fresh evidence
31         would have a significant bearing on decisions which have
32         been taken.     I hope that is clear.
33   MR.   HAMMOND:     You said you have read Taylor and you haven't
34         looked at the inquest.      Most of these families here that's
35         where the trouble is, it's at the inquest.           We had no
36         problems with Taylor but when it goes into Popper's


                                           43
 1         inquest he tried to discredit Taylor by spending two days
 2         on alcohol levels, four days on bringing witnesses to say
 3         that people were drunk, two days bringing other witnesses
 4         who said there were hooligans outside and then the
 5         statements that the police made right after the disaster
 6         were altered 3 months later and beer and alcohol and all
 7         that added on to them.    They were the people that he was
 8         bringing and they were the statements that we were seeing
 9         and the jury were seeing.     Not the first ones that was
10         made.
11              So the problem is Popper really.      Lord Justice
12         Taylor, we had no qualms about that.      Popper tried to the
13         rewrite it all again by saying they were drunk, he spent
14         half the inquest and that's what it was all about,
15         bringing policemen to say they were drunk, they were
16         fighting, they were hooligans.     People from around the
17         community to say they were drunk, bar people come and said
18         they were drunk.    So it was a different attitude to what
19         Taylor saw it as.
20              The jury believed all this because they never brought
21         a witness to go against, they never brought any witnesses
22         that we wanted to to go against these police, they just
23         wouldn't bring them.     That's where our trouble is.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     The difficulty about that is this,
25         that an inquest is, as I have tried to point out to you, a
26         fairly limited inquiry, you may not have thought so when
27         it spent 4 months doing it.      But, as I have indicated,
28         there were only two possible verdicts here: accidental
29         death or unlawful killing, there was no other.        I know the
30         Coroner left the question of an open verdict as a
31         possibility.
32   MR.   GLOVER:   Could he leave lack of care, sir?     No?
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That is a matter of law, I am
34         afraid.   There is no finding by the jury that there were a
35         lot of drunken fans.     There was finding that that was the
36         cause of the disaster.     I do not know why the Coroner


                                       44
 1        spent so much time doing that, but it was for him to
 2        decide it.     The Divisional Court heard criticisms of the
 3        way he dealt with the inquest.      I do not think there is
 4        any -- it will be difficult to re-open the whole of the
 5        way in which the inquest was dealt with unless I come to
 6        the conclusion that because of the fresh evidence there
 7        ought to be a fresh inquest.
 8                As you know, in the written submissions that were
 9        made to me the other day it was accepted, as I understand
10        it, that it would be very difficult to have a fresh
11        inquest and what was really sought was a quashing of the
12        verdict of accidental death.      I do not know whether that
13        has answered your question.
14                Please do not think that I am not aware of the
15        criticisms which were made of the inquest.      I am aware of
16        that.     I have also had the advantage of reading all of the
17        chapters of Professor Scraton's book, which he invited me
18        to do.     I am very well aware from that, from the
19        submissions that were made on behalf of the families and
20        also from the letters which I have received from you of
21        the criticisms of the way the inquest was conducted.        But,
22        as I said,    I cannot necessarily put right all those
23        problems and I hope you realise that.
24   MRS. SEPHTON:     But surely, sir, suppressed evidence is new
25        evidence.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     What evidence?
27   MRS. SEPHTON:     Suppressed evidence is surely new evidence.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Whether it is suppressed or not if
29        it has not been given before, not been heard before then
30        it is fresh evidence.     But, as I have been trying to point
31        out to you, not everything will have a significant bearing
32        on the outcome of these proceedings---
33   MRS. SEPHTON:     Yes, I realise what you are saying, sir, it
34        doesn't necessarily mean it will sway a jury.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        that is the problem.
36   MRS. SEPHTON:     The evidence we're seeing mostly after 3.15 in


                                       45
 1         actual fact was the evidence which was kept from the jury,
 2         unless it was in the interests of the police.            The police
 3         went on in great detail.     We couldn't go past 3.15 but one
 4         police witness went into 1990.       3.15 on 15th April 1989
 5         was our deadline.     One man was allowed, one police officer
 6         was allowed to go into 1990.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      What about?
 8   MRS. SEPHTON:     About the codes of behaviour and crowd control
 9         and everything else.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      About what?
11   MR.   HAMMOND:     The Trafalgar Square riots.
12   MRS. SEPHTON:     The Poll Tax riots.
13   MR.   HAMMOND:    The Miners.
14   MR.   HICKS:     Sir, this is the evidence of Marshall, which the
15         jury were told to disregard after he had been allowed to
16         go on.
17   MR.   BONE:     He was talking about crowd, behaviour, was he not?
18   MR.   HICKS:     But it was totally irrelevant to the events on
19         that day.
20   MR.   BONE:    We had a gentleman over here    who raised      his hands?
21   MR.   EDWARDS:    My name is Sid Edwards,     I lost my son,
22         Christopher.     I don't want to talk to you about
23         legalities,    it's all beyond me.    I think I would rather
24         like to speak for the silent majority of people who feel
25         they can't get up to talk to you.
26                 Just a slight thought on how we feel and how we have
27         felt over the last eight and half years.        I and a lot of
28         people here believe we not have been best served by
29         justice.     People here today have touched on certain
30         subjects, which we think are wrong.        I would just like it,
31         if you could, to try and realise just how we feel and how
32         we have felt for the last eight and half years.            We have
33         lived with it.
34                 We couldn't do to much about it up until the inquest
35         because most of us were grieving and we didn't know what
36         the hell was going on quite frankly and after the inquest


                                        46
 1   we walked away.    We walked away because I, like a lot of
 2   people, couldn't handle it any more and felt that if we
 3   had carried on that we would have all been basket cases
 4   and ended up in asylums.     It's only since the advent of
 5   the Hillsborough program last December by Jimmy McGovern
 6   that we have been able at last to climb out of our cots
 7   and get to grips with this thing.
 8           It may be nearly 12 months ago since that program but
 9   it still hasn't been enough time for us to try again to
10   grasp exactly what happened, the legalities and all the
11   things we should have known, which people here have talked
12   to you about.     All the things, all the evidence we've
13   tried to get, even we have tried to get and can't get it.
14
15           What I am trying to say to you is you said at the
16   beginning of this meeting that we've got off on the wrong
17   foot,    I would like now for us to get off on the right
18   foot.    I would like you to understand that although I speak
19   to you now passionately,    I speak to you focused.     I am not
20   going to rant and rave,    I am now, whereas maybe a few
21   years ago I was so angry and so mad that I couldn't talk
22   to people properly, now I can, I can't even believe I'm
23   doing this now.     But anyway the point is that now we are
24   focused.     We will not accept anything other than the truth
25   about what went on.     We will not.
26           You said you have been impressed with our dignity, so
27   have I.     But there comes a time when we must put aside
28   dignity.     This, we have been told, is our last chance for
29   justice and I earnestly beseech to you that it does not
30   matter how long you take in your deliberations, do not be
31   sidestepped by authorities, by Governments, by the media
32   or anybody.     I don't care, we've waited eight and a half
33   years,    if necessary we can weight a little longer.     All
34   that I ask is that when you do come to your final
35   deliberation that it is an honest and a view, unbiased a
36   view of all the people here.      Thank you.


                                  47
 1   MR.   BONE:   I was wondering if there is anyone else who has not
 2         spoken yet who wants to speak.       The lady at the back
 3         the r e .
 4   MRS. McBRIEN:        Sir, my name is Joan McBrien.     I am sorry about
 5         my voice today.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Would you like the microphone?
 7   MRS. McBRIEN:        I am feeling very ill actually.     I have got a
 8         very bad cold.       I'm the mother of John McBrien.     I feel we
 9         have suffered for eight years, more than eight years and I
10         would like to know what power you have to end our
11         suffering?       None of us want to go on like this.     We don't
12         want to come here and go through all this year in, year
13         out or watch programs on television about it.          We want to
14         turn to somebody who is going to point us in the right
15         direction at last.
16                 Is it possible that you have the power to make
17         recommendations that certain individuals are brought into
18         a criminal court or does that rest with the Crown
19         Prosecution Service?
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        If it is a question of prosecution
21         I think the only relevant candidates were probably Mr.
22         Duckenfield and Mr. Murray.
23   MRS. McBRIEN:        And Mr. Marshall.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Possibly Mr. Marshall.     I cannot
25         say that they should be prosecuted.       What I can say is
26         that if there is further evidence of manslaughter, and
27         that is what it would have to be, which had not previously
28         been considered by the prosecuting authorities that they
29         should reconsider their decision and if they reconsider it
30         and decide to prosecute then no doubt that would satisfy
31         you.        If they decide to reconsider it and still adhere to
32         their decision I am afraid that is not something I can do
33         anything about.
34                 All I can do is to recommend to the prosecuting
35         authorities to reconsider their decision in the light of
36         my findings about fresh evidence.        Do you understand that?


                                          48
 1
 2   MRS. McBRIEN:     Yes,   I do, but I did hear you say that you were
 3        one hundred per cent happy with Lord Justice Taylor's
 4        Inquiry.     I am not.    I know Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry
 5        was a flawed inquiry.       He exonerated Marshall and
 6        Marshall, in my eyes, will always be guilty because he
 7        requested the opening of exit gates to fill that ground
 8        that day.     That was not the correct procedure, that was a
 9        very unsafe procedure and so I don't think that is right.
10
11                His court was only an inquiry, it was a neutral
12        court, he was not to lay blame on anybody but he did.           The
13        barristers who acted for the police at the inquest they
14        just used that, they didn't go along any other lines.
15                What I would like to see is the three police
16        officers, ex-police officers, brought into a criminal
17        court where that is the only way forward I think, that is
18        what I would like to see.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I appreciate that is what you would
20        like to see.        I think that is probably what most people
21        here would like to see but I must,       I am afraid, make it
22        clear to you that it will not be my decision to prosecute,
23        I am not the prosecuting authority.        All I can do is, if I
24        am satisfied that there is fresh evidence which has not
25        been considered by the prosecuting authority, which is
26        significant evidence which tends to support a charge of
27        manslaughter, then they must look at the matter again.
28                If both I and they thought that it was sufficiently
29        significant evidence may be they would do so, I do not
30        know,    I cannot predict what would happen.     I cannot
31        predict, for example, whether the Home Secretary would
32        appoint a further judicial inquiry if I told him that he
33        ought to.     I suspect he probably would, because I think he
34        would act on my advice.
35   MRS. McBRIEN:     I know we have been told this is the last
36        opportunity that we have.        I don't think we should ever


                                         49
 1         give     up while we've got breath in our bodies,    Iknow I
 2         will     never give up until the day I die.    I will never be
 3         happy until I see those three ex-police officers in a
 4         criminal court and tried.     I'd like to see justice in this
 5         country and at the moment I know we are not getting i t .           I
 6         d o n 't care who I have speak to or what lengths I have to
 7         go to I will never give this up and I don't think anybody
 8         else should either.
 9                I don't think we should walk away from this, this was
10         too serious a miscarriage of justice for us to say,         "Oh,
11         all right, we'll forget about it this time",       I don't think
12         we should.
13                That was clearly to me a criminal act that was
14         committed on that day on     15th April 1989, to me it was     so
15         obvious it was a criminal act.       My son went to the
16         semi-final in 1988, the same 2 teams played at that
17         semi-final and that year people went in via the
18         turnstiles.     John came home as usual that day.     He went to
19         the same sort of match exactly in 19 89 and a different
20         procedure was taken that year and that is what caused his
21         death.
22                I don't want a new inquest,     I don't want to go
23         through all the gory details of the things that happened
24         in the gymnasium.     I just want justice and people to come
25         forward and say,    "Yes, we did make a mistake.     We did do
26         wrong that day.     We did commit a criminal act."     That is
27         what I would like to see.
28                We don't want to go on this like this forever, not
29         for the rest of our lives.        We have suffered far too long
30         as it is.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes, thank you.
32   MR.   WRIGHT:     I've lost my son at Hillsborough.     What mystifies
33         me, sir, when there was such a build up outside the
34         ground, the kick-off should have been delayed, which is
35         normal procedure with every ground.        Why didn't it happen
36         at Hillsborough?     Because when you are outside a ground


                                        50
 1         and the kick-off starts there is panic to get in to see
 2         that match because I've been involved in that myself in my
 3         lifetime when I have heard roars and especially when they
 4         hit the bar just after the kick-off, there's a surge that
 5         goes forward to try to get into that ground as soon as
 6         possible.     This is just crowd behaviour normal to when
 7         people are outside the ground and the kick-off takes
 8         place, which is wrong.
 9                With all the modern technology that is available at
10         the ground now why wasn't that kick-off delayed?        That
11         would pacify the people outside and there wouldn't have
12         been any pushing like there was.     That's all I've got to
13         say.
14   MR.   WHELAN:     We lost our son, Ian, that day.    He travelled
15         alone.    He was declared dead at 4 o'clock by a doctor who
16         refused me his statement.     The next we know of our son is
17         by 'phone on 4 o'clock the Sunday morning, which was utter
18         disgrace to us.     We just can't understand why our son, who
19         carried 2 identity cards, one with his photo on it, yet
20         the police couldn't tell me or my family until 4 o'clock
21         Sunday morning.
22   MRS. ROBINSON:      I'm just a little concerned,    I know you have
23         been set to scrutinise the evidence, you keep talking
24         about fresh evidence, how important that is and that's
25         what you are here for, but it came across loud and clear
26         to me that we are quite concerned about the procedures of
27         the inquest.     Are we not allowed to criticise the Coroner
28         or the procedures because to us this in turn did cause a
29         miscarriage of justice?     It might not be fresh evidence
30         but they are great concerns of ours and you seem to say,
31         "Well, no, I'm only here to look at fresh evidence."
32                Do we have go to back to Mr. Straw and say to Mr.
33         Straw,    "We need to look at the procedures that were in
34         place at the time and how they were not used correctly"?
35         Are you only able to take on board fresh evidence or can
36         you take on board our criticisms of the system?


                                        51
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   I can take on board the criticisms
 2        in the sense that I am aware of what they are.     I think
 3        that, as I tried to explain,    I am not a Court of Appeal
 4        from the Divisional Court so I cannot reverse the findings
 5        of the Divisional Court.   What I can do is if there is
 6        fresh evidence which bears upon the decisions that the
 7        Divisional Court made, for example, the 3.15 cut-off
 8        point, and there is ground for re-opening that issue then
 9        I can recommend that the Attorney-General applies to the
10        Divisional Court for that purpose.
11             But things like whether or not the Coroner wrongly
12        told people that they did not need to answer questions
13        because of risk of incrimination, whether or not the
14        mini-inquest should have been held without oral evidence,
15        those are matters which were dealt with by Divisional
16        Court and I cannot reverse those.     Do you understand?
17   MRS. ROBINSON:   I feel we're a bit limited then because I
18        personally question the Coroner's integrity in this case
19        so if you cannot deal with that where do I go from here?
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   That was a matter which, as I
21        recall, was raised in the Divisional Court.     The question
22        was raised at the Divisional Court that Mr. Popper was
23        biased.
24   MRS. ROBINSON:   The very fact that now we have a key witness in
25        Mr. Houldsworth, who Dr. Popper knew he had made a
26        statement and yet he did not call him to that inquest.
27        Surely that must prove that there must be a question of
28        Dr. Popper's integrity when the key witness of the whole
29        event was not called in front of the jury.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   I think that will be a question for
31        me to decide whether he was a key witness to the whole
32        event.
33   MRS. ROBINSON:   According to Dr. Popper the pivotal evidence in
34        the case was whether or not the police could see what was
35        going on in pen 3.   They were Dr. Popper's words, not my
36        words, they were Dr. Popper's words.     So he said the


                                     52
 1        crucial evidence depended upon whether or not the police
 2        could see in pen 3.     He then took the police's word that
 3        the camera was faulty and it was not working.           The only
 4        one man who could prove that camera was working was
 5        obviously the camera technician.         So why did he take the
 6        police's word for it?     Three times the jury called to see
 7        that film, three times they were told it was not
 8        available.
 9             I even question our own barrister at this point, why
10        our own barrister did not question about the validity of
11        this film.    Why Mr. Houldsworth's statement was never
12        called is absolutely beyond me.        But to me it puts the
13        Coroner's integrity very much        into question.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I have     the point about that    and I
15        fully understand the point about Mr. Houldsworth's
16        evidence.     It has been developed in both oral and written
17        submissions to me by counsel and I understand the point
18        about that.     I shall be seeing Mr. Houldsworth and if what
19        is said about it is correct then it may well be that that
20        is a significant aspect of the case.         In fact, if it is
21        correct then it plainly is a significant aspect of the
22        case.
23             But I think that Mr. Houldsworth        and the whole
24        question of the videos is one of the most important things
25        that I have to look at.        I am well aware        of that?
26   MRS. ROBINSON:     Yes, but what    I am saying is about the
27        Coroner's integrity.     Can you look at that aspect and if
28        you can't can you tell me where I can go?
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     The only way you can challenge the
30        Coroner's integrity would be in the Divisional Court.              An
31        attempt was made to do that, I do not know whether you
32        were one of the families that were involved in it, but I
33        have to say that I think that at this time it would be
34        very difficult for you.        I cannot advise        you on the law,
35        you will obviously have to         take your own      legal advice
36        about it or do it through the Family Support Group.              But I


                                        53
 1         think that it would be very difficult to challenge the
 2         integrity of the Coroner at this length of time bearing in
 3         mind there have been Divisional Court proceedings.
 4              I am not anxious to get into the business of advising
 5         you what course you should pursue because obviously that
 6         is a matter for you and I simply give you the benefit of
 7         my opinion as an experienced judge who has done a lot of
 8         judicial review work and so on.        I think that you do have
 9         to realise that the powers of the Divisional Court in
10         judicial review are limited.       The Divisional Court does
11         not act as a Court of Appeal on the inquest, it does not
12           re-hear the matter.    What the Divisional Court will do
13         is consider whether there has been a breach of the law by
14         the Coroner, whether he has made decisions which no
15         reasonable coroner should make, whether there has been a
16         wrong procedure,   such as the verdict should be set aside
17         and a new inquest considered.
18              When the application for judicial review was made to
19         the Divisional Court in 1993 there were, as I recall,        some
20         eight grounds put forward.        One of them was that the
21         Coroner was biased, that he should not have been holding
22         the inquest at all.     There were various other matters.
23         But the powers of the Divisional Court are very limited in
24         that way.   So I am afraid if you want to re-open that
25         ground you really ought to consult your own lawyers or the
26         family group of lawyers.
27   MR.   HICKS:   Sir, I think this is the heart of the question I
28         asked you earlier.    We do see almost a blind alley
29         appearing here.    If we can use Houldsworth as an example
30         and the video evidence in the round, if you like, that was
31         not available to us when the Divisional Court looked at
32         the Coroner.   But, of course, if you are not in a position
33         to maybe even comment, never mind not hear an appeal
34         against the Divisional Court, if you are unable to comment
35         on the validity, if you like, or the conclusions that the
36         Divisional Court came to then we have nowhere to go.


                                        54
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That is not quite what I am saying.
 2   MR.   HICKS:    That's not what we are hearing.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am sorry, then you have
 4         misunderstood me.    Let us take the evidence about the
 5         videos.   What is alleged, and I am summarising it very
 6         briefly and you will say I have left something out and so
 7         on, I am summarising it in this way; that the submissions
 8         which were made, and I have written submissions about it,
 9         it is said that because there was video evidence from a
10         particular camera which was focusing on the terraces and
11         which was recording or which was taking photographs
12         throughout the period and that evidence was not seen by
13         the jury, indeed not seen by Lord Taylor, it was
14         suppressed, wrongly suppressed.       If it had been seen it
15         would have shown that the terraces were in fact full at
16         the material time and therefore the police ought to have
17         known they were full and that at the inquest, although not
18         at the Taylor Inquiry, the police were saying that the
19         reason why they did not appreciate that the pens were full
20         was because the camera was not working.       That in a
21         nutshell is the submission which is being made.
22              If that is correct then obviously that is a very
23         important matter.    I have to look at that allegation very
24         carefully.    It is a serious allegation and I have to look
25         at it.    I have to see what the state of play was in
26         relation to those cameras.        I have to see what happened to
27         the tapes and,   I do not know whether you understand this,
28         but there were in fact five cameras located round the
29         ground.    We are really only concerned with three: one of
30         them which (I am talking about the police cameras now, not
31         the club cameras) one of which was trained on the Leppings
32         Lane entrance, that was camera number 1.        Camera number 5
33         was mounted near the west stand and had a view across the
34         Leppings Lane terraces.     It was mounted actually at the
35         back of the terraces looking along the line of them.        A
36         view not dissimilar from that from the police control box


                                        55
 1   but not precisely the same.       There was another one mounted
 2   on the south stand, which gave a view across diagonally
 3   towards the p e n s .
 4         Although each of these cameras was taking photographs
 5   all the time they were not necessarily all recorded all
 6   the time.    The police had two monitors on which they could
 7   record what was being shown on any particular camera.           The
 8   position I think is this; that there is a lot of coverage
 9   on the tapes of what was happening being shown by the one
10   covering Leppings Lane between about half past two and 3
11   o'clock.    It shows Gate C being opened, it shows people
12   coming through it, it shows people climbing over the top
13   and so on and so forth.
14         That was clearly something that the police in the
15   control box were concentrating on and it is recorded on
16   one of the 2 monitors.      As I understand it there are
17   shots from camera 5, which is the important camera here,
18   earlier in the day.     I will not get the times exactly
19   right but there is nothing,       I think, from about 2.20 until
20   two minutes past three, Mr. Hicks will correct me if am
21   wrong about this.       It is then apparent that the cameras,
22   and whether it is number 5 or whether it is number 2 on
23   the South Stand, are then concentrated on the terraces
24   because they show what was happening; people climbing
25   over, getting out and so on and so forth.
26         The issue is why was the tape which showed scenes
27   from camera 5 at an earlier stage was not part of the
28   compilation tape which was shown to the jury?        Were the
29   police dependent on the cameras for their appreciation of
30   what was happening in the ground?        What was the nature of
31   the pictures which were being taken by camera 5?        Were
32   they perfectly good?      Was camera 5 able to zoom?    So on
33   and so forth.     So far as Lord Taylor's Inquiry was
34   concerned there was a clear finding by him that camera 5
35   was working and it was capable of zooming.
36         One of the questions which I have to consider is


                                  56
 1         whether or not the police were dependent on that camera
 2         for their appreciation of what was going on.      Whether or
 3         not they had a clear view from the control box.      Whether
 4         they ought to have appreciated what was going on from
 5         simply looking out of the window.     Which,   I think, is
 6         clearly what Lord Taylor thought.     So those are some of
 7         the questions which arise in relation to the video
 8         evidence.
 9              At the moment I am still in the process of
10         establishing the facts as to exactly what happened in
11         relation to those video tapes and so on.       I have very
12         clear evidence from Mr. Hicks about it and I am
13         investigating the rest of them but that is clearly a very
14         important aspect of the case.     I think it is in the
15         forefront of the submissions which are made to me.
16         Obviously that is an important matter.
17   MR.   HICKS:   Sir, you referred earlier to manslaughter charges
18         and referral of the prosecuting authorities.      As you know
19         from our submissions, and again all of the families have
20         not seen those in detail yet, we feel there is a strong
21         case that certain police officers committed perjury,
22         certainly to the Coroner's inquest.     Will that be a
23         feature in your weightings as well and will you be making
24         recommendations,   if you are convinced, again, along those
25         lines to the prosecuting authority?
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Yes, if I came to the conclusion
27         that there was prima facie evidence of perjury by indeed
28         any witness I think that is a matter which I would draw to
29         the prosecuting authority's attention.     Whether or not
30         they would prosecute is a matter for them.
31   MR.   HICKS:   We understand you are only making recommendations.
32
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     If I was persuaded that there had
34         been perjury then obviously that is a matter which I would
35         draw to the attention of the prosecuting authorities.
36   PROFESSOR SCRATON:    Just one point,   I think it might be useful


                                      57
 1   for you to explain your own interpretation,     indeed the
 2   interpretation over the last 8 years of the concept of
 3   liability.   The reason for this is it has obviously been
 4   at the heart of much of what has been said this morning
 5   and indeed you have commented on it yourself.
 6        Lord Keith, in one of the compensation cases, made
 7   the point that the police had already accepted liability
 8   in negligence.    At the Divisional Court Lord Justice
 9   McGowan made the statement that he did not know what the
10   families could conceivably want given that the police had
11   already admitted liability.      Those words were echoed by
12   the Attorney-General in the House of Commons where he more
13   or less said exactly the same or made exactly the same
14   comment.
15        What that stemmed back to was the compensation
16   settlements that happened behind closed doors in the
17   short-term aftermath of the disaster, when, and it's my
18   understanding because obviously I wasn't privy to that
19   information, the court awarded a percentage of liability
20   against each of the bodies involved.     My guess is that
21   that award made against those bodies was similar to Lord
22   Justice Taylor's own findings in terms of responsibility.
23   So I would guess, working on that, that the police were
24   probably considered to be eighty per cent liable in
25   relation to compensation.
26        What we have heard again this morning is absolutely
27   clear, people are talking about a range of liability.
28   They are talking about liability of individual officers
29   but other people are talking about corporate liability,
30   the liability of the agency and the liability of the
31   police in general in terms offer policy and one of the
32   points that you made in your opening statement, and I
33   quote,   "There has been no formal admissions of liability
34   by the police."       There is this distinction always which
35   comes up whenever there is an appeal between the police
36   saying it was their fault and admitting liability in


                                 58
 1        negligence and the kind of liability that people here are
 2        concerned about, which is that form of admission of
 3        liability, particularly if it's going to lead on to
 4        further action taken against either individual officers or
 5        any particular agency involved.
 6             I was wondering if you could perhaps explain to us
 7        why that distinction occurs and what that distinction is?
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I will try.   First of all, there
 9        are two sorts of liability which we are concerned with.
10        One is criminal liability which is, essentially in this
11        case, whether or not one of the three officers who we have
12        referred to were guilty of manslaughter.     That is
13        liability which is established in a criminal court and is
14        subject to criminal punishment.     It has to be established
15        beyond reasonable doubt so that the jury are sure, in
16        effect, that one or other of those individual police
17        officers shut his eyes to an obvious risk of injury.        I am
18        to truncating that but I am summarising it.
19             That, in effect, is the question with which a jury in
20        a criminal court would be concerned.     That is criminal
21        liability.   That is a matter for the Director of Public
22        Prosecutions to decide whether or not to launch criminal
23        proceedings against one of those people.
24             You have to be very clear in criminal liability that
25        you are talking about the criminal responsibility of each
26        individual officer.     It is not a whole conglomerate of
27        fault by a number of officers put together and lumped
28        together and brought at the door of the Chief Constable or
29        whoever it may b e .
30             If we turn to civil liability the position is
31        different.   In civil liability, which is the liability
32        that can pay damages for negligence or breach of duty, the
33        Chief Constable is responsible in law for the acts or
34        omissions of junior officers.     When I say junior officers
35        I mean officers more junior to him, so, therefore,
36        including Chief Superintendents,    Superintendents and so


                                      59
 1   on.
 2          In those circumstances the faults of the police are
 3   considered and if they amount to negligence then liability
 4   is established.
 5          What happened here is that claims were made against,
 6   I think I am right in saying, the police only.        I am not
 7   sure about this, there may have been other defendants as
 8   well in the form of the Club and/or the Sheffield City
 9   Council.
10          Liability to pay compensation was never disputed so
11   far as the police were concerned.     As far as I know they
12   did not make any formal admission of liability.       That is
13   almost invariably the case where liability is accepted.
14   There is no difference in principle between accepting
15   liability and paying on a one hundred      per cent    basis than
16   there is making a formal      admission of liability. As    a
17   matter of practice there is no distinction between the
18   two.     That is why the House of Lords and the Divisional
19   Court said that the police had admitted liability.
20          It may be that they did not technically admit
21   liability but they never      contested it and that    is       the same
22   thing.     I know that some   of you think there is    a
23   difference between them.      It is a distinction without a
24   difference.       What happened thereafter, as I understand
25   it, is that the police sought contribution from the other
26   people who were criticised by Lord Taylor.      They, the
27   police, were one hundred per cent liable to you, or to the
28   people who sued them, but they were entitled, if they
29   could prove that other people were at fault as well, to a
30   contribution to the amount of damages and although, as
31   Professor Scraton calls it, that was a settlement behind
32   closed doors it was a settlement in which some or all of
33   the other people who were criticised made a contribution.
34          I have asked to know what the terms of that
35   settlement are.     I think between these four walls if they
36   tell me that I have no business to know it I am not sure


                                   60
 1         that I can assist upon it but I have asked.         I have no
 2         doubt whatever that the police took the major share of the
 3         liability. Professor Scraton may be right in thinking it
 4         is as much as eighty per cent but I do not know.            I have
 5         asked about that, whether I shall be at liberty to
 6         disclose to you what that was I do not know but that is
 7         the way it w e n t .
 8                 I hope you will accept from me that even though there
 9         was never any formal admission of liability, in practice
10         that is what happened.       The police never contested
11         liability and they paid out to those people who they have
12         paid out to on a full liability basis.         Does that answer
13         your question, Professor Scraton?
14   PROFESSOR SCRATON:       Exactly as I expected you to answer it.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I hope that is clear for people.
16   MRS. ROBINSON:     No.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        It is not clear?   What is not
18         clear?
19   MRS. ROBINSON:      It's just a load of jumble.      I'm sorry.    We're
20         still none the wiser, at least I'm not.
21   MR.   BONE:     I wonder if I could add something here.      The
22         Judge's terms of reference allow him to make any
23         recommendations he thinks are in the public interest.            A
24         lot of people here think it is right that the Judge should
25         make some formal admission: yes, it was our fault,
26         Hillsborough was our fault or it was 80 per cent our fault
27         or something like that.
28                 Legally it is true that it makes no difference as to
29         whether they have or not made such an admission, but it is
30         certainly arguable that you could say it was in the public
31         interest that the police should make a public admission of
32         that sort and if the Judge were to find as part of his
33         Scrutiny that it might be in the public interest for them
34         to do so he can jolly well recommend it in his report that
35         they should.       That might help perhaps.
36   MR.   HICKS:     I think this comes again to the hub of things,


                                         61
 1         sir, that, sadly, the law and justice don't run parallel
 2         with each other or so it would appear.
 3   MR.   BONE:    A problem that goes down the ages.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am afraid that is so.      This is
 5         inherent in the fact that legal proceedings have limited
 6         objectives.     I tried to indicate this in my opening
 7         remarks.     An inquest has very limited objectives, the
 8         choice of verdict is very limited.     There is no judgment.
 9         There are no findings of fact and from that point of view
10         it may be said that it     is very unsatisfactory.      I am
11         inclined to agree     that in these cases where there is a
12         major disaster of      this sort it is actually very
13         unsatisfactory to     have a judicial inquiry headed by a
14         senior judge and then an inquest which goes over a lot of
15         the same ground again?
16   MR.   HICKS:     And tries to re-write the verdict.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I do not think it does try to
18         re-write the verdict but it does go over the same ground.
19         What the solution to that is is, I am afraid, a matter for
20         Parliament.
21   MR.   HICKS:     We understand that.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Speaking for myself I think there
23         may be strong grounds for saying that the High Court judge
24         or whatever it is ought to conduct the inquest and have it
25         all in one go.
26   MR.   HICKS:     This is the basis for the working party, isn't it?
27
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      But I am afraid that is outside my
29         terms of reference.     I may have views about that.      I think
30         a lot of the dissatisfaction in this case has arisen from
31         the fact that there were these two inquiries.        They both
32         had different purposes but the inquest in fact was and
33         should have been on a much more limited basis than Lord
34         Taylor's Inquiry, which has wide ranging, when everybody
35         was represented, where he kept a proper grip and control
36         of the thing and he was afterall a very highly experienced


                                        62
 1         judge.    A coroner is, I do not know what his
 2         qualifications are, he is a local solicitor.
 3   MR.   BONE:    A medical doctor.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It is very difficult for a coroner
 5         to deal with a very complex case of this sort.       I quite
 6         understand feelings that the inquest didn't go well and a
 7         lot of people were dissatisfied with it.      But I am afraid
 8         you must also realise that the powers of the Divisional
 9         Court to put those matters right are also limited.       As you
10         correctly say, the system is not perfect, it does its
11         best.
12                 I do not have free, wide ranging powers,   I do not
13         have jurisdiction to interfere with previous court
14         decisions.      All I can do is to make recommendations if I
15         am satisfied that there is significant fresh evidence
16         which impinge on those previous decisions.       I hope that is
17         clear.     I have tried to explain it.   I know it is
18         difficult for you to understand it but that is the
19         position.
20   MR.   BONE:     I think it is certainly difficult for people to
21         accept this sort of thing, is it not.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      We have got a little more time.
23         There is somebody at the back there who has not spoken
24         before.
25   MR.   LESLIE JONES:    With regard to what Professor Scraton said
26         before about what you would consider new evidence.       When
27         you get down to the nitty-gritty of it I think a lot of
28         families have a great belief that the voracity of the West
29         Midland investigation was not all that was required.
30                 At the time we had no access to the statements from
31         the many mini-inquest particulars, you know, and the
32         transcripts.     When we sent away for our transcripts we
33         found out, there was total disbelief that the officer in
34         question who identified our son had ever been there.          The
35         whole thing was a total whitewash.       It just didn't exist.
36         The guy was not with my son.      He said the only thing he


                                        63
 1         could remember about him, he was him for about 16 hours,
 2         the only thing he could remember about him was he had grey
 3         pants on, my son had blue jeans on.        The officer not with
 4         my son.
 5                 You begin to wonder how much cognisance you can put
 6         on the evidence that was given by the West Midlands
 7         Police, especially now that we have had access to the
 8         evidence, the statements, et cetera, in some respects,
 9         although they have been trying to stop us getting them.                 I
10         have now managed to chase and chase for three months and
11         now they tell me that two statements are missing out my
12         file.     I only made three on the day and two of them are
13         missing.     It is ridiculous.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Can I just see that I understand
15         what you are saying.     You are saying that the summary
16         which was presented by the West Midland Police Officers as
17         the summary at the mini-inquest is not in accordance with
18         the statements on the file which has now been sent to you?
19         Is that what you are saying?
20   MR.    LESLIE JONES: What I am saying is we had no access            to
21         them until just recently.        I am now getting them files.           I
22         mean the only evidence that the officer gave on
23         identification had no reference whatsoever to my son.               I
24         mean the guy was not there.        I am absolutely convinced of
25         that.     We sent away for photographs---
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Sorry, which guy was not there?
27   MR.    LESLIE JONES: The police officer in question.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The police officer who said---
29   MR.    LESLIE JONES: P.C. Bromley.       We sent away for the
30         photographs, the photographs come, the policeman's head is
31         cut off, his epaulettes are blanked.        My son has got a
32         cover over his face.     It could have been anyone,       I
33         couldn't even recognise him.        There is no way.   Basically
34         that transcript of the mini-inquest as far as we're
35         concerned is just total hogwash.        It's absolutely
36         ridiculous and yet it was presented as evidence.              It was


                                        64
 1         witnessed by the West Midlands Police.
 2   MR.   BONE:    P.C. Bromley says he was with your son's body for
 3         16 hours and you are saying that you do not think he was
 4         there at all?
 5   MR.   LESLIE JONES:     I don't think he was there at all, no.       If
 6         he was there at all he may have been there for the five
 7         minutes while they identified his body or whatever.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I will try and look into that but I
 9         think eight years afterwards the prospect of my finding
10         any more reliable evidence now is pretty slim.
11   MR.   LESLIE JONES:    But it makes you wonder, doesn't it, how
12         much cognisance can be put on the evidence of the West
13         Midland Police Officers when you can find evidence within
14         the body bag files, which we haven't had up to now, and
15         suddenly everyone is finding out that they just do not
16         coincide with the evidence in court.
17                 It makes me wonder also when you —    you said before
18         that you weren't going to take -- you couldn't override
19         the judicial review. I was one of        the families that went
20         with judicial review and I was quite willing to      accept the
21         verdict of the judge, but maybe you could explain it to
22         me. Evidence was given of cohesion by West Midland Police
23         Officers of witnesses and it was written, documentary
24         evidence presented to the High Court and the only answer
25         to that —    West Midland Police had ample opportunity to
26         attend that court and refute the allegations.        They chose
27         not to do so.     The judges at the judicial review dismissed
28         it with whose to know what to believe?       As a man who
29         believes in justice I find that no justice whatsoever.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That is one of the cases that I
31         shall be looking, it is Mrs. Williams'       case I think that
32         you have in mind.
33   MR.    LESLIE JONES:    That's   right.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That is one   of the cases I shall be
35         looking at in considerable detail.       Who has not spoken?
36         Is there anybody who wants to speak who has not spoken so


                                        65
 1         far?
 2   MR.   WAFER:     I find it that difficult that, going back to the
 3         Coroner, that he was always in meetings with the
 4         solicitors.      We only has one, whereas each of the police
 5         officers had his own representation.           With the policemen,
 6         also with our own solicitors, was there not some kind of
 7         collusion that suppressed some of the evidence that we
 8         should have been given?        I think that needs to be looked
 9         at?
10   M R . BONE:     Thank y o u .
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Is there anything else who has not
12         spoken who wants to say anything?
13   MR.   BONE:     I think we will go up to        about 1 o'clock perhaps,
14         we have had a long morning.
15   MR.   GLOVER:     I know I have spoken before,       I want to just clear
16         one point.      For approximately seven or eight years now I
17         have been trying to get a statement of a P.C. Fogitt.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Who?
19   MR.   GLOVER:     P.C. Fogitt.   Each time I went      to the South
20         Yorkshire Police they said:         the   officer will not give
21         permission for me to have his first statement because it
22         does not concern my son.          The funny thing about it in his
23         second statement he does everything for my son.            He
24         carries him, he gets people to give him the last rites,
25         which I know he didn't do anyway, but his second statement
26         was made about five months after.           I need to see his first
27         statement but he will not           give permission for me to see
28         it.     That's that what the        South Yorkshire Police —     I've
29         got numerous letters to prove that.           I wonder could you do
30         anything about that.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       We will look at that.
32   MR.   BONE:     Mr. Spearitt wants to say something.
33   MR.   SPEARITT:      Again, it's about a statement .        I made a
34         complaint against P.C. David Illingworth and I have been
35         told that because I made that complaint I cannot have his
36         statement.      The reason why I want that statement is that


                                          66
 1         there is a slim chance that he actually got ray son out and
 2         also got me out.     I've been refused that on the grounds
 3         that because I brought a complaint.
 4                 Surely if he did get my son out it should have been
 5         in the body file anyway.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It should be.
 7   MR.   SPEARITT:     It should be.   He's actually told me he got me
 8         out.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Got you out or your son?
10   MR.   SPEARITT:    He got us both out.    There's no statement that
11         I've ever seen and they've refused to give me it.
12   MR.   BONE:    I said when we talked about this before, Mr.
13         Spearitt, that is something we are going to be looking
14         into.    I say no more than that at the moment.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      One more question from you, Miss
16         Brooks, or one more statement.     Nobody else wants to say
17         anything apart from Miss Brooks.      Is that right?
18   MISS BROOKS:      I'm quite amazed how referring to P.C. Ken
19         Greenway he stated to another member of the family that he
20         —   of the Support Group that he actually wasn't there that
21         day.     I have had three telephone conversations with him
22         and on those three occasions he actually told me that he
23         was there.     I even had the times he was there that day and
24         the following day.     How can he tell one person that he
25         wasn't there that day and then actually tell another
26         person that he was there?
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Sorry, I am slightly losing track
28         of this.     Who has said that they were there and then they
29         were not?
30   MISS BROOKS:      P.C. Ken Greenway who has been the contact at the
31         South Yorkshire police actually told another member of the
32         Family Support Group that he can't even try and imagine
33         what happened that day because he wasn't there.        He spoke
34         to me and he was literally throwing bodies out of the
35         terraces, and I have actually quoted him on that, and he
36         said he was working from 10 o'clock that morning until 1


                                         67
 1       o'clock of the early hours of Sunday morning.      He then
 2       returned back to duty at 7 o'clock on Sunday morning and
 3        finished at 4 o'clock on Sunday afternoon.
 4              Referring to Police Sergeant Peter Walton, he
 5       actually stated that he didn't leave my brother's side for
 6       one moment, where, after reading his witness statement, he
 7       did and he did not even attempt resuscitation.
 8              How can a policeman actually blatantly lie and that
 9       is not called into question?
10              Another concern I have got is I had witness
11        statements that have been made weeks and months later
12       after the event.     The only witness statement which I have
13       got which is dated 15th April is by my brother's friend
14       who was there and all they wanted to know was how much
15       alcohol Andrew had drunk and was he healthy and was he
16       fit.
17              The first witness statement Police Sergeant Walton
18       made was he did this and he did that and, you know, all
19       these fans were fighting and he merely talked to them and
20        calmed them down.     The next statement he said they were
21        all fighting, they were rioting, they were drunk.      It just
22        amazes me how it can go from one extreme in his first
23        statement and then go to another extreme in the n e x t .
24              Also why did West Midlands Police go to Spain to
25        interview him?    Why did they go and join him on holiday to
26        interview him for his witness statement?     They went out to
27        Spain in between his first statement and the second
28        statement.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Thank you very much.   I think we
30        will break off now.     Thank you very much for coming.     I
31        hope everybody has felt that they have been able to say
32        what they wanted to say and, as I have already indicated,
33        I am going to see a number of you at separate appointments
34        later.   Thank you very much indeed.

              I live at the above address with my sister and her family.



              On Saturday,       15th A p r i l , 1989,    (150489),      I went to the FA Cup se mi ­

              final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough in
                                                                 \a
              Sheffield.  I travelled in a mini bus with John GILHOOLEY his brother

                                     ,   their nephew John Paul GILHOOLEY and some other

              fellows and kids,



              We left Liverpool at about             10.30am (1030) and due to traffic we did

              not get to Sheffield till about S.30pm                   (1430).         We parked the bus

              opposite    shops on what appeared to be a housing estate.                          We   left ther
                                                                            PAGE        2
                                                                            S 1 172

and just walked to the ground.        I would estimate       it was about one mile

and we had to walk down quite a steep hill.



The two GILHOOLEY brothers had stand tickets and I had a Leppings Lane

T errace ticket as did the young      lad John Paul G I L H O O L E Y , I was going

to accompany John in the ground.



As we approached the metal outer gates         in Leppings Lane     it would be

about 2.50pm    <1450).     It was just utter chaos.        I pulled John away              j


saying we c a n ’t go in there.



We walked away from the turnstile,       to the    right.     There was a mounted

police officer,    who's horse was spinning       round,    which was causing more
                                                                  .,"'7
trouble    in the crowd.                                              '
                                                                y



Suddenly right in front of us,       the two b|fg\bI^/e metal     gates o pe n ed and

we went through these       into the ground.   fl was still with John and

another bloke who I did not know who had travelled on the mini               bus

with us.    As we got     inside the ground,   there were a lot of people but

it was not too bad.



I did not see any Steward between the gate          in which we came     into the

ground and the tunnel which gives access to the terraces,.             Nor did I

see any police officers       in that area.    I would esitmate that the

gates were opened at about 2.50pm (1450) or shortly a f t e r.



The three of us went through the tunnel onto the Terraces.               There were

a number of people      in the tunnel but we were able to get through

without much trouble.       We got to the terraces and turned half-right

into what   I think   is Pen 3 and we found a place about half-way down
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     S1172

the Terrace.             It would now be about 2.55pm       (1455)



It suddenly seemed to be getting                packed around us tighter and t i g h t e r .

I had little John in front of me trying to protect him.                      We were       not

next to a barrier or a fence.               It would be after 3.00pm        (1500) when

there was a sudden surge from the rear.                  It was packed solid and both

John and 1 were pushed towards the front fence.                      The other fellow who

was with us I could no longer see.                 After ti^w surge John and I were

about three feet off the front fence r i o p p o s i t e                one of the small

gates.



I shouted to the police,              " I ’ve got a kid here."       But it was now utter

chaos,      then I saw the gate was open and some             people were getting out.

I could also see people              climbing over the fence.         I still had hold of

John.       It was my intention to try to get to the gate but I was just

pinned with John a nd we could not move.                 I had looked at John's e y e s ,

they were becoming glazed.               I was fighting for my breath and thought                I

was going to die.              I lost consciousness,     but at about that time        I

have a vague recollection of a policeman trying to drag John out.

The ne;;t thing I remember was a police officer slapping my face and he

was saying,            "This one   is alive."   I was still    on the Terrace at this

time.       The police        carried me out and I remember being on the pitch.

I was taken to the First Aid place and I recovered without having to

go to h ospital.



I did not see John again.               At no stage did anyone ask to see my

ticket,       and it was not taken from me.           The ticket      is in the   possession

of my solicitor,             but when he has finished with it you may have           :i.t „

               Birmingham:, where          I saw Inspector LAYTON and PC               of the West

               Midlands     Police.        Also    present was                      nephew.
              —      ■ ■■■■  — ...


               I was shown several            video   recordings and photographs taken at

               •150489.

               On photographs          referenced PR 1/11-15 a n d ^ R 1/17 and PR1/21        I was able

               to identify myself at the bottom of tWe picture near to the g a t e . I

               could not identify my f r i e n d ’s nephqfo John Paul GILHOOLEY but at this

               time he would have been directly ip                   front of me.

 RAWMARSH        POLICE       STATION




 1.              I reported            for       duty     at      Rawmarsh             Police       Station           at    8.00am

 (0800)     on S a t u r d a y ,     15 A p r i l ,       1989         (150489)           at    this       t i me     I was       in

 full     police       uniform.             I was       to    be       conveyed          directly          to H i l l s b o r o u g h

Football         Ground       by     force        coach       to       be    briefed          for    the     day's          dut i e s .

 2.               I was      pa rt        of     serial       56       under       the    leadership              of       PS    2140

Taylor      from       C2.      We    were        under       the       direct         responsibility                  of       Inspector

Newey.

 3.              Following           the       briefing           in    the       North        Stand       at    the       football

 ground,        I was    deployed           with    the        rest         of my        serial      to     Rawson          Spring

 Roa d,    an    industrial           estate        near          to    the       bottom       of H e r r i e s        R oad.          At

 11.15am        (1115)       that     date,        I took          up       my    position          to    direct           the

 Nottingham           Forest       contingent,               to    suitable             parking          places        allocated

 within     this        industrial             estate.

 The    football         fans      t ha t      I s aw    were          conducting             themselves              in    a good

 natured        and     lighthearted              manner.              The       majority       had       parked           up    and

 entered        the     ground       at     an    early       stag e.             On    the    apprach           of    3-00pm

_(1500),        the    roads       around         Penistone             Ro ad,         Herries       Road        and       Rawson

 Spring     R o a d,    were       almost         deserted.                 There       were    the       od d      latecomers              to
                                                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                                                          R 104

the     ground       but       the       number!            were       not    so      great          as     to    cause       any       problems.

The     next       stage       of     our      duties            was    to a t t e n d          Claywheels              Lane       Traffic

Office        for    a    cooked          meal          and      following            this,          we     were       to    be    on    standby

outside        the       ground          on    the       Penistone            Road         end.

At a b o u t       3.05pm        (1505)            t ha t     date,       I was        stood          with        the       rest    of    my

serial        at    the     corner            of    Penistone            Road         and       Herries           Road       outside          the

Charlie        Brown        shop.             We    were         approached            by a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t ,               who    had

just     emerged          from        the      football            ground,            he    immediately                 ordered          us    into

the     ground.

At    t his    t i me     I had          no    idea what               was    happening,                  I entered           the       ground

with     the       rest     of      my    serial            together          with PS Taylor                      and       Inspector

Newey       wh o    were       both       in       possession            of      police          r a dio s.            As    I approached

the     playing         area        from       the       entrance            between            the       North        stand       and    the

Spion       Kop,     I saw          the       players            leaving         the       pitch and              a    large       crowd       of

spectators           on     the       pitch         around         the       Leppings            Lane          e nd    of    the    ground.

My    immediate           reaction             was       that      there         had       been       a     pitch       invasion          by       the

Liverpool           fans.           I then          ran a c r o s s          the      pitch          to     offer       my    assistance,

there       were     some        police            officers            present         but       not        m a n y.

As    I approached               the      Leppings               Lane    terraces               it    became           obvious          to me

th at    the       situation             wa,s not           of    public         order          but       of     public       safety.              I

ran     towards          the     fenced            area       near      to G a t e         4.        Th e      gate     was       open    and

several        officers             were       pulling            people         from       the       gates           with    great

difficulty,              due     to      the       fact       that      people         were          wedged           together          across

the     sma l l     e xit      gate.           I realised               t ha t     the      situation                 was    very       serious

and     I could          not     get      into          the      gateway         to    help.              I looked           towards          the

fence       and     I saw        that         people          were      crushed            against             the     perimeter

f enc e .      I wa s       faced         with a situation                       where          I could           not       get    to    anyone

to    help.         I was        at      this       tim e        with Police               Constable              Reeves.           Situated

to    the     immediate             r i g ht       of    the      gate       I saw         some       wooden           hoardings.              I

climbed        o nto      the       hoardings               w i t h PC       Reeves         doing           the       same    and       I w as

trying        to     look         at    the     situation              behind          the       fences.         I saw          tha t      the

c r u s h was        present            along         the      length       of       the     terrace          and     some       15     to £□

deep     in     p eo p l e .           People         were      pushed          up a g a i n s t        each     other          and     gasping

for     br e a t h .         It    seemed           to    stretch          f or      about        10 f e e t     back       along          the

terrace         and      then          I saw a gap              of a b o u t         3 f e et      and       from     that       poi nt

although           it was          crowded            people         were       standing           in a n      upright           position

and     looking          towards             the      pitch.

I thought            t h at       if    I could           encourage             the     people          at    the     back       to m o v e

further         bac k        and       out     of     the      exit       tunnel        to       their       ri ght    that       the        crush

of    people         directly               in f r o n t       of    those        people          would       lessen.            I shouted

repeatedly              to    the       people           at    the     ba ck      to    ’M o v e       back,    walk        out       of     the

g r o u n d ’ and        that          'People           were       being       c r u s h e d at        the    front*.            The        only

response           I got          from       the      people         at    the       back        was    obscene        language,              ’V*

signs      and       spitting               towards           myself       and       the     officers          near        'to me.

Whilst        on     the      wooden           ledge          youths       were        repeatedly             climbing           onto        the

heads      of      the       people          being        crushed and                I assisted              them     over       the

perimeter            fence         and       o nt o      the    ground,           several          of    these        persons           fell

o nto    the       playing             area     and appearing                   to     collapse          they       sought        assistant

I d o n ’t t h i n k          the       people           at    the    back        realised             the    seriousness               of    the

incident           at    the       front..            I was         in a h e l p l e s s          situation           so    I then

started         to      speak          to    the      people         crushed           into       the    fence.            I saw many               of

them     s till         conscious              with       their        heads         pushed        to    one    side        and       their

ears     crushed against                       the       fence.           I encouraged                 them    to     keep       their        eyes

open and           to    try a n d           move        their       l i mb s     and       as    the    crush        became          easier

to m o v e      backwards               if     they       could       or    just        to       stand       still.

During        the       incident             the      wooden         hoarding           broke          and    myself        and       other

officers           fell       to       the     ground.              I was       still        able       to    climb        up    onto        the

fence      by      using          the       supports           of    the    number           4 gate.           I was        aware          that

several         bodies            had       been      placed         onto       the     playing          area.         I could             not

believe         at      first          t hat    many          were    dead,            my    initial          thoughts           were        that

many    ha d     been       pulled          through          the      gates          and       over         the    fence          were          alive

a n d we 11,

The    c r o w d at        the     back         did    ea se     at    one        stage         and         I noticed             2

policewomen            appearing                from    the      tunnel          at       the       back.          I shouted                to     them

to    encourage            people          to    leave       the      terracing                and        for     them       to m a k e          their

way    to     the     back       of    the       crushed         f an s     and       to       pull         them     backwards                  and      to

safety.          After       great          difficulty               I noticed             that           the     two    policewomen

had m o v e d       through           the       crowd and           were        now       into       the        crushed           a r ea .        They

appeared         to    be    receiving                the    same      response                from        several           of       the       fans.

It a p p e a r e d     to me          t ha t     the    fans        di d    not       want          to m o v e      in       case          they

lost    t h e ir      view       of    the       proceedings               or    the       possibility                  of     the         match

being       pl a y e d .     I      also noticed              one      Police Sergeant                          moving         through             the

crowd and           down     to       the fro n t ,         he   appeared                 to    be       caught         up     in         the    crush

at    one    stage         and      Prom my        position            at        the t op           of     the     fence          I directed

him    to    pull      back         and        try a n d      pull     others back                   with        him.         Another

incident         I remember                was    when       I saw P o l i c e             Constable               Alan       Davies,             a

member       of C D i v i s i o n           moving          down      through             the       crowd a s s i s t i n g                fans       in

carrying         a man.           The       man       appeared         to       be    unconscious                  about          45 years               of

age    and     of     good       b ui l d .       They        couldn't            get      t h r o u g h a n d I w as                 trying             to

tell    PC D a v i e s       to       go    back       up     through           the       f ans       a n d out      the       back         way.

I could        see     quite          w ell      that       they      could          go    back,           but     PC    Davies

obviously           did     not       have       the    s a me     view         as    I did and                 tried        to       bring        the

man    through         the       crush and             pass      him       through             the       Gate      number             4.

When    the      area       near       to G a t e       4     h ad    partly          been           cleared, I saw                   Police

officers         and       fans       pulling          at     the     fence          around              the t e r r a c e .          I    thought

that's       a good         idea and             when       it h a d       been       pulled away                  people             were

pulled       through,            however,             the    people         at       the       front         had    great             difficulty

in    climbing         up    through             the    fence         from       the       drop          behind         the       wall.

When    all      persons          had       been       cleared         I looked                at    the        area     where             I had

been    in a n d       I could             not    believe          that         s u c h a sm a l l              area     had          been       able

to h o l d        so m a n y          persons.

Whilst        at       Gate       4    I cannot            reca ll      seeing          any      person who             was    dead         being

carried           from       t ha t     area,          except       for       the      m a n PC     Davies           had    been       with

who     appeared             unconscious                 to me.

I moved           back       onto       the       pitch and            tried        to a s s i s t        any     persons         who       had

obviously              been       in    the       crush.          Many        people        were      being          resuscitated             by

Police        officers                and    ambulance             c rews        and    also       fans.          Many      f ans      were

shouting           and       swearing             on the         pitch        blaming         the     Police          for     the      crush

but     I just          couldn't             comment           because           from     entering             the    pitch area             to

leaving           it    I d id         not    receive           any     information                vi a    radio        or w o r d      of

mouth        as    to       the       cause       of     the     crush.

I m ust       have          spent       some       15      to 2 0      minutes          walking           around        the    crowd

preventing              fans          from    fighting            amongst           themselves,                firing       insults

towards           other          officers,             myself       and       persons         in g e n e r a l        who     were

present           on    the       pitch.

1 saw m a n y           fans          and    officers            carrying           bodies         away        on a d v e r t i s e m e n t

boards        and       leaving             the    pitch        vi a    the       exit      to     the     gym.         I only         saw    one

ambulance              originally             on       the     pitch and            then after             20 m i n u t e s       another

came.         I was          amazed          that        20    or 3 0       had     not     been      directed             onto     the

playing           area.           I ke pt#, t hi nk i ng            where         are     all      the a m b u l a n c e s ,        has

anyone        asked              for m o re .

Many     fans          on        the p i t c h         were asked           to    l e ave a n d       get       out of      the     way.           I

was met           with           the r e p l y         " I ’m l o o k i n g      for    my brother"               or "ma te".

Several           were       obviously             distressed               and     I spent         t ime       speaking          to    them

to     try    to       help and             all    the        persons         I spoke         to    on     the       pitch     appeared

to     have       been       drinking,             to      some     degree.             I found           it     impossible            to

reason with                 many       of    the       fans     and     I am        s ure     t hat       they       did    not     know      the

full     extent             of    the       tragedy.            I certainly               d i d n ’t k n o w         so m a n y     people

ha d    died.           In       fact       I made        a    remark         just      after       4 o'clock              (1600)       to    one

of my        colleagues,                PC    Humphries,               to     the      effect       that        I thought           there
                                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                                R 104

  ha d    been about            8 fatalities.                 He   replied       "More         like       5 0" .     I was

  numbed      by    this        and    realised          in m y     own    mind        t hat    I should            have     d on e

  more to help.

  I later       joined          a number          of    officers         who    ha d    formed        a     l ine    across         the

  pitch.        I was       then       directed          to a s s i s t    in    crowd         control         outside          the

  ground and         assist           re    the    Nottingham            Forest        supporters,             who       left      the

  ground      without           any    incident.

  I was      joined        by    the       other       members      of    the    serial         and       I again         assisted

  in the R a w s o n S p r i n g            Road       area.       After       the     crowds        h ad    cleared         I went

  to C l a y w h e e l s    Lane       and    travelled            back    to C2 S u b          Division            for    debrief.

  I went      off    duty        at    8 .00pm         (2Q0Q).

  I have      attended           two       other       semi    finals      at    Hillsborough.                     The    last      one

  in     1988 w h e n      I was       on    duty       before      the    m a t c h at        the    Leppings            Lane     end

  turnstiles.              Although          the       crowd were         generally            rowdy and            in    high

  spirits      there        was       no    serious       crowd      disorder          or a n y       crushing            n e ar   the

  gates.

  I submit         this     report          for    your       information.

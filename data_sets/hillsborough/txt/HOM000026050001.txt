                 NINETEENTH DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                   MONDAY,       12th JUNE, 1989

                       (MORNING      SESSION)

        MR. COLLINS:    Sergeant Goddard, please.

          POLICE SERGEANT MICHAEL GODDARD Recalled

                Cross-examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Q. Mr.Goddard, may I ask you just a little bit about two
   things to begin with, first of all, radios and then the
   hierarchy at control in the control box? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. On the question of radios I think on Friday you endeavoured
   to explain what the situation was.  Do you have in front of
   you the South Yorkshire Background Material Booklet, Volume
   1, page 102 in Section 6?  It is a small bundle, Officer,
   the thinner one with tabs that only go up to 7. - A, Yes.

Q. It is background material. - A. Yes.

Q. Have you got it there? - A. Yes.

Q. First of all, was it the practice at the football ground
   to have the radios - that is the radios carried by the men
   on the ground - in contact with control on talk back? - A.
   That is correct, yes, sir.

Q. And that   has always been the practice? - A. Yes, it has,

Q. And that is because generally speaking it enables every­
   body to know what is going on? - A. That is correct, yes,
   sir.

Q. Of course it is affected by the volume of traffic   on
   the air? - A. Y e s .

Q. And if one looks at page 102 it does there set out how
   the system works.  Paragraph 61 19, everyone with a radio
   turned on to the appropriate channel can hear all the
   transmissions by anyone else, including the control room?
   -A. That is correct, yes, sir.

Q. That is with the control room using the equipment that we
   see in the photograph? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. That is the large radio set? - A. Yes.

Q. Not using the hand control which each Officer who has been
   equipped with a hand control set has on the ground? - A.
   Correct, yes.

Q. If more than one radio transmits at any one time all other
                                                M. GODDARD

sets including control room get all the messages.  However,
it becomes increasingly difficult to understand individual
messages when several Officers are speaking? - A. That is
correct, yes, sir.

If the controller is transmitting on the hand set - that
is the one that is wired to the radio? - A, Yes.

And one of the personal radios transmits at the same time
then the control output is cut off? - A. Yes.

All users including the controller will receive the
message from the personal radio and that arrangement
is built into the equipment? - A. Yes.

That is the way it works.   It is standard equipment? - A.
It is, yes.

It can only be overcome by deselecting   talk through? - A.
Yes, sir.

When the control room moved on the day in question to
using a hand set did that result then in the control room
being in the same position as any individual in the
ground? - A. Exactly, yes, sir.

That was the means of using the equipment but it rendered
the control room equal? - A. Yes, exactly.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I have not followed how it
was not equal beforehand.

     MR. WOODWARD:   It was less than equal beforehand,   sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    On talk through, as I understand
it, aiiybody can transmit and eu®rybody hears until it becomes
so garbled nobody can understand. - A. That is right, sir.

That applies to control as well as out stations.     Is that
right?

     MR. WOODWARD:   That is right, save, sir ....

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   When you operate from the
hand set rather than the main set what difference does
it make?

     MR. WOODWARD:  It means, sir, that control is not
being cut off automatically.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I am sorry, I may be very dense
but I am not following,

     MR. WOODWARD:   What difference does it make? - A. If
                                                    M. GODDARD

     you use a normal tulip mike on the normal base set there
     if you transmit and at the same time someone is transmitting
     to yourself it will cut control out.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Right. - A. If I use a normal
     hand held set I have got just the same opportunity of
     getting on the airwave.

Q. It sounds as though the system of last resort here gave
   you a better option than .... - A. That is correct, sir,
   yes.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I do not understand that. I
     mean, I understand it but I do not see the point of it.
     Yes.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   That is the effect? - A. That is
     the effect of it, yes, sir. _

Q. On the question of the hierarchy, the arrangement of
   responsibility in the control box, first of all, there
   is Mr. Duckenfield? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Then Mr. Murray? - A. Yes.

Q.Then yourself? - A. Yes.

Q.   And the other two Officers? - A. That is correct,   sir, yes.

Q.   The team apart from Mr. Duckenfield that had worked in the
     control box had worked together on a number of occasions
     before? - A. Yes, yes, sir.

Q. Were you all familiar with the way each other proceeded?
   - A. Very much so, yes, sir.

Q. And was it necessary according to your experience to have
   to tell each individual Officer in the team what it was
   that you were doing? - A. No, not at all.

Q. Why was that? ~ A. We had worked together certainly over
   12 months so we knew - each person knew what the other
   was doing or was aware of what the other was doing and
   it was a matter of you trust in each other.  You would
   certainly rely on all your people and you work as a team.

Q. The use of the various items of equipment. - A. Yes.

Q. You would be receiving messages and passing messages?
   - A. I would, yes.

Q. So would Mr. Bichard be receiving and passing messages?
   - A. He would be receiving messages on VHF, yes, and
   passing on VHF, yes.
                            4




                                                       M. GODDARD

Q. And if there was any doubt on the part of, let's say, Mr.
   Murray or Mr. Duckenfield as to what you were saying or
   what the message was would they enquire? - A. They would,
   definitely, yes, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     So the VHF set was not operated
     by you but by M r ....... - A. Mr. Bichard.  It is a hand held
     set which ....

Q. That is the one that connects with the club? - A. No, no,
   with the Force Control.

Q. Is there another one that does connect with the club? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. And does he have that as well? - A. No.        That is on the
   desk with us.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I beg your pardon?

          MR. WOODWARD:   Forgive me, sir. I was interrupting.
     I did not intend to interrupt.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    No, no.

          THE WITNESS:   The club radio is on the desk which I
     operate or P.C. Ryan would operate.  P.C. Bichard would
     only operate the VHF radio to Force Control.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That is Hammerton Road or at
     Snig Hill? - A. No,  Snig Hill, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Snig Hill.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   Was the way it ordinarily worked and
     the way you and the team proceeded such that you would
     have expected Mr. Murray and Mr. Duckenfield on the
     occasion to have everything at their fingertips? - A.
     Yes, sir.

Q. Mr. Duckenfield was in the control box? - A. For a good
   length of time, yes, sir.




                                 / Q. So far as
                                         M. GODDARD

So far as you are concerned, do you have any doubts or
reservations as to whether or not he was aware of what
you were doing?    A.  None at all, none whatsoever, sir.

Were you aware of what he was doing?   A. Not particularly,
no.

Was there a reason for that? A. Yes, sir, he was behind
me;  I think he was directly behind me and obviously I
couldn't hear everything that Mr. Duckenfield would be
saying.

Was he in a position to give direct instructions to you?
A.  Yes, sir, he was.

In relation to the decision of delaying the game, postponing
the kick-off, would that be a decision that Mr. Duckenfield
would have to take?   A. It would, yes.

You got a request over the radio for the game to be
postponed?   A. That is correct, sir, yes.

When you replied to that, saying that it was too late,
were you in fact saying "No, the game must not be postponed",
or just stating that things had gone so far?   A. Things
had gone so far.

If Mr. Duckenfield or Mr. Murray had wanted to make the
decision to postpone the game, were they in a position to
have done that?   A. At that stage, no, sir.

Why was that?   A. Well, they were in the control box.
To get from there down to the players' tunnel, etc., into
the ground offices area itself, it would only take them
a minute or a minute and a half, but they would certainly
have to get a move on.

So in making that decision, according to your understanding
of it, it involves further communciation before it is
made, does it?   A. Yes, sir.

What did you understand that process or procedure to be?
A.  That they would obviously have to communicate with
members of the FA and the Club and the teams.

So however the decision would be made, that would not be
something that would have been in your mind?   A. No, sir.

And whoever was making the decision would take whatever
procedural steps he considered necessary?   A. That's
correct.

And would it be right that you are not in a position to
say quite what steps Mr. Duckenfield would have considered
it necessary to take?   A. Yes, sir.

Or Mr. Murray?   A. Yes, sir.
                                         M. GODDARD


You agree?    A. Yes, sir.

It was a matter within their responsibility and the ir
power?   A. Yes, sir.

To do it in whatever manner they chose?             A. Yes, sir.

Are you aware of the evidence that Mr. Murray and Mr.
Duckenfield have given about the question of postponing
the kick-off?   A. I am not, sir, no.

On the question of opening the gates, you were aware that
Mr. Duckenfield had given an instruction to open certain
gates?   A. Yes, sir.

You have spoken of giving authority or permission to open
certain gates yourself?   A.  'A' Gate, yes, sir.

That was intended to relate to 'A' gate, was it?               A. That's
correct.

Gate A?   A. Yes.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Sorry, gate     ...?

      Mr. WOODWARD:     'A', sir.

Did you have a reason for believing that that was a decision
that you could properly give?  A. I did, sir.

What was it?     A. Mr. Duckenfield, prior to him authorising
the opening of   gate 'C', had said "If people are going to
get injured or   killed, we have got to open the gates. '
The same thing   applied to 'A' gate, and that is why I said
"Yes, open 'A    gate.”

And was Mr. Duckenfield, if he had wanted, in a position
to countermand what you were saying?   A. Yes, sir, he
was behind me.

May I ask you about the request for cutters?  Did you
know that police accident vehicles carried metal cutting
equipment?   A.  That is what I understood, yes, sir.

So why did you make the request to Claywheels Lane?
A.  Because it is the nearest police station, which is
a traffic garage, to the ground.

If there was a vehicle there, would you have expected it
to have such equipment?   A. Exactly, yes, sir.

So that was the reason you made the request to             Claywheels
Lane?   A. Y e s , si r .

How far away is that?        A.   800 yards;      half    a mile.

      Mr. WOODWARD:     Thank     you, Officer.
                                              M. GODDARD

            Re-examined by Mr. COLLINS:

Sergeant Goddard, can I ask you to look at Tab 14 in the
big bundle, which is the Operational Order.   Can you turn
to 4.1.1, please, which is the part of the Order dealing
with communications?  It is about a quarter of the way
in to Tab 14 - page 12 at the top right?    A. 4.1.1, did
you say, sir?

4.1.1, yes.   It is page 12 at the top, about a quarter of
the way into that tab.    A.  I'm afraid the pages on here
aren't marked.

Let me see if I can find it for you.   This is a defective
one;  it is missing the page that matters.   Here we are.
(Handed to witness).   Do you have it - "Communications,
4.1.1"?   A. Yes, sir.

That   sets out the provision for the communications.  We
can see the UHF/VHF channel set out in 4.1.1.2?     A. Yes.

And then the reference to FI Sub-Divisional Operational
Functions on 35?    A.  Yes.

That is the UHF direct to Hammerton Road.        Then, at 4.11.5,
we have this:

        "Strict radio discipline will be maintained at all
        times.  Messages must be kept as short as possible
        and where this is not the case, ground control has
        the overriding option of cutting short any
        transmission irrespective of rank."

Now, correct me if I am wrong, but the only way in which
ground control can do that is by switching to non-talk-
through, is that right?   A.  That would be correct, yes,
sir .

And when the radio went down, as you have described, and
the civilian technician came in to mend it, after that,
you could not get the non-talk-through because you were
limited to your hand-held set?   A. Exactly, sir.

So you were unable to achieve what is set out in 4.11.5
thereafter?   A. Yes, sir.

        Mr. COLLINS:     I am obliged.   I hope that clears that
up.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I think it does.

        Mr. COLLINS:   Thank you, Sergeant.

      Mr. PHILLIPS:      Sir, may I now call Peter Wells  out
of order? He has   in    fact broken off his holiday tocome
andgive evidence to        the Inquiry.
                                             P. WELLS

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That is very good of him, and
we must accommodate him.

               PETER WELLS, Called
             Examined by Mr. PHILLIPS:

Are you Peter Wells?   A.    Yes, sir.

Are you a Divisional Superintendent with the St. John's
Ambulance Brigade?   A. That's right.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Thank you very much for coming.

      Mr. PHILLIPS: Have you in fact been in overall
control of the organisation of St. John's Ambulance at
football matches at Hillsborough for about four years?
A. That's true.

I think it is right to say that you have attended on not
only the League matches but also the larger matches, the
semi-finals, and the like?   A. Yes, every match.

Were you in fact in control of the ground on this particular
occasion?   A. I w a s .

You were?   A. From the St. John's Ambulance point      of view,
yes .

Of course. Could you speak a little nearer to the
microphone, please? It is a little difficult to hear you.
What was the basic arrangement that you had with Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club for the attendance of officers?
A. For normal League matches we arranged that we have a
minimum of about ten and twenty people there and one
ambulance, but for semi-finals we always increase it.




                       /Q. How do you know how many
                                  P. WELLS


How do you know how many members to bring to any particular
match? - A. Just experience. The amount of casualties we
have in the past we know what we can generally cope with
with the number of personnel available. We always have
back-up with the County Ambulance should anything major
arise.
Do you have a direct line to the County Ambulance Service?
- A. No, apparently there are two Ambulance Officers there
from the Club site with radios who can radio to the vehicles.

You can speak to them on your radios, can you?- A. I can't,
no. I can get to them through the Club obviously.

Do you get any information from the Club of the expected
gate for any particular match? - A. No.

So you simply have to work on experience and intuition as
to the number of people who would be expected at a given
match? - A. Well you know with the amount of people who
follow the various Club what the attendance will be
approximately, but if it is a well known Club and it is
a popular Club then you expect a large attendance.

Do you have much liaison at all with Sheffield Wednesday
Club? - A. As and when necessary. Graham Mackrell, the
Secretary is always available for discussion if anything
arises.
Do you receive any payment from the Club for your services?
- A. We receive a donation which was agreed between area
staff and the Club about two years ago, I believe.

Is that dependent upon the number of Officers of your
Brigade that attend? - A. No, it is a straight donation
for the year no matter how many we attend.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: For the year? - A. Yes, they
give a donation at the end of the season.

I see, it is not a match by match thing? - A. No, wedon't
work match by match.
What is the donation? - A. That I am not aware of. I think
it was in the region, it was discussed with the Area
Commissioner who at the time was Mr. Cooper and the Secretary,
but I think it worked out roughly round about £35 per league
game, but I am not sure.
      MR. PHILLIPS:  So you as a volunatary organisation
decide for yourself who to send to the match and what you
should do when you get there? - A. Virtually yes, by
experience.

You have radios, do you? - A. Correct, yes.
                                      P. WELLS


Q. How many radios do you have? - A. We have six altogether.

Q. There is one in the first aid room, I believe, one at each
   corner of the pitch and you have one as the Controller?
   - A. Control Officer, yes.

Q. Is this a separate wave length from everybody else's radio?
   - A. Yes, it is our own wave length.

Q. So you are able to communicate with your own members who
   have radios at the ground but not with anybody else? -
   A. No.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: The Police can't contact you?
     - A. No, we contact the Police verbally. We do keep in
     contact with the Police.

Q. I meant on the radio? - A. No, not on the radio, no.

Q.         MR. PHILLIPS: This system, of course, has worked
     for several years, has it not, at this ground and many
     other grounds in the country. Has it worked satisfactorily
     up to now? - A. Yes, we have handled - in my experience
     as the Duty Officer - we have handled four semi-finals and
     had no problem at all.

Q. On this particular occasion how many people did you decide
   to take to the match? - A. We took 25 adults, 5 senior
   cadets and 3 junior cadets and two ambulances.

Q. And two ambulances? - A. Which is what we have had in previous
   years and it has been satisfactory.

Q. Where did you keep those two ambulances? - A. One was outside
   the first aid room under the North Stand, the other one was
   in the car park at the junction of the South Stand and the
   Spion Kop entrance.

Q. We know that you have a first aid room under the North Stand
   and that was provided by the Club, was it not? - A. The
   room was provided by the Club, yes.

Q. What about the contents of the room? -A. The contents of
   the room was provided by St. John Ambulance. There are two
   examination couches in there, blankets, stretchers, they
   are all kept in there.

Q. How many stretchers do you have altogether at the ground?
   - A. There was two trolley stretchers, two out on the ground
   rather. There were four wire mesh stretchers. There was
   two trolley stretchers in each ambulance plus two scoop
   stretchers on each ambulance.  Scoop stretchers are for
   spinal injuries that can be used in an emergency.

Q. So each ambulance is equipped with two stretchers aswell
   as what you have in the first aid room, you say?

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Did you say two stretchers plus
two scoop stretchers? - A. One scoop stretcher on each
ambulance, so there were two scoop stretchers on the ground.

      MR. PHILLIPS: Do you in fact have some stretchers
out with you near the pitch? - A. Yes, there was one trolley
stretcher in the South Stand Kop corner and one in the West
Stand, North Stand.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I Want to get it right, sorry.
Each ambulance has how many stretchers in all? - A. Each
ambulance has two trolley stretchers and one scoop stretcher.

      MR. PHILLIPS: And that is in addition to the two
trolley stretchers at the ground plus the four wire mesh
stretchers? - A. Yes.

What other equipment do you have available to you? Do you
have oxygen? - A. Oxygen is carried on both ambulances, yes.

Is this in the form of a cylinder with I think two settings.
Is that right? - A. That is right, sir. It is a large
cylinder which contains 1,360 litres of oxgen under pressure.
It has got two settings on it, two litres a minute and four
litres a minute on high setting.

These settings, what are they for? Why do you have two
settings? - A. One for children and one for adults.

What is the purpose of these settings? I mean, should I
say what is the purpose of the cylinder.  Is it to
resuscitate people? - A. It is what is known as a "giving"
set. It is to provide oxygen should a casualty need
oxygen and that sort of thing.  It is just giving pure
oxygen into the atmosphere which the casualty breathes from.
It is not a resuscitator. It does not breathe for the
casulaty.

But nevertheless it has a tube I think on the end of the
nozzle, does it not? - A. And a face mask.

So you can put that over somebody's face and let them breathe
in? - A. And breathe the oxygen.

But they have to breathe it in themselves, do they?    It
won't force itself into the lungs.  Is that what you are
saying? - A. It will if you take the face mask off and
put the tube in the mouth, it will blow the oxygen straight
in, yes. It can be used in that way, which is what I used
it as .

You have one of these on each ambulance? - A. Yes.

Do you have any in the first aid room? - A. No.

On this particular occasion, as we shall perhaps see, there
was a suggestion that one of your oxygen cylinders was
empty. This is a suggestion made, I think, by one of the
doctors who attended. You know about that suggestion, don’t
you? - A. I know about the suggestion, yes.

Can you tell the Inquiry, please, what you know about that?
- A. The cylinder in question was the one I was using off
the ambulance that I took down there. As I say, when I
left. Headquarters that reading was full. I got the oxygen
cylinder off and I turned it on to the highest setting
when I was using it out on the ground. That cylinder never
came off the high setting and at the end of the incident
it was still half full. That set will provide oxygen on
high setting for five hours and 40 minutes.

Did you when you heard about this criticism check that
particular cylinder afterwards? - A. I did; took it off
the ambulance and placed it on one side.

Was it operating? - A. Yes, it was operating perfectly    and
it is still locked away now in case anyone wants it.

It is still available to be tested if necessary? - A.Yes.

Are you satisfied as being in charge of the Brigade at the
ground, were you satisfied with the equipment that you had
at the first aid room? - A. Yes, for normal events it would
have been quite sufficient.

Of course you rely particularly on the extra equipment that
you have got in the ambulances as well, don't you? - A.
That is right, we are equipped to deal with anything on
the ground from a first aid point of view. Anything
more serious we take the casualty to the hospital.

I think you in fact when you went to the ground went into
the corner of the Spion Kop and the South Stand? - A. That
is correct.

I think your wife was also in that particular contingent?
- A. She was in charge of the team in that corner, yes.

And the Metropolitan Ambulance Service came along, did
it?  I think one of their ambulances came on to the
pitch as well.  Did you see that? - A. Saw the ^ ...

You were still there, were you? - A. We were still on
the pitch at that time.

Yes.  And I think you went off to the Northern General
Hospital with some casualties and a Police escort? - A.
Yes, that is right.

And came back again? - A. Apparently I think our other
ambulance made four or five trips. I only made one.

You made one? - A. It was quarter-past to half-past-four
when I ....

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Did you say your ambulance
or ambulances? - A. Our other ambulance, the one that
Mr. Goddard was  driving, I think he made four or five
trips.

I am sorry.  One came on the pitch to the Leppings Lane
end. - A. The one on the pitch made about four or five
trips.

What about the other one? - A. I made one trip ....

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I see.

     MR. PHILLIPS:   By the time you were operating
that ambulance the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service
had attended? - A. Yes, they had already been in
attendance quite a while.

     MR. PHILLIPS:   Yes.   Thank you very much.

             Cross-examined by MR. H Y TN E R:

I just want to say, Mr. Wells, in the hundreds of statements
that we have read from the supporters in the ground not a
word of criticism has been levelled at your Brigade and I
would like to thank you very much on their behalf. -A.
Thank you.

             Cross-examined by MR. M U LL E R:

Mr. Wells, I wonder if you can try and help us a little bit
more about timings.  When you arrive at the fence itself
and saw the people obviously in discomfort - you mention
one particular girl - am I right in understanding that you
immediately realised that it would be a good idea to
remove the fence? - A. From what I could see immediately,
yes, the only way to get those people out was going to be
remove the fence.
                                                 P. WELLS

And within seconds of seeing that you were asking somebody
for some bolt cutters or something to get the fence down.
Is that right? - A. I would not say within seconds.  Within
minutes, within minutes of our seeing it because I had
already helped to clear the vomit from her mouth and tried
to hold the airway open, so I would say within three or
four minutes, yes.

Three or four minutes is quite a long time, you appreciate?
- A. Within three or four minutes of my attending there  I
was asking for the bolt cutters.

I am not sure whether you appreciate how long three or four
minutes is. Are you actually meaning three or four minutes
or are you meaning a relatively short period of time? - A.
Say short period of time.

Yes.  What I want to know from you is this if you can help
us.  So far we have heard that at about 12-minutes-past-3
which is approximately 12 minutes after the kick-off the
first request was made, according to the control people at
any rate, for some bolt cutters.  How does that square
with your timing? - A. It may have been about that before he
asked.

I am talking about as far as you are concerned.  Was it as
late as that that you were asking for them, 12 minutes
after kick-off? - A. It could have been round about 10
minutes, 12 minutes, yes.  It could have been.

Can I just understand it then, please, as far as you are
concerned? How long had you been - just give us some
idea - had you been at the fence before you asked for
some bolt cutters?  Just give us some idea? - A. A few
minutes.

A few minutes? - A. H'm.

If we take your figure,    three minutes, say, something like
that? - A. Yes.

Are you then saying that it was about nine minutes after
kick-off before you actually got to the perimeter fence
at pens 3 and 4? Cannot be right, can it? - A. The match
had kicked off.  As I say, I never saw any of the match
any way, so I would not know, but the match had kicked
off and there was a free kick being taken which, I mean,
you can get from the timings of the match.  A free kick
was being taken as I went in front of the South Stand.
That is all I know.  A free kick was being taken.  I
arrived at the fence, saw what was happening, jumped on
the hoardings with the Police to ask the crowd to move
back if they could possibly because people were in trouble
at the front, realised there was no possibility 6f them

               moving back, saw this girl at the front, went to assist
               her, cleared the vomit from her mouth, realised what was
               happening, turned round, saw the Inspector and spoke to him.

          Q. Mr. Wells, I think it must be, must not it, from that it
             must have been a lot earlier than nine or ten minutes past
             when you were asking for bolt cutters? - A. I do not know.
             There was that much going off there at the time, difficult
             to put a time on it.

                           Cross-examined by   MR. MAXWELL:

          Q. Mr. Wells, the 25 first aid assistants St. Johns provided
             they are qualified first aid assistants, are they? - A.
             They are not assistants.  They are first aiders, yes.
             They are fully qualified first aiders.

          Q. Fully qualified .... - A. Fully qualified.       The adults
             were fully qualified.

          Q ..... first aiders.  That means they have passed - what -
              St. Johns exam, or .... - A. That means they take an
              examination every year in either first aid, home nursing
              or basic life support and they must do this to keep
              their efficiency up.   They are all fully capable of
              doing resuscitation, control of serious bleeding,
              management of fractures.

          Q. All fully capable of what? - A. Carrying out full resus­
             citation, control of bleeding and management of fractures.

          Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I did not catch the rest.  I
               am sorry.   A little difficult because you are turning to
               Mr. Maxwell instead of the microphone.   Resuscitation? - A.
               Resuscitation, control of serious bleeding and management
               of fractures.   That is the basics.  They are trained beyond
               that.   But that is the basics they must attain.

                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes.

          Q.        MR. MAXWELL:   You are not aware of any arrangement
               between the club and St. Johns Ambulance as to the prov­
               ision of first aiders and first aid equipment, are you?
               - A. With regard - how do you mean to ....

          Q. Are you aware of any arrangement that was ever made
             between the club and the St. Johns Ambulance as to the
             provision of first aiders at football matches at
             Sheffield Wednesday? - A. I am not aware of any written
             agreement or anything like that.

          Q. If there had been any arrangement is it something that
             you would be aware of or would it be dealt with at some
             other level in the St. Johns Ambulance? - A. It would be
C-14   '
                                       22




                                                              P. WELLS

                dealt with at Area level.

           Q. At Area level.  The equipment in the first aid room is
              that equipment owned by the St. Johns Ambulance organ­
              isation? - A. All apart from the emergency kit which I
              asked Graham Mackrell to provide which he did do.

           Q. And the emergency kit was provided by the club.    Is that
              right? - A. That is right.

           Q. And it consists of what? - A. It consists of a hand case
              carrying triangular bandages, emergency dressings and
              things of that nature that we could pick up and take into
              the crowd  to be used as and where necessary.

           Q. St. Johns Ambulance organisation provides first aiders
              for many different events, does not it? - A. That is right.

           Q. Football matches, other sporting matches, pop concerts
              and so on.  Is there any basic working list that the
              St. Johns Ambulance have to identify the kind of equipment,
              first of all, that you need at an event of that kind where
              you have masses of people? - A. Not necessarily because
              an accident is an accident, an injury is an injury.  It
              does not matter whether it is a pop concert or a football
              match, if a person is injured the injury tends to be the
              same.

           Q. But there is not a list of equipment? - A. That we would
              take with us?

           Q. Yes.  - A. No. We provide what we think would be necessary
              for the occasion.

           Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am sorry.  I am losing your
                voice.  It is a little difficult.  Would you try and speak
                this way although you are getting the questions from
                there? - A. We take with us what we feel necessary for
                the event.  If we do need any specialised equipment then
                we would take it along or ask for it to be provided.

           Q.        MR. MAXWELL:   But the equipment that you take is
                chosen by you on the basis of the experience that you
                have built up over many years of such events.  Is that
                right? - A. That is correct.

           Q. And for the purposes of resuscitation on this occasion
              did you have available the oxygen you have referred to?
              - A. We had two exygen cylinders available, yes.

           Q. Was there any other equipment specifically for resus­
              citation? - A. Each ambulance carried a suction unit
              which is both power driven and battery driven which is

        used for removing vomit or fluid from a casualty's throat.

             MR. MAXWELL:   Yes.        Thank you very much.

                   Cross-examined by MR. KALLIPETIS:

     Q. Mr. Wells, among the first aiders that attended the ground
        that day I believe there are a number of cadets as well.
        Is that right? - A. That is correct.

     Q. How many were there? - A. There is five senior cadets and
        three junior cadets.

     Q. Senior cadets, is that by age or by training? - A. By age
        and training.  By age and training.  The training goes up
        with the age limit.

     Q. Is that among the number of, I think, 30 you told My Lord
        attending on behalf of St. JohnsAmbulance? - A. 25 adults,
        5 senior cadets and 3 junior cadets.

     Q. I see.  You have described the equipment that you carry
        on your ambulances.  Do you carry the resuscitation
        equipment Minutemen or .... - A. Can you repeat that,
        please?

     Q. Yes.  Do you carry any resuscitation equipment on your
        ambulances? I think they are called a Minuteman. - A.
        No, we do not.

     Q. You do not.  The oxygen that you carry I think it is just
        straight free flowing oxygen?- A. Straight free flowing
        oxygen, yes.

     Q. And I think you have a telephone extension on the club
        telephone in the first aid room, do you not?- A. No.

     Q. You do not.  So there is no way of contacting the first aid
        room other than through a first aid or a St. Johns Ambulance
        man? - A. That is right, by radio.

     Q. Well, you can contact each other by radio? - A. That is
        right.

     Q. Nobody can contact you by radio .... - A. No.

     Q ..... as I understand it.  You were asked about the payment
         for your services, Mr. Wells and you said as far as you
         believe there was a donation per season.   Does that apply
         to Cup semi-finals as well?   Is there an additional arrange­
         ment for that? - A. That once again is arranged by Area but
         I do believe that is just for the League matches.   The semi­
         final comes on a separate footing, I believe.

     Q. A separate arrangement.        Would that be so much per thousand
                          24



                                                    P. WELLS

   of the gate, do you know? - A. I have no idea.    I cannot
   answer that.

Q. And I think the division of responsibility between your­
   selves and the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance
   Service is that you are there primarily to deal with
   all minor injuries, faintings, sprains, even broken
   or fractured limbs? - A. Yes.

Q. And SYMAS are there in the event of a major in5ury
   requiring hospital treatment.  Is that right? - A. Yes,
   for a semi-final they do provide vehicles as a back-up
   to our service. Obviously the more numbers there the
   more liable you are to have problems.

Q. Indeed, indeed.   I suspect you would be happy if they
   were a permanent feature, would not you? - A. Not
   really because we can handle - most League matches
   are not necessary.   We do not have that many problems
   really.

Q. For something like a Cup semi-final? - A. For a Cup
   semi-final I can see the logic in it of providing a
   back-up service, yes.

Q. Yes.  Did you have any liaison with SYMAS for the Cup
   semi-final? - A. No.  They liaise with the Police.
   The Police ask SYMAS to attend as well as us.

Q. As a back-up to your service.    Thank you.

                Cross-examined by   MR. GLASGOW:

Q. Mr. Wells, your relationship with the club goes back
   beyond the employment of Mr. Mackrell, the present
   secretary, or Mr. Lock, the present security officer,
   does not it? - A. Not my personal one.  The St. John
   one does, yes.

Q. No, I think you yourself have been there - have you been
   coming to the club .... - A. I have only dealt with Mr.
   Mackrell and Mr. Lock.

Q. Yes.  And I think you were dealing with the club shortly
   before either of them arrived.  Do you remember that? - A.
   I do not remember that.  The only two persons I have
   ever known ....

Q. They are the only two people you have dealt with.  To
   what extent do you get involved in the actual administration
   and the organisation before the games, Mr. Wells? - A.
   For the last two years I have been asked to go down to
   the pre-season stewards' meeting along with the Police
   and the Fire Brigade just to have a chat to the stewards
                                                    P. WELLS

     about what we would expect them to do in the case of an
     accident so we can liaise.

Q. I think since Mr. Lock arrived you have been attending
   these - they are called pre-season briefings? - A. Yes.

Q. And although there is no depth of instruction in first aid
   I think from your attendance at those meetings it would be
   fair to say that you know that the stewards are receiving
   instruction in a number of different areas? - A. Just in
   what to do, yes, if they do have an accident.

Q. And your involvement in those evenings, freely and kindly
   given; your time, has been to tell the stewards what you
   expect of them in the event of there being an emergency?
   - A. That is right.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What sort of thing are we
     talking about? - A. Well, if they see a casualty or if
     someone suffers a heart attack or something they inform
     the Police who inform us and then they guide us straight
     through with a minimum of loss of time so we know exactly
     where we are going to and what we ....

Q.        MR. GLASGOW:   And I think you or one of your Officers
     gives some very basic instruction about what they should
     not attempt to do since they do not have qualifications?
     - A. That is it. We just tell them what to do basically
     for the casualty.

Q. I do not want to overstate it, Mr. Wells.  I think in fact
   you telling them really what vnot to attempt to do ...A.
   That is it, yes.

Q ..... until you arrive.   That is rather more the line, is
    not it? - A. Yes.

Q.And the way in which they should get in touch with you and
   what they should do about simply remaining with a person?
   - A. That is right.

Q. And not attempt to do anything that they are not qualified
   to do until a qualified first aider arrives? - A. Correct.

Q. Because am I right in saying that it is your view and,
   indeed, a view of your Association that despite the heroic
   and well meaning efforts that amateurs do make first aid
   is something that is better left to those who are qualified
   in first aid if they are available? - A. It is a skill that
   is needed, yes.  You do need teaching to do it properly.

Q. And on the whole your message is to warn people off trying
   to attempt to do things unless they absolutely have to
   provided the qualified first aiders are on hand? - A. No,
                           26



                                                     P. WELLS

     I would not warn people off completely.   Anybody who has
     a go has got to be doing something right.   Obviously if
     a casualty is in trouble, telling them what is the matter
     with them then they have got to handle him more carefully.

Q. Yes.  So far as   the organisation   for each game, I think
   you know that a   letter is writtn   to your organisation
   formally to the   secretary.  Were   you aware of that? - A.
   I believe there   is communication   between the club and
   secretary, yes.

Q. It is very unfair to press you on areas that you do not
   know when obviously we have nothing but admiration and
   gratitude for the work that you do do but perhaps you
   could save us having to call other people by looking at
   the correspondence for me and then if you cannot help
   I won't press you.  You have got a black bundle there
   in front of you that looks like that which contains two
   of the examples and perhaps you could just help us with
   those, Mr. Wells.

          MR. GLASGOW:   This is, for the note,   the Sheffield
     Wednesday bundle, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes.

Q.        MR. GLASGOW:   If you go to page 134 and again it
     may be that you never see these, Mr.Wells, but that
     appears to be the letter written by the secretary to
     the secretary just informing them of the fixture.   Do
     you see? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you know that that was in general terms the pro­
   cedure that was followed? - A. Yes, I have had these
   letters before.

Q. You have seen them? - A. When I was Duty Officer I used
   to ....

Q. Thank you very much.  And if you would just go on a few
   pages to 137 we see again, do we, the sort of letter
   that your organisation would reply with saying, "Thank
   you for your letter.  I can assure you the necessary
   first aid cover will be provided by the Sheffield
   area"? - A. Yes.




                                 / Q. And you were
                           27

                                             P. WELLS

Q. And you were aware of the fact that what the Secretary
   wanted to be assured of was that your usual kind services
   were being provided and adequately provided for each game?
   A.  Yes.

Q. I think you have told us that at a semi-final it would be
   unnecessary for you to be told the precise numbers because
   you yourselves would know that that would be a capacity
   crowd?   A.  Yes.

Q. And called for the entire service that you would be able
   to provide?   A. Yes.

Q.    On the smaller games, I think Mr. Mackrell was in the
     habit of writing to you and giving you some assessment
     of what the probable crowd was likely to be at League
     games?   A. I wasn't aware of that.

Q. You were not aware of that.   You can take it no further
   than that this sort of exchange of letters is, in your
   experience, typical preceding all the games that you have
   been responsible for?       A. Yes.  What happens is that
   usually for League matches we just take them as granted.
   We have a fixture list, so we know what is taking part,
   and then for the larger ones we obviously contact     the --

Q.    I see.  Can you help me about the facilities that you have
     at the ground?    Does your experience go back to 1982
     when the local authority and the safety committee were
     concerned about the adequacy of first-aid facilities?
     Do you remember that?    A. Yes, the Health and Safety at
     Work came in, and the Health and Safety at Sports Grounds;
     they all came in on the same one, I believe.

Q. And do you remember that there was a visit to your room
   in the North Stand in order to satisfy themselves that
   what was available there was satisfactory?  A. I was aware
   of that, yes.


Q. To take it very shortly, at the end of a series of meetings
   were you told that the safety committee were satisfied
   with the facilities that you were providing in your room?
   A.  Indirectly I was informed that the Health and Safety
   had been down there and checked the room and it was okay
   by their standards.

Q. And you knew that that reassurance that you had been
   given had been preceded by a period of concern as to
   whether the facilities were adequate or not? A. That was
   on the provision of the first-aid room.

Q. Yes, I entirely accept that;   whether the equipment in the
   first-aid room satisfied the working party? A. Yes, that's
   correct.

Q. And after the matter had been looked into, you knew, you
   say indirectly, that they were satisfied?   A. Yes.  It
                             28

                                                   P . WELLS
     does not only apply to the toilet facilities and the
     washing arrangements.

Q. Well, I do not know how deep your knowledge goes, Mr.
   Wells.    Were you aware of the fact that the safety
   committee had inspected the actual facilities and the
   equipment in that room?   A.  The only equipment in that
   room were the stretchers and the couches.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Two couches?   A. Two couches,
     yes.

Q.         Mr. GLASGOW:  And do you remember how long after
     that you received the request from Mr. Mackrell for the
     emergency bag?   A. I requested that off Mr. Mackrell.

Q. I am sorry, that you requested from Mr. Mackrell?           A. Two
   years ago.

Q. That was two years ago?    A. I mentioned it to him in one
   of the preceding meetings that they didn't provide us
   with any equipment whatsoever, and he said "Well, let me
   know what you want and I'll get it for you", and that was
   from the emergency point of view, dressings, etc.

Q. After that meeting, I was just going to come to that
   point when Mr. Mackrell said "If you tell me anything
   that you need, I will see that it is provided."  I think
   the only thing that had occurred to you during the interim
   had been this emergency bag?   A. That was all we used,
   actually.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   An emergency ...?

            Mr. GLASGOW:   It was called an emergency bag, sir.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   This had the dressings in?

           Mr. GLASGOW:  I think, in fact, it is what we would
     call a first-aid bag, with the dressings and that kind
     of thing in.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes.

Q.         Mr. GLASGOW:  Mr. Wells, even looking back on this
     terrible tragedy and all that you did, is there any other
     equipment which from St. John's point of view you would
     have liked to have had provided?  A. Not really necessary,
     sir, because I don't think any amount of equipment or
     any amount of knowledge on that field would have helped.
     I mean there has been a lot of talk about defibrillators
     and resuscitation equipment, but it wouldn't have helped
     those casualties in the ground.

Q. I thought it right just to invite your view on that.   So
   far as £/ou are concerned from your own experience, even
   now, there is nothing that you could think of asking for
   by way of equipment to be provided that would have helped?
   A.  Certainly if the Club would like to provide
   defibrillators and things like this, then we will
   certainly train our personnel to use them.
                                              P. WELLS


      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Mr. Wells, I quite follow^that
it would not have helped those who were already dead in
the Pens, but would it not have helped those who were
struggling?   A. Well, you can't use a defibrillator on
someone until their heart has gone into defibrillation.
If you do, you are going to electrocute them.  These
people in the Pens had asphyxiated through lack of oxygen,
not through any heart problems;  it was just pure lack of
oxygen caused by pressure from the crowd, and in my opinion
there was nothing anyone could do for those people, no
matter what equipment you had handy.

       Mr. GLASGOW:  I wonder if I could just ask you about
the defibrillators which we have heard so much about.   It
is right to say, is it not, that that is a piece of
equipment which is potentially very dangerous?  A. It can
be in untrained hands, yes.

In the hands of anybody other than quite a skilled operator?
A.  That's right.

And it is not something which would be safe, with respect,
to leave even to one of your fully trained St. John s^
Ambulancemen unless he had been specifically trained in
the use of that equipment?   A.  That's right, yes.

And it is not only a question of the safety of the victim
or the patient but it is a question of the safety of
those who are in the area standing round and within
contact, is it not?   A. Yes.

Would it be fair to say that   from your own point of view
the use of defibrillators on   that pitch in the
circumstances which we have seen would have been^
completely out of the question?    A.   In my opinion,
yes, defibrillators would have helped.

Could you just finally help me on the question of money?
This may be a matter that you do not get involved in,
Mr. Wells, and forgive me if it is a difficult one.   I
think you may be aware that the St. John's Ambulance have
had difficulties with the Commissioners of Customs and
Excise over VAT problems.  Did you know that?   A. No,
I didn't know that.

Did you know that the annual contribution to the charitable
foundation which you represent has to be, in principle,
unrelated to any services that you provide?  A. No, I
wasn't aware of that.

You did not know about that at all?     A. No.

I will try and take it up with somebody else.  A. Can I
just make a point, before you finish, on these resuscitators?

Please do, Mr. Wells;  I did not mean to stop you.  A. A lot
of people have been bringing up the point about resuscitation
                                           P. WELLS


equipment, but  the people on the ground were getting
the best resuscitation that they could have by physically
being done mouth-to-mouth on.  There is no machine that
can replace mouth-to-mouth, not even done by a trained
operator, and the police, the fans and the St. John's
Ambulance were doing that.

I am sure you appreciate,    Mr. Wells - and I hope everyone
else does - that there is    not a hint of criticism in any
of our questions.  A. No,    but it's just on the point
about the equipment, that    even with resuscitation you
 can't do any better than    mouth-to-mouth, which was
being done.

You remain of the view that additional equipment could
not have helped - at least helped you?      A. It would
probably have helped.     Don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying
it wouldn't have helped, but you could have had a team
of surgeons there and I don't think they would have
saved any more   lives than what was saved;    that's what
I'm saying.  I d o n 't personally think that we could do
anything for the people who was already in that crowd
dead before we were brought in.

      Mr. GLASGOW:  Mr. Wells, at the risk of repetition,
we too are very grateful and full of admiration for what
you did.  Thank you, sir.

      Mr. KALLIPETIS:   Sir, may I put a few questions
arising out of what Mr. Glasgow put in relation to the
offer being made for equipment for St. John's?

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Yes.

     Further Cross-examined by M r . KALLIPETIS:

Mr. Wells, please do not think that we are in any way
criticising;    on the contrary. You have said that your
people are trained in first-aid.   Do you find that using
a bag and a mask is easier for the purposes of basic
resuscitat ion?

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Easier than what?

        Mr. KALLIPETIS:  The ordinary mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation?     A. We haven't got any bags and masks
but I have used one in the past and I don't think it's
a s effective as mouth-to-mouth, personally.


May I suggest what the ambulance officers would say, to
give you an opportunity to comment on it.  The difficulty
with human contact mouth-to-mouth is, of course, that
the person administering it has to breathe in themselves
and it is exhausting after a while?   A. Yes.
                                              P. WELLS
Whereas with a bag and a mask, of course, you are using
a manual operation which is sucking in air and breathing
it into the lungs.  On reflection, do you think that if
your people had bags and masks with them, it might have
made life easier on this particular occasion?  A. It
might have made life easier for our people, but, having
to use a bag properly, you need two hands to use a bag,
one hand to hold the bag and one hand to hold the head
back, and that's where the difficulty is, because you
can't use a bag successfully with one hand.

But is not that the same situation when you are giving
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation?   A. With mouth-to-mouth
you have got both hands free.

I thought one had to close the nose with one hand?
A.  The same hand as you are holding the head back with.

Perhaps we will have to differ about that, Mr. Wells,
but you are entitled to your opinion.    The other matter
is this:  so far as defibrillators are concerned, is it
quite right to say that it would be madness to try to
use those in a crowd, in the crowded conditions on the
field on that day? Would you agree?    A. Yes.

Not only have you got to be absolutely certain  that the
patient is in a fit state to have a defibrillator used
upon him but there must be no danger of any physical
contact between the patient and the operator and any
other person, because they would be electrocuted as well?
A.  That's  correct, yes.

It might be different if you had, in the relative quiet
of your first-aid room, a stable platform and unencumbered
space in which to use a defibrillator, and if such were
available, as I understand it, you are qualified to use
one - is that right?    A. No, we are not qualified to
use one, but if one was made available then I could get
our personnel trained to use one.

      Mr. KALLIPETIS:   Thank you.

            Cross-examined by Mr. WOODWARD:

Mr. Wells, your experience in St. John's is over 28
years?   A.  On and off, yes.

You have also had experience of rescue situations in the
Fire Service?   A.  Yes.

So when you speak of the efforts and the attention that
individuals got on that day, it is not simply from book
learning, it is from having done it and been in rescue
situations.  Are you saying that if one stands back and
looks at the attention that you observed individuals
being given that day, that really is the best that could
                                            P. WELLS


be done in that kind of situation?     A.     Given what we
had got there, yes.

That the attention that was given personally to
individuals without reliance on pieces of equipment
that might have been unfamiliar or perilous to use
was the best that you would organise if you were
organising it?   A. Most of the casualties in there
were suffering from lack of oxygen.

May I ask you a little bit about the events that happened
before you were aware of the disaster?  You had radio
contact between the four corners of the ground? A. Yes,
that's correct.

Does that mean that there were four radios amongst your
men or more than four sets?   A.  There were six in all,
one in each corner, one that I had and one in the first-
aid room.

And those are all radios with which you were all familiar
A.  Yes.

How long had that kind of radio been in use by you?
A.  About eighteen months, two years.

Did you find on the day any difficulties in using those
radios?   A.  No, all the sets were tested and proved
working.

They all worked, but was there a problem because of the
background noise?    A.  Yes, that is the only problem.
If you are in the Kop end and the Kop starts shouting,
you do have trouble hearing the messages .

Of course, that would depend upon wherever you were if
there was big background noise?   A.  Yes.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Did you have any ear-pieces?
A.  No, we didn't have ear-pieces;   we haven't got
ear-pieces yet.

       Mr. WOODWARD:   You haven't got ear-pieces      ...?
A.   Yet.

Were you trying to use your radio at all whilst you were
down at the Leppings Lane Terrace end? A. No.   I heard
the call go over and everyone was attending.

The arrangements that you had for placing your men around
the field, were those arrangements that were tried and
tested by practice?  A.. Yes.

That meant that you had numbers at each corner?        A. Yes.

It may be difficult to say now how many you had at each
                                           P. WELLS


corner, but was it of the order of five or six? A. Yes,
and balanced between male and female, because obviously
there are female casualties as well as male casualties,
so you try and balance the corners.

When you put them at the corner, do you expect them to
stay rooted to the spot or to be moving around?  A. The
instructions I give them are to sit in the corner and
if they are called to a casualty, then two people go with
the radio and report back what it is, and then the back-up
goes from there.

Ordinarily the alarm to call you to a casualty might come
in a number of ways, from the casualty himself, from a
steward or from whomsoever notices?   A.  Usually it
comes from the Police to us.

Whilst your men are in their positions, would you be
expecting them not only to be alert for messages but also
to be looking round?   A.  Yes.

And generally to observe the situation just in case some
peril was developing?   A. That's right.




                               /Q.   You made a tour
                                     P. WELLS



You made a tour of the ground at about quarter-to-3? - A. That
is right.

Does it follow from what you said that you too would be
looking out for any perils developing or any potential
hazard? - A. Not being a football fan I usually do that
anyway.

You are more interested in the people than the game. At
2.45 you walked round looking at the crowds and nothing
struck you about any arrangement or gathering of people
as being in any way likely to cause hazard? - A. As I
said previously we did notice that the West Stand end was
not as full as it should have been.

Of course if you had observed any likelihood of crushing
or peril you might have said or done something about it? -
A. Possibly.
What would you have done? - A. I would inform the Police,
the crowd control is in their hands.

And as you walked round you chatted to your men? - A. I
went round not to chat, I went round to make sure they were
all familiar with the emergency procedure.

Forgive me, that was a disrespectful way of putting it.
You were talking to your men? - A. Yes, I went round
specifically to make sure they were all familiar with the
emergency procedure.

When your attention was drawn to the problem at the Leppings
Lane end had the game started, do you recall? - A. The game
had started when I went up, yes.

Which way did you make your way up to the end, can you
help me? - A. In front of the South Stand.

There are some photographs.    I am not sure if you have seen
them.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:Mr. Woodward,  if you don't mind
myasking, where are you going to? We are dealing with the
St. John's Ambulance.

      MR. WOODWARD: We are sir, yes.Times       may be important.
Sir, may I indicate where I am going?

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Yes.

      MR. WOODWARD: There is a photograph sir of which only
one print is available. The negatives are in the West Midlands
which has already been referred to in the evidence, timed at
14.59. Sir, might I show the witness the photograph?
                                     P. WELLS


        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Which one is it?

        MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, it is not in the bundle that you
have.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Is this the one that I had
briefly the other day?

        MR. WOODWARD:   It is sir, yes.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Somebody seems to have taken it
back.  I thought I was obtaining a copy of that bundle.
I see I seem to have had it on short term hire or loan.

        MR. WOODWARD:   It is the only one that is available.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     If it is helpful I would not
mind looking at it.

      MR. WOODWARD: Sir, we are endeavouring to have copies
provided but we have not got the negative.

      MR. COLLINS:  It is DB17/15, it is the one that comes
after 14, which shows much the same as 14.

      MR. WOODWARD:     Do you see that photograph, Mr. Wells?
- A. Yes.

That is timed at 14.59 and it clearly shows the West end,
the Leppings Lane terraces. One can see to the right of
the photograph the back of the goal, the goal netting, and
one can see gates in the terraces, in the perimeter fence
open. I think those are gates 3 and 4, and at that time
there are a considerable number of people already outside
the perimeter fence? - A. That is right.

And your St. John's people are already assisting? - A. Correct.

Are you able to identify any of those St. John individuals
there? - A. There is one there looks like Mr. Towler.

And there seems to be some cadets there? - A. Two of the
cadets, yes.

So by the time that photograph was taken there is already
a considerable build-up of people out from the terraces and
Police Officers and other individuals are engaged in attending
to the situation? - A. Yes, but they are presently still
behind the hoardings.

And your men are there as well? - A. Yes, I presumed that
the Police had got things under control at that end at that
time.

When you got to the terraces were you able to say whether
the scene had developed that far or not? - A. How do you
mean, the "scene had developed that far"?
                            36

                                        P. WELLS


Q. Well you see the number of people that are already out and
   the number of individuals engaged in giving their attention
   back through the fence on to the terraces? - A. Yes, those
   people who were trying to get back in, we thought at first
   there was a pitch invasion. When we arrived at the scene
   obviously it wasn't.

Q. Perhaps you would be kind enough to look also at the
   photograph in the Composite Album Number 2, PR2/1.   It is
   the sixth photograph from the back of the bundle.  If
   one looks at the left-hand corner of that photograph
   there can be seen two individuals, one with a white sash
   or band around his uniform and another gentleman with a
   white band around his hat? - A. Yes.

Q. Are those, doing the best you can from the photograph, do
   they look like St. John Ambulance Officers? - A. Correct.

Q. Are you able to identify either of those individuals, a
   tall order? - A. Yes, the one with the white sash on is me
   and the one withthe white band round his hat is Philip
   Saxton.

Q. So that photograph, which is timed at 15.04, shows that
   you are already there and already involved in attending to
   the people? - A. Mine is timed at 15.15.

Q.   No, that is the date. - 15.04,   I was there, yes.

Q.   How long had you been up therebefore you got to that
     position we can see in the photograph? - A. Not very long
     because that was when I was helping the young female casualty
     by clearing the vomit from her throat and that was the
     position that she was in.

Q. One can see from that photograph that the gates are open?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall ever seeing those gates whilst you were out
   there? - A. I was not paying any attention to the gates.

Q. Just one matter:  you refer to a casualty in 1988 someone
   who broke his ankle. Did you know that that chap had
   jumped over the fence and fallen? - A. Last year?

Q. Yes? - A. Inside the pen?

Q. Yes? - A. I was not aware. I thought he had tripped on
   the terrace. He was not very communicative when we took
   him.
           MR. HYTNER: Sir, in my anxiety to congratulate the
     Brigade I missed out one question with a run up to the
     wicket beforehand.
                                  P. WELLS


           Further Cross-Examined by MR. HYTNER:

You I think at some stage, Mr. Wells, assisted the Police by
leaping on to the barrier and shouting to the crowd to get
back? - A. Yes.

It was perfectly obvious to you after a moment that they
could not go back because of the weight of the numbers behind?
- A. From the higher position you could see there is no way
they could go back.

Was that Pen 3 or 4? - A. That was roughly where I was on
this photograph, the same position.

      MR. HYTNERt   Thank you.


                Re-Examined.by MR. COLLINS;

Mr. Wells, 2.45 when you go round and you notice that the
West terraces are emptier than you thought they were, they
ought to be at that hour. Did you notice anything about
the distribution on those terraces? - A. The fans seemed
to be congregating behind the goal but there again those
always fill up first anyway.

How full were those parts? - A. They were relatively full.
There was not a lot of room in there but they were still
able to move about.

Was it sufficient at that stage to cause you any anxiety?
- A. Not at that stage, no.

The only other thing that I ought to ask you about is this:
you were asked about numbers.  Is there any relationship
between the numbers of St. John's Ambulance personnel and
the crowd? - A. Not usually. We try to provide cover in
each corner which we think will be sufficient for the
numbers of people there.

Were you aware that it was a condition of the   Safety
Certificate that there should be a particular   ratio of
first aiders and numbers of crowd? - A. I was   not aware of
a particular number.  I thought they wanted a   minimum of
people there.

In fact it is 1:2,000? - A. I was not aware of that.

Is a ratio of 1:2,000 in your opinion an adequate and
proper ratio? - A. Given normal circumstances I would
presume it would be, yes.

But you weren't aware of the arrangements? - A. I was not
aware of the numbers, no.
                                   P. WELLS


      MR. COLLINS: Yes, thank you. Sir, for the record
it is paragraph 8(3) of the Safety Certificate.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, thank you.


                  By LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:

Mr. Wells, just one matter.   You mentioned to Mr. Mackrell
that the Club did not provide any equipment and he said:
"Tell me what you want and I will get it for you". Is that
right? - A. Well within limits, obviously, I presume he
meant.

He would do whatever he could. What you got was the emergency
bag? - A. I told him it would be handy if we had some equip­
ment we could take out.

Anything else you asked for? - A. Not at that time, no.

On reflection is there anything else you think ought to be
provided in the first aid room? - A. On reflection I think
with liaison with the Club we could provide a far better
service, yes, by either equipment or communication.

I have had a letter from the head of St. John's Ambulance
who says that a formula has been drawn up - I don't know
whether you know about this - on a national basis which
makes recommendations as to what ought to be available.  I
don't know whether you have seen it? - A. I am not aware
of the content but I have heard there is a plan.

I am just wondering if there is any particular facility,
I am not looking back at this disaster now I am thinking
of the future, that you think ought to be there? - A. I
think resuscitation apparatus should be made available.

In the   first aid room? - A. In the first     aid room.

What have you in mind, just more oxygen cylinders or what?
- A. Something that will breathe physically for the casualty.

Yes, anything else? - A. Well there are various things, but
to go into the detail now, you know. We would have to sit
down and think about it with the Club.

I dare say I shall receive something later about that, but
I was thinking particularly of your experience of this ground.

       What about the first aid room itself.   It is not very
big.   Is it adequate? - A. It is in circumstances. Normally
with a big match the Police also use that end and it does
tend to become a bit congested round there if you have to
get casualties in and out because of the Police vehicles
round there.   It is also situated away from every, this is
why we   don't have much contact with the Club because we are
at the opposite end of where everything Clubwise happens.

Q. The second ambulance, it was never intended that that should
   be able to get on to the pitch, was it? - A. No, it was taken
   round that side for any casualties that side.

Q. That happened to appear at the South side.       Is that it? - A.
   Yes.
         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes, thank you very much.    Please
   resume your holiday.

         THE WITNESS:     Thank you.

         MR. COLLINS:  I have no doubt we can ask the St. John's
   Ambulance people in Sheffield to put in writing their
   recommendations?

         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes, or their Chief Commander.

         MR. COLLINS:  I was looking at the letter heading.
   Perhaps we could ask those in charge to submit in writing
   a list of what equipment they consider to be helpful.

         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes, thank you.


              POLICE CONSTABLETREVOR BICHARD Called

                      Examined by MR. COLLINS:

Q. Yes, it is Trevor Bichard? - A. Yes.

Q. Now you were on duty at the ground in the Control Room bn
   the day in question. How long had you done this sort of
   duty, or how often had you done this sort of duty? - A. Every
   home match for over a season.

Q. Every match ....     A. In relation to the video duties, sir?

Q. Well no, duties in the Control Room? - A. Over a full season,
   I think it was September 1987 when I took over those
   specific duties.

Q. And ever since then you have worked in the Control Room at
   football matches, have you? - A. I have sir, yes.

Q. I imagine you don't necessarily always do the same thing,
   or do you? - A. My specific duty is in relation to the videos,
   sir.

Q. Now just looking at the statement that you have provided us
   with, it is prefaced with what appear to be notes with times?
   - a . Initially I prepared sort of a log system to assist me
   putting together a statement really just to gather my thoughts
   into some kind of sequence.

Q. Indeed, I just wanted to ask you when you made that? - A. I
   commenced making the notes on the Sunday morning after the
   events had taken place.

Q. I think in fact, when one looks at it, some of your timings
   are a little bit out. They were based, were they, partly
   on memory and partly on access to a log? - A. They were
   purely memory.  I have established since then that memories
   are not that good.

Q. I think you are out by five or ten minutes on occasions, are
   you not? - A. I believe sometimes even more.

                                              T. BIGHARD

In your experience was this a larger build-up than you
had seen at matches or .... - A. I had only seen similar
numbers at that stage before when a League match,
Manchester United, came and we had an arrival of perhaps
25 coaches all at one time and that would be a similar
number as was at the Leppings Lane at 2.30.

Can you remember how long that took them to get that
number through? - A. Not offhand, no.

On that occasion they all arrived at once but were there
others arriving to build up on them, as it were, or was
it just that one off effectively? - A. No, it was a one off
effectively, the coaches arriving at the same time.

Yes.  On this occasion of course you knew that there were
fans still coming in behind, I suppose? - A. Began to become
aware as I looked down Leppings Lane and carried out a
view there that there are still foot passengers making
their way towards the ground.

Did you form any views about whether that number was
likely to get through before kick-off? - A. I felt quite
confident that they would get through.

How far up Leppings Lane could you see with your camera?
- A. The camera provides a view right along Leppings Lane
until it in fact bends to the right-hand side heading
towards Penistone Road.

So how far approximately is that up Leppings Lane?     Can
you help? - A. Maybe 250/300 yards.

Presumably if you use the zoom facility you can focus on
Leppings Lane and see at least for that distance the
numbers coming down Leppings Lane? - A. Again, when you
are using your zoom facility the picture  that you are
getting at its extreme is a rather large and general one.

I follow that, but it gives you an idea, I imagine, of
the sort of numbers coming down, does it not? - A. Yes.

Did anyone ask you to make that check to try to assess
the sort of numbers that were still coming down Leppings
Lane as the mass of people built up at the turnstiles?
- A . After I had switched the camera system to take the
views of Leppings Lane at 2.30 I went along Leppings Lane
to look at the crowd as it was moving along.   Yes, there
were foot passengers but it did not seem an exaggerated
number at that time.

Did anyone suggest that you might keep an eye on the
numbers coming down Leppings Lane and, indeed, the
numbers outside the turnstile  so that you could monitor
the build-up? - A. I was directed to watch the circumstances
                                              T. BICHARD

that were developing at the turnstiles rather than what
was happening in Leppings Lane.  Obviously the larger
number were around the turnstiles.

I follow that, but did it not occur to you or to anyone
that the two should not be looked at in isolation because
the more you have coming down the worse the problem is
going to get, is not it? - A. I can appreciate that point
but speaking for myself my interest was directed at the
people around the turnstile area.

It did not get better any way, did it, as minutes went by
- A. Certainly not, no.

Indeed, it got worse? - A. Yes, it did.

Did you volunteer to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield or
anyone that the position was getting worse? - A. At the
time that this was happening Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield was stood just in front of my position
on the monitors.

So he could see them? - A. So he was looking up at the
monitor we were looking at and we were discussing the
general situation together.

What was the discussion as far as you can recall?
Obviously do not expect you to remember exact words.
- A. The matters we were seeing, particularly
individual events, was in relation to a mounted Officer
who seemed to be struggling with crowds who were pushing
his horse around.

It must have been fairly obvious, surely, that the crowd
was getting worse rather than better? - A. It was obvious
that the crowd was building up, yes.

Was anything said as time went on that you can remember
about possible delay of kick-off? - A. A conversation
did take place between Mr. Duckenfield, Mr. Murray,
possibly whoever else was in the control at that time
and I remember Mr. Murray saying that it was not our
policy to delay the kick-off for people who had just
arrived late at the ground.  Somebody else threw into
that conversation if there had been a problem on the
motorway or roadworks the situation is different.

So it was your understanding - I appreciate it is not
your decision. - A. Yes.

Senior Officers.  It was your understanding, was it,
that because the fans were choosing to arrive late
then there was no question of deferring kick-off? - A.
Yes.  I think the situation is if fans become aware
that by coming late kick-off will be delayed they will

     continue to come late.

Q. Yes, I see.  Now again at about this time between 2.30,
   2.40, that sort of period, were you aware of the civilian
   radio communications officer coming to deal with the
   radio? - A. Yes, he did come in and commence work on
   the set which is below the desk in front of me.

Q. We have heard Sergeant Goddard tell us about that and
   I am not going to ask you to go over the same ground.
   Did there come a time again shortly after or about
   this time that you heard something to do with the gates
   over the radio? - A. That is right.  Mr. Marshall was
   asking for the gates to be opened because of the problems
   outside.  When referring to gates the gates I am talking
   about, it is just C Gate.  Mr. Duckenfield1s attention
   was directed to C Gate as was mine.  That is the gate
   we were looking at.

Q. Which is not surprising because it was basically the only
   gate that you could really see through that camera? - A.
   That is correct.

Q. And it is the outside of which together with the inside
   of which you could see? - A. Yes.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Are you simply giving us
     your understanding of it or what Mr. Marshall said?
     - A. No.  Mr. Marshall was referring to opening gates
     because of the problems outside.  I directed Mr.
     Duckenfield's attention to C Gate and,  if you like,
     when reference was made to gates by Mr. Marshall that
     is the gate that I was looking at on the monitor and
     paying attention to.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:   That was certainly the gate that
     you could see in the video.  Did you understand or
     did you think Mr. Marshall was simply referring to
     that gate or to that and the other gates or did not
     you know? - A. My belief was that he was referring
     just to C Gate, possibly because that is where my
     attention was directed from what I could see.

Q. And you drew Mr. Duckenfield's attention to Gate C?
   - A. Yes, that is right, sir.

Q. You were aware, I imagine, that Mr. Duckenfield was not
   experienced at policing or overseeing the policing at
   football match at Hillsborough? - A. I knew he was new
   to the specific duty.

Q. Yes.   Now, again, your timing is a little out on your
   notes.   We know that it was at 2.48 that the gate in
   fact opened and it was at 2.47, just a minute or so
   before, Mr. Marshall requested the gates be opened?

                                                               T. BICHARD

               - A. I would accept the differences in time, yes.

          Q. Well, we have got the timing from the video and obviously
             that is more accurate than your memory.   But when that
             gate opened just after Mr. Marshall had asked for the
             gates to be opened what did you think had opened it? - A.
             There had been some conversation on the radio regarding
             pushing at the gates and gates bending and buckling and
             when that gate appeared to open'’ my immediate reaction
             was that the fans had in fact forced open that gate.

          Q.   Did you make some comment to that effect?   - A. That is
               right, yes.

          Q.   I think you said something like they   have broken down the
               gate? - A. That is the words I would   have used, yes, sir.

          Q. Yes.  But in fact after about 20 seconds or so it was
             closed again? - A. That is right, yes.

          Q. And according to your notes you put it thus, you say
             after 20 seconds gate closed.  Appears that it had been
             opened on purpose - sorry - appears that it had been open
             on purpose? - A. Is that on my original statement or the
             notes?

          Q. No.  I am reading out from the notes.   You have got a copy.
             In fact you time it at 2.40 which we know to be slightly
             inaccurate.   It is page 6 of my copy of the notes.   I have
             a typed copy.   I do not know.  It may not accord with the
             original. - A. Yes.

          Q.   You have got that? - A. I have got that, yes.

          Q.   As you see, it says after 20 seconds gate closed.Appears
               that it had been open on purpose? - A. Yes.   I was unsure
               about actually who had opened it or why it had been opened.

          Q. I want to see whether this is hindsight or whether this is
             what you thought at the time.   Your immediate reaction was
             to think the gate had been broken down?   - A. That is right.

          Q.   That is what you said? - A. Yes.

          Q. It was open for a very short time and then closed again?
             - A. Yes.

          Q. Did you then appreciate that in fact it had been open on
             purpose or was this something you were told later on in
             the afternoon? - A. It is quite possible that that is
             something that has come out during the events and me
             actually writing it down.

          Q.   I follow.  In any event we know that there was again   a
               request from Mr. Marshall? - A. Yes, in relation to
                             51



                                                      T. BICHARD

     opening of the gates.   It was more   insistent and far more
     concerned.

Q. And we know that the gate or that Mr. Duckenfield ordered
   the gate to be opened eventually at about 2.52? - A. Yes,
   after the request had come in Mr. Duckenfield paused for
   thought and made some comment about lives being lost,
   for the gates to be opened.

Q. The first request was 2.47.  Mr. Duckenfield did not make
   his final decision until about five minutes later.   Is
   that correct? - A. No, only moments later after that.
   The second request from Mr. Marshall was more concerned,
   more worried and appeared to be more like an order in
   that I want those gates to be opened.  It was more in­
   sistent and it was only a pause for thought about the
   situation before Mr. Duckenfield said open the gates.

Q.    Tell me, you were concentrating, as you have   told us,
     upon the video of the crowd at Leppings Lane    turnstile?
     -A. I was overseeing the videos, yes.

Q. You could obviously see all the videos because they were
   all on but which one were you concentrating on at this
   time? - A. At that time I would be watching the one at
   Leppings Lane.  From about half-past-2 that was where my
   attention was concentrated.

Q. There was presumably a video going of the situation on the
   West Terrace? - A. It was.  It was operating at that time.

Q.   Were you observing the build-up on the West Terrace at
     this? time or were you concentrating on the Leppings Lane
     turnstiles? - A. No, certainly my attention was drawn
     purely to monitor one which is the camera on Leppings Lane.

Q.   What I am getting  at is this.  Were you aware or did you
     draw to Mr. Duckenfields or anyones attention the state
     of the centre pens on the West Terracing when the decision
     to open the gate was made? - A. When the decision to open
     the gate was made, no.   I was concentrating on Leppings Lane.

Q. Because did it occur to you that if Gate C were opened the
   fans would be likely to go down that centre tunnel? - A.
   The simple fact of the matter is the tunnel is not in view
   from that camera.

Q. No, I know that. - A. And therefore it is out df mind.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Out of mind? - A. It is out
     of mind, sir, yes.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:Yes, that is very fair. So what you
     are saying in effect is that neither you nor apparently
     anyone else in the control room thought of the effect of
it   '
                                   52



                                                             T. BICHARD

            Gate C and the fact the fans were likely to go down that
            centre tunnel? - A. From looking at that picture that
            summarises my thoughts, my personal thoughts.

         Q. Well, effectively it was no thought rather than a positive
            thought? - A. I accept that, yes.

         Q. Now, the gate having been opened you saw no doubt the
            people coming in through that gate but did you hear
            later shortly after that another request  this time in
            relation to Gate A? - A. Yes.  That was the first time
            really that my attention had gone away from Gate C to
            Gate A and it was, I believe, Sergeant Higgins who was
            in charge of ....

         Q. And it was for that reason, I imagine, that you put the
            camera on to as you could the inside of Gate A? - A.
            That is right.  Obviously I am interested in why he had
            made the request.

         Q. Indeed.  Shortly after that did you or were you aware
            of troubles on the West Terraces? - A. Yes.  Once the
            gates had been open the problem obviously was alleviated
            outside.  The crowds moved in and concern was then more into
            relation with the fans getting into the stands out of the
            seating area on to the pitch.  Obviously that is, if you
            like, the next stage we moved on to.

         Q. So Mr. Duckenfield was concerned not with the terrace
            but with the influx through Gate A on to the North Stand.
            Is that right? - A. That is fair comment, yes.

         Q. But you were aware, were you not, or became aware - you
            have seen the photographs - at about one-minute-to-three
            people began to climb over the perimeter fence? - A.
            They did, yes.

         Q. And began to appear on the perimeter track? - A. Yes.

         Q. You saw that, I imagine? - A. I did, yes.

         Q, Can you remember what Mr. Duckenfield's reaction was in
            relation to that? - A. Again, speaking as regards my
            thoughts, it bore strong resemblance to the season before
            when the fans in fact invaded the pitch at the end of the
            game.

         Q. So your immediate reaction was pitch invasion, was it? - A.
            Certainly, sir.

         Q. But it must have become obvious fairly quickly   that it
            was not a pitch invasion? - A. I would not say   fairly
            quickly.  For a period of time we were looking   at that
            situation and I would speak for other Officers   in the
            control room as a pitch invasion.

                                                    T. BICHARD

Q. They did not actually invade the pitch, did they? - A. Right.
   They were climbing the fences, shall we say, in an attempt,
   in my view to get on to the pitch.

Q.   Well, how long did you continue to believe that youwere
     looking at a pitch invasion? - A. I would say certainly
     for three or four minutes.

Q. I see.  Yes.  Now, at what stage were you asked by anyone
   to contact the operations room to call Operation Support?
   - A. Again in relation to time between 3 o'clock and 4 that
   hour passed in my mind in the space of about five minutes.

Q.    Well, I think we can actually get the time. We know   it
     was at 3.07 that ground control asked for Operation
     Support; - A. I accept that because they have taped
     messages.

Q. Indeed.  That was you, was it, who sent that message? - A.
   I made the radio request on the instruction of Mr. Jackson,
   the ACC.




                                 / Q. Was it you
                             54



                                                T. BICHARD

Q. Was it you, too, who made the request for the ambulance?
   A.  I did, yes.

Q    And for the Fire Brigade?      A.   Yes.

Q. We know the times, because we have got records for that,
   so I am not going to ask you about that. The only thing
   I want to ask you about is this:   Snig Hill appears to
   have believed or got information which was passed on
   both to the Fire and the Ambulance Service, that fans
   had broken down the gates, putting it broadly - that
   thatis what had caused the trouble, that a gate had been
   broken down?    A.  I'm not sure.  If the transcript says
   that that is the message that I've passed to Operations
   Room, I accept the transcript, but I don't remember doing
   it.

Q. You had initially, you told us, thought that Gate         'C ' had
   been broken down?   A. I did, that's right.

Q. That was at first?     A. Yes.

Q. You knew, of course, that Gate 'C ' and indeed Gate 'A'
   had not been broken down when the majority of the fans
   came in?    A. Yes.

Q.   Were you given any instructions as to what you should say
     to Snig Hill about what the trouble   was?    A. In relation
     to calling Operations Support?

Q.    In relation to saying what had happened?  A. No,I wasn't
     given any instructions in relation to explaining what
     had happened.    I was given instructions as to what we
     required.

Q. Because it would seem, on the face of it, that the only
   way that Snig Hill could have got hold of the idea that
   there was a gate broken down was if you had told them?
   A.  I accept that.

Q.    Can you think of any other way they could have got hold
     of that idea?    A. Unless some sort of message was
     passed on personal radio, because in fact I believe they
     were monitoring the personal radio channel 25.

Q.    It does not appear from the record that we have that there
     is any such message certainly on the transcript that we
     have seen.    It does not mean that there was none, I follow,
     but certainly as far as it has been monitored there does
     not appear to have been.    A.  I accept that. I cannot
     offer you any explanation why they should formulate that
     idea.

Q. And you cannot now remember precisely what you did say?
   A.  Not at all, no.
                                           T. BICHARD
Did you know why you were calling the Fire Brigade?
What I am getting at is did you know what you wanted
from the Fire Brigade?   A.  I was paying attention to
what Sergeant Goddard was doing in relation to the
Brymac and obtaining the cutters, and when the realisation
was that he was not successful in getting those from
Claywheels Lane, I offered to contact the Fire Services.

But the Fire Brigade would want to know what they were
dealing with, would they not?  It was not a fire, for
example, and they would ----    A.Certainly I can remember
passing a message that we required the Fire Service
and for the Fire Service to bring cutting equipment.

      Mr. COLLINS:  I think that is all I need ask you,
thank you, Mr. Bichard.

             Cross-examined by Mr. H Y T NE R :

Mr. Bichard, I want to investigate,   if I may, just what
your duties were.  You clearly were   an expert in
investigating the monitors and the cameras?     A. I think
'expert might be an exaggeration;   experienced.

Experiened.  Were yourduties simply to operate your
machinery, your technology, under supervision and
direction, or did you have duties which derived from
your own initiative?    A.   The supervision of the monitors
and the operation of them is my initiative.    If I could
perhaps explain:  if I see an incident or notice something
on the monitors, I will bring it to the attention of
the Control Room staff.    Obviously if they see something
in particular, they will mention it     to me.

So this may be two ways.  Somebody may say to you, "Zoom
in on the centre of the South Stand, there's something
happening over there", and you will do it?   A.  Yes.

You, on the other hand, if you are watching the monitors,
may spot something and zoom in yourself?  A. Yes.

And if you can see it, youwill then say to somebody
"There is trouble there"?    A.  Yes.

Is there always an officer of the rank of Inspector or
above in the Control Room?    Are there occasions when
the senior officer there is Sergeant Goddard?  A. There
are odd occasions when Sergeant Goddard, P.C. Ryan and
myself are in the Control Room.

But would it be normal for the officer in charge of the
game or the commander on the ground to be in the Control
Room?   A. It would be normal for Superintendent Murray
to be present.
                                       T. BICHARD


When you are briefed as to what your duties are and
what initiatives you are to take, what was your
understanding?   Was it your understanding that your
principal function was crowd trouble and identifying
trouble spots so that they could be dealt with, and
identification afterwards?   A. That is just one of the
functions.  When the system is installed as command in
control, you lose evidence gathering.   However, when
the system is set up for evidence gathering, you gain
the benefit also of command in control.

What I want to know is this: Was it to your knowledge
one of your duties in which you were briefed to monitor
the ground for overcrowding in any particular spot?
A.  No, I have never been briefed in that direction.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Never been briefed ...?
A.  Never been briefed in that direction in relation
to monitoring overcrowding.

      Mr. HYTNER:  So during the course of the build-up
to what we now know was a disaster, it was never in your
mind that you had to watch out for possible overcrowding
on the Terraces?   A.  That's right, sir, it was never
in my mind at all.

Now, in the course of your long experience on the monitors,
have you ever actually noticed that in a particular
corner of the Kop or in a particular corner of the West
Terraces people are bunched together and look a bit over­
crowded?   A.  No.

Never?   A. Never.

This question, therefore, may be so hypothetical that you
may feel it an unfair one, but I shall ask it so that
you can consider it.   Suppose on that particular day
you had noticed that Pens 3 and 4 were full to what you
regarded as safe capacity, using your own judgment,
let's suppose at 20 minutes to 3. Would you have
considered it any part of your duty to draw that to
anybody's  attention?    A. I don't think it would be
possible to come to that assumption with these scanners.
Perhaps I can qualify that a little bit further?

Yes, please.    A. I would think that somebody who was
actually on the ground in the area is the one that
would have to make that sort of decision.

What about looking out as well as looking at the monitors,
because you have got a clear view through this enormous
glass window, have you not?   A.  You have, yes.

Are you saying that it would be impossible for you or
Sergeant Goddard or Superintendent Murray or Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield, looking down on the Terraces,
                                           T. BICHARD

to notice overcrowding if it occurred?   A. Yes.  I think
an example could be if you were to look at the Terrace,
the West Stand, earlier on in the day when it was obvious
that there was a smaller number in there and look again
at the pictures later, there will not be a great deal
of difference in its actual appearance on that monitor.

I am not going to press you on this, Mr. Bichard.   You
are giving very frank answers and if that is your
considered view, I will leave it.  I merely want to make
sure that this is the situation, because the Sheffield
Wednesday Club may disagree with this - I do not know -
but you are saying that so far as control of capacity,
that is controlling the safe capacity of the Terraces
is concerned, your monitors were useless and in any event
it was not part of your duty to use them for that purpose
A.  The monitors give you a false picture, a false
impression about the numbers in a specific area.   It
wouldn't be a sound judgment to make it just from that
monitor.

Is there any liaison at all between Sheffield Wednesday
Control and Police Control over the numbers arriving at
the ground?   A. Between the Police Control Room and the
Club video room, is that what you mean, sir?

It is not just a video room.   It may be that you do not
know this;  I will ask you:    Were you aware that in
addition to having their own monitors, to which you had
access ----    A. We cannot see pictures that they are
receiving.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You cannot see pictures ...?
A.   The Club system is not connected to ours;   we cannot
see what they are seeing.    However, they have access to
ou rs .

      Mr. HYTNER:  I am sorry, it is the other way round.
You are quite right, I had got it the wrong way round.
Were you aware that in addition to their monitors, they
also had a mechanical check through turnstiles and
computers as to the numbers coming into the ground?
A.  Yes, I am aware of that.

Was there any liaison whatever between you and the Club
Control Room as to how many there were in the ground at
any given time to enable Mr. Duckenfield or anybody else
to assess the numbers still to come?    A. No, I would
have no communication, and never have had any
communication, with that room.   It would not be, if
you like, within my job description.   It's not my area.

Perhaps not your particular one, but you know what is
going on in the Control Room?    A. Yes, I am aware.

You have done many semi-finals?    A. Two semi-finals.
                                         T. BICHARD

And other big matches?     A.   Certainly.

And has the Police Control Room never received a call
from the Club Control Room indicating how many people
are in the ground to give some guide as to how many
are still to come?   A. Yes, there has been communication
received.  I can think of a specific occasion off the
top of my head, a Cup Match between Sheffield Wednesday
and Everton when the Kop reached about 19,000, and
obviously that is getting near to the time when the
turnstiles will be closed, and I was asked to look at
Penistone Road to see how many people were there on
that occasion.

That is precisely what I am asking.  That is vital
information for the police controlling Penistone Road
to know how many more people to anticipate?  A. That's
right.   I believe the system does provide a warning
when it is getting near capacity.

You are absolutely right.  The computer pulsates when it
is 85 per cent of capacity, so we are told.  You can
recall this happening at an Everton/Sheffield Wednesday
match?   A.  That's right, yes, an evening match.

On this occasion was there any warning ---

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I am sorry, when are we
talking about?    When was the Everton/Sheffield Wednesday
match?     A.  It was a Cup Replay.

Which year?   A.   I'm not sure.

Well, was it more than a year or two ago or what? A. It
was certainly within the previous 12 months.  The idea
behind going to monitor the people who were outside was
thinking along the lines of public order, because
obviously when those turnstiles are closed, if people
are still queueing they are going to be concerned.

      Mr. HYTNER:  There are two problems, are there not?
The first problem is if there are very few in the ground
and it is close to kick-off and it is an all-ticket match,
there are going to be an awful lot of people suddenly
arriving and the Police outside ought to be warned about
that?  That is one problem, is it not?   A.  That is an
assumption, yes.

Another problem is this:  If people have got in without
tickets, for example and, taking the Kop on the occasion
of the Sheffield Wednesday match, the Kop is near
capacity and there are still 3,000 or 4,000 outside,
there could be a serious public order problem when the
gates are shut?   A. Yes.  The match that I am thinking
of was pay on the day rather than ticket.
                                       T. BICHARD

It is a similar problem.  There will be people outside
who will not be able to get in?   A.  They wofi't be able
to get into that area, yes.

On this occasion, the semi-final where the tragedy occurred
was there any communication whatever between Police
Control and Sheffield Wednesday Control over the numbers
already in the Leppings Lane Terraces or in the North
Stand?   A. I certainly didn't make any communication.
I am not aware of any communication.  However, I am not
aware of what happens on the telephone.




                        /Q.   Did you hear any discussion
                                     T. BICHARD



Did you hear any discussion about it? - A. I can't recollect
any, no.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     We have of course had the
Sergeant about this?

      MR. HYTNER:   Yes sir.    I leave that now.

I just want to deal now with this: you talk about the pitch
invasion and for three minutes or so, three or four minutes,
you still thought it was a pitch invasion? - A.Quite convinced
in my mind, yes.

A pitch invasion presupposes a fan invading the pitch area?
- A. That is right, yes.

There was not any, was there? For three or four minutes the
fans were in the area between the pitch and the fence? - A.
That is right, yes, until the numbers built up so much
so that they did spread on to the pitch.

But that was already when everyone realised that there was
a disaster? - A. I would say that point is when we did
realise there was a disaster.

And before then there was nobody on the pitch, so it is a
little hard for anyone to have suspected that there was a
pitch invasion? - A. I think perhaps we ought to qualify
what a "pitch invasion" is. If the fans come out of the
area where they are supposed to be that is a pitch invasion.
It does not mean to say they physically go on the playing
area.  If they are on the perimeter track that is a pitch
invasion.

You would call that a pitch invasion? - A. I certainly would,
yes.
      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Other than to get on the pitch,
why do they do that? - A. Again one would assume that if
the fans are coming out of the area where they are, either
they are trying to get away from some trouble in there and
escape into the safety of the perimeter track and the pitch
or they are intent on getting into the playing area to
prevent the match taking place.

      MR. HYTNER:  I think we may both have been trying to
get at your same point.

      Obviously if they are intent on causing trouble for
the game, first of all it is unusal for that to happen
that early, isn't it, when there has not been a penalty
given or not given and there has not been a goal scored
and so forth? - A. I have been at football matches when
people have gone on the pitch before kick-off.
                                        T. BICHARD


Q. All right, well it is a possibility? - A. Yes.

Q. But if they are over the fence and they are not going on
   the pitch and this is taking place for three to four minutes
   it becomes obvious, doesn't it, that the motivation is the
   other one that you have mentioned, getting away from trouble?
   - A. I would say not, because if your mind is switched into
   a public order situation, if that is what you are believing
   then something else has to happen to turn your mind into
   that sort of thinking.
Q. Absolutely right and that is what I am going to ask you last
   of all.
            The whole of the briefing, the whole of your training
      turned your mind solely to the problem of public order.
      That is right, isn't it? - A. I would say that that is a
      very fair comment.
Q. And in fairness    to you and other Officers of your rank, your
   minds had never    been adverted by training or briefing to
   the possibility    that there might be overcrowding and
   crushing on the    terraces? - A. Yes, I would agree with you.

            MR. HYTNER:   Thank you.


                    Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON:

Q. May I deal with one matter. You received a request from
   Superintendent Marshall for the gates to be opened? - A.
   More than one request, yes sir.

Q. The first request? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Am I right that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield made no
   reply to that until what became in effect an order from
   Mr. Marshall for the gates to be opened? - A. A reply in
   that he may have asked him to stand by while he was doing
   whatever he was doing, considering the matter or whatever.

Q. He gave no response either positively or negatively to
   it? - A. That is right, yes.
Q.     Then you had drawn his attention by   means of the monitor
      to Gate C? - A. Yes, that is right.

 Q.    That gate was opened? - A. It was sir, on   two occasions.

 Q.   Some moments later Sergeant Higgins   asked for Gate A to
      be opened. Was there any observation by Chief Superintendent
      Duckenfield to the effect:   "I have given that order some
      moments ago"? — A. No, when that second request came in
      it was part and parcel of the first comment about opening
      the gates.
                                  T. BICHARD


From Sergeant Higgins? I have left Superintendent Marshall
and gone to Sergeant Higgins? - A. When Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield said about opening the gates, again my belief
was that he referred to C Gate and C Gate only and when the
request came in for A Gate, it was a separate matter.

Yes, indeed. That is what I am trying to establish. We
have had other evidence you see from other witnesses? - A.
Yes.

When Sergeant Higgins made his request for Gate A the Chief
Superintendent made no observation he had given such an order?
- a . Not to my knowledge.

Nor did he reply to it? - A. I am unaware.

It was Sergeant Goddard, was it not, who gave the order to
open Gate A? - A. Yes, that is right sir.

Now may I move forward to the effect of opening gates.
Am I not right that when Gate A was opened, Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield gave an order as to marshalling Officers to stop
the crowd going on to the pitch via the North Stand? - A.
That is right yes, the North Stand.

So indeed when Gate A was opened the Police mind turned towards
public order and the effect of opening it? - A. Yes.

Quite properly? - A. Yes.

But the complete reverse took place in respect of Gate C,
no one paid any attention to the effect of opening Gate C?
- A. The situation outside the ground was alleviated when
Gate C was opened. From the difficulty we had there it had
gone.

That is entirely my fault.   I should of course refer to
inside the ground.

      In distinction to the effect of opening Gate A, when
the Police took proper action to deal with the influx of
people through Gate A, when they opened Gate C they did
not take any action as to the effect of the crowd going
through Gate C into the ground? - A. I am a little bit
confused as to what you are implying about Police action
in respect of A Gate?

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I think what Counsel is saying
is this: when Gate A was opened the red light of public
order problems came on and attention was given to what
might happen if people came round through the North Stand
and as you put it before "got on to the pitch from the
North Stand"? - A. That is right sir, yes.

So there was a deployment of Officers? - A. As I believe
there were two lines of Officers placed behind A Gate.
                                  T. BICHARD


What Counsel is putting is that no thought seems to have
been given to what might happen inside the ground when
Gate C was opened? - A. I believe that the Officers who
were behind Gate A, or the Officers who were in charge of
that position on the ground, made the decision to form
that line behind the gate.  It was not something that the
Control Room instructed them to do.

      MR. JACKSON: Whoever did it, whatever was done,
something was done? - A. Yes.

In distinction to what happened about Gate C? - A. That is
right.

      MR. JACKSON:   Thank you.


               Cross-Examined by MR. MULLER:

There is one question in relation to the cameras. The
facility you had in relation to the colour camera and the
zoom facility in particular, would have enabled you, if
you had chosen to do so, to see whether or not people were
being crushed up against the perimeter fencing? - A. No
sir. The facility is not good enough to get that close.

Am I not right in saying that the zoom facility does enable
you to see the fence? - A. Oh yes.

And to get a close-up on the people at the fence in colour?
- A. No, we must define what you mean by a "close-up".
It is closer than it is closer than in its extreme, yes,
but it is not a close-up of an individual. You would
probably only get 30 or 40 heads and shoulders at best on
that picture.
Perhaps that is something people can try for themselves?
- A. Yes, you would have to see that on the system.

Of course one of the problems is that not until you think
there is something wrong there will you zoom in on it.  Is
that right? - A. I would zoom in on something if I thought
that the picture by zooming in would benefit by it. That
is the best way of describing it.

Unless you think there may be some problem with crushing
at the front, you are not likely to be zooming in to look
to see whether there is crushing at the front, are you?
- A. Correct sir.

Even if you have a picture of people at the front in the
vicinity of the fence, from what you say you are not looking
to see what the people right behind the fence are doing,
you are concentrating more on the people who are beyond
the fence on the pitch? - A. That is right, yes.
                                    T. BICHARD


Now one other matter I would like to ask you about. We
have been provided with the VHF Channel 1 tape.  I don't
know whether you have had an opportunity of seeing it? -
A. No sir.
I think it may well be that this records what you say
to Snig Hill, and I put it to you, it is at page 16? - A.
May I have an opportunity to look at it?

If there is one available. You see in the top left-hand
corner it gives the time between 15.13 and 15.14 at the
bottom. Have you got that? - A. Yes, I have that.

If you look at the right-hand side, just over halfway down
it says:

                          "Hillsborough ground control could
                          you contact the Fire Service,
                          Fire Service, we want some
                          hydraulic cutting equipment to
                          the ground to cut some of the
                          metal fences. Fire Service urgent
                          required Leppings Lane over".

Then the reply comes, am I right:

      "Roger Fire Brigade
      urgent up to Leppings
      Lane Roger".

A. Yes.
Am I right in saying what we  see on the right is what you
were saying? - A. That is correct, yes.

Therefore no mention there, if this transcript is right,
about anybody breaking down the gates or anything? - A. No.

And what is important, a specific mention by you of Leppings
Lane? - A. Yes, I did.
Have you any idea, because subsequently we shall hear, that
when a message was sent from Snig Hill, the people at
Snig Hill apparently did not know where the Fire Brigade
was required? - A. Well it is quite clear, it is the
Leppings Lane end of the ground. Obviously the Fire Sfervice
are not going to bring their fire equipment, the tender
actually into the ground. They are going to bring it to
the nearest point, it is the actual cutting equipment that
we would require in the ground and that would be dealt with
on the ground.
But your recollection certainly accords with that, not only
did you say Leppings Lane but the person at Snig Hill
confirmed Leppings Lane? - A. That is right.
                                   T. BICHARD


            Cross-Examined by MR. GIBSON-WATT:

Officer, one point first which you ha ve touched on but I
want to get it clear. When Gate C first opened, just for
a few seconds, you instinctively said:   "The fans have
broken down the gate" or words to that effect? - A. I did,
yes.
That is what you thought.  It then closed and soon after
that you were getting very strong requests or commands
fromSuperintendent Marshall that the gates should be opened?
- A. Yes, that is right.

So by the time you were getting these commands through it
must have been obvious to you that the Police had at any
rate regained control of Gate C? - A. I believe that, yes.

And indeed that the opening of Gate C originally had been
deliberate, not a break in by fans? - A. That may be an
assumption in between the incident happening and me writing
that down.

Well what I am suggesting to you is it is an assumption
between the incident happening when you first blurt out
your thoughts instinctively and realising that Superintendent
Marshall was still asking for the gates to be opened?- A.
I am unclear on what you are actually to gain, sir.

Let's take it slowly.  If Superintendent Marshall is asking
for the gates to be opened, the fans have not broken in
and not broken down the gate, have they? - A. There is more
than one gate though, sir. It may well be he was not aware
that that gate opened.

Well you are aware when Superintendent Marshall is giving
his orders or making his requests for the gates to be
opened, that fans are no longer coming through Gate C.  You
can see that? - A. I can see that, yes.

Therefore at the least Gate C is then under Police control
and no fans are coming in? - A. Yes, and I am assuming
that Gate C is the one that everybody is referring to.
That is where my attention is drawn.

Precisely so. So you assume    when Superintendent Marshall
is making his requests, that   everybody is concentrating
on Gate C and Superintendent   Marshall is asking for Gate C
to be opened? - A. Yes, that   is right, sir.

Which means it must have been opened and closed the first
time and not forced by the fans? - A. It could well have
been forced.  If the gate has been opened or just taken
off lock, the fans could well have forced the gate open and
we managed to close it again, it does not mean to say it
is damaged.

All right, I will accept that. It has been closed again
without being damaged? - A. Yes.

And that was clearly apparent to you by let us say at the
latest 3 o'clock, kick-off time? - A. I was aware that the
gate had been opened twice, yes.

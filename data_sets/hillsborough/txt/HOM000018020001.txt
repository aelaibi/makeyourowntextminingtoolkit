The Et. Hon. Mrs. M. Thatcher,
10, Downing Street,
London.




 Dear Mrs Thatcher
After the Bradford fire we put forward proposals for crowd control at football matches,
a fire retarding system and barriers which collapsed to allow spectators to escape easily
on to the pitch. In addition to our approach to you, the proposals were submitted to
the Popplewell Committee, two ministers of sport, the Chairmen of the FA and Football
League and a large number of the Club Chairmen. We also took a stand at the Fire
Brigade Seminar to show a working model of the system.
No one, but no one, was interested or could spare time to see us. Obviously it was a
stupid idea - or was it?
More recently we have submitted a system for tracking baggage on to aircraft to ensure
passengers and luggage are positively linked and security checks are conclusively
identified. Again, no one is interested. The airlines wish to pass the buck to the baggage
handlers, the baggage handlers feel it is the responsibility of the airports who in turn
believe IATA is the responsible body. From the ministry we have received the enclosed
card, but no action.
I appreciate people are very busy and cannot spare time to investigate everything,
however, these same people find time to visit the scene of the latest tragedy, attend
memorial services and pontificate on television - surely we can do better than this.
Could you please direct me to someone who is prepared to listen with an open mind.
Yours sincerely




Toby Streatfeild-James

^^Dear

     Thank you for your letter of 18 June 1997 to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new
     inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

     As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
     public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
     received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
     renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
     December.

     The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
     put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
     medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
     circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
     significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
     announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
     Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

              To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
              Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

              a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
              b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
                 discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
              c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
                 matters;

              And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
              such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
              Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
              attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
     f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\prm-0535.doc
            their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
            be taken in the public interest.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
   has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
   submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
   available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
   Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
   him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
   Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
   might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
   report by the end of the year. The Government hopes that this independent scrutiny will
   finally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Dear Sir/Madam.

I am not a resident of the UK.   I am married to one, and my heart
is there.  I love football, and enjoyed many matches whilst in the
UK.  I attended the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest semi-final match
in 1988, so feel somewhat closer to those that died and saw death
at the same fixture in 1989.   I have one simple question.

Why haven't enquiries been re-opened?

I believe that there are clear grounds.  People seem to have lied.
Thanks for your time in considering a response.

Priority: normal

Dear Sir/Madam
I wonder if it would be possible for you to forward this mail to
the home secretary.
Dear Sir,
I am writing to ask you to re-open the enquiry into the Hillborough
disaster.
Whilst the former home sectretary seemed to want to brush the
matter unde
r the carpet, apparently fearing the police, I believe that in the
new spirit of
open government# the Hillborough case represents a great
oja^rtunity to the
n<^rgovernment to prove its desire for transparency and fairness.
The families have received nothing fro® the government 'because- of a
false
assumption of time of death. Meanwhile police officers and other
emergency
service workers have received compensation for the traumas suffered
doing their job.
While I do not object to people receiving compensation for trauma I
do firmly believe
that those who suffer through no fault of their own should be
considered before
those who have chosen a job which will take them into traumatic
situations.
I believe a great wrong has been committed against these families
and it is your
duty to rectify this.
Best Wishes

Neil Bridson

  put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
  medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
  circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
  significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
  announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
  Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

           To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
           Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

           a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
           b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
              discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
           c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
              matters;

           And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
           such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
           Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
           attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
           their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
  f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\prai-0530.doc
             be taken in the public interest.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
   has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
   submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
   available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
   Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
   him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
   Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
   might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
   report by the end of the year. The Government hopes that this independent scrutiny will
   finally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Dear Mr Blair,

Last Saturday nearlyjMJQQ.             e attend                                   Concert af
Anfield, LiverppolrWe were there to si                          support         e call for the
enquiry jp fc flh e Hillsborough Disaster                                    real truth to be
uncovered

I am from Liverpool and I was living there at the time of the disaster. The communal
grief felt by the city at the time is something I will never forget. W e all felt that once
again the lives of ordinary people had been put before the convenience of the
authorities. Now, 8 years on, there is still a feeling that justice has not been done.

Before the general election the outgoing Home Secretary had promised to reconsider
the possibility to re open the enquiry and I hope that his successor is also willing tq
consider this. I would like to ask you if there is a willingness on the part of your
government to right the wrong that has been done.

The people who died on 15th April 1989 deserve the truth to be heard.


Yours sincerely,




Barry King.

^^D ear Mr. Cruces,

   Thank you for your petition of 26 June 1997 to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a
   new inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

   As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
   public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
   received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
   renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
   December.

   The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
   put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
   medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
   circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
   significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
   announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
   Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

            To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
            Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

            a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
            b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
               discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
            c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
               matters;

            And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
            such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
            Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
            attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
            their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
   f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\prm-0532.doc
            be taken in the public interest.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
   has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
   submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
   available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
   Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
   him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
   Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
   might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
  report by the end of the year. The Government hopes that this independent scrutiny will
  finally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Dear Mr. Hunt,

Thank you for your letter of 14 May 1997 to the Prime Minister in support of calls for a new
inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\prni-0533.doc
            be taken in the public interest.

  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
  has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
  submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
  available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
  Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
  him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
  Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
  might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
   report by the end of the year. The Government hopes that this independent scrutiny will
   finally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Firstly, may I congratulate you on your successful electioil campaign.

I am writing to ask you to re-open the enquiry in to the 1^89 Hillsborough Disaster. |l
have attached a letter to my local MP, Theresa Gorman, in^acE T ^T m y'ffSifSSPSk
for her support for the re-opening of the enquiry.

I was recently one of 35,000 to attend a concert at Anfield which was held to raise
money for the legal battle to continue, in order that the families of those who were
killed at Hillsborough can proceed with their fight to see that justice is finally given.

I would hope that the new Labour government will see fit to re-open the enquiry, or
even to start a fresh enquiry in to one of the biggest white-washes in British legal
history, courtesy of the former Conservative Government.

I look forward to receiving a response from you shortly, and wish you well in your
new position.

Yours sincerely



Gregory Hunt

Dear Mrs Gorman

As our local Member of Parliament, regardless of the fact that you are now in
opposition rather than a member of the government itself, we would appreciate your
comments on your support, or opposition, to the re-opening of the enquiry in to the
1989 Hillsborough Disaster.

I am sure you are aware of the public feeling which calls for a re-opening of the
enquiry, which was a white-wash letting the FA, Sheffield Wednesday FC, the
Conservative Government and the South Yorkshire Police Force (in particular) off the
hook for their part in an avoidable disaster in which 96 people lost their lives, and
which left thousands of others to rebuild their lives.

Such support was recently strengthened by the holding of a concert at Anfield, the
home of Liverpool Football Club, at which over 35,000 people attended, testament
itself to the strength of public feeling within the North West and other parts of the
UK.

We are residents of Billericay, and feel that you, as our representative, should press
for the re-opening of the enquiry, to ensure that justice can be served.

We look forward to receiving your comments as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely



Gregory Hunt & Eleanor Eldridge

   Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
   him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
   Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
   might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
   report by the end of the year. The Government hopes that this independent scrutiny will
   finally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

   Mrs P Mehta

I enclose what I hope is a self-explanatory copy of the letter I have today sent to Mr. Straw. I hope you
can find the tim e to give it som e consideration.

O n a lighter note, can I thank you for quite the m ost exciting eight hours of television I can remember
on the night of M ay 1st.
i f this sounds trite, it is not m eant to. I can think of nothing as m onum ental of thrilling in the last
fifteen years at least. This is evidenced hy the fact that I can think o f nothing either that kept m e out of
bed until 5 a.m . when I wasn’t on-call. Congratulations.



Yours sincerely,

    Dear M r. Straw,
    I am sure you will he aware o f the campaign hy the fam ilies o f the victim s of the H illsborough disaster



•
in 1 9 8 9 to re-open the inquest into the deaths.
I have only been actively involved with this for the last six m onths, but have already learned enough to
convince me that the verdict of 'accidental death' in 1 9 9 1 was a travesty, and an insult not only to the
m em ories of the victim s, but also to the reputation of British justice.
I always assumed that the fam ilies knew who I was, but did not want to talk to m e (I was a volunteer at
the hospital, and involved solely in resuscitation attem pts on the first twelve or so victim s.) In January,
I found out that I was spoken of at the inquests as an 'unidentified doctor', and that several fam ilies had
been trying to trace me for eight years. I was m ost certainly n o t unidentified, and have documentary
proof o f this.
    I have m et several families, including the H am m onds, whose 14-year-old son was the first I tried to save
    on the day, the Hicks who lost their two daughters, and Eddie Spearitt, whose son Adam I also tried to
    save. Mr. Spearitt is trying to find out not only exactly what happened to his son, but what happened to
him over a two-hour period before he appears at the hospital.
H illsb orough was not a jet aircraft blasted out of the sky. N or was it an express train careering off the
tracks, or a madman loose with automatic weapons. It was a football match. It was a P .A . cup sem i-final,
with policing, stewarding, crowd control, and video surveillance, which took place in the middle of a major
    English city on a sunny spring afternoon.
    It is inconceivable to me that 9 6 deaths under such conditions could be 'accidental'. W hat I have heard
    and seen over the last six m onths has affirmed this. There is a huge mass of 'new' evidence, which is not
    in fact new, but was sim ply never presented at the inquest.
    I would urge you to consider this evidence, and its im plications in term s of the inquest verdict. N othing,
    of course, will bring back the victim s. N o-on e believes it will. B ut the least we owe them is the truth.



Yours sincerely,

      Dear Home Secretary,

      r e :- Hillsborough Justice Campaign

      You will be aware that: we await a decision from
      yourself and/or others regarding our quest for a
      fresh examination of evidence relating to the
      disaster and events thereafter.

      We as a group have declared a willingness to afford
      time for proper examination before such a decision.
      We wish to stand by that arrangement but many
      families are becoming anxious at the lack of
      movement. Our efforts are not helped by press
      speculation and reports that are alleged to emanate
      from the Home Office.

      It is for example being reported that "you have met
      with members of the Hillsborough Family Support
      Group..     yet we are not aware of such a meeting.
      It could not have been with an officer of our
      organisation without our knowledge and we are
      therefore concerned at possible mis-representation.


                                                         From the desk of...

23-JUN-9H 23:20   TREUOR HICKS




    Could you confirm if such a meeting took place, who
    it was with, when and where etc.
                                 i


    I and other senior officials of our group are in
    London over the next two days and would gladly meet
    with you and/or your deputy or officials, (formally
    or informally, in confidence and at your convenience)
    if you feel that would be beneficial.

    In any event we would welcome some indication of the
    likely timescale to a decision and of course, expect
    notification prior to general release to the media.

    Please note my contact numbers a r e :-

Dear Mr Straw

I write to urge you to institute a public inquiry into the HillsborougfiC^ootball Stadium
Disaster.                                                                       _

I believe that the evidence as to the time of death of the victims which has recently come to
light should be considered, and that the public forum is most appropriate.

As one of the victim’s mothers said on radio today, if the truth is heard then justice must
surely follow.

Yours sincerely

^^D ear Mr. Rafferty,

   Thank you for your letter of 12 June 1997 to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new
   inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

   As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
   public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
   received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
   renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
   December.

   The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
   put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
   medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
   circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
   significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
   announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
   Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

            To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
            Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

            a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
            b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
               discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
            c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
               matters;

            And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
            such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
            Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
            attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
            their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
   f:\oppu\cornplnts\corresp\prm-0528.doc
            be taken in the public interest.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
   has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
   submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
   available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
   Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
   him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
   Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
   might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
   report by the end of the year. The Government hopes that this independent scrutiny will
   finally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

^^Y ours sincerely



   Mrs P Mehta

Justice by reopening the inquiry.

Dear Mr. West,
I
 Thank you for your recent letter to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

         To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
         Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

         And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
         such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
         Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
         attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
         their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
         be taken in the public interest.
f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\prm-0526.doc
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end of the year. The Government hopes that this independent scrutiny will
finally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely



Mrs P Mehta

Dear Mr. Donaghy,

Thank you for your letter of 24 May 1997 to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new
inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider folly the material which has been
put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

          To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
          Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

         a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
         b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
            discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
         c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
            matters;

          And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
          such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
          Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
          attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
          their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
f:\appn\coniplnts\corresp\prni~0524.doc
          be taken in the public interest.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end of the year. The Government hopes that this independent scrutiny will
finally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely



Mrs P Mehta

  Dear Home Secretary,
                            I am writing to you concerning the Hilsborough Disater. Enclpsed,
    along with this letter, are five 'Justice for the 96' cards. These cards are a show of
   support for the Hilsborough families in their quest for a long overdue judicial review, and
    a re-opening of the inquest. Ever since the disaster there has been a massive
    Establishment cover-up. The bereaved families put their faith in the Establishment, and
    the Establishment spat in their faces. The inquest verdict was an utter disgrace - the
    3:15pm ruling in particular - and Chief Superintendent Duckenfield - the police officer in
    charge on the day - has got off without any punishment whatsoever. The recent
    dramadocumentary ‘Hillsborough1 by the excellent Jimmy McGovern brought the disaster
^ j a c k into the limelight. The programme not only served to dispell some of the myths
^Ppjrrounding the disaster - the myths printed by the s*n newspaper - it also uncivered
    new evidence, that of the missing videotape. The videotape proved that South Yorkshire
    Police have been lying all along. Since the programme even more evidence has emerged
    that the inquest coroner - Dr Popper - was totally unjustified in refusing to hear any
    evidence after 3:15pm on the day of the disaster. This was the evidence of a doctor who
    said that on the day of the disaster a boy whose life he was trying to save was still
    alive at 4pm. I was at the disaster, along with my Dad and my elder brother. My brother
    was in the central pens, but luckily survived. However, my brother's best friend wasn't
    so lucky and died. It could so easily have been my brother, or indeed me had I have
    been in one of the central pens. It's clear to me, and to many others, that there is
    enough evidence for a judicial review and a re-opening of the inquest. So, come on
    Home Secretary, our Prime Minister said that he would govern in the interests of all the
    people. If that is so then you will grant the Hillsborough families the justice that they
    have fought long and hard for.

                                    Yours Hopefully,

Dear Mr Straw,
                I am writing to urge you to use your powers to open a new inquiry into the
Hillsborough disaster in 1989. Although the tragedy occurred before I began to attend
football matches, I believe the events and the aftermath raised questions which are still
relevant today.

To me, the verdict of the original inquiry represented the worst aspect of the Thatcherite era -
the attitude that "nobody pays" that resurfaced when the Scott report was published and
which no doubt contributed in part to the election result this year. The Establishment, in this
case the police, must be held accountable for their actions if citizens are to be able to respect
the institutions of the state. A new inquiry would help reestablish that respect.

As an indirect result of the tragedy, England now has some of the finest stadia in Europe, and
safety at football grounds has improved considerably. Yet as long as no one is held
accountable for the Hillsborough tragedy, and it continues to be regarded as an unfortunate
accident, then what is there to prevent it recurring? I do not want revenge for what happened.
I only want to be sure that it will never happen again.

Over the past few years the Labour party has abandoned a lot of values that I hold dear. I
hope your commitment to social justice remains intact. Only a fresh inquiry can provide the
justice that the 96 people who died at Hillsborough deserve.

Thank you for your attention in this matter. I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely




William Nicklas

^^D ear Mr. Duffy,

   Thank you for your letter of 25 June 1997 to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new
   inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

   As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
   public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
   received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
   renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
   December.

   The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
   put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
   medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
   circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
   significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
   announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
   Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

            To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
            Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

            a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
            b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
               discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
            c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
               matters;

            And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
            such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
            Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
            attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
            their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
            be taken in the public interest.
   f:\oppn\complnts\coiresp\prm-0521.doc
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
report by the end of the year. The Government hopes that this independent scrutiny will
finally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

Yours sincerely



Mrs P Mehta

Dear Mr Straw,                             /
              As you are the new Home Secretary I would like to ask you
to re-open the inquest in to the Hillsbrough Justice campaign in which 96
football supporters died in the worst ever tragedy in Europeon Football.
There have been several versions come out o f the incident which took
place on the 15th April 1989. The job o f the Hillsbrough Family Support
Group (H.F.S.G) is to find out what really happened on that day, surely a
large portion o f the blame must be laid on the South Yorkshire Police.

The main reason the incident took place is that of the allocation given to
the Liverpool supporters. They were put into very small pens separated at
The Leppings Lane end of the ground. The Nottingham Forest
supporters where given much more room at the Kop end o f the ground.
The fencing at the front and sides contributed to some o f the deaths
by crushing the supporters. Also the failure of The South Yorkshire
Police to respond in a rightful manner in that Chief Superlntendant
Duckenfield having just let the Liverpool supporters in, in their hundreds
which caused the disaster.

There has also been a Hillsborough Justice Concert in which such bands
as SPACE, THE BOOTLEG BEATLES, DODGY, MANIC STREET
PREACHERS and THE LIGHTING SEEDS took part in the biggest and
most meaningful concert this decade, in aid o f the families that were
involved in the disaster it raised a lot o f money for the families and also
raised peoples awamess in to what is still going on 8 years after the
disaster now all I can hope for is that you feel the same in that justice
must be done. Awaiting your response.

             Yours Sincerely,


             Liam Beilis

Congratulations on your recent appointment.


As a season ticket holder of Liverpool Football Club, I attended the match on
Saturday 3rd May at which a display of support was shown for the Hillsborough
Justice Campaign.

Before kick-off, what appeared to be a unanimous display of cards rea
for the 96 “ was held aloft. This included support from opposing fans (
supporters). It was an extremely impressive display but did not receiv
on Match of the Day or the national evening news.

Instead of just signing the card which was distributed and posting it to
for a fresh inquiry, I thought I would write to you personally. The strei
particularly on Merseyside but also amongst football fans nationally Ci
underestimated even eight years after that fateful day when 96 people               ___

One has only to visit Anfield - even midweek out of season - to find fresh flowers and
other momentos at the Memorial. The victims will never be forgotton and the
campaign for justice will continue.

It is not a question of money that is the issue but the principle that those affected by
the tragedy should be given and seen to be given justice. There were many media slurs
made against the victims at the time and these have never been corrected.

There has also been new evidence e.g. CTV camera evidence, testimony from
witnesses etc. which should be re-examined formally.

Please use the power in your new appointment to grant a fresh enquiry and give the
families concerned peace of mind after all this time.


Yours faithfully

     & X JK

^ Jb c a r Mr. Ryan,

   Thank you for your letter of 22 May 1997 to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new
   inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

   As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
   public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
   received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
   renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
   December.

   The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
   put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
   medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
   circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
   significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
   announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
   Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

            To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
            Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

            a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
            b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
               discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
            c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
               matters;

             And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
             such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
             Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
             attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
             their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
             be taken in the public interest.
   f:\oppn\coniplnts\corresp\prni-0S13.doc
   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
   has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
   submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
   available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
   Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
   him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
   Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
   might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
   report by the end of the year. The Government hopes that this independent scrutiny will
   finally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

^ p fo u rs sincerely

       Dear Mr Straw,

       I would like to bring to your attention the case of 96 Hillsborough dead. The day
       were 96 innocent young people went to watch a football match but never returned
       home.

       To date nobody has been held responsible for these deaths and the family of the
       dead are left to grieve without really knowing what happened to their loved ones
       on that fateful day.

       I am sure you are aware of the ever continuing unrest across the country
       regarding this injustice, no better illustrated than when 40,000 people turned out
       at the Hillsborough Justice Concert 12 days ago to voice their support.

       I am asking you to justify my vote in the recent election, show some compassion
       and re-open the case, so these families can finally find out what happened and lay
       their loved ones to rest..

       T his is a n issue w hich w ill n o t go aw ay, it affects thousands o f y o u r people.
       R e-open th e case an d le t ju stic e p rev ail.

       I look forward with interest to your response,

       Yours sincerely,




       Christopher Ryan

Dear Home Secretary*                          I    (         t     1
                         I am writing to ask |o u tjo 6to,ew#^thinp in your
power to get the Hillsborough inquiry reop^ne^. .U aw w miSTH-ltter
will go straight in the bin, but could you at least read the first
paragragh. I’ll say what I want to say most first; How would you feel
if a member of your family was killed and no one valued their life?
Because that is how many of the 96 victems fam ilies feel right now.
These fam ilies have never got justice and the verdict was a
      race. I know if I w ere one of those members of the jury, who


»     b that verdict I would never be able to sleep again because
      every tim e I closed my eyes I would see the faces of the fam ilies
      and the horrific scenes of that day. For the police to say because a
cam era was not working they could not see the terrace becoming
too crowded is incorrect. From the police control tower at
Hillsborough you can see the Lepping’s Lane End clearly and the
persons on it as well.

I and I know I speak for others when i say that the persons
responsible for not opening the gates should be found and tried for
manslaughter. My fam ily and I have long believed that the chief
officer responsible on that day, who’s name escapes me at this
moment in tim e is the one responsible for the deaths.

All English footbal fans reguardless of their club and strength of
support want one thing;And that is to get justice for the fam ilies and
every other fan in this country. W e do not want to have been the
ones blamed for the deaths because of drunkeness or anything
else because we know the real truth and the real culprits are still
out therel
It seems the people who are supossed to protect us are actually the
ones who harm us. I personally know I’ll never trust a police officer
to do anyting after Hillsborough. I am also interested to know why
the officers got compensation and many fans and fam ilies did not?
I have been in many situations simular but escaped unhurt because
of the correct actions being taken.

If you have taken the tim e to read this letter then I am very greatful
that you have listened to what I have to say.

  Yours Sincerly

  Evangeline Wood

P S. The disaster nearly happened eight years before it did but this
tim e it involved Tottenham fans, everything was the sam e but the
only difference was the gate onto the pitch w as opened when
people first began to get crushed.

« D ear Mrs White,

   Thank you for your letter of 22 May 1997 to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new
   inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

   As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case for a further
   public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many representations which have been
   received. Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
   renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama “Hillsborough” last
   December.

   The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which has been
   put forward calling for a new public inquiry. This includes video evidence of the disaster and
   medical evidence about the time of death of the victims. He has decided, in all the
   circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure that no matter of
   significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To this end, the Home Secretary
   announced in the House on 30 June that he had invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior
   Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to conduct the scrutiny. His terms of reference are:

             To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
             Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

            a) To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or
            b) To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the purpose of
               discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or
            c) To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police disciplinary
               matters;

             And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
             such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
             Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
             attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
             their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
             be taken in the public interest.
   f:\oppu\complnts\corresp\prm-0516.doc
    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to examine all the written and other evidence that
    has been submitted. He will also consider any further material that interested parties wish to
    submit to him. He will then advise the Home Secretary whether any evidence not previously
    available is of such significance to justify a further full public inquiry, and the Home
    Secretary has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives
    him. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will also identify for the Attorney-General, the Director of
    Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police any evidence that
    might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously been considered.

    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expects to start proceedings in September, and hopes to produce his
    report by the end of the year. The Government hopes that this independent scrutiny will
    finally bring to an end the uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

                                                                     L
  Dear Mr Straw,
                              Hillsborough : 15th April 1939
  My husband was a survivor at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at Hillsborough.

^ ^ lth o u g h he was, thankfully, not too badly injured physically, he has suffered, and still is
    suffering, psychologically. He still has to take medication to control panic attacks, has a
    reduced memory span and a lack of concentration, together with an obsession with everything
    to do with Hillsborough.This obsession will no doubt continue to rule his life, ( and therefore
    my life too), until such time as there has been a satisfactory legal outcome, starting with a
    new Inquest.

   The injustice of the whole affair and the apparent cover-ups surrounding it, which have
   served to protect the police, and the Establishment, only fuel our frustrations, and sadly make
   it more difficult to respect the British Judicial system, which we feel has let us down.

   How can this situation remain - if the police and the British Judicial system are to have
   respect and credibility throughout the world?

   Initially, an apology by the police, together with an explanation of where they went wrong
   would have done so much good, if coupled with the necessary changes to ensure such a
   tragedy could never happen again.

   While many changes have been made for the better, which I welcome, much more would
   have been done had the full truth been brought into the public domain.

   If members of the public don’t have the confidence that all the necessary lessons have been
   learned from this, how many more lives, than the 96 who died at Hillsborough, will it take
   for something to be done?

   I therefore urge you to open a new Inquest to consider all the new evidence that has
   emerged.

   Yours Sincerely,

              L   '   M   e

Dear Mr. Straw,
I think it is time to hold a Public Inquiry iritQ the H ills^^ugh disinter. The families and
loved ones of victims have been sorely wronged. The coroner's j6lusa! to consider events
that happened after 3-15pm was either madness^or an attempf 'at a cover-up. Dr. Walker,
who treated some of the dying, has recently realiseNUhe significance of this. He has stated
that he treated people, later to die, after this time, ffifedvidertce will be crucial and must
be heard.
I look forward to hearing from you soon
                                                                          Yours faithfully

    Dear Mr Barron

    Thank you for your recent letter to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new inquiry
    into the Hillsborough disaster.

    The Home Secretary is currently considering the representations which have been made for a
    fresh inquiry. He has followed the families campaign for a new inquiry closely and has also
    had the opportunity to meet some of the members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group
    since the broadcast of the Granada television drama last December. He is very aware of the
    strength of feeling on this issue and will reach a decision as soon as possible.

    Yours sincerely

        Deac®r Straw,

         I was at the Hillsborough stadiiM disaster in 1989 and witnessed fist hand the events leading to
         the tragedy in the Leppings Lane end. The Taylor Report has led to the development of safer
         stadia for the larger clubs however there remains a deep sense of injustice in that the
         circumstances leading to the disaster and the response of the emergency services have not been
         properly examined and / or aired publicly.

         In view of the new evidence which has emerged recently I would urge you to do everything in your
         power to ensure that a new Inquiry and Inquests are held as soon as possible. Nothing is going to
         l A g back the 96 supporters who perished, however properly conducted hearings with just
         oroom es would mean that the suffering of the families and others affected would be greatly
         reduced.

         Football supporters everywhere are looking forward to positive action on your pa

         Yours sincerely,




         Dominic Boyle

    D ear M r Straw

    Firstly, m ay I take this opportunity to congratulate you and the L abour
    Parly on your victory in th e re m it general election. A s a L abour voter, I
    am extrem ely pleased th at m y vote has at last helped bring about a
    change in G overnm ent.

    A s H om e Secretary, I hope th at you w ill take this opportunity to re-open,
    as soon as possible, an enquiry into th e H illsborough D isaster o f 15th
    A pril 1989. I recently attended the 'R ock the K op' concert at A nfield and
    w as m oved by th e depth o f feeling th at surrounds this tragedy.

    A s a football supporter m yself, I am concerned by th e fact th at the truth
    has never folly com e to light. A nother inquest needs to look properly
    into w hat happened after 3.15 pm on th at day, som ething the first inquest
    neglected to do. T he fam ilies also have the right to know the full
    circum stances o f how th eir loved ones died. I therefore urge you now to
    re-open a full and thorough enquiry into w hat happened so th at ju stice
    can finally be done. It is the least th at th e fam ilies o f th e 96 football fans
    w ho died deserve.

    I have also sent a copy o f this letter to my local M P Andy King.

Dear Mr Straw,

Last Saturday nearly 40 000 people attended the Hillsborough Justice Concert at
Anfield, Liverpool. W e were there to show our continued support for the call for the
enquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster to be re opened and for the real truth to bet
uncovered.

I am from Liverpool and I was living there at the time of the disaster. The communal
grief felt by the city at the time is something I will never forget. W e all felt that once
again the lives of ordinary people had been put before the convenience of the
authorities. Now, 8 years on, there is still a feeling that justice has not been done.

Before the general election your predecessor had promised to reconsider the
possibility to re open the enquiry and I hope that you are also willing to consider this.

The people who died on 15th April 1989 deserve the truth to be heard.


Yours sincerely,




Barry King.

Dear Councillor Jackson

Thank you for your letter of 18 May 1997 to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new
inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

The Home Secretary is currently considering the representations which have been made for a
fresh inquiry. He has followed the families campaign for a new inquiry closely and has also
had the opportunity to meet some of the members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group
since the broadcast of the Granada television drama last December. He is very aware of the
strength of feeling on this issue and will reach a decision as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely




Mrs P Mehta

Subject: Justice for the 96
Content-Length: 1408

Dear Mr Straw,

I am writing this email message to ask you to act on the request by
the
parents of the 96 who died at Hillsborough ,as well as many
thousands of
football fans, for a new enquiry into the disaster at Hillsborough.

I^am a Labour councillor in Stockport, but also a Liverpool fan of

standing. I went to Sheffield for the first time since the disaster
last
weekend. Lost of thoughts and memories came flooding back, which is
why
I am writing to you now.

I am aware that you will have recieved many thousands of the
postcards.
No-one is looking for a scapegoat. In my opinion that would be
counterproductive. What is needed is the truth. When I walked the
streets over the last few months, people asked me what would be the
difference having a Labour government. I told them that for once
government would be "for the people", not for any one particular
self
interest group.

In my humble opinion reopening the enquiry into the Hillsborough
disaster would be a victory for the ordinary people who simply want
to
know what happened so that they may complete the process of
rebuilding
their lives. Until this aspect is dealt with, the relatives of the
victims will not be able to do this.

Please, for the sake of the relatives adn in the name of truth and
justice, reopen the inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

Cllr Ian Jackson

Dear Mr Straw

We write to ask you in your new position as Home Secretary to look at the
issue of Hillsborough in a different light. Please help the families of the
96 victims to establish the truth so that they can put the matter to rest
and begin to live their lives again.

Most people in Liverpool are delighted that we now have a Labour Government

    Dear Ms Wilson

    Thank you for your letter of 12 May 1997 to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new
    inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

    The Home Secretary is currently considering the representations which have been made for a
    fresh inquiry. He has followed the families campaign for a new inquiry closely and has also
    had the opportunity to meet some of the members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group
    since the broadcast of the Granada television drama last December. He is very aware of the
    strength of feeling on this issue and will reach a decision as soon as possible.

    Yours sincerely




    Mrs P Mehta

Dear



As a lifelong Socialist and a long-standing Labour Party member may I congratulate you on
your appointment after our magnificent victory. The rate of progress being made by the
Government in the first 14 days, not least your Department, is breathtaking. Your moves to
halt the jailing of fine defaulters, to introduce the mandatory 110 day limit on the time that
can be spent in jail on remand, and to drop plans to abolish the right to trial by jury will be
welcomed by all fair-minded people.

When you catch your breath, can I ask you to look again at the case made by The
Hillsborough Family Support Group for a fresh enquiry or inquest into the H illsborough
disasteMn the light of the new evidence that has recently emerged. The deep sense of
injustice felt by the families and friends of the victims, and football supporters generally, will
not be assuaged until a further investigation takes place.




Yours Sincerely

Hillsborough when those that they have lost have never
received justice for what happened that fateful day. Not
only is it necessary for the dead and the families to be
served justice it is also important for all true football
fans. Ultimately and most frighteningly it could have been
any of us involved on that fateful day had our team been
involved. Now the new Labour government offers a real hope
that the case can be reopened and rexamined so that football
fans but more importantly the families who lost loved ones
in the disaster can finally move on from Hillsborough. The
event can never and should never be forgotten but justice
should and now can prevail, I only hope you come to the
right decision and reopen the case. I have enclosed a self
addressed envelope and would be most grateful to receive
your views on the matter.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Connell

Thank you for your recent letter to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

The Home Secretary is currently considering the representations which have been made for a
fresh inquiry. He has followed the families campaign for a new inquiry closely and has also
had the opportunity to meet some of the members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group
since the broadcast o f the Granada television drama last December. He is very aware of the
strength of feeling on this issue and will reach a decision as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely

Dear Home Secretary,

I am writing to urge you to re-open the inquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster Case. I believe
that this is necessary if the British public are ever to get a fair and accurate representation of the
events that lead to the death of 96 people at a football match.

I recently attended the Justice for Hillsborough concert in Liverpool. There the audience was
urged by bereaved families to write to members of Parliament, in an effort to ensure that this
incident is given the Home Office's utmost attention. Many people are hoping that it will be
possible under the new Government to obtain a more open and just review than proved possible
under the Conservative administration.

I feel that many of the facts and events of the day have not only been clouded in the smear
campaign which followed the tragedy, but were also neglected by the inquiry as a result of the
"time ruling" and the evidence presented overall.

I believe that we owe it to the 96 people who died that afternoon to ensure that the facts are
accurately represented, that the mistakes and actions which lead up to the incident are publicly
acknowledged and, more importantly, that the events which followed are opened to scrutiny.

Ulus I would now ask you to look at the case, and to view it with the compassion it deserves. I
feel we owe it not only to the familes, but to sports fans everywhere, finally to ease the anger
which many still feel and to allow the families to grieve in peace.


Yours faithfully

Rt.Hon. Jack Straw, M.P.
The Home Secretary
Home Office
50 Queen Anne’s Gate
London SW 1H9AT
                                                                                    m p o ^m 5
Dear Mr.Straw                 Hillsborough Disaster : 15thApril 1989

I write to you as a fortunate survivor of the Hillsborough Disaster, having personally been crushed at
the front of the Leppings Lane terrace on that fateful day.

My own experience was published in 1995 in the book entitled “The Day of the Hillsborough
Disaster'’ by Liverpool University Press (ISBN 0853231990). I would urge you and your colleagues
to read this book which, I believe, because of its publication date constitutes new evidence not
available to the original Inquest Jury.

I would stress that I was not called to give evidence at either the Judicial Inquiry or the Inquests.

I was deeply disturbed by many aspects of the original Inquests, particularly:

   (i) the failure to meet the Jury’s repeated requests for certain video evidence of the Leppings
       Lane terrace to be made available to them before they announced their verdict - evidence
       which was recently uncovered, despite previous suggestions by the Police and the Coroner
       that it did not exist, because of a fault with a surveillance/video camera;

   (ii) the arbitrary and misinformed exclusion of evidence after 3.15 p.m. on the day of the
        Disaster; and

   (iii) the heavily-weighted summing up by the Coroner which, when combined with (i) above
         made the option of an “Unlawful Killing” verdict one to which the Jury were unable to give
         reasonable consideration.

I am also greatly concerned at serious conflict of interest allegations that, I understand, have been
made (by other people) against a prominent Conservative Party figure in Local Government who, I
understand, was at the time (i) Chairman of the South Yorkshire Police Authority (that decided not
to accept the Chief Constable’s offer of resignation), (ii) Chairman of the Licensing Committee
responsible for the Safety Certificate at the Hillsborough Stadium and (iii) a Director of the Insurance
Company responsible for meeting compensation claims made against the Chief Constable.

I hope that you share my view that not only should justice be done, it should also be seen to be
done. As far as Hillsborough is concerned, there remain many unanswered questions. It is clear
that justice has not been seen to be done. Only when it is seen to be done will those who continue
to campaign on this issue accept that it has been done.

I sincerely hope that under New Labour you will agree that a thorough examination of all the new
evidence should be put before a Jury at a new Inquest.

As you consider this important matter, if you feel that i may be able to provide further helpful
information or evidence to yourself or your officials, please contact me.

Yours sincerely,




(M r. ft. White)

I write as a supporter of the Hillsborough Families Justice Campaign to urge you to order
  fresh inquiry into the 1989 stadium disaster.

It is now clear that conclusive video evidence of the level of overcrowding on the Leppings
Lane terraces, prior to the opening of the perimeter gates, existed at the time of the original
inquest but was not used. I believe that this supports the widely held view that the guilty
parties were involved in a cover-up of massive proportions.

As events at previous semi-final matches at that ground show, Sheffield Wednesday were
sitting on a crowd safety time bomb. This coupled with South Yorkshire Police’s massive
incompetence jaded with a fashionable mistrust of football supporters, created the horrific
conditions that led directly to the death of 96 people.

Of course one must remember that all of this took place at a time when Thatcher’s Private
Army were fresh from their bloody victories in the coal mining villages of Britain - most
notably Yorkshire. Was it that the establishment of the time owed them one? Or was it just
a coincidence that, despite Lord Taylors observations, they were let off the hook with a nice
fat pension thrown in here and there?

As the new Home Secretary you have the power and a duty to right a wrong. I hope that
my small effort here together with the magnificent and relentless efforts of Trevor Hicks and
his colleagues can convince you to exercise that power. Justice for the 96!

D ear M r Straw,


I am writing in support of the cam paign by the fam ilies of the
for a fresh inquiry into the dreadful events of April 1989.

 I appreciate that you must be inundated with all m anner of requests since arriving at
g ie Hom e O ffice but I firmly believe that the case of 96 people, mostly distressingly
*o u n g , who went to a football match never to return, should be at the top of any ‘to
do’ list.

I m yself am a Liverpool fan and, yes, that probably is the reason I feel strongly
enough to put pen to paper but it does not alter the fact that I, and a great m any
others believe that justice has not been served.

This is not about Liverpool, the football club or the city, nor is it about football, the
gam e or its supporters. It is only about justice and bringing to account those that
have been wrongly exonerated in the past. The fact that Liverpool and football m ay
be anathem a to the voters of middle England you so religiously court now should
not deter you from doing what is right.

I hope that now there is a new governm ent with a fresh face as Hom e Secretary,
(and a football fan - albeit Blackburn Rovers - too boot), then the cam paign for
justice for the Hillsborough fam ilies will finally bear som e fruit.




Yours,




Martin J Cullen

The Right H on.Jack Straw M P,
H om e Secretary,
5 0 Q ueen Anne's Gate,
London S W 1H 9A T .



Dear Mr. Straw,
I am sure you will he aware of the campaign hy the fam ilies of the victim s                   S ffis a s te r f
in 1 9 8 9 to re-open the inquest into the deaths.
I have only been actively involved with th is for the last six m onths, hut have already learned enough to
convince m e that the verdict of 'accidental death' in 1 9 9 1 was a travesty, and an insult not only to the
m em ories of the victim s, hut also to the reputation of British justice.
I always assumed that the fam ilies knew who I was, hut did not want to talk to m e (I was a volunteer at
the hospital, and involved solely in resuscitation attem pts on the first twelve or so victim s.) In January,
I found out that I was spoken of at the inquests as an 'unidentified doctor, and that several fam ilies had
heen trying to trace me for eight years. I was m ost certainly n o t unidentified, and have documentary
proof of this.
I have m et several families, including the H am m onds, whose 14-year-old son was the first I tried to save
on the day, the Hicks who lost their two daughters, and Eddie Spearitt, whose son Adam I also tried to
save. Mr. Spearitt is tiying to find out not only exactly what happened to his son, hut what happened to
him over a two-hour period before he appears at the hospital.
H illsborough was not a jet aircraft blasted out of the sky. N or was it an express train careering off the
tracks, or a madman loose with automatic weapons. It was a football match. It was a F .A . cup sem i-final,
with policing, stewarding, crowd control, and video surveillance, which took place in the m iddle of a major
E nglish city on a sunny spring afternoon.
It is inconceivable to m e that 9 6 deaths under such conditions could be 'accidental'. W hat I have heard
and seen over the last six m onths has affirmed this. There is a huge m ass o f 'new' evidence, which is not
in fact new, but was sim ply never presented at the inquest.
I would urge you to consider this evidence, and its im plications in terms of the inquest verdict. N othing,
of course, will bring back the victim s. N o-on e believes it will. B ut the least we owe them is the truth.

Dear Mr Smith

Thank you for your letter of 5 May 1997 to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new
inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

The Home Secretary is currently considering the representations which have been made for a
fresh inquiry. He has followed the families campaign for a new inquiry closely and has also
had the opportunity to meet some of the members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group
since the broadcast of the Granada television drama last December. He is very aware of the
strength of feeling on this issue and will reach a decision as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely




Mrs P Mehta

^W ILLSBOROUGH JUSTICE CAMPAIGN
  I am enclosing a card indicating my support for the campaign to review the events of the
  Hillsborough Disaster.
 I am an outsider to the city and football club, having become involved through my girlfriend,
 who was on the Leppings Lane Terrace on the day in question. It would be patronising for me,
 therefore, to claim to speak on behalf of the people of Liverpool. Nonetheless, I raise the
 following points with you.
  The strength of feeling I discern amongst the supporters is overwhelming - frustrated,
  dignified and fiercely held. My perception is that few are "after blood", just an acceptance by
  somebody, somewhere in authority, that somebody somewhere dropped an almighty clanger.
  The word "sorry" would at least provide some comfort. I found the display on Saturday to be
  moving and universal.
 My perception is that for many, the football club means a great deal: many - although I accept
 not all - have few other passions and many have had economic difficulties thrust upon them in
 recent times. I hope that the least you will feel able to do is to look at the situation again: these
 people have backed you considerably during the last week. Please do not fall into the trap
 others have in recent years and ignore the sense of injustice which pervades - particularly when
 it is centred amongst your heartlands.


  Yours faithfully

Home Secretary
House of Commons
LONDON
SW1A OAA




Dear Mr Straw

May I congratulate you on the Labour's Party1®                 cess
this week and say how glad I am that you have rep 1ace’

as Home Secretary.

I hope that you will soon be able to give your attention to the
call for a new inquiry to be held into the disaster which took
place at Hillsborough football ground eight years ago.

I have no connection with Liverpool football club but I find it
upsetting to think of how so many young people suffered on that
dreadful day, and of how their families are suffering still.

My understanding is that new evidence has recently come to light
which could show how things went so wrong on that day and I urge
you to help the victims' families by opening a full inquiry in
the near future.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Bird

Thank you for your letter of 9 May 1997 to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new
inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

The Home Secretary is currently considering the representations which have been made for a
fresh inquiry. He has followed the families campaign for a new inquiry closely and has also
had the opportunity to meet some of the members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group
since the broadcast of the Granada television drama last December. He is very aware of the
strength of feeling on this issue and will reach a decision as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely




Mrs P Mehta

Dear Mr Straw,
                                 I                    •;I
                  I am writing ferasfr+Wrt7? nnv ifitjtfirv or inquest
into the Hillsborough disaster be opened as soon as possible. For one
reason or another justice has not been done.

For grieving families to know that the truth has not been fully
examined leaves them in an intolerable situation, with many unable
to come to terms with their loss and subsequent suffering. New
evidence has become known and could be an important part o f a new
inquiry. I hope that you can find time to acquaint yourself with the
most recent information.. If you need help with acquiring that
information, I would be willing to help. I suggest that the
Hillsborough Family Support Group would be willing to help. They
can be contacted at 21 Rosemont Road, Liverpool, L17 6BX.


Clearly for the dead, it is too late, but for the families involved, it is
essential that they are helped. As a football fan and parent I feel
certain that I would want to search for the truth and to have it
acknowledged and I therefore ask you to give it the most serious
thought. The Conservative Party was noted for its lack of
compassion. I trust that the Labour Party will at least be able to
consider this request.

I appreciate that this must be a hectic time for you and I realise that
it might take some time to respond but this IS important.


Yours sincerely,




                          Kenneth Bird

Dear Home Secretaiy                             \Y

As a Labour voter and a football fan I support the Hillsborough Families in their
campaign for justice and feel that in light o f new evidence, a new and independent
inquiry should surely be forthcoming.

I hope that you and your new Government will now do all that is within your power to
ensure that a this inquest now takes place.

Yours Sincerely,



Alex McGuinness.

fresh inquiry. He has followed the families campaign for a new inquiry closely and has also
had the opportunity to meet some o f the members o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group

strength o f feeling on this issue and will reach a decision as soon as possible.

Dear Home Secretary,

I am writing this, in addition to the endosed notice of support, for the Justice for the 96
Campaign; concerning the campaign for a fresh enquiry in to the Hillsborough Disaster of
1989.

    ien the new Prime Minister, Tony Blair, addressed those who had gathered in
f   wning street, on his first day as PM after having seen the Queen, something he said
seems appropriate to this. He said that Labour were striving for a Fair, and Just, country;
and that is all we ask for, justice. If the Labour party are truly to boast that they are
running the country in such a way, then this campaign must not be ignored. The families
of those who died have been denied justice for eight long years, and just as the
Conservatives were allowed to make us suffer for too long, so must Labour end the
suffering of these people. If you were to launch a fresh, and full, new enquiry; then you
would win the respect, not only of millions of football fans, but of anyone who has ever
heard of Hillsborough 1989. Great songs would be sung on the terraces of the Reds, more
great than those in Liverpool, Manchester, North London, or any oilier red teams you can
think of. So please, fly the red flag for the 96, for Justice!


Yours Sincerely




J. F.M. Paddock (Mr.)

Football Hooliganism - An Insoluble Problem?                          19



iv    Heavier penalties
      The   implementation    of    large   fines,    periods   of
      imprisonment/reformative training for violent offenders,  or
      the imposition of periods of detention at attendance centres
      on match-days (even community service):

This is a treatment of the problem not a cure.    Law and order must be
maintained - but whether the 'short, sharp shock' methods effectively
punish or deter the football hooligans is debatable.   Some have viewed
magisterial action up until now as the       lunacy of leniency .(53)
However, the 1982 Criminal Justice Act extended the power available to
the courts from those that were accessible under the old Public Order
Act (1936).  Even if a stricter enforcement of the law is undertaken by
the courts - will stiffer sentences change anything?       Surely they
should be seen as an interim measure whilst a long-term solution is
developed through the co-operation of the Government and the football
authorities.

v     Special travel clubs
      The organisation of supporters clubs so as to introduce
      membership for the use of    away travel facilities - with
      proper stewarding and police escorts:

This measure is fine for coach travel but needs to be carefully worked
out with British Rail as fans can travel on the normal train service
operating on match days.    Also, can potential football hooligans be
prevented from travelling (sometimes by car) as were picketing miners
in the recent coal dispute?

vi    Surveillance
      The use of intelligence planning before matches as well    as
      the monitoring of     terrace trouble-spots ^ with use     of
      closed-circuit  television, video, police    look-outs     to
      identify offenders:

Again,   this is only a treatment of the problem' and calls for
investigative police work to track down offenders if they are not
apprehended in the ground.    It could be useful to pin-point ring
leaders though, especially in the light of evidence to suggest that
some of the spectator violence is premeditated and planned (e.g. racist
groups).

vii   Fences and moats
      The isolation of the pitch from the terraces and the
      separation of one section of terraces from another.     This
      keeps the players 'far from the madding crowds' and prevents
      pitched battles between rival fans:

Again, this is only a treatment of the problem - already many grounds
have introduced fences and grilles but no moats yet. The introduction
of a finer mesh for goal-nets would help to eliminate the danger to
goal-keepers of being struck by missiles thrown from the crowd.
However, as far as fences and cages are concerned, there are a number


53.   Bert Millichip,   'Thoughts on Crowd Behaviour', op.cit.
Football Hooliganism - An Insoluble Problem?                          20




of draw-backs.  Firstly, there is a view that police reaction to crowd
control can be hampered by perimeter fencing. Secondly,       there is
always a real danger of crowd safety levels being reduced as the fences
surrounding the ground would be a difficult obstacle to overcome in the
event of a fire or a surge on the terraces.    The way of escape on to
the pitch is effectively ruled out by high fencing.   Thirdly, there is
a psychological theory that, briefly,    can be paraphrased:    If you
treat them like "animals' they will behave like 'animals I (54)

     It must also be said that isolating the pitch from the terraces
only serves to isolate the problem of violence on the terraces and
outside the ground (We'll see you all outside I* - is the rallying cry
of the hooligans.).  Unless a large police presence is evident on the
terraces and outside the ground,  the problem is simply removed away
from the confines of the ground.

viii All-seater stadia
     The introduction of 'all seating' in football grounds so as
     to prevent crowd surges and allow easier identification of
     trouble-makers:

Although successful at Aberdeen - it does not seem to have worked at
Coventry according to research undertaken by the Sociology department
of Leicester University.(55) There seems to be a greater risk of
ordinary fans becoming involved with hooligans and from the recent
events at Luton, there is the danger of seats being ripped from their
brackets and turned     into handy weapons    and missiles for    the
'hooligans'.  It should also be noted that there is, for example, a
troublesome element at Chelsea who congregate in an area of seated
accommodation at Stamford Bridge     - so what real      effect would
'all-seaters' have on the hooligans?

ix    Police force
      The use of large numbers of police - riot police, police with
      dogs, mounted police, police escorts for visiting fans,
      police searches on fans:

Again, only a treatment - bringing aout a further alienation of the
police from the offenders, even encouraging attacks on police officers
as at Luton.  A police presence at football matches is necessary - but
should be a low-key affair except for potential  'trouble' matches when
every precaution should be taken within the context of careful planning
between clubs and the police.


54.   The reference to animals is said to be unwarranted, cf. complaints
       from readers of The Sun , (15.3.85), p.4.
55.   Reported in 'The Guardian' (31.1.85); Anthony Storr in Human
      Aggression (1968), says: " The extremes of 'brutal' behaviour
       are confined to man; and there is no parallel in nature to
       our savage treatment of each other.
       The sombre fact is that we are the cruellest and most ruthless
       species that has ever walked the earth", p.9.

  Dear Mr Bridge

    I am writing to acknowledge receipt of your note of 10 February enclosing a copy of one
   which you sent to the Home Secretary. I am sorry that your original correspondence has not
^ p e e n traced.

  The Home Secretary has given an undertaking to consider carefully the representations that
  have been made to reopen the public inquiry into the Hillsborough tragedy. He explained
  that in coming to a decision he would consider whether there is any new evidence, and, if
  so, whether that evidence appeared to be of such significance that had it been put before
  Lord Taylor or the coroner, either the outcome of the Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury
  would have been different.

  I am sure that your comments about the use offences at grounds are common to many
  ordinary football supporters at that time. The Taylor Inquiry has been a turning point in
  relation to crowd control and the safety of sports grounds and its recommendations have
  had an obvious impact at sports grounds around the country.

  The Home Secretary has said that he will reach a decision on any further action to be taken
  in relation to the Hillsborough Tragedy as soon as he has been able to consider all the
  issues.

                                                              Yours sincerely

Dear Mr. Heath,

                  Football Hooliganism - An Insoluable Problem?


I enclose herewith a copy of an introductory essay I have recently written on
 football hooliganism1 (30 th March 1985) •

I am writing to you as my M.P. as I have been disappointed by the complete
lack of response from the Government offices for a similar letter and copy of
this report sent on 13th April to. Mrs. Thatcher in the wake of the Luton -
Millwall trouble in March. The Government's reaction after this event was
quick in recommending fences as part of a remedial package - but with no
mention of the safety factors (please see page 15 of «y paper written before
the tragedies of Bradford and Brussels).

If you have any comments that you would care to make upon my treatment of the
subject, or any advice for me in directing my further study of the problem,
I should only be too pleased to receive them.


lours sincerely

Mr. S. Bridge,




Dear Mr. Bridge,

      Thank you for your letter and for sending us a copy
of the Essay which you have prepared on the subject of
hooligans who attend football matches.

      A preliminary glance at the document seems to indicate
that you have covered all the main points which are generally
associated with hooliganism and are coupled with social
behaviour patterns of the country at the present time.

      When we have had the opportunity of looking at your
report in more detail, we will write to you again if there
are any points we would wish to pass comment on.

                                                 Yours sincerely,

V                ;
       Dear Mr Bridge

       Thank you for your letter of 14 October.

       Your essay has, I think, outlined the general areas of
       concern in the field of crowd misconduct and I am sure
       you will be aware that action is already being taken by
       the Football Authorities on fences, all-ticket games, kick-off
       times, behaviour of players, surveillance, etc.

       The government also appear at last to be prepared to act where
       punishments are concerned. We have supported the alcohol
       legislation, despite its obvious weaknesses and will continue
       to exercise what control we can over relations between the
       game and the media.
       You will excuse me if I restrict my comments on your thoughts
       about spiritual revival to saying I respect your view. It is,
       however, a personal one and you will appreciate that The
       Football Association, as a non-political, non-religious
       organisation, can make no official statement on what you
       have to say.

       Yours sincerely

Thank you for your recent letter to the Home Secretary in support o f calls for a new inquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster.

The Home Secretary is currently considering the representations which have been made for a
fresh inquiry. He has followed the families campaign for a new inquiry closely and has also
had the opportunity to meet some o f the members o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group
since the broadcast o f the Granada television drama last December. He is very aware o f the
strength o f feeling on this issue and will reach a decision as soon as possible.

Mr. Home Secretary,              \
You will find enclosed with this letwftwo
                                 letter two red forms proclaiming “Justice for the 96”.
These Forms, I am sure, are but two of many that you will receive over the course of
the next few days.
They were issued at a Liverpool home fixture last Saturday against Spurs.
Had you been at this fixture you would have witnessed a show of support from
40,000 fans, both from the home Liverpool contingent together with those who had
travelled from London, that I believe represents national opinion on this issue.
I can certainly advise, with regard to myself and my two young sons, that this
message represents heart felt views, held with deep conviction, that there needs to
be a new inquiry held into the debacle that was Hillsborough.
Evidence that has recently been made widely available should, and must, be set
before an independent inquiry team with a brief to consider aN of the evidence.
I appreciate that you are new to Office, but I would ask that you respond to this
letter advising what I and colleagues may expert from your new administration with
regard to this important and personal issue.
Believe me, all of Mersyside together with all right minded people would wish to see
justice properly served for the families of the dead, and the survivors of this great
tragedy.




Sincerely,

Jack Straw Esq

Dear Mr Straw




                                                                         ini,
I am writing to ask that you give renewed consideration to the case relatmg-
HiUsborough tragedy of 1989. I myself attended that game and was standing on the
Leppings Lane terraces, but was rather more fortunate than 96 others.

As you are probably aware. South Yorkshire Police initially contended that they were
unable to identify the suffering of supporters due to the defective closed circuit television
cameras which allegedly did not allow close up pictures to be taken. New evidence has
clearly demonstrated that allegation to be false, and that the poHce knew, or should have
known, that the supporters in the two central pens were suffering and in some instances
dying.

The police therefore had a duty to protect the public by closing the gates which they had
previously opened at the Leppings Lane entrance, and opening the gates allowing access
onto the pitch to relieve the crushing. The police failed in their duty to protect the public
in this way, and 96 lives were lost as a direct result of the actions of the poHce on that
fateful day.

I do not bear any ill will towards the South Yorkshire PoHce - they had a job to do, but
they are only human and mistakes are made. I believe the facts of the case to be
relatively clear, and I trust that you will instigate a review of the case to allow the victims'
families to rest knowing that the truth has finally been publicly established.
       *•

    Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

^^D ear Mr Straw


  First of all, may I congratulate you and your colleagues of New Labour on your
  victory in the General Election, I think I speak for most people in this country when
  I say that we all feel you can make a difference to Britain. All the talking as Mr
  Blair said just the other day, is over and now you have that chance you have all
  waited so many years for.

  The Conservative Party deserves to be in the state it currently finds itself in, they
  lost touch with the man and woman in the street, the people they were supposed to
  be working for. I feel that is something you as a party will not do and that is why I
  voted for you in the election.

  Now to the real point of this letter. You may have seen on the news at the weekend,
  the pictures from Liverpool Football Club and their match with Tottenham Hotspur.
  These pictures were not of the match itself but of 45,000 people holding aloft
  “Justice for the 96” cards, one of which is enclosed

  You have so many things to even contemplate doing the in the next 5 years of
  Government but this campaign is one that has been going on too long and which
  needs attention as early as is possible.

  continued
  I have supported Liverpool Football Club for most of my life and 9 years ago, had
  to endure surely the worst scenes ever seen at a footballing fixture. Not only did we
  all see what happened at Hillsborough, the families of the 96 killed are still living
  through this ordeal all these years on.

  It is imperative that they get what they deserve, a new enquiry into what happened
  that fateful day. The Conservative Government and Michael Howard, an MP here
  in Kent has so far refused these families their request. THIS CANNOT AND
  MUST NOT STAY LIKE THIS.

  The truth is the only thing that can help these people, it must come out, it is only
  RIGHT that it does. I emplore you to look into the new evidence they have to hand.

  Even living in Kent, I regularly travel to Anfield Football Club, was there this
  ^eekend just gone and once again have had to stand and face something which I
  and many other supporters like me, should not have to - the memorial plaque to the
  96 victims of Hillsborough.

  Look into the new evidence, call a fresh enquiry ... HELP THE FAMILIES OF
  THESE PEOPLE TO GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES.

  Anfield’s pledge is “You’ll Never Walk Alone” ... It is footballs’ most famous
  collective cry, make sure these families can stop doing just that, walking alone,
  trying to get someone with the power to listen. You have that power, the British
  people have given you that, un-like Michael Howard before you, please ...


                              USE IT.

  Yours Faithfully

Dear Home Secretary,

       As a football supporter and a Liverpool fan in particular I fully support the
campaign of the Hillsborough Families for Justice and request that in the light
of the new evidence which has recently emerged about the disaster, you do all in
your power to ensure that a fresh inquiry and / or inquest is established as soon
as possible.



                                                      Yours In Sport

Dear Mr Alley

Thank you for your letter of 3 May 1997 to the Home Secretary about the calls for a new
inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

The Home Secretary is currently considering the representations which have been made for a
fresh inquiry. He has followed the families campaign for a new inquiry closely and has also
had the opportunity to meet some of the members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group
since the broadcast of the Granada television drama last December. He is very aware of the
strength of feeling on this issue and will reach a decision as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely




Mrs P Mehta

Dear Mr Straw,
                                                                    'CES

       I hope you will not mind if I give you an                                   may
not seem significant at the moment

       A request for a new inquiry into Hillsborough is unlikely ever to go away
because too many people lost too many loved ones.

         For those involved, it has always been regarded as one of die biggest of many
social injustices suffered under a Conservative government and it would be wrong, but
excusable, to believe it was just a tragedy at a football match.

        I was a spectator at the match, but I have never been involved in the aftermath,
except to make the first commentary on ITN as it happened. But I do have a lot of
understanding about it.

        I am writing to you because I do not want a Labour Government to slip up on
this one because, below the surface, it is also a national issue and a highly political
matter and to see it any other way would be to misjudge the feelings of many millions
of voters.

        These people (the relatives) want their day in court for what they regard as a
Conservative government inspired cover-up by the Home Office and they will be
looking to a Labour Home Secretary to help them put the record straight. I hope you
will eventually agree. It is something that needs to be purged and the sooner we get it
over with, the better.

                                    Yours sincerely,

 It is a beautiful warm sunny summer’s evening, the date - Ai            167 -HKel

 season; the place - a football match - kick-off at 7:30 pm.                   we are marshalled out o f the
 seats we occupied at the end o f one o f the long stands and are funnelled round a corner into a triangular
 area bordered by high wrought iron fences, out o f which two gates give onto the pavement and road
 beyond the stadium. We walk past the turnstiles and exit gates o f the area given over to the away-fans
 who have a standing area and cantilevered stand above it. They are also being funnelled into this same
 small triangular space as ourselves. A crush develops as people pile out o f these exit points in a hurry to
fcget back home to Manchester: They are, no doubt, unaware o f the fact that the area is already solid and
 that only two gates open onto the public highway. I see the ratlings coming up in front o f me and realise
  I am going to get pushed straight into them by the unseeing crush behind me. I panic, seeing serious
 injury and maybe death coming my way. I start shouting, linking arms with those nearest me. “Link arms
  - we’re going to get crushed against the tailings” . We link arms, using our combined strength and weight
 to lean backwards and slow down the impelling rush o f those behind us. Somehow, we manage to create
  enough space for ourselves to manoeuvre our way towards and finally through the narrow gap o f the two
 gates. I vow never again to go anywhere near that end o f that particular football ground again if it means
  being exposed to such serious potential danger: I keep my word.

 It is a beautiful, fine, sunny afternoon, the date - 15 April, 1989 - the end .of the football season - the
 place - a football match - kick-off 3.00pm.

 The place? The Leppings Lane end o f Sheffield Wednesday football ground.
 The result? 1%7 - 0; 1989 - 96.

 Sentimental adages along the lines o f “there but for the grace o f God” come rushing to my mind as I
 watch the scenes o f unbelievable horror unfold before my eyes that late spring day - events which I had
 somehow known would one day overtake that badly designed, badly organised end o f that particular
 ground. More adages along the lines o f “life lambs to the slaughter” rush through my brain as I watch
 those limp and often lifeless bodies hauled onto the pitch that fine, sunny day. And that is what it is really
 all about - that innocent football supporters going to nothing more exceptional than a football match
 instead went to their death.

 We all attend public events in public places; we attend them in die blind belief that such public venues are
 safe and fit for us to attend . We do not view attending a football match as having a commensurate risk
 attached to it, such as an actuary would attach to flying on a scheduled passenger plane, for example, and
 for which we would therefore insure ourselves for loss o f life.

 I watch the screen change and interviews start I watch Graham Kelly do an obscene impersonation o f
 Pontius Pilate and I realise that I rail against that mental self-absolution today as much as nine years ago

 How, if the HA is th*» ultimate authority with regards to soccer and all its doings, how come, that the HA
 does not bear the ultimate responsibility for what occurred that fateful day?

 How, if Sheffield City Council’s chief safety officer stated, as he did in a documentary soon after the
 inquiry, that the ground was not safe, how come Sheffield City Council does not bear ultimate
 responsibility for what happened on 15 April 1989?
    ♦

        How, if Sheffield Wednesday football dub, who, as the owners o f the ground, ate responsible for its
        maintenance a d upkeep so that the general paying public can go there in safety, how come that Sheffield
        Wednesday football club do not bear ultimate responsibility for what happened on 15 April 1989?

        However many questions I can think o f concerning that horrific day, one thing and one Aung alone is
        true:-

        For years the police had effectively cordoned o ff the approaches to the ground, thereby preventing a
        crush developing around the Leppings lane end o f the ground. This meant that the perception was that,
        because the enclosed pens at the Leppings Lane end o f the ground had been used for years in complete
        safety, that the pens and the lay-out and management o f that end o f the ground were in and o f
        themselves intrinsically safe. I am certain this perception was a cruel illusion. For, had that end o f the
        ground been intrinsically safe, then, no matter what the police did or did not do to contribute to the
        situation outside the Leppings Lane end o f the ground so that a gate had to be opened, thereby releasing
        the crush o f people into the stadium, had the lay-out and maintenance as well as the organisation inside
        that stadium been inherently safe, then no disaster could have occurred.

        I think that in a desire to punish someone for the catastrophe, and given that the police are ultimately
        responsible for security outside and inside the ground, that a disservice has unwittingly been done to all
        the dead, by letting others who were to blame walk away from their responsibility.

        But is it not also the case that Sheffield Wednesday football ground’s safety record relied on people in
        high places trusting to luck rather than good management?

        Questions about the probity o f the coroner’s decisions - some o f which, such as fixing the time o f death
        so early - seem perverse to say the least

        Failure to call doctors to give evidence which would have disproved this arbitrary hour o f 3.15 pm have
        gone unchallenged.

        None o f this, however, approaches for perversity the lack o f diligent pursuit o f any and all evidence
        which marked the case o f the “missing” security video. Was there a breakdown in the control centre o f
        the one camera whose video-tape would have clearly shown the build-up outside and inside that end o f
        the ground? But what if that camera did not in fact break down? The absence o f that one, crucially
        important film becomes ever more difficult to explain, and the apparent lack o f urgency in ascertaining
        its existence and whereabouts, is unforgivable. So many people in authority who should have known
        better and should have performed better, seem instead to have exercised a very poor level o f due care,
        and it is perhaps this one over-riding factor which has marred this case and made it so important that a
        new appeal is launched. How can there ever be peace for the survivors if the feelings persist that there
        has been a cover-up o f this lack o f due care?

        I find it alarming that no one appears to have thought about probing more deeply in these directions
        when wishing to establish responsibility for the Hillsborough disaster, instead o f developing what may
        have been a fatally blinkered view o f the matter in which the police were the only culprits, and as a result
        o f which every other body involved in not exercising a duty o f due care in this matter walked away scot-
        free.

        Justice for the 96!

Dear Ms Cadden

Thank you for your letter of 13 May 1997 to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new
inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

The Home Secretary is currently considering the representations which have been made for a
fresh inquiry. He has followed the families campaign for a new inquiry closely and has also
had the opportunity to meet some of the members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group
since the broadcast of the Granada television drama last December. He is very aware of the
strength of feeling on this issue and will reach a decision as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely




Mrs P Mehta

fresh inquiry. He has followed the families campaign for a new inquiry closely and has also
had the opportunity to meet some of the members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group
since the broadcast of the Granada television drama last December. He is very aware of the
strength of feeling on this issue and will reach a decision as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely

   Dear Home Secretary

   As a football supporter I folly support the campaign of the Hillsborough Families for
   Justice and request that in the light of the new evidence which has recently emerged
   about the disaster, you do all in your power to ensure that a fresh inquiry and inquest is
   established as soon as possible.

   Is it not about time that the families and supporters involved received the Justice
   and the truth they deserve?

   There is tremendous support for this campaign as there are too many questions still to
   be answered. Also why have the parties that were responsible for the actions, or lack
   of actions, that led to the disaster have never been made accountable for the decisions
   they took?

   Without the foil facts it is impossible to have an accurate picture of the problems that
   arose on April 15th 1989 therefore how can all the lessons be learned.

   I wait in anticipation of your decision and I hope ami pray it is the right one.

   Yours faithfully

 cised the accuracy o f the
  portrayal.
     The one message that is
  clear is that a lot of ques­
  tions remain unanswered.
     Notably (some would say
  crucially) why did the coro­
  ner at the inquest restrict
  tim e of death to a fictional
  standardised average of
  3.15pm; and could this not
  have, as is reasonably
  argued, prejudiced the out-
- come of-the inquest, particu­
  larly as some people were
  still dying in th e period
  which followed, as the
  nation witnessed when the
  disaster unfolded on our
  television sets, w ell past
  3.15pm?
     It strikes me that fact is
  being compromised by
  bureaucratic convenience
  whose crude effect distorts ,
  the truth and questions the
  reliability of the outcome.
     And that such strong-arm

                 a bid t^uphold
           confidence in the
  police by deflectingcriticism.
     Why else antagonise the
  victim s by restricting bla­
  tantly relevant evidence?
     Ibelieve as matters stand
  now, not only have: the police
  been generally undermined,
  but the judiciary are also
  under the microscope.
     The public does not liketo
  feel its democratic institu­
  tions are corruptible, espe­
  cially w hen evidence is
  restrietedjn such a sensitive
  matter as to how 96 people

    How those 96 people died
  that day should be seen to
  have been investigated thor­
  oughly.
   An inquest is, o f allplaces,
 no place for cover-ups.

Dear Mr Straw

On Saturday I attended the concert at Anfield organised to support the families of victinfom the
Hillsborough tragedy.

I heard on the news that you were going to re-open the case and so I wanted to write to thank you
and to support you in this.

    sure that you are aware of the great depth of feeling for justice, and it fills me with hope that
I made the right decision in voting Labour, if there are finally going to be people in your position
who have ethics and a consideration of what is right.

It would be appalling if families did have to instigate private prosecutions. I think that they have
suffered enough. I just hope that they will have received some comfort from 34,000 people who
believe that justice will finally happen.

We finally need people to own up to mistakes - not necessarily to be punished for it, but to admit
that tragic wrong decisions were made and that the whole thing was dealt with badly. I still
cannot believe that the police in charge got away with covering their own backs, and this took
precedence over people’s suffering.

I grew up and lived in Liverpool and recently moved to London. I always knew that Liverpool
had an unfairly bad reputation, but it was not until I met some people in London that I realised
the full extent of the prejudice. I will never forget the vehemence of people’s opinions over
Hillsborough who still carry the images of the Sun newsapaper, and refer to us as “whingeing
Scousers” when we continue to talk about requiring justice.

I have high hopes that the re-opening of the case will right these wrongs, erradicate wrong
stereotypes and, maybe, bring some comfort to the families and people who still suffer from
 having been there.

Thank-you once again. I do not require an answer to this letter, unless you change your mind.
Then I will require an explanation.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Bowyer

Thank you for your letter of 17 May 1997 to the Home Secretary in support of calls for a new
inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

The Home Secretary is currently considering the representations which have been made for a
fresh inquiry. He has followed the families campaign for a new inquiry closely and has also
had the opportunity to meet some of the members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group
since the broadcast of the Granada television drama last December. He is very aware of the
strength of feeling on this issue and will reach a decision as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely




Mrs P Mehta

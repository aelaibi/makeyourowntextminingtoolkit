            I am a Police               Constable           in the         South Yorkshire                 Police        presently

            stationed            at    Cl    Sub    Division,            Rotherham.

            On Saturday,               15 A p r i l ,      1989      <150489),           I commenced             d u t y at     Main       Street

            Police        Station,           Rotherham          at      S.30am      <0830) .          Shortly afterwards                    in

            company with               other       officers          we w e r e     conveyed          by    coach        to H i l l s b o r o u g h

            Football            Ground       at S h e f f i e l d ,      where      we    attended          a briefing.

            After        the     briefing          the     serial        I was     attached           to    ( Se ri al       37)     made       our

            way     to W a d s 1ey B r i d g e           Railway         Station.          The      Sergeant         in      charge        of    the

            serial        was      a PS Kennedy,               the      other     serial       working           with     us w a s     Serial

            was     in    charge        of    both       the    serials          <36 a n d     37).

            Both     serials           were     stood       by the         W a d s 1 ey B r i d g e    Railway Station

            awaiting            the a r r i v a l       of a s p e c i a l       train     containing             Liverpool

            supporters,               this    I believe           was      due    to a r r i v e      at 2 . 0 2 p m <1402).

            We    had     been        standing          in the       Railway       Station          area     for     a    considerable

            length        of     time,       when       a message          was    passed       over        the    ra d i o     to    the

            effect        that        assistance          was     r e q u i r e d at     a store           called        the    ’G a t e w a y ’ ,

            which        w as    about       200 yards          away       from    the    Railway           Station,           further

            along        Halifax        Road.           Myself,         irt c o m p a n y w i t h     several        other          officers,

            proceeded            to    this     location                           but    as     we a p p r o a c h e d        the

•Gateway*, a               call    over     the        radio       stated        no      further          assistance            was

required.

My     observations              whilst     in t hi s         area       made       me    aware          that     hundreds           of

Liverpool           supporters           we re     standing             and    sitting             around       drinking

alcohol        from        cans,     almost        everyone             of    them was             holding        a    four-pack

< b e e r / l a g e r ).

After      only       a fe w m i n u t e s        we    returned             back     to W a d s l e y B r i d g e            Railway

Station.            Whilst        stood     there           I saw       numerous          Liverpool             supporters

walking        down Halifax               Road     in the          direction             of    the       football          ground

many     of    them        carrying        cans        of    beer/lager.

The     train arrived              at     about        2 p m <1400),          our     two      serials          were

positioned            along       the     exit     from       the       station          and       onto     the H a l i f a x

Road,      where         several         Mounted        officers             were     waiting            to a s s i s t       in the

escort        of    the     supporters,            this       took       several          m i n u t e s , then           we    walked

t he    supporters              towards     the        ground,          these       particular              supporters              were

a ll    well       behaved        and     there        were       no    incidents             to    r ep o rt .

We     arrived        at    the     ground,        the       Lepping          Lane       entrance           where        the

supporters            we    had    escorted            went       through        the      outer          gate     towards           the

turnstiles.

We     then were           told     to    take     up a       position           on L e p p i n g s         Lane       near     to     the

bridge,        whilst           1 wa s    stood        there       numerous           supporters             were        s t i ll

arriving           many     of wh i ch w e r e          sti ll         drinking          be e r     or    lager,         also       many

were     asking          for     tickets        from        other       supporters             or a s k i n g         if a n y o n e

knew where            they       could     be     purchased.                 It w a s     very apparent                  that       lots

of     people       had     travelled           to H i l l s b o r o u g h       without            tickets.

It w o u l d       be a p p r o x i m a t e l y    2.43pm          (1443)        when         I was       aware        that     more

and more           people        were    arriving,            hundreds           in fact.

I had      part       of a m e s s a g e        over        the    radio       that       indicated             that      the       game

was    going        to     be    delayed,         and       in f a ct        I told       several          supporters               this.

I just        don't        know    where        all     these          supporters             were       coming        from,        the

                                                                                                                                       R3S7

area        at    t h is    time       was     congested.                I also          saw      that       people        stood

waiting           ne ar     the       turnstiles           were       being         lifted         over         the      fencing       to

avoid        what       appeared          to    be a       crushing            situation.                  There         were    also

several           youngsters            climbing           ov e r     the w a l l          into      the        ground.

It w o u l d       be      shortly        after       3pm       (1500)         when       I heard a               loud     cheer       from

inside           the    ground,         which        I assumed            was       the       kick-off.                There     were

still        hundreds            of    supporters           outside            the       ground         pushing           towards        the

e ntranees.

Several           minutes         elapsed        when       I heard a message                        o v er       th e    rad io .       I am

not     certain            but    I believe           t he m e s s a g e        to       be    similar            to     "All    available

officers           attend         immediately              inside         the       ground".               On     hearing        this        I

ran     towards            the    t u r n s ti le s.        Following               me    wa s     PC      451     Cooper,        whom           for

th e    rest       of      this       incident        I was         in    c o m p a n y with.                We    both       jumped         over

a    turnstile             ran    to    the     rear       of    the      South          stand       down         through        the

seating           area      onto       the     playi ng a rea,             at       which         p oi n t      I could         see    there

was     a    l a rg e      crowd       p r o b l e m at     the       r ea r    of       the L e p p i n g s           Lane     end

g oa 1 po s t s .

I went           immediately            to     this       area and         I saw          that       people            were     being

crushed           on    the      perimeter           fencing,            also       on the         side-fencing,                 together

with        PC    Cooper         I stood        on    the       sm all     wall          n ea r    the       perimeter           fencing

and     began          lifting         people        over       the      fencing.              I lost           count      of    how many

we     got       out    but      they mainly              consisted            of    younger            people,          all     of w h i c h

had     either          climbed         near     to       the    top      of    the       fen ce ,         or     had     been    lifted

up     by    fellow         supporters,              we    carried         on       doing         t hi s     for w h a t        seemed

h o u r s , although              I realise           it w a s n ’t,           when       it      seemed          that     the    majority

of     supporters             were      out    of a n y         further         crushing             problems.                Myself         and

PC     Cooper,          together         with        some       other      people,             carried a teenage                      bo y    to

the     gym       on a m a k e s h i f t       stretcher,                in m y      opinion            t hi s     boy as        dead.            I

d o n ’t k n o w w h o           we    handed        the    bo dy        to,    but a          police           officer         told    me

where        to    put      the       body.

                     wherever        we    could.

                     Cooper       went     into      the    stand where            the     incident           had    occurred-             This    I

                     understood           was   mainly        to    protect        the     scene      due      to    several         groups       of

                     supporters           standing         nearby.          It was       at    this     time        when a youth            from       one

                     of    the    groups        threw      some     water      over      myself       a n d PC       Cooper.          No    action

                     was    taken with           regard       to    this,      due    to      th e   fa c t    t h at    the    supporters

                     still       in the       stand      were      in m y    opinion          angry and         annoyed and            in d o i n g

                     anything        may      have      caused      further        problems»

                     Most    of     the    supporters           had   by     now     left      the    ground,           the    ones    that

                     remained were              spoken      to,     and     slowly       and     carefully asked                to    leave       the

                     ground,        this      they      did w i t h o u t    any     problems.

                     We    then made          our w a y     to W a d s 1ey B r i d g e         Station         and met         other       members

                     of    our    serial.         We     then went          to C l a y w h e e l s    Lane      and were         later       stood

                     down.

             tunnel        area      was       fairly       w e ll     congested          the       supporters           were      well          behaved

             and      from     the    view        X got         there       was    no    pushing           taking       place.

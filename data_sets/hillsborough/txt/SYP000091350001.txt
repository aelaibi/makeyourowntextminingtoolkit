               I am a Liverpool Football T l u b Supporter and ^ s a s o n ticket holder.                             I

               attend mos4*home and away games, and have s up po r teak them all my life.

               I obtained a tic)ket for the Semi Final tX^be played at Hi 1 lsborouqh

                             had originally he 1d a stand ticket for the match but had

               swapped it for two ground tickets so that we could both go to the

               match.        The tickets we had were for the Leppings Lane terrace

               costing £6 each.

               On the morning of the match Saturday 15th Tfrpril 1989 <150489)                             I picked

               up                  in my car from his                >ss and started out for Sheffield.

We arrived in Sheffield at about                  1.15 pm and parked in a residential

street near to Chaucer Road.               We walked towards the ground stopping at

a shop to get something to             eat.       We slowly         walked on again towards        the

ground,    there were a lot of supporters around the                      area but I did not

see any trouble.        I cannot remember            people drinking         in the streets as

we approached the ground.

We arrived at the Lappings Lane end of the    ground at about five to
     ^ i—
t w o . There was only two or three people ahead of us in the queue to

the turnstiles, and we had no trouble getting to the turnstile.                               At

the turnstile     I was searched by a Policeman before going                       in.    I did

not see                   Police outside the turnstiles                   I remember seeing
    OAT
Stewards    inside and o u t s i d e    the t u r n s t i l e s .

I attended the same game the year before and had tickets for the West

Stand so I knew the Leppings Lane turnstiles and were to gain entrance

to the ground.

I went through a turnstile without any problems and gave up my ticket.

Once inside the tb<nstile          I looked across and saw that the Jblue

c on ce rt in a^g a^ yat x the side of the turnstile was open a bout the width

of a man and a steward was standing near to i t .                        I did not see anyone

entering the ground through the open gate.

I did not see any signs directing us to our viewing point but directly

ahead of us was a tunnel so we made our way towardsNit.                            I did not see

any Police or Stewards around the tunnel entrance.                           We stalked down the
                                                                            Ua c;\ \ 'Sir'll- f3ejn £
tunnel towards the terrace without any

past two when we reached the terrace,                    it was faiN^ly crowded just

what   I would have expected an hour before the Kick \ f f                       of a big g a m e .

On reaching the terrace we went slightly to the right \jito Pen 3.                                 We

walked about half way down the terrace and stood close to the central

fence which divides P e n ’s 3 and 4.                The terrace was very crowded and

we had to push our way to the viewing point.
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    S3561

I did not see anyone drinking alcohol              in the ground,      the atmosphere

was good, and there was no trouBl

I saw a crash barrier on the terrace aubmit six feet in front of us ;
                        \(                        c/tT
and I also saw a man standing on a barrier x i j e n 4 waving a blow up

banana about this was alongside us.

We stood around talking and I saw the teams corrse\at for a warm up.

It was getting very fxUJ, on the terrace but I was ntjitVc r u sh ed .
                                                                                            -3
Whi 1e I was standi ng on the v V r a c e        I was joined by

and he stayed with us until just a-gter the teams had w a rmed up, when

he welVL away to try and find his mate^j                                           returned
                                                   V)
to us after'vabout five minutes and told us there was trouble outside

he did not tell u ^ a n y t h i n g   further.

   )m about twenty to tl~\ree (1440) onwards             it started to get really

tight              Pen and you could not move around at all.                I was holding

on to the central       railings and could feel the crowd pushing me down

the terrace and into the railings.               Hy friends had been standing

behind me but they were pushed past me dawn the terrace.

Despite the crowd pressure because           I was holding on to the railings I

was not moved along much.

Because of the crowd pressure I was getting worried but                              who

was by now in front of me was getting very worried.                    We thought about

trying       get out but decideHKagai nst it because of the amount of

people b e h i m    _
                         ° h 'T       \              v
I remember the teams came out and I f.e                  e ve ral crowd surges at this

point and the pressure got really bad.               I was still holding onto the

fence and I could see                   just ahead of me and                  was just

behind me.

I was being crushe^\but        could breathe reasort?           ly enough        tween five

to three and three o c'hack (1455 ~ 1500)               I saw               get up onto the

central fencing and make his way towards the pitch.                    I then saw him

            climb over the periirieter fenceN-ir^d onto the pitch.            I saw him fall

            into the advertising hoardings which were surrounding the pitch.

            I thought about climbing up into the railings but because of the crush

            I could not get up onto the fence.             At this point          was still

            behind me, and       I knew the game had started.      The only part     of the game

            I saw was when       Liverpool   had a c or ne r, after this I was    to worried

            about what was       going on around me to look at the match.

            I was getting more and more crushed but I still held on               to the railing

            and stayed in the same viewing position.                       shouted from the

            pitch that he would meet us outside after the game.

            The crush went on for a short while before            it seemed to stop.       I saw a

            Policeman in Pen 4 and he asked us all to move back as also he asked

            the people in Pen 4 to m o v ^ ^ b ^ c k ^ ^

            The game had stopped and the players had left the pi t c h.             All of a

        ^   sudden the crowd in front of me parted and I saw a man lying on the

            ground having difficulty to b re at h.          I would describe this man as

            being about 25 to 30 yrs, 5 * "IQ" very heavy build,             I would say

            ov er we ig ht .   His hair was dark and cut short,      he was clean shaven with

            a chubby face.        He was wearing blue jeans,      light coloured shirt and
O^JHUJL
(*#. A ,jumpe r .       His face was white to blue in colour and he was foaming at

            the mouth arS-sJ.f he was having a fit.         Myself and           went to this

            man witji some otPhs^ people who I do not know, we picked up the man and
                  t/vA peuSonj
            ran out'of the tunnel^i^)the rear of the terrace with him.

            We carried the man out through the blue gate which I had seen open

            before going in, and put the man down on the ground.                There were

            several Police and Ambulance men around, most of the Police were

            standing around.        I saw several other people lying on the ground,            I do

            not know if they were dead or badly injured.

            I said to             we are in the way here and we should leave the ground

            a Policeman nearby told me that was the attitude so we left the ground

and went out into Leppings Lane.

At the time we placed the man on the ground I could hear noises

coming from his throat and he was alive TSjQd breathing.

Before we had carried the man,, out I had seen i N a r g e        pile of bodies

lying against the perimeter fe^ic^alS^he front of Pen 3, several of

these people looked very blue and were dead.

My Grandfather was a undertaker and I have hel]?©^ him in the past so I

have seen several dead bodies.

       and myself walked down the Leppings Lane where we met

                            into the ground and he asked us what ----------
                                                                 had gone

on.    I crossed the road and went to a telephone box where            I rang my

Grandparents to let my family know I was alright.              At this time it was

about three twenty five      (1525).     There was a lot of Fire engines

Police around the area,     the Police were getting shouted at by fans.

Also   I saw a lot of pressmen around stopping           people and asking them

for their views this was upsetting fans and the pressmen were very

close to getting assaulted.

I was in a daze and left               and              and walked back to my car,

and waiting for             for some time but he never came.           Later I went

back towards the ground to try and find him but I could not find him.

I again went back to my car and listened to the radio,              people were

walking by in a daze and people were            coming out of the houses asking

what was going on.

After some time, about quarter past five            (1715)   I got out of my car

and again walked back towards the ground and on the way I met

walking up.

We went back to the car and a person fr^ft^a nearby house             l e t _____

use the telephone to ring home.          After this we got in the car and

drove home through Huddersfield.             We got home afcjoi^t eight o clock

(2000 ).

         All the other matches    I have been to I have been stopped by the Police

         quite a distance from the ground checking tickets and if you did not

         have one you were turned back.     I was expecting it this time but I was

         not stopped at all.

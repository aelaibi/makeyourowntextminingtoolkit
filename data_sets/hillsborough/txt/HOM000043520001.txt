                 TWENTY-EIGHTH D A Y ’S PROCEEDINGS

                     MONDAY, 26th JUNE, 1989

                        (MORNING SESSION)


          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Strange how the idea of a
     heatwave becomes an idee fixe.

                    WILFRED EASTWOOD    Recalled

                  Cross-examined by    MR. MAXWELL:

Q. Dr. Eastwood, you are an engineer of great experience and
   in partiular expertise with regard to football grounds, are
   not you? -A. Yes.

Q. And an engineer, you value your good name, the firm's good
   name, and you would not put that in jeopardy? - A. No.

Q. Indeed, I think on the occasion of one Officer Working;;
   Party you very properly were at pains to make that
   clear.  It is at page 105 of the core bundle being
   brought for you at the moment.  It is towards the bottom
   of the page when there had been some questions raised
   with regard to the South Stand and you say in the last
   five lines it was his professional opinion which he was
   most jealous of and would not put in jeopardy, the
   South Stand was structurally safe? - A. Yes.

Q. Now, if you would please keep the core bundle available,
   would you go to page 475 in it? Do you have that?
   That is a document that comes into existence after the
   annual inspection of the stadium as required by the
   certificate of ground safety. - A. Yes.

Q. And the terms of it are set out there and you conclude,
   "I certify that in my opinion the various structures on
   the ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate
   for the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid
   down in the certificate of ground safety"? - A. Yes.

Q. Is it fair to say that what you meant there was that as
   far as the matters within your remit this football ground
   was safe for use? - A. What the certificate says is the
   various structures.

Q.   Yes.   - A. Are you asking me now to go beyond that?

Q.    No.  I am asking you certainly whether as far as the
     matters within your remit are concerned, and they are
     matters that relate to the structures? - A. Yes.

Q. You were saying that as far as those matters are concerned
                              2

                                                  W.    EASTWOOD

   this ground was safe for use? - A. Yes.

Q. And those structures as far as you were concerned, did
   they include, for example, the crush barriers? - A. Yes.,

Q. And when you gave this certificate you included the crush
   barriers, the perimeter fences? - A. Yes.

Q. All such items of the structure? - A. Yes.

Q. There are not any hidden reservations in this, are there?
   There are not any exclusions so far as structures are
   concerned? - A. That is so.,,

Q. You meant then the reader to conclude on the basis of
   your professional opinion that this ground was as far
   as the structures were concerned in good order? - A. Yes.

Q. Can I go, please, to the 1981 pens? Details of the scheme
   were formulated by you, were not they?- A. Yes.

Q. You told Lord Justice Taylor that you had some I think you
   used the word vacillations about the creation of the pens
   by virtue of the radial fences? - A. Yes.

Q. But whatever qualms you had is it fair to say that they
   were never publicly expressed at any officer working
   party? - A. Prior to their construction these pens were
   never the subject of discussion so far as I can recall
   at a working party meeting at which we were invited.
   There were obviously other working party meetings.   It would
   be understood that when the working party came to the
   ground for its either bi-annual or annual inspection we
   were generally invited to take part in any discussions.
   All other meetings of the working party including the
   one at which these radial barriers were requested we
   were not present.,

Q. Then as far as the officer working party meetings which
   you attended or a representative of yourrfirm attended
   is it fair to say that no public expression occurred of
   any doubts that you may have earlier had about the pens?
   -A. I would not like to say that that is so but I am
   sure I vacillated from time to time if there were dis­
   cussions but at no stage did I ask for anything to be
   minuted or did I feel strongly that something should be
   said about them.

Q. And in the years which followed the creation of the pens
   you continued to provide the certificates relating to your
   inspection of the ground and the safety of the structures
   there? - A. Y e s .

Q. And, for example, if you would go to page 179, I    think
   this is the certificate given the year after the    pens
   were created.  The letter begins page 178 and it    is an
   annual inspection again and you set out details     there
                                3


                                                      W.   EASTWOOD


   of what you have done and on page 178 you say, the third
   paragraph up from the bottom, "Two radial fences had been
   installed on the Leppings Lane terrace to segregate
   spectators"? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you see that? - A. Yes.

Q. And then over the page, 179, the document concludes in a
   similar way to the 1988 certificate, "I certify that in
   my opinion the various structures on the ground are in a
   satisfactory condition and appropriate for the stadium to
   be used to the full capacity as laidddown in the certificate
   of ground safety"? - A. Yes.

Q. And it is fair again to say, is not it, that your prof­
   essional view meant, putting it simply, that as far as
   the structures with which you were concerned this ground
   was safe to use? -A. That is so.

Q. The 1985 modifications were originally put to the South
   Yorkshire County Council in the form of Plan 6705/2
   which is at page 220 of the core bundle, and looking at
   that plan there are shown on it, are not there, certain
   new gates which would have been part of the proposed
   development, new gates on the turnstile side of the
   West Stand? - A. Yes.

Q. One advantage of that scheme as it was proposed was that
   there would have been segregation of spectators from the
   time they came through the turnstiles? - A. That is so.




                                / Q. And that would
                                           4


                                                                            W. E A S T W O O D

Q.   And that w o u l d ha v e e n a b l e d , for e x a m p l e ,          the n u m b e r s goi ng
     i nto the s e g r e g a t e d a r e a s to be m o n i t o r e d        at the t u r n s t i l e s ?
     A.    They c o u l d have b e e n m a t c h e d e x a c t l y          to the c a p a c i t y of
     each pen.

Q.   In the event, a n o t h e r s c h e m e was            p r e f e r r e d and   put    to    the
     S o u th Y o r k s h i r e C o u n t y C o u n c i l     A.        Yes.

Q.   W o u l d you p l e a s e t ur n to p ag e 268.                I w a n t to see if you
     can a s s i s t on this a sp e ct .             Page 268 is the end of the
     l e t t e r from Mr. V a u g h a n for S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e to your firm
     i n d i c a t i n g that t h e s e r e v i s e d p r o p o s a l s are g e n e r a l l y
     a c c e p t a b l e and s e t t i n g out c e r t a i n c o m m e n t s u p o n th e m and
     on p a g e 268 (j), " S t e w a r d i n g of new gates.                   As m e n t i o n e d
     in my l e t t e r of 2nd May, 1985, it is e s s e n t i a l that all
     the new g a t e s are f u l ly s u p e r v i s e d by s t e w a r d s who m u s t be
     fit, a bl e and p r o p e r l y t r a i n e d . "          Do you see t h a t ?
     A.        Yes.

Q.   The o r i g i n a l p l a n had got, as I have p o i n t e d out to you,
     t h e se g a te s on the t u r n s t i l e side of the W es t stand.
     A.      Yes.

Q.   The r e v i s e d v e r s i o n did not h a v e t h o s e gates, did it?
     A.      It d i d n ' t have t h o s e g a t e s but t h e r e was, I am c o n f i d e n t ,
     a c h a n g e in a gate at that side.               I b e l i e v e two, i n de e d.
     One l a r g e g at e was m o v e d and a s ma l l gate was i n c l u d e d at that
     s ide of the stand, b e h i n d the stand, b e t w e e n the s t a n d and
     the t u r n s t i l e s .

Q.   The r e f e r e n c e in t ha t l e t t e r to g a t e s - can you              say w ha t
     do you u n d e r s t a n d it to be a r e f e r e n c e to?     A.                It says,
     "the g a t e s " so it m u s t m e a n all new or p o s s i b l y               in a d d i t i o n
     r e - l o c a t e d gates.

Q.   D o e s it   i n c l u d e the n ew g a t e s    to be put        in    around       the    perimeter
     f en c e ?     A.        C l e a r l y it says   "gates".

Q.   And the new gate in the r a d i a l fence.  A.     The r e wa s not
     a new gate in the r a d i a l fence, sir.  The new r a d i a l fence
     was pu± in.       Oh, I see, the one at the ve r y top, w h e r e
     t h e r e is a pair.   Yes, yes.

               MR. C O L L I N S :    I am s o r r y to i n t e r r u p t but we h av e been

             L O R D J U S T I C E T A YLOR:  I think                 we    should      not    spend
     too   m uc h t i m e on w h a t was a b o r t i v e .

             MR.     MAXWELL:         I am      sorry,        sir?

             LORD     JUSTICE     T A YL O R:         On      things       that   did    not    happen.

               MR. M A X W E L L :   I am sorry, sir, in the e v e n t this

               L O R D J U S T I C E T A YL O R: But the p l an we w e r e l o o k i n g at
     b e f o r e did not h a p p e n and, in fact, I was l o o k i n g at it
     c lo s e l y , the p l an we w e r e l o o k i n g at b e f o r e w o u l d not

                                                        W. EASTWOOD

                MR. MAXWELL: There are certainly clear 'no go' areas
            in there, if I may say so, where the cal culations are set
            out.

                LORD JU STICE TAYLOR: Thee will    be someone   better
            qualified than I to look at them.

       Q.       MR. MAWELL: At all events, you tested these crash barriers
            and gave them a certif ica te afterwards? A. Yes.

       Q.   Again, that certif ic at e meant  that as far as you were
            concerned those crash barriers were safe for use on Leppings
            Lane terrace?    A. At the normal factors of safety which
            one expects to have.     Nothing can be absolutely safe.

       Q.   In your statement you have indicated what, by some post
            tragedy experiments and calculations, you have worked out to
            be the loading on barrier 124(a) which is the barrier which
            collapsed.   You have come to some calculated force, have
            you not?   A. No, Sir, not for 124(a).

       Q.   Please explain.  The experimets and calculations which
            we did related to the two barriers which visually deformed,
            you can see it, but did not collapse.

       Q.   Were they   in pen four?   A. Yes.

       Q.   That led you to the ocncl us io n that the force needed to
             produce that deform at io n was 9 k/N/m?  A. On one of the
             barriers 9 k/N/m, which is 50% above the test load and
             which is 80% above the design load, and on the other one
             was l\ k/N/m, which is 25% above the test load and 50%
             above the design load.

       Q.   Putting it in a more homely way, assuming two people standing
            next to one another per metre length, would the force
            pressing them against the crash barrier be in the region
            of half a ton on each person?  A. Yes, on the stronger
            one of the two.

       Q.   That is the 9 k/N? A. The 9 k/N/m would be about        1,000 l b s .
            which is just under half a ton.

       Q.   Can I now turn to 1986     removal of barrier 144.  It was
            necessary, was it not,     in 1986, for your firm to consider
            whether the removal of     144 would leave a ground which was
            still safe to use?  A.     Yes.

       Q.   So that you could advise the club or the Officer      Working
             Party if you thought that it was unsafe to use?      A. Yes.

       Q.   Was there a positive conclu sio n in 1986 that the removal
             of 144 did indeed leave the ground safe to use?   A. The
             view that was put before the Work ing Party on the afternoon
      S D'
C 2                                            8


                                                                  W. EASTWOOD

                   of 7th August or whenever it was, by the police, was that
                   in their view the ground would be safer and that pen would
                   be safer with that barrier removed and it was at that
                   time.   This was a strongly held view, apparently. Prior
                   to that day we had not known of that view but I believe
                   it is recorded that the police had put forward that view
                   two or three months before to the club.

             Q.   Can you please refer to one of the plans which have been
                   prepared by Ralph Braid  Associates, which appear in a
                   plastic folder which show the lay-out of the crash barriers.
                   It is a drawing 1340/02, plan details of the central
                   pens. A . Yes.

             Q.    I have no doubt you could do this by reference to your drawings.
                   It is simply that it is convenient to me, I am afraid.  It
                   is the West Terrace plan, details of central pens.  I think
                   that there is a smaller version of it as well. Can I hold
                   my copy of this plan up for you to see and you will see that
                   I have shown on it in orange the barriers as they now are
                   in pen three, and I have also marked in the barrier which was
                   damaged, 124(a).  A. Yes.

             Q.   And in blue the other barriers in pen four,         and by a    red
                   line where 144 used to go. A. Yes.

             Q.   I want to take up with you the question of whether or not the
                   removal of 144 was causative, whether the removal of it was
                   a cause of 124(a) becoming damaged.    That is a matter which
                   was dealt with on Friday and I think that on Friday you
                   accepted the propos it ion that it is likely to have had so m e ­
                   thing to do with the damage to 124(a).    Do you remember
                   that?    A. I do remember.

             Q.Is that a view which is in fact a considered view       on your
                  part? A. When I gave the answer I was not looking at a
                  drawing   as I am now, Sir, and of course if you look at that
                  drawing   you will see that the part of the barrier which was
                  removed would not be applying load directly down to the
                  one which partially collapsed.

             Q.   It still leaves a very significant channel there in any
                  event, does it not. If 144 is present, can you see the
                  pencilled lines that I have drawn in?  A. Yes.

             Q.   Between what would be      the end of 144 and   the end        of the
                   central radial fence?      A. Yes.

             Q.   In your view once 144          was removed did it create a signific ant ly
                   increased risk of damage being done to any other barrier?
                   A. YeS. I think that the           one that was most in peril —
                   and u n f o rt un at el y we have not got the numbers of the barrier
                   on here and so I cannot say the number.           Not the one that
                   failed but the one on the row further back was the one which
                   now had to take the increased load.

             Q.   At the left-hand    end of the barrier.     There is a         larger

            version,   136(a).   A. That one is 136(a)?

       Q.   Yes.  A. My Lord, the barrier 136(a) would obviously take
            more load when this one was taken out because people coming
            through here would be pressing on it, but you will see that
            136(a) was in effect shielding this from the pressures in
            that direction.

                   LORD JUS TI CE TAYLOR: Which one was shielding it?
            A. That one was shielding this from pressure coming from
            t h e r e , where the barrier was taken out.

       Q.   Can I just   be told where       I read the numbers?

                MR. MAXWELL: On the larger version of the plan,              at the
            left-hand end of the marking.

                LORD JUS TI CE TAYLOR:       Yes,    I have got it.   Thank you.

                MR. MAXWELL: Dr. Eastwood, given that 144 was removed,
            as indeed it was, its absence then creates a channel, does
            it not, that leads vertically down by the side of the
            central radial fence as far as barrier 125?  A. Is that
            barrier 125?

       Q. Barrier 125 is the ri ght-hand            one of the two on the front
           row   A . Yes.




                                             /Q.    And that vertical channel
                                            W. EASTWOOD


And that vertical channel would itself be available to provide
some relief of any additional pressured caused by people
coming into pen 3, would not it? - A. I think to talk in
terms of relief of pressure;  the redistribution of
pressure.

Very well.   If barrier 144 was present then by its presence it
may have caused people to stop either by choice, if that was
the place they wanted to be to watch, or to be stopped by it
because it. was an obstruction? - A. Yes, that I think was the
view expressed by the Police when they asked for it to be
removed.

Are you able to assist on this.  Given that there was such an
obstruction and people gathering there, if 144 had been
present and a large number, hundreds, suppose, of people
coming coming down the tunnel, would the problem of accident
simply have been thrown back into the tunnel area itself? - a.
Well, certainly it would have perhaps been transferred to the
barrier 144.  The pressures would have been there.

One more matter if I may with regard to the barriers, and it
deals with the corrosion.  The worse corrosion found was under
the level of the concrete, was not it? - A. I don't think that
is so, sir, no.  There was serious corrosion of the ends of
tubes where they were hidden by the clips, and the corrosion
below the level of the concrete was not so severe as to be in
my view if there was nothing worse on the site I would not
hesitate to have the load on those barriers tomorrow, if there
was nothing worse on the site.  It was getting to a stage
where in a few years it might start to have a less than proper
factor of safety, but the amount of metal lost below the
concrete, where it was worst it had been made good by plating,
and where it had not been made good by plating there was still
an adequate amount of steel left there.

You say there was significant corrosion above ground level,
but it was hidden from view? - A. No, there was corrosion
within the concrete at what was the original deck level, and
the steel had obviously been wetted there and rusted before
the new concrete was put on in 1966, we are guessing.   Now,
that corrosion further down it appeared had been noticed by
the engineers acting at that time, and they had added
plates to the legs which were most corroded before
embedding them in the new concrete.  Where they had not put
the plates then there was still plenty of steel left to
take the forces.  Since 1966 there has been a modest amount
of corrosion at the new surface level where there is
moisture from the concrete step and air, and there is the
beginnings of corrosion there, but not such as to be
dangerous.  The dangerous corrosion was under the clips.

Where it was hidden from view? -A. Yes.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Presumably, Dr. Eastwood, because
of the construction it would be likely in the mind of an
engineer that although you could not see it there would be
,7^

                                                            W. EASTWOOD


           corrosion under those clips? - A. Yes, and one expects that to
           be shown up by the test load, sir, as it was on various
           occasions through the 9 years that tests were carried out.

      Q. So you are saying you would not need any extra test to see
         whether there was corrosion not visible under the clips? - A.
         We were relying on the test load, s i r , which is an overload,
         which I believed at the time was reasonable.     Now I don't,
         having seen what can happen without one knowing about i t .

      Q.    What else could you do to test it? - A. Just take the barrier
           apart, sir.

      Q. Take the clip off? - A. And rebuild it.

      Q. Taking the clip off is not a major, not a rebuild, quite? - A.
         If you are taking it off you would rebuild.  Each time we took
         a clip off we rebuilt the whole joint by putting a new section
         of tube there and so on.  When I say "each time", each time we
         found corrosion.

      Q.        MR. MAXWELL:   Dr. Eastwood, I move on now to crowd
           capacity.  You originally proposed a capacity for the Leppings
           Lane terraces of 7,200, did not you? - A. Yes.

      Q. And that was calculated, was not it, on the premise that the
         barriers either were or would be made, by virtue of some
         additional barriers, that they would be adequate in strength
         and spacing? - A. Yes.

      Q.    You have heard the criticisms made of the barriers as far as
           strength and spacing are concerned.  Do you see that in 1979
           there was any reason to suppose you would come to a different
           view, taking account of these criticisms? Was there anything
           you have heard caused you to change your mind? - A. No, sir.
           No.  I believe that with the greater number of barriers, the
           strengthening which was carried out, the reduction of 1,000 in
           the capacity, I believe absolutely that if the number of
           people in those pens had been controlled to the 5.4/sq. m,
           reduced somewhat in 1979 by a percentage because of the lack
           of gangways, that if there had been the 5.4 people per sq. m
           it was a very reasonable and good layout.

      Q. In 1987 you prepared another plan, a ground plan, which gave
         details of the capacities in the pens.  Do you recall that
         plan? - A. Would you just give me the number?

      Q. I think it is 8945/1A.

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Whose plan is this?

                MR. MAXWELL:   It is in Dr. Eastwood's statement, sir.

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        It is not one of Braid &
           Associates?.

                MR. MAXWELL:   No, sir, it is an Eastwood plan, and it is

     at page 209 of Dr. Eastwood’s documents.-

Q. Have you got that, Dr. Eastwood? - A. Yes.

Q. And it was drawn in April 1987, and it rather looks as though
   it was sent off to the Football League in association with
   their local plan? - A. Yes.

Q. On it you show for the central pens, or for each of the pen
   areas, a figure for the number of away fans, away fans,
   sterile area, and home fans? - A. That is so.

Q. You made the point to the Inquiry on Friday that such numbers
   are meaningless unless there is some method of monitoring the
   numbers at the point of entry? - A. That is so.

Q. Are they also meaningless if the fans having come through the
   point of entry they are then free to move about? - A. if the
   fans are free to move about and there is no means of counting
   how many people are in there at any time, they are
   meaningless.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Can you just remind me - I may
     have been told before - what are the red figures 1, 4, 3, 2
     about, on the plan I have got? - A. That is the order, sir in
     which the radial barriers were put in. Nos. 1 and 2 were put
     in together, and then 3 and 4 later.

Q.        MR. MAXWELL:   Were they put on simply to assist this
     Inquiry? They are not part of the original plan, are they? -
     A. I believe, sir, in the text of my statement we refer to the
     radial fences 1 and 2 having been put in in 1981 and so on.
     We used those numbers in my statement.

Q. You were asked by Mr. Collins various questions about breaches
   or nonconformity with the Green Guide? - A. Yes.

Q. And the way in which the questioning began was to refer you
   to the conditions of the general ground safety certificate,
   which is condition 15(1), which provides that the holder
   shall at all times maintain all structural parts of the
   stadium in sound order and to the appropriate and relevant
   standards in the Guide.  You find that in the core bundle
   at 113. -A. Yes.

Q. 15(1), and it was suggested to you that that would mean only
   this, that the holder had to comply with those specific
   standards laid down in the Green Guide.  What I want to take
   up with you is this.  Looking at the reference to the
   appropriate and relevant standards do you understand that as
   allowing introduction of the idea of flexibility in the
   application of the Green Guide standards or not? - A. I
   interpret the Green Guide in total, and there is the clause
   which says that departures from this Guide may be appropriate
   and that the guidelines are not mean to be a substitute for
   professional judgment and common sense, and I believe this is
   a reference to the Guide as a whole, not individual
if

                                    13

         guidelines.     I may be wrong.

     Q. Thank you.  And certain of the specific points which were put
        to you, if I may deal with now.  First of all it was suggested
        that the exit doors should not have been sliding or roller
        shutter gates so as to comply with paragraph 65 of the Green
        Guide? - A. This is the 1976 version, is it?

     Q. No, this is the 1986 Green Guide:  "Sliding or roller shutter
        gates should not be used as exit doors". - A. We are post-1986
        now, are we? Would you give me the paragraph?

     Q. Paragraph 65.  Looking at gate C would that have been a
        problem to have had a gate which opened out and into a
        principal exit route,that is would it not have obstructed had
        it opened out into the area next to the river? - A. Yes.
        Could I first say I don't regard the word "sliding" as
        covering gate C.   It is a folding door is gate C.  It is a
        completely different kind.   To answer your question directly,
        sir, if the doors had been opening outwards then it would have
        obstructed outside.

     Q. I want only to ask you this now.   Towards the end of your
        evidence when being examined by Mr. Collins you accepted the
        proposition, "It looks as though the tunnel will have to be
        re-engineered".  What   facts have led you to that conclusion? -
        A. Not in order to satisfy any Guide.   Perhaps I should have
        considered just a little longer before replying and given a
        slightly longer answer.   It is one of the matters which will
        have to be considered.   There may be various aspects of the
        ground which in the light of experience something will have to
        be done about them, like, for example, the perimeter fence,
        and the club will no doubt be looking at all these matters,
        and the tunnel will be one of them, although in my view the
        tunnel does not transgress the guidelines.

     Q . Thank y o u .

               Cross-examined by MR. GIBSON-WATT:

Q. Dr. Eastwood, I understood from what you said to Mr.Collins
   on Friday that you had not seen a copy of the safety cert­
   ificate while youwere giving the certificates year by year
   which you gave for this ground.  Is that correct? - A. Yes.

Q. And I think you said you did not think that any consultant
   engineer would have seen the safety certificate when acting
   as your firm did in the normal course of events.   Is that
   right? -A. Not never seen the safety certificate because
   we saw when the first one was being issued what it was
   to contain and it would be normal for a consulting engineer
   to see it at that time, to ask to see it if he is not shown
   it and then I think it would be normal to expect the client
   to tell him if any subsequent changes were made.

Q. Right.  You of course act for, I think, four other
   football clubs with designated grounds besides Sheffield
   Wednesday.  Is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. And it is on that basis and with that experience you are
   saying that should in your view be the normal course of
   events? - A. That is the way in which we have worked.

Q. Right.  Were you in fact aware, did you have in mind when
   certifying, the specific terms of Clause 24 of the safety
   certificate? You will find it on page 114 of the com­
   posite bundle. - A. I have read that clause now, sir.

Q.   Yes. What I wanted to prompt you on is this.   It is
     quite a long clause.  If you did not actually have a
     copy of it while certifying it is perhaps difficult
     for you to have kept its specific terms in mind? - A.
     I did not quite hear, please.   Would you ;Iik

Q.   Yes. You told us you did not   have a copy of the safety
     certificate? - A. I have on my files a copy of the original
     safety certificate.

Q. And therefore you would have been able to refer to Clause 24
   when giving your certificate if you had wanted to? - A. Yes.

Q. I see.  Thank you.  And the position really is this, and I
   do not intend it as a criticism of you, rather than follow
   the wording of Clause 24 you issued what amounted to a
   certificate of good health for the structural parts of the
   stadium? - A. Yes.

Q. And if the Council had thought or complained that that was
   an inadequate certificate and did not comply with Clause 24
   they could have come back to you or to the club and said
   so? -A. Indeed.

Q. And they never did? - A. No.

              Cross-examined by MR. KALLIPETIS:

Q. Dr. Eastwood, would you be kind enough, please, to have in
   front of you the 86 Guide? - A. Thank you.

Q. Paragraph 113, please.  As far as the Leppings Lane
   terraces are concerned, pens 3 and 4 particularly, there
   are no gangways as I understand it.  Is that right? - A.
   That is so.

Q. And the construction of the radial fences means that
   there must be gaps between the crush barriers obviously?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Paragraph 115, please, D r . rEastwood. That provides,
   does it not, that the minimum gap should be 1.1 metres
   and the maximum 1.4? - A. That is so.

Q. Do any of the gaps in the crush barriers as you left
   them after you had completed your work before this semi-cup
   final comply with that paragraph? - A. I do not know
   whether the word any of them, but there are various ones
   which do not and it is with good reason.   When there are
   no gangways, gangways being set lower than the general
   terrace so that people will be discouraged at least from
   standing in them, it is fairly easy for people to move down
   from the back towards the front.  If we had gaps between
   barriers within these limits of 1.1 and 1.4 metres   it
   would be very likely that the gaps between them would be­
   come obstructed.  You get a group of three or four people
   coming together, two of them can stand behind the barrier
   and their two mates perhaps stand to one side, and before
   very long your gap has become blocked.   For this reason,
   therefore, it would be more appropriate once the decision
   has been taken that gangways cannot reasonably be provided
   proper gangways with depressed steps, it then becomes
   reasonable to have wider spaces.

Q. So are you saying that a positive decision was taken to
   ignore the guidelines in the Green Guide and to make all
   the gaps wider than was recommended? -A. I am not sure
   that they are all wider, but the wider gaps, the reasoning
   was as I have just put forward.  It will be realised
   that these matters were discussed over ....

Q. Yes.  Forgive me, Dr. Eastwood? interrupting you. My
   question was was there a positive decision taken?- A.
   The answer must be yes, after a lot of discussion.

Q. And was that decision taken by you? - A. No, no, no.  I
   have not taken any decision on any aspect of this ground.
   The working party makes the decision.  Normally I am not
   there when it makes it and if I am there, as happened on
   one or two of the earlier occasions, I have no vote.

                                                           W.   EASTWOOD


      Q. Leaving aside the fact you may not have been there when
         decisions were taken I believe you accept that your input
         to the working party was giving advice? - A. Indeed.

     Q. Did you give advice that the gaps between the barriers
        should be larger than was recommended in the Guide? - A.
        Yes.

     Q. Is that minuted anywhere? - A. I do not think so because
        the discussions were wideranging with many, many matters
        being discussed at each meeting and, in the end, whatever
        is generally concluded like adopting the layout in a
        certain plan that is what happened.  That is where the
        minute appears.  When my plan of these barriers was
        accepted that is the minute.

     Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I suppose a gangway is a
          safety measure, is it? - A. It is indeed, sir, if you
          can construct them so that people cannot stand in them.
          In other words, you depress them below the general level
          of the terrace.

     Q. I follow.     But it is a safety measure? - A. It is a safety
        measure.

     Q. Likewise, the limitation of these gaps is a safety measure?
        - A. Indeed, sir.

     Q. Does not what you have just said come to this, that because
        it was practically impossible to have one safety measure
        one therefore abandoned another as well?- A. Abandoned it
        but with a layout of crush barriers and the terrace which
        is accepted as being appropriate in the circumstances.

     Q. Well, I am sorry.  I do not understand what that last
        answer means. -A. Using professional judgment and common
        sense.

     Q. Making the best .... - A. Making good.

     Q ..... of the job?-A. Making the best of it, sir, is not
         good enough.   It has to be good when it is finished.

     Q-        MR. KALLIPETIS:    Would not more gaps have been a
          safer option, gaps which complied with the Green Guide
          guidelines? More expensive, of course, Dr. Eastwood, but
          surely safer? - A. Safety has many aspects and if the gaps
          are such that they become choked by people then that in
          itself can lead to some danger, so one is balancing whether
          it is better to be slightly wider.    It has to be kept in
          mind as part of the picture the rows of barriers are closer
          together by some 20 per cent.   This is an important point,
          sir.   These barriers could have been in rows 3.9 metres
          apart.   On average they are 3.2.  Tljls means that there is -
          whatever - 16 per cent extra strength there which can

            therefore take care of any extra pressure which comes
            from the opening higher up the back and that was a part
            of the picture.

         Q. Dr. Eastwood, my question was whether it would be safer
            to have more gaps which did comply with the Green Guide.
            - A. I do not think so in these circumstances.

         Q. Did you consider that and disregard it as an option? - A.
            Oh, yes.

         Q. And where is that minuted, please, Dr. Eastwood?-A. I
            considered it.  I do not write minutes when I consider
            something at the drawing board.

         Q. Did you impart your consideration to anybody? - A. Oh, yes

         Q. To whom? - A. These layouts were discussed at great length
            in the working party.

         Q. I want to be certain what you are saying. Dr. Eastwood.
            Are you saying that you said in the working party that
            these gaps did not comply with the Green Guide, secondly,
            that you had considered having more gaps which did comply
            with the Green Guide but thirdly, taking all things into
            consideration, thought it was safer to have larger gaps
            but fewer of them.  Is that what you are saying? -A. No.
            If you would repeat each of those points one after the
            other I will ....

         Q. Are you saying to the«working party that you said to the
            working party the gaps in the barriers as I have designed
            it do not comply with the Green Guide? “ A. Yes.

         Q. When?- A. Oh, in introducing ....

         Q. When? - A. Whichever meeting I first produced this plan to

         Q. You cannot be more precise than that? - A. No, no.     It is
            10 years ago.

         Q. Yes, but you have not come unprepared for this Inquiry,
            have you, Dr. Eastwood? You have not come unprepared for
            this Inquiry? - A. However well I tried to prepare I am
            sure I would not be able to tell you at which meeting we
            specifically discussed barriers as distinct from entrances
            and so on.

         Q. Very well.  The second question I asked you was whether
            you said to the working party that you had considered
            having more gaps which did comply with the Green Guide?
            - A. To use exactly those words I think it unlikely but
            the gaps themselves w e r e ,discussed and it is quite likely
            that I or somebody else might have used words very similar

         Q. And quite likely that you did not? - A. I think that very

                                                             W.   EASTWOOD


           unlikely.

      Q.    I see.  The third one was that you had considered all
           these matters and on the balance of thecconsideration
           you decided to have larger gaps which did not comply
           with the Green Guide.  Did you say that to the working
           party? - A. I put forward these larger gaps and the
           working party were informed they do not comply with the
           Green Guide.

      Q. You see, the difficulty, Dr. Eastwood, is this, is not it,
         that under paragraph 226 if the gaps do not comply with the
         Green Guide then the calculation upon which you have been
         operating of 5.4 is in fact incorrect? - A. Are we talking
         about 1979 or 1986?

      Q. I asked you to have the 86 Guide in front of you. - A. Yes.
         It must be kept in mind that these decisions were taken in
         1979.

              anything       I said      that     n i gh t    was    possibly        a little         unbalanced.

         Q.   So you did say it,              Dr.    Eastwood?               A.      It     is   quite        likely

             more     precise.

        Q.   Yes,    number     two.     A.    Yes.

        Q.   Forgive       me   but we are      talking      about     the   barrier?        A.    Yes.

        Q.   And th e h o r i z o n t a l bar?          A. Yes, the h o r i z o n t a l bar.        The

                    The picture is not quite so bad as it might at first
                sight appear, that it is the fourth to sixth load test that
                you are applying. For much of that structure it is still
                the first three.  Having said that if this were taken as
                being the second three times of loading the recovery was
                76% and it passes if it is more than 75%.

           Q.   Forgive me, I am looking at photograph page 59(a) of your
                bundle, which is the ap paratus what you designed to
                test the barriers. It may be my mistake but I understood
                that the purpose of that machine was to apply pressure
                to two ho rizontal bars at the same time, is that not right,
                the same pressure? A. That is so, yes.

           Q.   The same pressure?  A. If they are of different lengths it
                will be obviously a different load.

           Q.   But you only measured the left-hand one as we look at that
                photograph, which is barrier number one. A. Yes, the
                de flection was only measured on barrier number one, horizontal
                rail number one.

           Q.   You then move the apparatus           along to test the middle
                 horizo ntal bar?  A. Yes.

           Q.   And number three, which is at the right-hand             side of the
                photograph?  A. Yes.

           Q.   You then report the movement           for the first time on the middle
                bar? A. That is so.

           Q.   That middle bar has been subjected           to three pressure      loads
                 already? A. Yes.

           Q.   Unrepo rt ed ?   A. Yes.

           Q. The first record, which is in fact the fourth testing, is only
               76% recovery, page 200?  A. Yes,  I will accept that figure.

           Q.   It is your figure, Dr. Eastwood.             A.   I accept   it is my
                 figure without looking it up.

           Q.   So you cannot say, can you, Dr.Eastwood, whether               or not had
                 the movement of that middle bar been recorded on the first
                 three loads, that it would have been successful in passing
                 the test?  A. With a fair degree of c e r t a i n t y , y e s .

           Q.   It just happens to be the one that collapsed. A. With a
                 fair degree of certainty, yes.  The first time of loading
                 they only have to recover 50%.  There is argument as to
                 how that 50% is measured, but that is what it is, not 75%.
                 On the second three cycles of loading it has to be 75 and
                 it was 76.  Whilst there is a gap it is fairly sure, fairly
                 certain, that those barriers would have passed.

           Q.   The    c om bi na ti on   of the wider gaps than in the Green Guide,
                 the   po sitioning       of the barriers, and the testing on the

                                                               W. EASTWOOD

              barrier that failed, if one looks at the plan it is plain
              to see, is it not, Dr. Eastwood, that the gap through which
              people coming through the tunnel can enter immediately is
              6.3 metres according to the A-G plan 6.3 met res ,t he y have
              an immediate gap in front of them in excess of two metres,
              or if they go to the middle gap they have 2.325 metres.
              Both of those gaps are greatly in excess of the recommended
              gap ac cording to the Green Guide.    The first barrier they
              come against is the one for which there is an innacuratte
              test and an uncertain one, and that is the one that collapses.
              A. As part of the picture the spacing between barrier 124(a)
              and 136 is signifi ca nt ly less than permitted by the guide
              so that it has spare capacity to take account of any extra
              pressure coming through that gap.     That is an important
              consideration.

         Q.   Are you saying that the gap between 124(a) and 125 was
              deliber at el y made smaller?  A. No, I am sorry, I have not
              made myself clear.     The gap between 124(a) and 136, the gap
              going up the slope, all these barriers, the barriers are on
              average about 16% closer together than they need to be.

         Q.   That would be a good point but for the fact that the steps
              are already wider than permitted in the Green guide.
              —  A. No, they are the ideal spacing.

         Q.   The width of the steps?       A. They are   ideal.

         Q.   I am going   by the Ralph Braid Associ ate s     plan.

                   LORD JUS TI CE TAYLOR:    The Green Guide is?

         Q.   MR. KALLIPETIS: Pa ragraph 92, "A terrace step should not
               be less than 280 m.m. or more than 380 m.m. wide.   The
               preferred dimension is between   355 and 380"-  A. Yes.
               I have never seen this Braid drawing.   I am at a great
               disadvantage.

         Q.   The drawing is immaterial, Dr. Eastwood, it is the width
               of the step that matters, is it not.       Did you consider the
               width of the step in giving your ce rti fic ate to the capacity
               of the ground for the Safety Certific ate ?     A. Yes, and my
               re co ll ec ti on is that the step widths are about 380 m.m.

         Q.   If the plan is accurate that is not quite right, is it.
               They vary, 3 9 0 . — you can see for yourself, there is no
               need to go through them all.      Some are 380 but not all of
               them are, are they?     A. Please, I do not know.   I have
               not got those figures in front of me but we made m e a s u r e ­
               ments at the time.

              LORD JUS TI CE TAYLOR: Have you not got this         plan?   A. No,
              I have never seen that drawing of Braid's.

         Q.   Forgive me, I thought you had been referred           to it earlier.
              A. It is the same drawing, is it?

         Q.   It is.   It is on the extreme right.        A.   I have never seen

                    drawing. (Another drawing handed)

              Q.   MR. K A L L I P E T I S : You will see that the average in any event
                   is in excess of the Green Guide?            Yes, 385.

              Q.   And the critical steps between barriers 136, 136(a) and
                   124(a) which collapsed, and 125, apart from the first one,
                   which is 337, none of them are within the Green Guide-line.
                   A. Can I ask which section of the terrace these steps
                   were measured.

              Q.   You can ask me but I cannot      answer.

                       LORD JU STICE TAYLOR: This section on the line of the
                   tunnel.  A. So it is the wrong section.

              Q.   MR. KALLIPETIS: I am sorry.    A. These are measured on the
                    line of the tunnel it says which is not on the line of the
                    critical barriers.   Can I also respond that we are dealing
                    here in millimetres.   The average tread with is 385 m.m.,
                    that is unbalanced because at the bottom there is a 441 which,
                    of course, is not a step at all, it is the trough at the bottom.
                    If that 441 is taken into account that 441 is 60 m.m. over
                    the 380 and as there are 30 steps that alone puts the average
                    up by 2m.m. and so the average comes down to 383 m.m.    The
                    preferred width of step includes 380.    We cannot make concrete
                    to that accur acy of 3 m.m., this step width is as near as no
                    matter the ideal step width.

              Q.   If you do not accept the me as ur eme nt on the plan, Dr. Eastwood,
                   and it is you that gave the Cer tif ic at e of Safety to this
                   ground, are you saying that you measured the step treads
                   between the two critical barriers?      A. At that time we
                   me asured steps and I do not know which.

              Q.   Which time?   A. At the time of doing our original        report
                    on the ground we me asured tread widths.

              Q.   Where is the record of that mea su re me nt ? A. I cannot be
                   sure whether we shall still have it.      It is a long time
                   ago and the notemb ooks may or may not be present in our
                   office but we can look.   They were measured and if you
                   put a tape on the top of the step you find it is 380 m.m.
                   plus or minus the width of your finger nail; it is that
                   kind of order with the slight variations that you inevitably
                   get in concrete.   380 is regarded as ideal.     What is the
                   difference between that and 383?

              Q.   Certai nly not 400. A. One step is shown here        asbeing    400
                    which of course is nearly an inch w i d e r .



                                          /Now at 380 is ideal
                              29

                                                   W. EASTWOOD


     Now, at 380 is ideal.  It would not be using professional
     judgment and common sense to say that one step of 400, 20mm
     greater, in the whole length is creating any danger.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I d o n ’t know where you get the 380
     being ideal.  What the Guide says, rightly or wrongly, is the
     preferred dimension is between 355 and 380. - A. I am sorry.
     I was not reading.  The preferred dimension.

Q. So 380 is the ceiling? - A. The ceiling, yes, sir.      But at 380
   it would be within the preferred range.

Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS:   It would be the end of the preferred
     range, Dr. Eastwood? - A. The end of the preferred range, and
     it is 3 mm more on average.

Q. So the summary is this.  The gap immediately in front of the
   tunnel entrance is considerably larger than that preferred,
   the gaps between the barriers d o n ’t conform to the Green
   Guide, the testing of the barrier is defective as regards the
   barrier that collapsed and the width of the steps between the
   two sections of barriers don't conform with the Green Guide?

            MR. TOULSON: Well, sir, if it is a question all those
     separate ingredients have been discussed individually.  If it
     is a general roll up comment it is more appropriate later.   If
     he wants an answer to each part he had better put them in each
     par t .

            MR. KALLIPETIS:   I thought I had got an answer to each
     par t , although I have summarised i t .

          MR. TOULSON:    Then there is no need for the question.

Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS:   The question is this, Dr. Eastwood.  In
     view of those circumstances do you still think it was right
     and do you still think it is right to say this ground is
     perfectly safe for the numbers for it was assigned? - A. I
     believe that this ground was very safe on that day, that
     there is possibly no safer ground than that day, if the
     spectators had been properly controlled.

Q. Thank you. - A. And I say that with experience of working on
   many grounds.

                   Cross-Examined by MR. GLASGOW:

Q. Dr. Eastwood, can you help me first with the 1981 incident,
   because I think you have told the Inquiry that your
   understanding was that had been overcrowding at the extreme
   edges rather than in the centre? - A. That is my
   understanding.

Q. Could we look at the only documents we have on that, Dr.
   Eastwood.  Would you take the core bundle, unless I ask
   otherwise, and I w o n ’t need any of the drawings, so you can
   fold them up. - A. What page on the core bundle?
                             30

                                                  W. EASTWOOD



Q. Start in the core bundle at page 139.  Perhaps we should take
   them in order.  I apologise.  Perhaps 136 first to see the
   origins of it.   186 you will see is a report to the Assistant
   Chief Constable from the Superintendent in charge of the
   ground at that time.  Would you look at the second paragraph
   on page 136, where he says:

        "I have acquainted him” (the club secretary) ” with all
        our efforts to move the Spurs fans into the less densely
        packed central part of the terracing and of the use of
        the public address system” .

   Firstly, does that accord with your understanding? 136 is the
   initial Police report, the second paragraph.  Does that accord
   with the understanding you had acecdotally of what had gone,
   that the Police were trying to move people from the densely
   packed wings into the centre? - A. The picture as I understand
   is that the tunnel was not used because of the well known
   problem that in front of the tunnel there is excessive
   density, and that this experiment involved the spectators
   coming in from the two corners.  Unfortunately, it did not
   work.  Although there is a natural tendency to migrate to the
   centre of the terrace because of the better viewing....

Q. Dr. Eastwood, I can cut you short.  I d o n ’t think it is your
   fault, but some surprise was registered at your suggestion
   that it was your understanding of the 1981 incident that the
   overcrowding had been in the wings, and I wanted your help to
   see whether or not the contemporaneous....

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      I think it has been clear to us
   all all through.

        MR. GLASGOW:   If that is right, sir, then I think Mr.
   Collins put, "Was it not the central area that was
   overpacked", and with great respect I think that was wrong.

        MR. COLLINS:    If I did put that, and the transcript will
   no doubt say that I did, then I did not mean to.   The only
   surprise I was expressing was Dr. Eastwood’s belief that the
   central tunnel had been closed off.   That was the only thing I
   expressed surprise a t .

        MR. GLASGOW:    My misunderstanding.    I w o n ’t press it:

Q. Of course, Dr. Eastwood, as ;we now know the radial fences
   were installed to deal with or to attempt to deal with the
   understanding of the problem that had arisen with distribution
   at that date? - A. Yes.

Q. Am I right in thinking it is your belief that the purpose of
   those radial fences had been explained to everybody at the
   time when they were installed? - A. I c a n ’t say that, no.   One
   would expect so, but I c a n ’t say that was my understanding.

Q. As late as 1985 the plans which you drew up for segregation at
                            31


                                                 W. EASTWOOD


   the Leppings Lane entrances were aimed at and had as their
   sole object segregation of fans rather than allocation to
   pens, did not they? -A. Segregation of home and away
   supporters you mean?

Q. Yes. - A. That was the starting point from the point of view
   of the club.

Q. I accept that, but did there ever come a point after that
   starting point when you explained to the club, whatever
   discussions you may have had with the local authority, that it
   was also of prime importance that that plan be adopted in
   order to have numbered capacity allocations to the pens? -A. I
   d o n ’t believe I used words like "prime importance” . Obviously
   I felt that this was a good thing to be doing, but I was not
   foreseeing the disaster that has occurred.

Q. Of course I accept that, Dr. Eastwood.  I just wanted to see
   whether or not you thought it had been in the minds of your
   clients that pen segregation as distinct from fan segregation
   outside was of any importance in 1985? -A. Oh, I d o n ’t think I
   had a monopoly of being concerned about segregation into pe n s .
   The club did appreciate the advantage.

Q. Yes.  Would you like to go to 208 of the bundle and help us.
   I think you were there at 208 in April 1985 explaining to the
   then South Yorkshire County   Council what the    object of the
   scheme was, and your very first sentence is:

        "The club is anxious to segregate the visiting tea m ’s
        supporters as they enter the ground"?

   That was the object of the scheme, was not it? - A. Yes, I am
   sure that was the starting point.

Q. But again, did there come a        time when you said to the club
   words to the effect, "Never      mind segregation    of fans.What
   you have got to bear in mind is the importance on pen capacity
   limitation"? - A. I c a n ’t say I honestly say I stressed to the
   club that this was a prime thing that must be done.     What I
   was saying to the club was I believed this would have great
   advantages and would get rid of most of the problems.

Q. Yes.  The scheme that was ultimately adopted, your Mark II
   scheme, and I entirely accept a geared down version of what
   you wanted to do, geared down at the request of the club, did
   not provide for any segregation between pen allocations, did
   it? - A. There was segregation by the wall which runs across
   the yard, so that if you like the northern part of the pens
   could be separated from the central and southern.

Q. Yes, we understand that, but that wall again was all part and
   parcel of the all important segregation of potentially warring
   fans? - A. Segregation, that is so.

Q. I think you know that within approximately a year of that
   scheme coining into effect by late 1986, the Police had decided
                                 32


                                                     W. EASTWOOD


         it was better to have complete segregation at that end of the
         ground, and no home supporters there at all? - A. I did not
         know that the Police had decided that, no.

    Q. Did you not know there came a time when so far as the club and
       the Police were concerned the wall was no longer serving a
       useful purpose? - A. I was not informed, but I can well
       understand.  I know there has been no game since that time
       when that wall would have been fulfilling its purpose.  There
       has not been a game since that time with the fans segregated
       at that end, since the Liverpool game in 1986.

    Q. You will appreciate when I say "you” I am talking about
       your practice. - A. Yes.

^   Q. Not necessarily you individually.  Your practice certainly
       knew and advised about the use of A-G turnstiles as being the
       sole entrance for the terraces, did not it? - A. Not as far as
       I know.

    Q. I think in fact - help me if I am wrong - you drawing
       illustrates the fact in your own bundle?   Would you take your
       own bundle just for a moment and go to the most recent drawing
       we have at page 208.  It is unnumbered in my bundle, but it
       comes after the letter of August, 1988, which is 206 and 207.
       Very close to the back, two letters back from the last bundle
       of plants.  The big bunch of plans at the back.  If you just
       flip two documents back from the envelopes. - A. Yes, the
       reduced plan.

    Q. Can we look at that plan together.   That apparently was drawn
       by your practice in April this year.   It has the legend, "For
       the use of the turnstiles” in the top left-hand corner.   The
       North Stand is 1-10, the West Stand are the 6 gates to the
       left of that with the number of persons, and then A-G is the
       West terrace? -A. Yes.

    Q. And the wall, Dr. Eastwood, is marked with its increased
       capacity, and the legend beside it, "Gate open". - A. Yes.

    Q. It is apparent, is it not - does that help to clarify your
       memory - that certainly the practice was aware in this year at
       the very latest that the scheme for the entrance to the
       terraces was that everybody comes in through A-G and the gate
       in the wall is kept open so that some can be directed to the
       North-West terrace? - A. That is obviously so, yes.

    Q. It really boils down to this, does not it, that you cannot now
       recall any discussions you had about that new scheme? - A. I
       c a n ’t recall any discussions that I had. In this context I
       have asked my counsel to raise an answer I gave on Friday
       which I would like to change, butI was not aware of this
       view.

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   How do you mean, to raise an
         answer you would like to change?   Which answer is that? - A.
         On Friday, sir, I was asked if i had known that the gap was
                             33


                                                 W. EASTWOOD


     open where it says "Gate open", and that the spectators were
     going through those 7 turnstiles and spreading everywhere,
     would I have been concerned, and I said, "Yes".  Of course, I
     would not be concerned except in a game where that wall was
     meant to segregate fans, and I gave the wrong answer.

Q.        MR. GLASGOW:   Of course. - A. And I have asked my
     counsel to raise that in re-examination.

Q.   Perhaps we can clarify it now if it helps, Dr. Eastwood.   The
     importance of that gate being closed, if the gate was to
     remain, only had relevance when the wall was being used for
     the purpose for which it was designed, namely segregation?
     -A. Yes, that is so, and I am sorry I gave the wrong answer
     on Friday.

Q. As far as I am concerned there was no criticism.  I simply
   wanted to refresh your memory that there must have been some
   discussion with you or Mr. STrange or the practice about the
   new layout at that end of the ground? -A. Yes.

Q.   And that perhaps you were overstating the case, with respect,
     when you said in answer to my friend, Mr. Muller, for the Fire
     Service, that you were kept in the dark about the new layout
     and the use of that end? - A. Indeed, yes.

Q. I won't put it further.  As to the question of capacity to the
   terrace as a whole, I think I am right in saying that shortly
   after Mr. Mackrell took over at the end of 1986, if that helps
   you, October and November 1986, he did ask his staff to
   clarify what the position in respect of terrace capacity was.
   Do you remember that? - A.  It is quite likely.  Mr. Mackrell
   is very careful.

Q. The particular point I wanted, Dr. Eastwood, was that Mr.
   Mackrell wanted to know two things, did he not?     (1) whether
   or not the old certificate still held good, and (2) whether or
   not he was right to be viewing that terrace as having a total
   capacity of 10,200? Do you remember the points being raised
   and you trying to help him with it? - A. I d o n ’t recall, but
   this was in a meeting. I do remember very shortly after Mr.
   Mackrell came having a meeting with him, and it is possible at
   that meeting this question was raised.   I would be a little
   surprised if I had been able to tell him that the original
   certificate still held.

Q.    Look at 188 of your bundle. That may help you.   188 you did
     look at before, but this is well into the new regime in April,
     1987, and it is Mr. Mackrell himself 'phoneing, and I think
     Mr. Strange’s handwriting but ticked by you at the top.   Am I
     right? W.E. tick at the top? -A. Yes.

Q.    And the    very first point     is:  "He can't find any amendments
     the original safety certificate.   Do I know if any exist?"
     "Not that I have seen".  Does that help you?    Mr. Mackrell
     thinks that he did, as appears from that note specifically
     raise with you his concern that it appeared to be a very old
                             34


                                                  W. EASTWOOD


     certificate and had it been amended? - A. He specifically
     raised with my firm this question, and it has obviously come
     as something of a surprise to us that there is doubt as to
     which safety certificate.

Q. Did it occur to you when he did raise that particular point
   with the firm and you saw this note that however surprising it
   may be nobody had got round to designating capacities for the
   pens and that we were still talking about the old 10,200
   unchanged? - A. Yes, I am sure we were surprised by this.   On
   the other hand there had been mention of the certificate on
   various occasions during the year since Sheffield City Council
   had taken over, and I suspect we thought the issuing of the
   new certificate was imminent.

Q. The point had been raised again by his secretary on behalf of
   Mr. Mackrell with you at page 178 of the bundle, if it is easy
   to go back, had not it? - A. yes, that was at about the same
   time.

Q.   That was in February? - A. Within a few days.

Q.    Well, it is a little earlier, Dr. Eastwood.  It is 26th
     February.   Page 178 of your own bundle. - A.Yes, I thought    it
     was a few days. In fact it is separated by 6 or 7 weeks.

Q. No criticism.  The third point here, and again we have looked
   at it before and forgive me for asking you again, but has any
   account been taken for alterations done at Leppings Lane? "Is
   the 10,200 or so figure still correct"?- A. Yes.

Q. Does that refresh your memory that at least Mr. Mackrell
   became concerned at the end of 1986 early 1987? - A. Indeed,
   yes.

Q. And his concern was about total capacity of terrace? - A. Yes.

Q. And whether or not there had been any designations? - A. Yes,
   quite correct.

Q. Because it is correct, Dr. Eastwood, however regrettable it
   may be, that by the time he took over the penning system had
   been in operation for many years without any solution having
   been found to numerical counting of the number of people who
   were going into them? - A. Indeed.

Q. Again, may be you c a n ’t deal with this but I would like you to
   try.  Would it be fair to say if any indication had been given
   to the club that this was a matter of safety which required
   attention, your experience of them had been such that they
   would have acted on your advice? - A. My experience of the
   club is that they were very careful to do the right thing.

Q. Perhaps you can help me in terms of general figures.  We can
   look at the precise work if necessary with the breakdown.  The
   years 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, those four years leading up to
   the tragedy, in the ground improvements which you assisted
                        35


                                              W. EASTWOOD


with would you be able to confirm that the total gross
expenditure on those was something in excess of £1.6 million
during that period?




                             /A. There is obviously.
i %
                                36


                                                       W.   EASTWOOD


        - A. There is obviously a grey area between ground improve­
        ment and improvement of safety.  I would have thought the
        total figure was more than 1.6 million.

      Q. Well, we can look at the precise figures if necessary.  I
         can tell you that what we have tried to extract out of that
         is anything other than improvements to the ground. - A. Yes.

      Q. In other words, all works on executive offices and that
         kind of thing stripped away and the test that we have
         employed and will employ is those works which qualify
         for a grounds improvement grant from the Trust and it
         would be right, would it not, to say that if the works
         qualify for an improvement grant from the Trust they
         must by definition be related to works calculated to
         safety and improvement of the ground for the ordinary
         spectators? - A. It is improvement and safety lumped
         together.  Both can qualify.

      Q. Yes.  And that has been a consistent pattern of spending
         over the years, certainly since Mr. Mackrell has been there?
         - A. Yes, yes.

      Q. And of course, for completeness, if the works qualify half
         of that is refunded by the Trust? - A. Yes.  I do not know
         the proportion but there is a grant.

      Q. So be it.  I think the last matter and I deliberately
         refrain from trespassing on anything that others have
         asked about and putting it doubly, Dr. Eastwood, is your
         understanding of the legal effect of this certificate
         and I am sorry to have to ask you one question about that
         but you have been asked to express your view on the law
         and I think, with respect, you got it wrong.  Let us look
         at the certificate, can we, at page 111 and 113 of the
         bundle? I think we can go straight to 113.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Glasgow, do not let me
        discourage you if I am wrong about this but does it
        matter what Dr. Eastwood's view of the law is? No doubt
        if what he says is wrong you can put me right.

             MR. GLASGOW:   It does not, sir.  Well, put it right
        would be too presumptuous but I shall offer you my sub­
        mission on it but what does matter is perhaps to Dr. Eastwood
        that I would have said, with respect, it is unfair to invite
        him as a lawyer to the conclusion his clients were acting in
        breach of a certificate if they were not.  Perhaps I can
        just put the one question on that:

      Q. Dr. Eastwood, it boils down to this really.  Did you believe
         that if the working party and the Council had given con­
         sideration to a matter of dimension or specification within
         the Green Guide and had decided upon it that you could
         lawfully act on that satisfaction of the Council whether or
                            37


                                                      W.   EASTWOOD


     not it complied with the technicalities of the Green code?
     - A. Yes.

Q.    May I give you one example?  I take it very shortly. It
     was within your knowledge that the width of the perimeter
     gates, rightly or wrongly, had been a conscious and
     deliberate decision of the certifying authority? - A. Yes.

Q. Had been discussed at some length and the two opposing
   views considered? - A. Yes.

Q. And they had decided in their wisdom that the gates should
   be less than the recommended guide? - A. Yes.

Q. They having expressed their satisfaction with that position,
   did you believe that the effect of the certificate was to
   override that satisfaction and to impose an absolute legal
   obligation on you and your clients? - A. I believed that
   the effect of a certificate was to ratify the decision to
   leave the gates.

Q.    And looking at paragraph 15 and the full context and the
     words that were omitted the last line with the words and
     in all cases to the satisfaction of the Council did you
     believe that if you had a decision, for example, on the
     width of the gate which was to the satisfaction of the
     Council that you could lawfully act on that satisfaction?
     - A. I did.

          MR. GLASGOW:   Excuse me one second.     Thank you
     very much, Dr. Eastwood.

                 Cross-examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Q. Dr. Eastwood, you held a continuing retainer from the club,
   did you not? - A. No, sir.  I was retained from time to time
   throughout this period.

Q. I see. - A. It would be wrong to say I had a continuing
   retainer.

Q. But there was no other consulting engineer acting on behalf
   of the club throughout this period, was there, in relation
   to these matters about which you have spoken? - A. No, no.

Q. And the appointment or your part begins by documentation
   by document page 7 in the bundle, 1st December, 1978,
   commissioned to act on our behalf in our dealings with
   the club, and that is indeed what you did? - A. Can I
   just come back, please, to your previous question?  There
   was another engineer employed on some works in the club
   during my period of office.

Q. Any of the works to which we have been giving our attention
   here? - A. No, no.

                                                     W.   EASTWOOD


Q. You acted throughout on the club's behalf in relation to
   these matters? - A. Yes.

Q. You have given evidence about the erection of the radial
   fences and they were first erected in 1981? - A. Yes.

Q. Following the 1981 semi-final? - A. Yes.

Q. At that time those fences were to be introduced to enable
   segregation of fans and you clearly understood that.  Is
   that correct? - A. Yes.

Q. And that segregation would facilitate the Police role? - A,.
   Yes.

Q. However, there were gates to be put in those radial fences?
   - A. Yes.

Q.And the purpose of those gates, I think we can see from your
   correspondence, was to give access for maintenance and
   policing of t|je game? - A. Yes.

Q.   .„We see that in your bundle of documents at page 69, 2nd
     September, 1981? - A. This is my bundle, sir, is it?

Q. Yes, it is.  Since you have it     and may be more familiar
   with it. - A. Yes.

Q. Than the general bundle.     Page 69.   2nd of September, 1981.
   - A. Yes.

Q. In that letter you envisage the gates being there and^their
   purpose to give access for maintenance and also policing
   during the game? - A. Yes.

Q. You did not contemplate, did you, that a Policeman would be
   there at the gate in all circumstances? - A. I did not at
   that time, no.

Q. No. And you were at that time advising the club in relation
   to the certificate and in relation to the modifications
   that were being proposed and had there been any necessity
   from the point of view of safety concerning the requirement
   of a Police Officer you would have said so? - A. No.

Q. Why not? -A. No. Whether a Police Officer is required I
   believe is not my judgment but that of the Police.

Q. But were you not saying earlier in your evidence that you
   regarded the control or manning by a Police Officer as
   very necessary were there to be radial fences? - A. It is
   not for me to take the decision but it is my view that it
   is important there should be a Police Officer in charge.

Q. Did you ever express that view in 1981? - A . No.
                            39


                                                   W.   EASTWOOD


Q. The provision of the radial fences would enable two things
   to happen.  It would enable the terrace to be divided up
   when there were fans of different persuasions wanting to
   use it? - A. Yes.

Q. And in those circumstances the radial gate would be closed?
   - A. Yes.

Q. However, when there was a situation contemplated of fans of
   the same persuasion being able to use the whole of the
   terrace those gates would be opened? - A. Yes.

Q. And in those circumstances, as you say at the bottom of
   page 69 in your letter of the 2nd of September, the gate
   could be left open but fastened back to connect the areas
   during a game if adjacent ones are occupied by the supp­
   orters of the same team? - A. Yes.

Q. You see, it is in relation to your assertion earlier in
   your evidence, if I can put it like that, there were
   constant assurances being given by the Police that the
   gates would be manned.  Do you follow? - A. I am not sure
   I used those words but my answer would be coloured by the
   response of South Yorkshire County Council to my letter, 2
   September, which is given on page 76 of my bundle.

Q. Yes. -   A. And item l<c).U'&fcem 1 is referring to these
   radial   barriers and the last item, 1(c), says that a con­
   dition   of them being put in is the new gates at the rear
   of the   terrace also being under Police control.

Q. So when you speak of constant assurances is this something
   you learnt from the South Yorkshire County Council or does
   it have some other source? - A. I am not sure of the words
   that I am said to have used but it was my understanding
   that where there was a gate these would be under Police
   control and that a Policeman would be told your gate is this

Q. Well, what did you envisage the Policeman doing at that gate

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well, we spent a good deal of
   Friday afternoon by Mr. Muller on this, did not we?

        MR. WOODWARD:    We did, sir, and that is partly why
   I am on my feet.

       THE WITNESS:  I envisage that a Policeman at that gate
  would be controlling undesirable movement of the crowd.   If
  more people were wanting to crowd into the central pen it
  would be very appropriate, even though the spectators were
  all from the same club and the gate open, that a Policeman
  should be there to stop people congregating in excessive
  numbers in the central pen.

Q. I suggest you put it higher than it was ever stated by any

     Police Officer concerning their role in relation to the
     gates.  May I refer you to what happened in 1987 when the
     question of radial gates was then again raised? -A. Yes.

Q. If we look in your bundle at page 179 there is a letter
   of the 2nd of March, 1987.  I beg your pardon.  The note
   of a telephone message.  Do you have that there, Dr.
   Eastwood? - A. Page 179?

Q. Yes. - A. The memo.

Q.   Yes.   The memo. - A. Yes.

Q.   Is this a memo of a telephone message or not? - A.        Yes, it
     is a memo of a telephone message, yes.

Q. And at item 3 it says.   Dr. Eastwood says leave the capacity
   at Leppings Lane as it is providing Police have gates under
   West Stand open so that people can distribute throughout
   the terraces evenly.   Do you follow? That was your response
   to a question that had been raised which I will come to
   again in a moment, but there you were saying of the gates
   provided they were open it was all right? - A. No,   that is
   not so. What I had in mind was exactly what happened on the
   day, that far too many people got into the central pen and I
   foresaw those two gates as being the safety valve which
   would permit people to be distributed out towards the two
   wings.  Now, I had in mind of course that there would be
   Police there because that is what I had understood but
   whether there were Police there or not it was important
   that the overcrowding in the central pen could be relieved.

Q. From the safety point of view insofar as it impinged upon the
   barrier below it, did you have any objection to the removal of
   that section? - A. Not sufficient to say it should not be
   done.

Q. Did you have any? - A. Whenever one takes out a piece of
   barrier one never says that that is not going to do any harm
   in any respect.  Obviously one has to consider it, and then in
   the end it is a matter of a balanced view being taken.

Q. Did you advocate any caution at the time of that proposed
   removal? - A. No.  Having considered it, no.

Q.   This resulted in effect in us having 136A and 136 barriers
     divided.  It was barrier 136 and it became 136 and 136A as a
     result of that cutting out? - A. Yes.  I should point out that
     I did very firmly resist taking out the other barriers which
     impinged on the radial fence.

Q. Which other barrier? -A. There is correspondence at that
   time....

Q. To which barrier does it relate, this correspondence? - A.
   Each of the barriers within the two pens which actually joins
   up to a radial fence.  Each of those, the Police wanted them
   taking out, and I kept saying "No".

Q.   Perhaps I d o n ’t need to pursue that with you, but the point is
     no objection or advice was tendered by you or given by you in
     relation to the removal of that central section? - A. I gave
     very careful consideration to every one of these crush
     barriers which impinged on the new radial fences, and
     obviously that one had to go or spectators would not have been
     able to get down to the lower part .

Q. Did you give any advice or not against it being done? - A. I
   am not sure what was said in discussion, but in writing, no,
   not that particular one.

Q. When it came to taking out the barrier above that at 144....

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Do think we might embark on that
     at 2 o'clock?

          MR. WOODWARD:     Yes, sir.

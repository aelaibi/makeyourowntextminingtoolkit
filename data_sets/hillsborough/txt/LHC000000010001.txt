                    HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY

      This information has been produced to acquaint members
of the progress that has been made to establish services in
the wake of the Hillsborough tragedy on Saturday 15th April,
1989 .

     From the outset, the Authorities most affected within
the North West Region (the core authorities) agreed to work
on a pan-Merseyside, pan-Agency basis, co-ordinating
the establishment of immediate, short term assistance and
planning a longer term, coherent response to events which
will likely effect thousands of people.  The planning and
provision of specialist and discreet services for these
'victims' on a multi-authority, multi-agency basis is
already well underway.

     The task of co-ordinating the response to the tragedy
has been undertaken through regular meetings of an
Inter-Agency Co-ordinating Group which comprises
representatives of the Directors of Social Services of all
five Merseyside Authorities, Cheshire and Lancashire,
together with colleagues from the Mersey Regional
Health Authority, the Probation Service and the Emergency
Planning Unit of the Merseyside Fire and Civil Defence
Authority.  The voluntary sector response is being
co-ordinated through the Voluntary Sector Co-ordinating
Committee, with access to the Inter-Agency Group.

     Steps were taken immediately by the Group to establish
a national, 24 hour Helpline to enable those affected by the
tragedy to make contact with trained and experienced
counsellors able to listen and help.  In addition, a number
of drop-in and advice centres have been established
principally to provide easily accessible counselling
services and a meeting place with appropriately trained
support services on hand, for those who may benefit from
sharing common experiences and needs.  The establishment of
permanent premises for a counselling, drop-in and memorial
centre is being actively pursued.

     In addition, the Inter-Agency Group is exploring the
possibility of creating a Disaster Unit which would have the
capacity to maintain a continuing 24 hour Helpline,
co-ordinate and provide counselling both locally and
nationally, manage a permanent drop-in and advice centre and
co-ordinate voluntary effort.  The Unit would also maintain
the computer data base which, with the assistance of
Consultants, was established by the Inter-Agency Group very
early on to deal with the mass of information and referrals
from the Helpline and to aid the tracking of individuals.
The Unit is also envisaged as having public relations,
training, finance and administrative functions.

     The requirement for a major training programme of
crisis intervention work and counselling for health
authority staff, social workers, teaching staff and
voluntary sector organisations was recognised and
arrangements were put in hand almost immediately for
presentations to be made by Michael Stewart of the Centre
for Crisis Psychology to large groups of staff.   In
addition, briefing seminars for Elected Members of the core
Authorities took, place on 22nd April.  For longer term staff
training purposes, agreement has been reached for the
appointment of Training Officers, one post being funded
through N.W.A.S.S.A.   This post aims to attract an Officer
who will engage in training ventures across the North West
equipping the workforces in a number of agencies to cope
both as helpers and as victims.

     Arrangements are being made for details of this post to
be advertised in 'Social Work Today' and contact points in
all the core authorities have been given to enable potential
applicants for any vacancies which may arise as a result of
the tragedy to make an approach for details.  The Group is
considering the establishment of a Hillsborough Jobs Forum
Day at which job vacancies could be discussed with
interested persons.

     It is planned that support and de-briefing of
counsellors will be provided separately and independently.
In this connection, the Inter-Agency Group has accepted the
offer of B.A.S.W. to co-ordinate and utilise all offers
which have been received in this direction.

     The Group has arranged for the production and
distribution to the core Authorities (and indeed to all
Authorities affected by the tragedy) of appropriate
publicity material for adults (containing advice on how to
cope with a major personal crisis) and for young people
(encouraging them to talk about their feelings about what
happened at Hillsborough, and how it effected them, their
friends and family).  These leaflets have been backed up by
the production of posters for use in schools and colleges
and posters for more general use.  Sticky label badges have
been produced and information has been reproduced in local
'free' or 'in-house' newspapers.

     There has been liaison between the Group and the
Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund and working arrangements
between the Authorities and the Fund have been established.
The Local Authorities have no direct responsibility in
relation to the Fund and it's management.

     The Group has attempted to ensure that all agencies
have been kept fully informed and appraised of it's work and
of the progress made in establishing services and responding

    to the tragedy.   Meetings and consultations at Officer and
    political level continue.   Information has been made
     available continuously to the press and a separate and
    discreet briefing arrangement with professional and trade
     journals is being established.

         The immediate priorities are being addressed by the
    Group.  It is clear that all those people attending, playing
    and officiating in the match at Hillsborough, plus their
    circle of family and friends, must be regarded as victims.
    The issue for Authorities must ultimately be the quality of
    life of the survivors and those closely associated.  The
    nature of the service to be provided must be regarded as
    preventive mental health.

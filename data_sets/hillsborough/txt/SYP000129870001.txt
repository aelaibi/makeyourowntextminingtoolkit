                I am a Police              Constable            presently        attached        to   the S e r i o u s      Crime

                Squad,        Police       Headquarters.




                At     0930       on S a t u r d a y     15th    (150489)        April       1989,    I paraded        in full

                uniform            at   the N o r t h     Stand,       Hillsborough Football                Stadium,

                Sheffield.               My duties         were     in      connection with           the f o o t b a l l     semi-final

                between           L i v e r poll    and    No r tt i n gharri F o r e s t .



                On attendance              at      the    ground       i was     assigned        to   Serial       number        63 which

                was     to    be     supervised           by S e r g e a n t    2777       Johnson.      At    approx imatley 0945

                al l    the       Police     units        were    briefed        by C h i e f   Superintendent               Dukenfield

                and Superintendent                     Murray.         On   complettion         of    the     briefing,          together

                with     other          officers         in my    serial,        we     then    began a mobile              pa t r o l    in a

                marked        Police       transit         van,     patrolling             Middlewood       Road     and     Langsett,

                Road.         The       mobile      patrol       commenced         at      approximately          1100 and         a     large

                number        of     both L i v er po ol         and     Nottingham          supporters        had a l r e a d y

                arrived           in the     Hillsborough              area .



                Whilst        patrolling           Middlewood            Road and          Langsett    T o ad ,    I saw       that      the

                local        public       houses         were    all     full    with       supporters        from    both       c it ie s.
                                                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                                                       R413

The     public       houses           were       so      full    that        supporters              were       standing          outside

th e    premises          drinking              intoxicants             on     the     footpath.                From      ti me    to       time

it     became       necessary              to    instruct          the       supporters              to    keep         footpaths

clear     as    they       were        causing            an    obstruction.                   Where       possible          I

instructed           people           to    go     inside        the      public          house       and       consume          the

drinks        in t he      bar.            However,            in m a n y      cases       the       bars       were      to o    full       and

people        were       asked        to    drink         up a n d      take      glasses            back       inside       the       bar.

I noticed           that     a    lot       of     the      young       male      supporters               appeared          to    be

very     merry       at    this        stage,            which     w as      shortly           after       midday.



At     approximately              1.33pm           (1335),         our       patrol        attended             the      Royal     Hotel

Public        House,       Penistone               Roa d ,      Sheffield.                On arrival               at    this     location

1 saw a v e r y           l a rg e     number            of N o t t i n g h a m      supporters              outside         this

public        house.         I s a w 7t h a t            most     of    these        people          were       consuming          drinks

whilst        standing           on    the       footpath          and       that      inside         the       bar      area     was       v ery

full.         Other       Police           units         had    responded            to    this       location            due     to a

call     made       by    staff        at       the      premises         to    the       effect          t h at    a    number        of

youths        were       deliberately                 causing          damage        to    glasses           and        property

inside        the    bar     a r e a.



 On     questioning              people          outside          the     premises,             they       confirmed             that

approximately              f ou r      youths            who    appeared          drunk         began        to     smash        glasses

inside        the    bar     and       then        left        pr ior     to P o l i c e        arrival.




The     footpaths          outside              t h is    public        house        had a very              l a rg e     number        of

pint     glasses          just        strewn          about.           I saw      empty Pils               lager         bottles,

empty     wine       and     cider          bottles            also     discarded              onto       the      footpath.            As

some     of    the       supporters              began         to m o v e      off     towards            the      football        g ro u n d ,

these     glasses          and        bottles            were     being        kicked          and    tripped            over,     which

in t u r n     caused        them          to    sma s h .        I saw        so me      of    these        supporters            stumble
                   I                                                      -~i                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                                                        R413

on    the    bottles              and   due     to       the    obvious               danger,          staff       inside        the    public

houses       were           requested          to a t t e n d        outside            and       clea r      up     the       debris.

Three       members           of    staff       complied with                    this        request          and went           outside

with      cardboard               boxes       and    bi n      sacks        and        set       about       clearing           up   the

broken       glass.               I understand                the    bar        was     then as ked             to      c lo s e .     At    t h is

point       people           then       began asking                myself            and    other          officers           where    they

could       find another                 public          house       which            was    being          used     by N o t t i n g h a m

supporters.                  I was       not    giving          them        any        replies          to    this        q u estion and

told      them,         in v i e w       of    the       time,       that         they       should          be a t t e n d i n g      the

ground       to        start       finding          their       gate            entrances           and      standing           in the

queues.            As       they    began       to w a l k          off         in the       direction             of     the    ground,          I

saw a       lot        of    young       men     carrying            c an s       of    lager          in    packs        of    four.        I

would       describe              these       fans       as    very       boisterous                but      manageable.




From      t h is       location          we    theri r e t u r n e d             to    patrolling             the       Middlewood Road

and Langsett                 Road



At    approximately                 2.05pm          (1405),          we         attended          at    the     Horse          and   Jockey

Public       House,           W a d s 1 ey B r i d g e ,        Sheffield.                   On arrival              at    these

premises           othe       Police          units       were       already            in a t t e n d a n c e .            I saw a very

la r ge     number           of L i v e r p o o l        supporters               outside           the      premises           drinking

intoxicants.                  These       supporters                were         both       standing          and       sitting        in an

area      which         forms       part       of    the       car    park            for    the       premises.               Inside       the

bar    area        again          it w a s     very       full.           We      had       responded           to      this     location

as    the    result           of    a    call       or    complaint               from       a    local       resident           about       the

behaviour              of    certain          fans.



Again       I saw           the    fo o t p a t h and          parking            area       wa s      strewn        with       litter       such

as    half     eaten          sandwiches,                fish       and         chips       wrappers          and       numerous        la ger

bottles       and           pint    glasses.              These       vessels               were       again       being.kicked              over
                    f                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                                         R413

and     tripped          over       by       fans,       causing           them      to       sm a s h .      The      staff       at    this

public         house         were       requested             to a t t e n d        outside           and     clear         up    the m e s s,

which        they       did.        A    lot       of    these       fans       were          in m y       opinion          drunk,       but

d ue    to     the      large       Police          presence,              were      reasonably               orderly.




Whilst         walking         through             the     crowd         of    people           outside          the    public          house,

I was        pointing          out       that       they       had       a fiar          walk       to     the      ground and           that

they      should         be m o v i n g        off.           My    comments             were       ignored          and     some

Liverpool            fans      remarked             to me          that       "The       game       would        not    be       started

u n til      they were             all       inside".              I pointed             o ut    to      them       that     they       co u l d

not     be     sure      of    that          and    again          told       them       to     start       making          their       way     to

the     stadium.              Some       fans       did       eventually             drink          up a n d        begin        to w a l k     in

the     direction              of       the    stadium, making                 comments             to     the      effect         that      the

Police         should          drive          them       to    the       g r o u n d in the P o l i c e              vans.



I noticed            that      a    number          of    fans       were       carrying              bottles          of    cider        or

cans      of    lag er.            I stopped             some       of     these         f ans      and     told       them       they would

not     be a l l o w e d       i n to        the    stadium          carrying             alcoholic              drinks.           The

replies         from         some       were       to    the       effect       they          would        h av e    drank        it    by     the

time      they       reached            the    ground.              Some       of    them        even went             onto       parking

area      and    started            to       drink       the       contents          of       the     cans       and    bottles           rat he r

than      risk       having         th e      drink        confiscated.




As     the     Liverpool            fans       slowly          started          to       drift        down W a dsley              Lane

towards         the      ground,             our    ser i a l       moved       off       to     the       bottom       of       Wadlsey

Lane      and    stopped            outside             the    Park       Hotel       Public             House.         These          premises

were      again         full       of    Liverpool             fans,          many       being        outside          the       building

drinking.               An     officer             at    this lo ca ti on           had a rr es te d             a Liverpool

       circumstances                 leading            to    the a r r e s t             of    this       youth       I am    not       familiar

       with.         On    seeing             this      officer           with        his       prisoner,          I got       out       of    the

       Police        van and             opened         the       rear     doors           to a l l o w      entry       for       the    officedr

       and     prisoner.                 As     this        youth was           being           placed       into       the    rear       of     the

       Police        van,       I    was        s u r r o u n d e d by a p p r o x i m a t e l y             fifteen          to    twenty

       Liverpool           fans,          some         carrying           opened           c an s     of    beer/lager,             some       with

       pint     glasses             of    beer/lager               which        had        obviously          been       purchased             from

       the     Park       Hotel.              Those         fans     began          to     p r o d me       a n d at     first       I thought

       they were           going          to a s k          why     we    had       just        placed       the       youth       in the        van

       obviously           under          arrest.             Instead           they           were    pleading          wi t h me        to as k

       the     youth       in the             van      to    g ive       up hi s          ticket,          stating       that       many       of     them

       had     not    got       tickets             for      the     football              match.           I told       them       the       ti c k e t ,

       if     the    youth          had       one,      was       his     property              and    not    for me          to    dispose           of.

       They     then ask ed               me     if. I k n e w a n y w h e r e                 they    could       obtain          tickets,           to

       which        I told          them       "No” .         I then           got        into      the     Police       van       and    the y o u t h

       was     conveyed             to    the       Police          room       fo r       processing.              My    serial          then went

       back     onto       patrol.



       At     2.50pm       (1430)             t ha t    day were           patrolling                 Langsett          Road       and    I noticed

       that     football             fans        were        still        in    the        vicinity          making       their          way

       towards        the       stadium,               although           I am        unaware          which       team       they       were

       supporters           of.




       At     approximately                   3.05pm         (1505),           as     a    result          of a    ra d i o    message           from

       the     stadium.                  On    our     a r r i v a l we        set        about       crowd       control          duties        a

       large        numbers          of       people         of     both       sexes,           including          children,             were        now

       spilling           out       of    the       stadium          exits          and        beginning          to    congregate             on the

       road and           footpaths              immediately               outside              the    stadium..          I saw          t hat       some

       of     these       people          looked            very     dishevelled,                   so me,    including             young        men,

were      cr y i n g ,        s o me     had     no    shoes        on     their          feet.         As m o r e      and    more        fa ns

spilled            from       the       stadium        I realised                  that    something             very      serious         must

ha v e    taken             place       inside        the    stadium.




I had         no    personal             radio        and Sergeant                   J o h n s o n w a s the o n l y o f f i c e r in

our      serial             wi t h radio        communication,                  but       he      was     now       some    distance

away      f r o m me          as         we    h ad   spread         out t r y i n g           to u s h e r    the     crowd awa y         from

the      main       gates          of    the     stadium.            More           and    more        people        were     leaving         th e

stadium,            these          all    Liverpool            supporters.



I approached                  a youth           of a b o u t    eighteen                 years        w h o wa s v e r y pale         in

colourand               appeared           to    be    staggering.                       I took hold            of his      and asked            if

he w a s       alright.                   He    seemed         not       to k n o w w h a t w a s         happening           or w h e r e       he

was      and       he       virtually           fainted        into          my arms.             I dropped           the   youth      to

one      s id e     of       the    entrance           gates        and      sat         him     down.




I was         then          joined       by     othey youths               who       informed           me     he was       their      friend

and      he    had          travelled           with    them        to     the       ground.            These        youths      spoke

with Liverpool                     accents,           they     were        angry          using        obscene         language        a nd

screaming               about       the       allocation            of     standing              areas        for L i v e r p o o l    fans.

The      youth          I had       sat       down     appeared            to       be    concious            and    I asked        hi m    if

he    wanted            to    go    to    hospital,            he    declined              and asked             his    friends        to get

him awa y           from        the      a re a .

As     I helped           the     youth       I had         tended        to       his    feet,          having        leaned         o v er

from      a section             of    the     crowd.           I got          the    youth          I was        tending         to      his

feet      and       on    turning          saw     s om e     youths          struggling                with     each      other.             One

of     these        youths        was      trying        to    break          free       of    two       other       youths        who        were

restaining               him.        He    w as    looking          at    me       and    shouting             you murdering

members         of       the     crowd      began        to    shout          similar          comments           and      obscenities

at     myself        and       other       officers.              The     youth          I h ad         tended       shouted          b a ck      to

exits,         by    both Pol ice             and     other         supporters.                    I knew        the    situation              in

the     ground           must     have      worsened.               I tried          telling             people        in f r o n t       of me

to     ge t    away       and     make      r o om    for      other          people          to    leave        and    for

ambulances               to    be a l l o w e d      in.       I was          met    with          further        hostility,              both

verbal         and       physical.            I was         punched           at    by a n o t h e r        youth and            blocked

t he    punch        by       placing       my     forearms          in f r o n t         of       my    face,       then       b ee r     cans

were      being          thrown       from        other       members          deeper          into       the     cro wd ,       but

fortunately               I was       not     struck.             I kept           pleading             with     them      to    get      well

away      and make             some       r oom    for      the     injured          to       be    ferried          away.         Some

people         just       i g n o r e d me,        others         shouted           obscenities                and     threats           of

violence.                By    n ow a m b u l a n c e s       were       beginning             to a r r i v e        but    the       crowd

were      till       very       hostile.



During         what       I could          only      describe            as    mayhem,             I ha d      people       running            up

^to m e       and    expressing             their        concern          about          telephoning              home      to     let

-relatives           know       of    their        safety.           I told          them          to    get     well      away       from

th e    ground           and    to    go    to     local       r e s i d e n t s ’ houses                and     ask    their

                                                                                                                                           R 413

•   permission             to    use       their      telephones.                 I had        numerous          people          making

    this     request            as    to    th e     location          of       telephones.              I advised              all     of    t h em

    the    same       as    they       would         obviously             eventaully             find     telephones                a n d a ls o

    it w a s     a way          of    getting         people          to    leave       the a r e a.




    I was      then a sked             by a        uniformed           Police          Inspector           to    go a n d        join a

    number       of    other          officers            who    were       lined       up on        the    service             r oad      inside

    the    ground          area       which        runs      between            Leppings          Lane     and       Penistone             Road.

    I did      not     know          the    Inspector            but       I had       no w    become       detached             f r o m my

    serial       and       joined          the     other        officers          who       had    formed        a    line.           On     joing

    the    line       I saw a          number         of     bodies,            approximately              eleven          pe o p l e ,      and

    these      were        obviously             dead.          I now       knew       that       the    situation              I thought

    to    be a s e r i o u s          matter,         was       now a t e r r i b l e          tragedy.              As    more       and more

    ambulances             arrived,          so      did     fire      engines.               Metal      barriers              were     placed

    behind       the       l i ne s    of P o l i c e        Officers            I was        staning       in a n d           these       we r

    covered       over          by    canvas         sheeting          to       form    a more          private           screen.




    The    ambulances                began       taking         injured          people        away      as m e d i c a l        staff

    tended       the       bodies          behind         me.     A number             of     police       Officers             were       then

    released          from       screening            the       bodies,          myself        included.




    Some    officers             were       s en t    back       to    crowd       control           duties          at    Leppings          Lane

    and    I and       three          or    four      other       officers             were       instructed              to    go    further

    along      the     service             r oad     to w h e r e      BBC       television             vans     were          pa rk ed.          At

    this     l o c a t i o n we        joined         a     number         of    other        officers          forming          a barrier

    to    stop    people             walking         form       the    Penistone              Road      entrance           of    the

    service       r oa d        to    the    Leppings            Lane       end    of       the    service           road,       thus

    Allowing          better          access         fo r   ambulances             to       leave.




    I was      also        instructed              by a n       Inspector          whom        I did       not       know       to    c o v er     an
                                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                                             R413

             entrance/exit             gate    which    gives       access       o n t o 'leppings L a n e           terrace

             preventing          anyone       without    authority          onto     the    terrace.            From    that

             position       I could       see    the    emergency          services        working        frantically

             carrying       away       injured       and what       appeared        lifeless        bodies       from     the

             terrace       areas.



             The    rest    of    the    stadium       was   by     n ow   emptying        with     some       sections

             virtually       empty.




             I remained          in    that    position       for    quite       some    t im e    u n t il    being    briefed

             in the    North          Stand    much    l ater     that     afternoon.             After       this    briefing

             and    taking       a short       break,    I regrouped             with    the      rest    of m y      s erial,

             this    being       at    about    6.30pm       ( 1830).       We    then     resumed        rnoblie      pa tr o l   of

             th e   Hillsborough          a r ea .

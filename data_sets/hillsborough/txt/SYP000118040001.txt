             On Saturday,              15th April,             1989,     I commenced              duty    at 9 a.m.               at    Barnsley

             Police        Station.          I travelled            to H i l l s b o r o u g h     football            ground          in

             company with Police                    Sergeant         1341       Crawford          and    upon      arriving             at

             Hillsborough              I took        up d u t y     in s e r i a l     60    under       the      command          of P o l i c e

             Sergeant          2019     Thompson,            ’E ’ D i v i s i o n .

             At    11 a.m.          I commenced           f o ot    patrol       public       order       duties           on P e n i s t o n e

             Road     near       to    the    dog     racing        tr a ck ,    I was       on    pa t r o l     in    company with

             Police        Constable          6 82 Lowe.            At   this     time       we    did    not      have       a    radio,          the

             only     one      being        with Police            Sergeant       Thompson.              After         some       30 minutes

             on    public        order       patrol       it    soon     became        apparent          t ha t    many Nottingham

             Forest        f an s     were    arriving          early      for    the m a t c h a n d w e r e              inhabiting              the

             l ocal     public         houses.           They were         drinking          heavily        and were

             congregating              in    large       groups      although          they were          at      t h is    time        very

             well     behaved.

             As    time     went       by    the     crowds        began    to    get       larger       congregating                  outside

             the     public         houses        a n d at     approximately            12 m i d d a y      there          was     a    crowd       of

             approximately              300       fans    outside        the R o y a l       Hotel.         The        public          house

             itself        was      full     to    overflowing           a n d all      the       crowds        though        boisterous.,

             were     w e ll     behaved.           These       crowds      were       drinking          beer      by      the     crateful

             and     sat    drinking          it on       the      pavement.           The    crowd       outside           the R o y a l

Hotel        r emained well                 behaved           but      as    time       passed and             the    more      the       crowd

go t       dru n k,      so    the     atmosphere                got    more        agitated.                This    culminating               in

a bottle            being        thrown          at m y s e l f a n d          other         officers          on the       other         side

of     the     road.           S h o rtly after               a member            of    staff          from    the R o y a l        Hotel

approached               us    to     say    that          t h e re    w a s .t r o u b l e       in t h e     premises.             Police

Sergeant            Thompson           summoned             assistance              and      the       public       house      was

cleared and                the       crowd moved              on.       They        were      all       very    drunk       but      due      to

numbers,            it wa s          impossible             to    do a n y t h i n g         about       them       getting         to    the

ground.             As     the       rest    of       the     fans       filed         past       us    on P e n i s t o n e R o a d

heading          towards             the    grdund,           it w a s       obvious          from       their       demeanour            and

behaviour             that       many       of    them        had      been       drinking             and were       drunk.             I have

n ot       worked        at    the     Penistone              Road       end      of    the       ground       before       and      cannot

comment         as       to w h e t h e r        it    is u s u a l         that       so m a n y       fans    should         be

drinking            or     drunk       before          the m at c h .

At     3    p.m.      we      began        to m a k e       our       way    b a ck     to    the g r o u n d        in o r d e r        to

commence            Phase        (S)       duties,           those       being         on    standby          outside       the

ground.             However,           whilst          walking           back       towards            the    ground      as    a serial,

it b e c a m e        apparent             via        the r adio t h a t            there were               problems        in the

ground         at     th e L e p p i n g s            L a n e end.          We    began       to m a k e       all     haste back              to

th e       ground        on    th e    way       being        picked         up     by a P o l i c e          Transit       van and

d r o p p e d at         the     ground.              We    entered          th e      ground and were                placed         on

s t a n d b y at         the H o p         end    of       the    ground          underneath             the    North Stand along

with        several           other        serials.

After         some       five        minutes          on s t a n d b y at           this      loation,          during         which          time

it w a s       becoming              obvious          to    us    that       there          was    a major          disaster

occurring             at      t he    Leppings             Lane       end,     we      were       all    then       taken      onto       the

field and             placed          in a       line        in a      public          order       capacity along               th e      front

of     the N o r t h          Stand.         Upon          entering          the       field       I saw       hundreds         of

Liverpool             f a ns     on    the       fieldand             many     f an s       laying       on th e      field

obviously             injured.              We        were kept           in the, line              in f r o n t     of   the N o r th

th e    Liverpool             fans        in th e N o r t h S t a n d w e r e                     very angry and were

venting           their       anger           on    ourselves                on    th e      pitch.          The       abuse       and

were       leaving           th e    North Stand and                         ripping           up a d v e r t i s i n g       hoardings                and

taking        them       to     the       Leppings                Lane       end and           carrying          injured           persons

and Police              Constable              68E Lowe             were          instructed along                     with       two    other

The     f a ns     who       were        on    the        field were               mostly walking                  around           in a      daze

bu t    it    became          very apparent                       that       the       vast      majority          of       them     had      been

drinking           heavily.               They were                venting             their      anger         upon        the    Police          and

Liverpool           fans.            He       approached                us    fo r      protection.                He       had    been       taking

photographs              of     the       incident                which       had       caused         the L i v e r p o o l         fans         to

being        kicked and              spat          at     by the         fan s.           In a n       effort          to    protect          h i m we

tried        to    keep       the L i v e r p o o l               fans       away       but      they were             so    intent          to    get

at     him.        The       abuse        coming             from       persons           still        left      in th e          North and

No rth West             pens        as    well          as    from       on       the     f i el d .      Whilst            there       c o in s

began        to    rain       down        on us           from      the       terraces            at    the      p r es s     man and

ourselves.               The        o n l y w a y we              could       protect            him was         to     get       him    out       and

fo r    his       own    safety,              he    took          off    his       press         jacket         and     put       all    his

equipment           away.            Three          of       us w h o        were       on     the     gate      then        formed a

circle of sorts around him and attempted to run through the Liverpool

fans   on the field and to safety.                 As we made our way through the

crowd the photographer's            camera equipment and bags were kicked all

over the pitch, we were spat on by fans who were obviously drunk and

angry.    We eventually managed to get him to safety at the Nottingham

Forest end.       I then went back to the centre of the field and assisted

with the public order cordon across the field.

The most striking thing about being on the field with the Liverpool

fans was how many had been drinking and some very heavily.                           It was

often difficult      to understand them when they asked for information

regarding relatives,         etc.     By this time as things began to quieten

down on the field and the decision was taken to abandon the game, I

was    directed    along   with     the    rest   of   the   public   order   line   to   go

outside   the ground and assist with persons leaving the game.                         This

appeared to go smoothly with a very subdued atmosphere amongst all

the Nottingham Forest fans.               I had nothing to do with the supervising

of the Liverpool fans moving from the ground.

Upon   re-entering     the   ground       I was   directed to the mortuary by an

Inspector where I was put in charge of one of the bodies.                       The body

was No (2), later identified to me at 2.10 a.m. as that of INGA SHAH

SIDES of Golders Green,           London,     34 years of age.         I then took the

body in a SYMAS vehicle to the Medico Legal Centre, where the body

was booked in.       The body was described as female, 34 years, shoulder

length blonde hair of slim build and was wearing a green wax jacket

and grey jumper and jeans.           She was wearing black boots.             I played no

part in the removal of this body from the Leppings Lane end of the

ground and am unable to say which pen she came from.

I finished duty at 4.00 a.m. on Sunday 16 April 1989.

fans        on the        field and            to    safety.             As     we     m&de       our w a y       through            the

crowd        the       p h o t o g r a p h e r *s c a m e r a        equipment              and      bags w er e        k i c k e d all

over        the    pitch,        we     were        s pa t     on by         fans      who were          obviously              drunk          and

angry.            We    eventually             managed          to ge t         him        to   s a f e t y at       the N o t t i n g h a m

Forest        end.          I then went              back       to      th e     centre         of    the     field and assisted

with        the    public         order        cordon across                   the     field.

The     most       striking            thing        about       being          on the           field with           th e L i v e r p o o l

fans was           how many            had     been       drinking             and     some       very      heavily.                It was

often        difficult            to    understand              them when              they asked             for     information

regarding              relatives          etc.           By    th i s    time        as     things       began        to    quieten

down        on th e       field and            the       decision            wa s    taken        to a b a n d o n      the         game,       I

was     directed along                  with        the       rest      of     the     public         order       line      to       go

outside           the     ground and assist                     with         persons            leaving       th e    game.              This

appeared           to     go    smoothly with a very                           subdued          atmosphere            amongst             all

the     Nottingham              Forest            fans.         I had          n o t h i n g to do w i t h        the s u p e r v i s i n g

o f the L i v e r p o o l          fans           movingfrom            the      ground.

Upon        re-entering            th e      ground           I was      directed               to the    mortuary              by an

Inspector where                   I was           put     in    charge          of     one of the         bodies.               The       body

was     No.       < 2 > , later         identified              to me          at 2 . 1 0 a.m.           as      that      of       INGA SHAH

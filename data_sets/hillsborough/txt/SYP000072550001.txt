               to Woodsi.de.             This   is about a three minute walk.            We caught the

               coach at 10.30am            (1030).   /The   coach firm was Su nypary C o a c h e s ,

               that there was an alcohol              ban on the coach.            He told us that there

               drunk    it.      As I said the coach left at              10.30,     (1030), we didn't stop

               on the way and I didn't notice any traffic delays either.                              We started

               off down the M33 but I can't remember which way we went from there.

               We arrived in Sheffield between 12.30 and 1 pm                       (12.30 and 1300).             The

               coach stopped on a             main road about        10 minutes walk from the ground.

               When we stopped we             werj^in a line of emptying Liverpool coaches.                           We

               to the same fixture           last year and knew where to go.                Outside the

               Gateway store we were talking to the local                      police and other fans,             the

               mood was great - everybody was enjoying the day.                          At about 2.20pm

               (1420)       the police told us to make our way to the ground.                        At this

               stage there was about 3-300 people sat on this patch of grass.                                    We

               all got up and made our way towards the ground.                          One or two policemen

               walked with us towards Hillsborough but I didn't notice many policemen

               lining the route.             No one was drunk at all and I didn't see any
                 /
              Zither     at all that day.             We got to the Leppings Ln entrance about

               H .30pm (1430).           We all had tickets for the Leppings Ln standing B

               turnstiles          It was      chocka outside so we decided to wait for a few

               minutes to see if the crowd outside would thin out                           I could see the

               top of the turnstiles but there wasn't any queues,                        just a mass of

               pe o pl e.      I coul             iree mounted policemen in this crowd prior to

               thfff turnstiles.        I/After w a i t i n g a few m i n u t e s   it became obvious       that

               block.         As we got to the turnstile we had a large concertina gate to

               our left.        This would be about 2.40pm               (1440).       In this corner there

               was one young       policeman who was shouting for people to calm down and

           packed.        At the time     I thought to myself ’This is Qtmr organisation*

           but once we got through the turnstiles these thoughts disappeared as

           it was easy going          in the courtyard.        I didn't see any police or

           stewards here,       in fact       I d i d n ’y see a steward until the game had been

           abandoned.         Once    in this    courtyard we went to the toilet.              I wanted

           Unid'er the West Stand.             We had no trouble at all         in here and when we

                  sectional    fencing to our right            Me,        and           stood behind,

                rectly behind this barrier but                 went underneath it and stood

           directly       in front of it.         We were here at about 2.45pm (1445)

           was a surge from behind,               I got crushed against the barrier,              It

           became painful and I needed to move.                 I co ul dn ’t get under the

           barrier so all three of us edged left to try and get round.                                  got

           to the end of the barrier first and got round.                       I went next I got my

           left    leg round the stantion but as I was bringing my right leg round

           it got crushed against             this stantion.     It was very painful and

           trapped.                  managed to get my leg free and he followed me               into

           the crowd.         Once we were free from this barrier we were forced slowly

           forward.        We had no control of our movements.                  The pressure

           increased and we came to a halt about               10 feet from the perimeter fence

           and then I co ul dn ’t move at all.             The gate    in the perimeter fence was

               pitch         I saw a youth who was about three                   in front of me I would

               say he       was about sixteen,           blonde haired,            cut short at          the back.I

               watched him disappear from view,                    he just         went down. I never saw

               him again.                          and myself were still together.                     As people

               were being pulled out of the gate we got closer to it.                                 I could see

               people       being crushed against the perimeter wall and fence.                              Some were

               trying       to climb over but as soon as they                      pulled their          torsos out of

               the crowd they were trapped there by their                        legs.

                       The three of us got out virtually together and                                  and

               helped me       into the penalty area.               We all sat down to get our breath

               back.       Even at this time the police were still trying to get the

               uninjured fans back            into the pens so as they could get the game

               restarted.          I looked back into the pen from where we had come and it

               d i d n ’t seem any better.             People were still being crushed against the

               fence, after a couple of minutes we went to the sidelines near the

               halfway line under the North Stand.                       While/we were there a policeman

               came round and asked if anybody was                    injjy^fed.       I said I w a s .       He

               were    people a lot worse than me being brought                      in/all the time.               A

               white man about 22 yrs,             six foot tall and goo<y build, was brought                           in

               and placed on the floor about five yards away from me.                                This man had

               obvious trouble breathing and was trying to speak but couldn’t.                                          A

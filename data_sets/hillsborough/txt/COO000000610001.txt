                                         F O O T B A L L SPECT A T O R S BIL L

              The Prime Minister held a m e e t i n g wit h M inisterial
    colle a g u e s this m o r n i n g to disc u s s the m a n a g e m e n t of the
    F o o t b a l l Spec tators Bill in the light of the latest
    i n f o r m a t i o n about the timing of any r e c o m m e ndations that Lord
    J u s t i c e Taylor might make on a national football m e m b e r s h i p
    scheme.           Present w ere the Home Secretary, the sec r e t a r y of^
    State for the Environment, the Lord President, the Lord Privy
    Seal, the Chief W h i p and the M i n i s t e r for Sport.               Mr Langdon
    and Mr Muridy (Cabinet Office) w e r e also present.

              I          should be grateful if recipients of this letter w o u l d
    r e s t r i c t its c i r c u l a t i o n to those officials wit h a s t r i c t
    op e r a t i o n a l need to know.

              The Home Sec r e t a r y said that, f o llowing the Cabinet's
    d i s c u s s i o n of the h a n d l i n g of the Football spect a t o r s Bill on
    20 April, Lord J u s t i c e Tay l o r had told him that, w hile it
    should be possible to prod u c e a short interim report before
    the m i d - A u g u s t start of the new football season to cover the
    q u e s t i o n of p e r i m e t e r fences and one or two important m a t t e r s
    of oolice procedure, it w o u l d not be possible to give as
    w i d e - r a n g i n g an interim report as Mr Just i c e Popplewell had
    mad e because, un l i k e the B r a d f o r d fire, there was considerable
    d i s a g r e e m e n t o v e r .the cause of the disaster.             In particular,
    he could not promise that any reco m m e n d a t i o n s he might mak e on
    m e m b e r s h i p cards w o u l d be in time for the passage of the Bill
    in the current Session.                  Oral heari n g s wer e likely to b egin in
    the f o l l o w i n g w e e k and to continue until around the end of
    June.         It w o u l d then be necessary to take w r i t t e n evidence.
    Lord Justice Ta y l o r had r e c eived about 1,050 letters, of w h i c h
    m ore than 900 had argued that a football m e m b e r s h i p scheme
    w o u l d serve to incr ease the risks of a r e p e t i t i o n of the sort
    of d i s a s t e r w h i c h had o c c u r r e d at the H i l l s b o r o u g h ground.
    Lord Just i c e Ta y l o r felt that it w ould not be possible to
     ignore the issue; he w o u l d p r o b a b l y ask the D e p a r t m e n t of the
    E n v i r o n m e n t for a w r i t t e n contribution, and he w o u l d consider
     the ava i l a b l e t e c h n o l o g y as well as the s i tuation in other
     countries.            Lord Just i c e Tay l o r did not at present feel that
     it w o u l d be possible to cover the question of a national

m e m b e r s h i p scheme until his final report,        which he e x p ected to
submit at around the end of the y e a r .

      In d iscussion,     the fol l o w i n g m a i n points w e r e made:

      (a)   In the face of the very large number of football-
            related deaths w h i c h had o c c urred in recent years (a
            N ewcastle supporter had died a few days earlier
            f o llowing an inci dent in a London p u b ) , it w o u l d not
            be sustai n a b l e for the G o vernment to postpone the
            Bill until the f o llowing Session.                 It was essential
            to retain a l e g i s l a t i v e vehicle to enable the
            G o vernment to deal with any reco m m e n d a t i o n s by Lord
            Justice Taylor w h i c h the Government m i g h t decide to
            accept.           In order to make the Bill's e n a b l i n g
            f r a m e w o r k as flex ible as possible further
            c o n s i d e r a t i o n should be given to whet h e r any of the
            m a n d a t o r y requirements in clause 5(2) of the Bill,
            r e l a t i n g in p a rticular to exemp t i o n s from the
            national m e m b e r s h i p scheme, should be made
            permissive.              Agai nst that, the w i t h d r a w a l of
            m a n d a t o r y r e q u i rements w h i c h had been inserted in
            the House of Lords w o u l d greatly c o mplicate the
            h a n d l i n g of the Bill.

      (b)   The Government had u n d e r t a k e n at Report Stage in the
            Lords to b ring forward amendments to require that
            the Sec r e t a r y of State's approval of a draft
            football m e m b e r s h i p sche me should be m a d e subject to
            the negative r e s o l u t i o n procedure.    It w o u l d not be
            p ossible to mak e this subject to the af f i r m a t i v e
            r esol u t i o n proc edure, since this w o u l d render the
            Bill hybrid, but the Government should u n dertake
            that both Houses w o u l d be given the o p p o r t u n i t y to
            deb a t e the S e c r e t a r y of State's decision.        It had to
            be recognised, however, that this w o u l d mak e it very
            d i f f i c u l t to implement a national m e m b e r s h i p scheme
            in time for the start of the 1990/91 football season
            in Augu st 1990.

      (c)   As the Bill stood, the Football M e m b e r s h i p Authority
            w o u l d be r e q uired to dra w up a ,national m e m b e r s h i p
            scheme even if the Government wer e to decide, in the
            light of any r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s which the Lord Just i c e
            Taylor m ight make, that such a scheme should not be
            introduced.            To m a k e the e n a b l i n g character of the
            Bill clearer and to prov i d e a s s urance that the Bill
            itself w o u l d not take matt e r s beyond the point of -no
            return, the Bill could be amended so that the
            Football M e m b e r s h i p Authority w o u l d be required to
            p repare a scheme only if so d i r e c t e d by the
            S e c r e t a r y of State.       W h i l e it w o u l d not be
            a p p r o p r i a t e for the Bill to require that such a
            d i r e c t i o n should be the subject of approval by
            Parl iament, it w o u l d nevertheless be helpful for the
            G over n m e n t to u n d e r t a k e that P a rliament w ould be
            given the o p p o r t u n i t y . t o debate any such direction.

      s trengthen the Sec r e t a r y of State's hand in p r e ssing
      the Foot ball M e m b e r s h i p Aut h o r i t y to prepare a
      viable scheme as soon as possible.

(d)   The football authorities, w h o it was p r esently
      intended should be a p p o i n t e d to staff the Football
      M emb e r s h i p Auth ority, were d r a g g i n g their heels over
      the preparations for a national football m e m b e r s h i p
      scheme.           F o l l o w i n g the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster, there
      was a case for a m e n d i n g the Bill to provide for the
      estab l i s h m e n t of a new authority, w h i c h might be
      known as a Football Safety Authority, w h i c h could
      take on r e s p o n s i b i l i t y not only for the p r e p a r a t i o n
      and oversight of a football m e m b e r s h i p scheme but
      also for the lic e n s i n g of football grounds under the
      Bill.         However, a change to the Bill of this
      m a g n i t u d e w ould greatly c omplicate its handling,
      e s p e c i a l l y in the House of Lords: it might
      a ccordingly be better for the proposed arr a n g e m e n t s
      to remain in place, w i t h the S e cretary of State
      ret a i n i n g r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for the l i c e n s i n g of
      football grounds, though the D e p a r t m e n t m i g h t want
      to d e l egate ne g o t i a t i o n and en f o r c e m e n t of the
      detailed safety measures.

(e)   The Bill w o u l d need to be amended to prov i d e for the
      requirement of a l l - s e a t e d a c c o m m o d a t i o n which the
      Home Secretary had ann o u n c e d in the House of Commons
      in his statement on the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster.            This
      amendment w o u l d need to be s u f f iciently broad to
      allow for the i m p l e m e n t a t i o n of any other
      recommen d a t i o n s w h i c h Lord J u s t i c e Taylor might mak e
      on physical measures, i n c l u d i n g turnstiles and
      perimeter fencing.             It w o u l d probably be best for
      this amendment to be i ntroduced in the Commons
      rather than at T h i r d R e a d i n g in the Lords.

(f)   O p ponents of the Bill w o u l d claim that the
      Gover n m e n t had c o mmitted itself to the d e f erral of
      the final pr o c e e d i n g s on the Bill until after Lord
      Justice Taylor had sub m i t t e d any reco m m e n d a t i o n s he
      might m ake on a national football m e m b e r s h i p scheme.
      This was not the case, however, since Min i s t e r s had
      been careful to say no m ore than that any
      r e c ommendations w h i c h Lord J u s t i c e Taylor m ight m a k e
      in his inte rim report could be taken into account in
      subs equent procee d i n g s on the Bill.                 The situation
      had not been altered as a result of the expected
      d elay in the submi s s i o n of any reco m m e n d a t i o n s w h i c h
      Lord Justice Taylor m i g h t m a k e on a national
      m e m b e r s h i p scheme; the Bill w o u l d provide an
      e n a b l i n g fra m e w o r k w h i c h w o u l d allow any such
      recommen d a t i o n s to be taken into account in the
      pr e p a r a t i o n of the scheme.

(g)   It w ould be important to counter the i mpression that
      the q u e stion w h e t h e r or not to proceed wit h a
      national m e m b e r s h i p scheme was a ma t t e r for Lord

              Justice Taylor:         it was instead a m a t t e r for
              d e c i s i o n by the Gove r n m e n t and by Parliament.

       (h)    It w ould be necessary to complete Second R e a d i n g of
              the Bill and as muc h as possible of the Committee
              Stage in the Commons be f o r e the Summer Recess.              This
              m eant that final d e c i s i o n s on the h a n d l i n g of the
              Bill w o u l d be needed be f o r e the W h i t s u n Recess so
              that Third R e a d i n g in the Lords, for w h i c h two
              weeks' notice was required, could be c o m p l e t e d as
              soon as possible thereafter.

       (i)    C o n s i d e r a t i o n should be given to the s t a g i n g of
              m ajor matc h e s in the morning, before pu b l i c houses
              were open, and to the closure of public houses in
              the v i c i n i t y of a ground d u r i n g the period whe n
              spectators would be leav i n g the match.

         .The Prime Minister, summ i n g up the discussion, said that
the G o v e r n m e n t should press ahead w i t h the F o o tball Spectator s
Bill in the present Session.                The Bill provi d e d the only
a v a i l a b l e means of d e a l i n g with a s i tuation w hich could no
longer be tolerated;             if progress on the im p l e m e n t a t i o n of a
n ational m e m b e r s h i p scheme were in any wa y delayed, then it
w o u l d be clear that it was those who had o b s t r u c t e d the
p a s s a g e of the Bill wh o w o u l d be indirectly re s p o n s i b l e for
any future tragedies which might be asso c i a t e d wit h football
matches.

          As had been f o r e s h a d o w e d at Rep o r t Stage in the L o r d s , an
a m e n d m e n t should be brought forward at T h i r d R e a d i n g in the
Lords to provide that the S e c r e t a r y of State's d e c i s i o n to
a p p r o v e a draft foot ball m e m b e r s h i p scheme should be subject
to the n e g ative r e s o l u t i o n proc edure, and the Government
s p o k e s m a n should u n d e r t a k e that time w o u l d be made av a i l a b l e
in both Houses for d e b a t i n g the n e cessary Order.                     An amendment
s h o u l d also be brou g h t forward for T h i r d R e a d i n g in the Lords
to p r o v i d e that the F o o tball M e m b e r s h i p Authority should draw
u p a scheme only if required to do so by the S e c r e t a r y of
State; and, while this sh o u l d not be made the subject of an
O r d e r - m a k i n g requirement, the G overnment spokesman should mak e
clear that both Houses w o u l d be given the o p p o r t u n i t y to
d e b a t e that decision.           A l t h o u g h the Bill w o u l d need to give
greater emph asis to safety, there w ere dif f i c u l t i e s in
a m e n d i n g the Bill to e s tablish a F o o t b a l l Safety Authority.
Th e S e c r e t a r y of State sh o u l d retain res p o n s i b i l i t y for the
l i c e n s i n g of football grounds, though further w o r k was needed
on the best way to carry out the l i c e n s i n g function.
A m e n d m e n t s w o u l d need to be prepared, for i n t r o duction in the
Commons, to provide for the r equirement of all-seated
a c c o m m o d a t i o n to be part of the l i c e n s i n g arr a n g e m e n t s to be

the i m p l e m e n t a t i o n of any r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s w hich Lord Just i c e
T a y l o r could be e x p e c t e d to mak e on physical matters, such as
t u r n s t i l e s and p e rimeter fences.            The Sec r e t a r y of State for
the E n v i r o n m e n t should cons ult the football a uthorities about
the a l l - s e a t e d requirement, and should make clear to them that

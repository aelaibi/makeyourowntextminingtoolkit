        TAYLOR REPORT: ATTENDANCE CENTRES




        I attach a draft contribution to Mr Goddard's submission on the
        Taylor report as requested in his note of 22 June, along the lines
        suggested in your note of 26 June.

        Mr Goddard is also proposing (in his separate note of 26 June
        addressed to Mr Grant) the issue of a circular to courts and
        others about exclusion orders. This offers a very good
        opportunity to remind courts of their powers to combine attendance
        centre orders with exclusion orders for offenders under 21
        convicted of imprisonable offences.   I think we should take
        advantage of it. Otherwise we shall probably have to put round a
        separate circular, which is wasteful.

FROHs Detective Inspector Cleverley
                                            DEPT: Hillsborough Enquiry
TO: Chief Superintendent Wain
                                            DATE: 20 August 1990


            SUBJECT:    INTERIH REPORT 7
                        Further enquiries requested by
                        Hammond Suddards
                        re DJ Lock Esq

On the Instructions of Superintendent Bettlson, I have carried out
preliminary enquiries concerning the police career of Hr Douglas John
LOCK, who Is now Security Officer for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

The personal record Is an abbreviated version on microfilm.     I have
examined this, and read the SWFC correspondence files at HQs Registry,
FI Sub Division, and F Divisional HQs.   I have also spoken Informally
to Inspector Calvert.

POLICE SERVICE
HILLSBOROUGH EXPERIENCE




Undoubtedly Hr Lock was Interested in football as a sport, and his
statements at the Taylor enquiry about attending many matches as a
spectator cannot be refuted.    Hr Calvert says that he had a great deal
to do with policing the ground, and always operated from the Control
Box.     Having re-read the transcript, there would seem to be no
anomalies on the question of Hr Lock's experience.

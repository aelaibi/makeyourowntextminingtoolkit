that    the          horse

                      being          ridden             by       Constable                          was    being            handled          in a

capable          and       competent                manner.

From    my       experience                   it    is       apparent             that        the    horse                                   i   s an

by    the    animal             while          trying             to    gain        access          to    the       turnstiles.                   During

this    period             of    crowd             activity             I noticed              from       the       video         recording

             that          at    one          point          the       horse                               gave        the        signs          that       it

was    being          subjected                to       some       form        of      discomfort              or    injury            from       the

rear,       it       laid       its       ear       back          and       began        to    try       and    move         forward.

From    my       experience,                   when          a    horse        is      subjected           to       pain         or    discomfort

the    animals             first          line          of       defence          is     to    move       away       from         the       cause          of

the    pain,          at/       as    fast          a     pace         as    it     can       achieve,          if     the        horse          is
                                                                                                                      /'/
prevented             from       moving             by       either          the       rider        or    its       confinement                  it    will

then    use          its    alternative                      line       of     defence             and    kick       out         in    the       direction

of    the    thing          causing                the       discomfort                with        its    hind       legs         or    fore          le g s .

An    indication                that          horse          is    a    about          to     do    this       can     be        detected             by    the

rider.           As       the    horse             tenses          its       m u s c 1 es      in    p re p e r a t i o n         to    k i c k , it

will    arch          its       back       and          this       can       be     felt       as    a    distinct               action          by    the

rider.           A    kick       from          a    horse          which          can       weight        between            11       and    15       hundred

weight       will          cause          serious                injury       to       anyone        nearby          and         in    some       cases

can    be    fatal,             if    the          impact          of       the     kick       is    in    the       region            of    the       chest

serious          injury          from       being       kicked          by       young       horses          during          training             and

in    1989       (000089)             one    officer          lost          his       life    as       a    result          of    being          kicked

by    a    Police          Horse.

Horses          used       in    the       Police       Service             are       selected             for    their          calm

temperament                and       are    given       extensive                training,             in    order          that       they       can

perform          their          operational             duties          without             danger          to    pedestrian                and

vehicular             traffic,             but    no    horse          will       remain          calm       and       under          control         if

subjected             to       pain    and       discomfort             from          whatever             cause       and       it    is

therefore             the       responsibility                of       the       rider       to    take          all    steps          necessary

for       the    safety          and       well    being          of    the       animal          under          his    control             to    avoid

the       animal          suffering          from       any       form       of       injury       which          may       render          it    a

danger          to    the       public       which          may    be       in    close       proximity                to    the       animal.

Constable                            was    placed          in a       difficult             situation             by       the

circumstances                   that       were    present,             surrounded                by       members          of    the       public

and       with       his       mount       being       abused          by    someone          from          the    rear.

In    this       situation             the       officer          would,         be    unable          to    make       an       arrest          even

if    the       person          to    be    arrested          was       close          at    hand,          because          any       opposition

to    am    arrest             could       result       in    the       officer             not    retaining                full       control          of

the       movements             of    his    horse,          or    even          being       dragged             down       from       his       horse.

In    the       position             Constable                         was placed it was im pe rati ve that he

remained             in    full       control          of    his       horse          to    avoid          any    injury          being          caused

to    members             of    the    public          in    close          proximity             to       the    animal.

                                 Prior    to joining S Y M A S         I had been a design engineer,

                                 April    I was    on duty from            "1400 to 2200,      I/had been on duty

              3.                 I had taken a         casualty to N o r t h e r n General           and     radioed green

some     time after             15.00.        I had a l r e a d y heard alpha               call    signs

being m e n t i o n e d         in broa d c a s t s       by control       and    I knew that

these were              the    call    signs       of the       liaison officers at

H i l l s b o r o u g h and so         I wondered          if something was              happening

there,        although          I had not heard a n y amb u l a n c e               being      sent to              j

to the        pitch was a little                   tight    but S t a t i o n Officer Higgins

S t a t i o n O ff i c e r   E a s o n and a police            officer.            1 did not

proceed a n y further                than the       extent      of the Kop end penalty

a rea because          I did not want             the    vehicle       to become        surrounded

by people as this w ould                    cause     difficulties           in our     leaving

the    pitch.         I locked the door               of the amb u l a n c e and opened

the back        of the        vehicle as Mr Flack approached-                          We    1oaded

the    patient        onto      our a m b u l a n c e , having        first        removed one of

our own       cots w h i ch was           immediately          commandeered,            Mr F l a c k            !

got    into     the back           of the a m b u l a n c e    with the        police       officer

an d   c on ti n u e d to       resuscitate         this      patient w ho was a child.

I closed the           rear        doors and       got    into the d r i v e r ’s seat.                Mr

fCason g ot       into the          passenger       seat      to use the           radio.     Whe n

then drove          off      the    pitch     into the y ard but Mr E a s o n got                   out

of the a m bulance.                 I had great          difficulty        leaving the          ground

due to the          nu.mbe r s a f peo p 1 e mi 11 i ng about.

As we      left     no more a m b u l a n c e s       had arrived.             I radioed        control

to tell       them that we ware                going      to the No rthe rn G e n e r a l and

we went       there without, a police                    escort.       About a mile           from the

N o r t h er n General          I saw a number            of a m b u l a n c e s    going towards

the    ground.         We a r r i v e d at        casualty where           there was a charge

nurse w a i t i n g       for      us.    I do not        know his       name a l t h o u g h     I have

seen him many times.                     We u n l o a d e d   the   patient and took              him

into the        resuscitation             room where          there was a doctor.                 We

cleaned       our     e q u ipment and         loaded up the ambulance.                     Mr Flack

radi oed      i nto    cont r o 1 to say that we were                    go i ng hack        to the

ground.

W hen we a rr iv ed           back at       the    ground w e entered from P e nistone

Roa d b et w e e n two          terra c e d houses.           We    could not         get very far

into     that     entrance          because       of the      vehicles       in that yard.

There     was a c a s ualty aged about 20 who was                            being     r e s u s c i t a t e d,

                                                                                            S99 S

by a / i r e      man and      some other      people.          We    loaded this            patient

onto      the a m b u l a n c e and then drove           back     to the N o r t h e r n

General      H o s p i t a l , a g a i n without      police      escort.

We a rr iv ed at         the   casualty entra n c e          and took the           patient         into

the      foyer w here a doctor           p r o n o u n c e d him dead on a r r i v a l .              We

took      him to the        plaster     room as       directed.          The     casualty who

we    had taken         in earlier w as a lso          in the        plaster      room w h i c h           4

was      being    used as a t e m p o r a r y m o r t u a r y .

We    cleaned      our e q u ipment and        loaded up the amb u l a n c e and

radioed       cont r o 1.      We we re told to go to L e p pings                   L a n e . There

were a lot of            people    in L e p p i n g s Lane and we were                  d i r e c t e d by

the      police    into     the service       road.        There were about                three      or

four a m b u l an ce s      there a head of us.            We opened           our back       doors

ready to move            down as the       queue      of a m b u l a n c e s    g r adually m o v e d

a wa y    but as     soon as we       did so        people    began      rushing         towards

us.       A p ol ic e m a n tried to       load a walking             casualty onto             our

vehicle       but we      told him to put him on the                   day vehicle            w hich

was      behind    us.      A police     officer       whose      rank     I did not          notice

came up to us and said that                   there was         someone         down at the

front      of the       queue who was       in a bad way.              Mr FIack          ran down

to where         this    casualty was w a i t i n g and           I drove        the a m b u l a n c e

down.       The    casua 11y was        on t he      rig ht hand s ide at a poi nt

where      the    ss rv i ce   road w i d e n s .    This     c a s u a 11y was         loaded      into

s omeone     else.        I drove     down the        service        road to Pen i s t o n e

second time          that we had visi t e d          the N o r t h e r n General             I heard

a doctor         tell    Mr Flack     to take any more               casualties          to the

           a mile     or so a w a y from the hospital.

           other a m b u l a n c e s .        The    hospital       were    ready for us.              The

           patient      was     taken straight               to the     resuscitation           room.        We

           w a i t e d for a short while                  for the p a r a m e d i c     to   rejoin us and

           it is possible              that the          same doctor       came     back w ith us to the 1

           for our      body bag.             We gave        it to him and          I told the         vehicles

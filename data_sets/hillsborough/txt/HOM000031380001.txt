          We know that the families attach importance to being told about the
          announcement before MPs are told. They have made it clear that the matter is
             11 a series of personal tragedies, and to use the words of their legal adviser
           they do not want the event to be highjacked by politicians”.

          We assume that you (Home Secretary) will wish to speak personally and in
          confidence to M r McBride.

         CD advise that it would be preferable to delay going public on the fact there
         will be an announcement, so as not to detract from your (Home Secretary) visit
         to Leicester. We think the families should have as much notice as possible
         and that they could be contacted on Wednesday afternoon



         Thursday 26 June

         News that the announcement is to be made will spread quickly and OPPU will
         contact by telephone:

                 Liverpool Football Club

                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

                 The Football Association

         to confirm when the announcement will be made.


        Monday 30 July

        We propose that you (Home Secretary) should write enclosing a copy of the
        announcement to those families and relatives and certain others who have
        previously written about Hillsborough. These letters could be issued
        immediately after you have made the announcement on Monday. We will let
        you have a draft letter shortly.

        Copies of the announcement should be made available by your office to Mr
        Howard and the shadow and Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokespersons.

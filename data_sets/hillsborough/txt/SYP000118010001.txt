           At 9.00 'a.m. on Saturday 15 April 1989,      I came on duty at Barnsley

           Police Station, where together with a number of other officers, were

           transported to Hillsborough Football Ground for a briefing at

           10.00 a.m.

    At 11.00 «.in. or possibly «. little before that time, Serial 14*

    together with another serial: consisting of *B2f JBub-Divis,!'^Of f leers,

    attended at the rear      Ihr terraces on. the -West.'Stand,; whljre       ,/

    Inspector White explained what we     were required to do that day.



    Serial 14 was deployed inside the     ground at the Leppings Lane end of

    the ground.   We were to search supporters entering the ground at

    turnstiles A-G.   I was working in    the company of Police Constable ,

    2806 Butler and our attention was     mainly focused on turnstile, C»



    Shortly after 11.00 a.m. Serial    14, took up positions at the

    turnstiles and at about 11.15 a.m. turnstiles A~B were open.           Through

    the turnstile you could see that     there was another serial deployed

    outside the ground who were also     there to search supporters.       ,



    By 12 noon all the turnstiles <A-G) were open, but supporters were

    only coming through in dribs and     drabs and the serial outside      the

    ground were able to search those     persons. However, Inspector       Wtiite

    insisted that such persons be searched a second time by Serial 14V

    The supporters feelings about this were mixed, some did not mind

    others found this offensive.



    By approximately 2.20 p.m. supporters were coming through the
                                                                               *•
    turnstiles quickly and there were not enough officers present to

    search every person entering the ground.



    Through the turnstile you could see that people were being fished

    right up to them, but I could riot see past the first three or four
                                                                        ;■PAlGE    ,
                                                                     '....ft162

people outside the ground to see hew big the crowd was.          People were

coming through and we were still frying to search them.          However,

some people were saying that we wduld be better off dealing wit%,the

crowd outside rather than searching them.



By about S.30 p.m. supporters   were beginning to climb over the top              of

the turnstiles, these persons   apparently had tickets* and were

-throwing them into the crowd outside the-ground.



A short time after this I noticed that Gate C was open and a large

number of supporters came flooding into the ground.      I do not know

how the gates had become opened.



I cannot give a number of how many persons came into the ground but

it was a terrific amount.



The mood of these persons was that they wre either angry or

triumphant.   I will explain this as follows.   Some   people entering by

gate C had tickets and some had not.    Because of the enormity of the

crowd it was impossible for any of us to control them, to cheek to

see if they had tickets or to search them as we had been deployed to

do.                                                      :v. ■



After a short time a matter of about one minute Police Officers,            I

recall Police Sergeant Crawford, Police Constable McManus and Police

Constable Grant were able to close Gate ’C .



The ;crowd that had rushed through gate seemed to congregate around

the area between gate C and the West Stand congesting the area

totally.   t was continually asking people to move back or to go to                rT
the area they were supposed to be in and this was replied by them

either saying thiy were waiting for friends or abuse or people being

both abusive and angry.                                       ■             'vt



The supporters were angry bec^u^e there was apparently an enormous

crowd outside the ground and they were insisting that we do something

about it.     Unfortunately we could not do anything, we had no radiof

for communication and I had not seen Ins,pfctor White sine# about           *

1.00 p.m. As a matter of fact I never saw       him again that day.   .



Supporters were saying get out there do something, there's people

being crushed to death out there.       I noticed that there was some sort

of message being passed over the ground’s       tannoy but the noise of     the

crowd was so loud that no-one was able to       hear.



As all this had been happening,     people had still be coming through

the turnstiles.     However, the   condition of some of these was very

bad, especially the women and      children.   The people werepale and you

could see that they were sweating And having difficulty breathing.              I

tried to help those people as      best I could.



The next thing I remember was      another crowd of supporters flooding in

through gate C.     I lokoed over in the di recti on of the gate- and,, saw

that it was open again and officers were attempting to close it.            The

state of the crowd was the same as I had described before.         It was

also obvious that many of the persons had been drinking, ho%.everi it

was impossible to do anything about these people.                     f



Needless to       a| this st#ge it had already become impossible            "

continue searching people.     There was nothing whatsoever tha-t w#
could do to make the      situations any better.



I .remember hearing a     loud cheer from the area inside the stand ami

the crowd that had gathered between the West Stand and GaJe C; *

suddenly all ran towards the central tunnel which l»ads onto tjle

terraces in front of the West Stand and the area behind the stand

became virtually empty.      However, people were still coming 1Jiroug||',;. '

the turnstiles.   The time was about 3.00 p.m.



I must admit it, the last 30 minutes I was the most worried I had been

in my entire life because there were only 11 Police Officers and god

knows how many fans and we were      powerless to do anything.



I remembered next an      Inspector, whose name I do not know,   come

running from behind the West Stand                                      ttffi

piaa.f. to us and telling us to go onto the pitch,     The whole of Serial

14 followed the Inspector round behind the Police Control and onto

the pitch from the South Stand.



At this stag© we did not know why we were going onto the pitch.            As

we reached the pitch 1 could not see any players.        I could see fans

running out on the pitch and it appeared at that stage that they were

invading the ptich.     There were also other officers ccwiiig onto>,the

pitch jand they appeared to be forming a cordon along the 18 yard line

in front of the West Stand.



I was facing the West Stand and saw fans pushing towards the front,

some being lifted into the stand from the terraces.       As,I looked at

the terraces I can oYily remember looking at parts CS a ’
                                                        fttt CN marked on

the pl*n.   However,    I remember seeing a fan at the top of the West
Stand swinging along the rafters by his arms.     I remember alfo seeing

one fan being lifted from the terraces into the West Stand,     He was

almost in the West Stand but fell to the floor.    At this point it

etill appeared as though what I could see were just acts of         ,

hooliganism.                                            ■■



The next thing was that Police Officers ran from the 18 yard line to

the wire fence at the Centre South and Centre North areas,     I

followed suit but did not realise that it was anything more than bad

behaviour from the crowd*    I c«n recall Police -Sergeant Crawford

telling our serial to try and stay together.



When I reached the fencing I could see that persons were being

crushed against the fencing.    However it still did not seem as

serious as it apparently was.    I could not understand from being

stood further back on the pitch why persons did not move further back

as there appeared to have been room.



Other officers had begun opening gates and lifting people over the

fences.   I stood to the left of gate’
                                     ^fcas you look from the pitch and

remember part of a blue barrier being thrown at us Police Officers,



A Policewoman who I do not know came to me and said, there’s little

kids dying.    I looked at the fence again and saw that people were

pushed up to the fence with so much pressure that their faces were

being pushed almost through the fence and some poeple were burning

blue, others were being sick and it was instantly obvious that some

were already dead.



I, remember speaking to «jn« woman and trying to encourage her to
                                                                                                          ■     page



attempt to climb up, but the pressure was so gr#at behind her that

she was unable to.                I then tried to help people climb oyer the'teflee

to g»t onto the pi tch.                                                                                ';,:'-



When, i few people ha<4 got out I went to ctietk tNaf the y :were oi

After I had done that with two people,                                 I returned to the fence btft

was unable to get ne«r enough to help and realised I wo^ld be b*tter

helping the ones as other officers we,re getting them o4t»



Together with Police Constable 3E32 Burton,                                   I went to             Liverpool

fan and saw that his friends had brought an advertising, hoarding to

put him on.            This man was alive, however, he was far from well.                                           We

helped the fans place him on the board then we placed him in the

recovery position and I placed something soft under his head.                                                   Then

together with Police Constable Burton and his friends we carried the

man to the area between the North Stand and the Spion Kop.                                                When we

reached this part of the pitch I returned to the Leppings Lane

than myself.

         While officers were trying to help people, abuse wa,S being reSflJ^ecI

         from fans, some of the fans, although I believe the majority o? them

         genuinely wanted to help.                            Others were trying to h,elp their friends

         and would not allow officers to show them the correct w a y s .a

         Eventually everyone began leaving the ground.                                          All bodies were

         removed and our serial was then instructed to escort Liverpool fan©

         from Leppings Lane to Penistone Road roundabout.                                          At this stage our

         serial had the addition of Policy Constable EQ83 Parker, but was

         minus Police Constable                           E819   McManus and Police Constable                     H8S7 Grant,

         who were still dealing                           with   bodies. At this time we did                      not know how

         many people had die^pt*.

         Further to this I have                           only   worked one previous semi-final match at

         Hillsborough and that was last year when Liverpool were playing Notts

         Forest, as this year.                       However,       I was deployed at the rear of the

         North stand and did not encounter any.problems.                                                                      ;

Chief Inspector




In    connection      with       the       above     event    I    came    on    duty        at   9-30      a.m.      (0930).      My

specific area of responsibility was Sector 2B under the command of Superintendent

Marshall.         I was     in charge of serials 34-51, excluding 44,                                46,    47 and 48, whose

Inspectors        were     Townend,         Ellis,    Meek,       Morton       and Robinson.          Serials         34-35   were

performing coach reception for Liverpool                           fans in Claywheels Lane.                      Serials 36-37

were public order/train reception units at Wadsley Bridge Station.                                               Serial 38 was

involved      in    mini        bus    reception       on    Wardsend          Road,    whilst        serials         39~40   were

responsible         for    coach      reception        in    Halifax       Road.       Serials        41,       42   and 43     were

public      order    patrols          in   Halifax     Road       and   finally serials               49,       50   and 51     were

mobile units operating in the Foxhill, Parson Cross and Grenoside areas.

Due    to   the     fact    I    was       supervising       these      officers        on    foot,        my   basic    area      of

deployment was from the Leppings                       Lane roundabout to the top of Halifax Road                               near

to Chaucer School,              including the          designated streets, Claywheels Lane                           and Wardsend

Road.

The last      semi final          I worked         at Hillsborough was during the season                             1980-81 when

Wolves      played Spurs.              However       since    that      time    I have       worked        numerous     games      at

this ground.         Additionally           I have been           in charge of games at Barnsley during a 2

year period in that Division.

                                             )
During the last            12 months         I have been responsible               for the planning and policing

of matches at Bramall Lane.                      In essence        therefore I have considerable experience

in the policing of football matches.

On the day in question some pubs in my sector were open but they were adopting a

back door selection policy.                      Clearly these pubs appeared full but to the best of
ROGER PURDY                                                 -2 -                                                             R279

my knowledge none of my officers attended at any licensed premises in response to

calls for assistance.

On my        routine patrols          in Halifax           Road I saw numerous fans who had clearly been

drinking        but none       of whom could be described                   as drunk           enough to arrest.             One is

bound to        record       that    the Gateway          Supermarket at Kilner Way, Wadsley Bridge,                              did

enormous        business       in    the sale of           intoxicants prior to                the kick off at 3-00 p.m.

( 1500).

The mood of some             of the        fans I saw was boisterous                      and loud,     but    not unlike the

vast majority of football fans every Saturday of the season.                                            The only difference

being their numbers were greater.

The    escort     of    fans     from       Wadsley       Bridge     Station         to    the   ground       was    carried      out

efficiently and effectively with the valuable                                   assistance       of    the Mounted Branch.

I gave my officers strict instructions to leave the Liverpool supporters under no

illusions        that    having          arrived    in Sheffield           they were           to behave       themselves.           I

instigated       selective          searches       of certain            supporters.           It was     evident      that      they

were    not     used    to     such       positive        policing,             many      of   the    fans asking why we were

searching       them     etc.        In     my    experience        this    is       unusual     as    currently most             fans

expect such actions from the police.

After      supervising         the       above    officers         I returned         to Halifax Road to oversee                   the

continuing arrival              of Liverpool             coaches.        I was,      therefore,         unaware of the size

of the build up of Liverpool supporters in Leppings L a n e .

At    approximately            2.55        p.m.    (1455)      I    was         in    Halifax        Road near      tothe    Wadsley

Bridge        Station    when        due     to    the    tone      of    radio      messages         emanating       from       Match

Control I took all the available personnel and attended at the Leppings Lane end

of     the    ground     where       I     reported       initially        to   Superintendent           Marshall.          We    were

unable to contact Match Control and so in company with Chief Inspector Waring who
ROGER PURDY                                            -    3 -                                                                 R 27 9

had by this time joined me, we attempted to make Leppings Lane a sterile area to

enable the emergency services to enter the ground.

In the       interim      period       in company with other officers                            I assisted        the    injured        to

waiting      ambulances          and      ensured            the       safety        and   sanctity     of   about      10/12     bodies

which were        lying      outside         the       turnstile              area    adjacent   to the        river.      I did not

handle any bodies.               The match was then abandoned and our task then was to placate

fans obviously            in a state of shock and make                               a sympathetic attempt to advise them

to leave the scene.               Officers were subjected to violent and horrific verbal abuse

from many         fans,    but    to      their            credit       the majority of officers were                   professional

and sensible in their attitude.

Radio communication initially appeared to be satisfactory, however shortly before

2.30    p.m.      (1430)     my     own      set       began           to   become     distorted      and but      for    the     events

thereafter I would have certainly either changed the radio or the batteries.

During the        tragic      events         after 3 .00p.m.                  (1500)       there was some radio trouble but

in    the    noise     and    confusion            I       could        not    distinguish       what    was    being    said      or    by

whom.

Due     to   my    duties      on      the    day           I     am    unable        to    comment   on     the   actions       of      the

stewards.

Whilst       it   is   evident       that      a large             number        of    Liverpool      fans were      still      walking

down Halifax Road shortly before 3-00 p.m.                                       (1500)      this in itself is not unusual.

My experience          in these matters                     told me           that    this happens at nearly every ground

in the country.              Providing they are sober,                          tolerant and in possession of tickets,

problems are usually minimal.

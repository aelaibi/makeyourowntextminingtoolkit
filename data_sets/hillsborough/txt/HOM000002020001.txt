            He was not agreeable to a public address announcement being made at that

            stage   as he felt it would hinder the arrival of the emergency services.

            He wished to keep the spectators in their place.

            When asked what was the cause of the disaster, his reeponae was that the

            Liverpool supporters had failed to heed the Police warning to arrive

            early and so had caused additional congestion and pressure on the

             approach to the ground.        The Chief Superintendent remained at the

             meeting for only a short period.
             I continued to persuade the authorities to make a public address

              Manager, Kenny Dalglish, make a public accouncement requesting

              co-operation from the fans in the difficulties which had arisen.

              At this stage the impression X had from various sources was that

              our fans had forced open a gate.

              made a careful investigation of the Leppings Lane end.           .By this

               time, most of the spectators had left although there were still some

               there-who were anxious to tell me that the Police had opened the gate.

               They showed me the gate and X could see that it was of the concertina

               type which would be difficult, if not impossible, for fans to force open

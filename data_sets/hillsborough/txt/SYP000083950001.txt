tunnel.       I entered the           centre     tunnel    and a strong            sms 1 j. of    intoxi cants

hit me.       I have     never      e n c o u n t e r e d smells as       strong     in football           grounds

previously.          Upon entering         the    tunnel     we were         greeted       by jeers,        boos,

and   loads    of obscene        and abusive         remarks were            d i r ected at      us.

Supporters         pushed and j o s t l e d with u s . / They were                 shouting       things         like

"YOU M U R D E R I N G B AS TA R DS . "    "YOU'RE F ITCHING U S E L E S S " and             "WHY DON'T YOU

F U C K I N G DO S O M E T H I N G , P E O P L E ARE DYING    IN T H E R E . "       I still      did      not

know what       lay ahead       but    it was yobvious        by the ag g r e s s i v e a t t i t u d e          of

the   crowd that a wrong w o r d / i n their               dir e c t i o n would        have     caused us a

lot of trouble.            The^s-HTuation         in the tunnel            was    very volatile            but     due

to our     numbers      being    small,      no ac t i o n was       taken.        It was      obvious       that

a large amount         of L iver p o o 3. s u p porters       were        t h e w o rs e f o r d r in k .



As we moved         down the     tunnel     we g r adually          got    s e p a r a t e d amon g s t    the

crowd.       The    crowd was       very hostile aim as myself                    and others        tried

radio    links were        non-existent.            As we m o v e d       into    the West S t a n d        the

first    thing      I noticed were         people     on the        pitch,        I thought       at      f^rrst

there    had been a pitch             invasion      but as    I moved         down the       stand        I saw

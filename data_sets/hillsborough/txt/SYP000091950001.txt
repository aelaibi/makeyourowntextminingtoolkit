               I am a Police Superintendent of the South Yorkshire Police Force,

               presently performing duties as the Acting Divisional Commander of                      ’D'

               Division.      I am forty-three years of age,              being born on




               On Saturday,      15 April   1989 (150489)           I was the senior officer on duty

               within   *D ’ Division on the occasion of the semi final footbal1 match

               between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, a game that was taking place

               at the Hi 1lsborough Football Stadium, which is in *F' Division.



               At 8.30 am.      (0830)   that morning,       I commenced duty at West Bar Police

               Station and at 9-00 am <0900)           I attended a briefing that was held in

               the Gymnasium at West Bar Police Station.                   That briefing was    conducted
                                                                       PAGE     2
                                                                       S3621
                  A//O310
by Acting Superintendent KING    (now Super int end en t) and was   in accord

with a ’D* Divisional Operation Order, Reference 3/89.  That Order had
                      /s()*    Ml         -f * *  ^ S€^ ^ ,|
been prepared by Police Sergeant JONES (now Inspector), who had acted

as Liaison Officer between "D* and    *F * Divisions and also other

interested parties,   and was authorised by me some time prior to the

match.



In simple terms,    the emphasis of that Order was that    *D* Division

responsibilities were to ensure that fans arriving at the Midland

Railway Station, within the city centre, were escorted to Hillsborough

on service buses and that every assistance was to be given to the Road

Traffic Division to ensure that fans,     travelling by road, were

assisted as freely and quickly as possible through the city area.



Following that briefing,    in company with Police Sergeant JONES, who

was to be my Staff Officer on that day,     I did a tour of the city

centre and spent some    considerable time at Midland Railway Station,

Sheffield,   ensuring that supporters, who were arriving at that

location on special    trains, were effectively escorted to a fleet of

service vehicles and then escorted through to the ground by officers

who were actually travelling on the buses.       That aspect of the

operation went without any particular problems.



I then did a tour of the major routes, within the Division,          checking

on the general traffic flow towards Hillsborough.        The traffic, whilst

heavy, was flowing freely and,    during this route inspection,       I had a
                          N 3SG7
discussion with Qhief Superintendent NESS I T , who was carrying out a

similar exercise.



At 2.50 pm (1450)    I returned to West 8ar Police Station satisfied that
                                                                                   PAGE    ;
                                                                                   S3621

supporters were moving through the city area,               towards Hillsborough,

without any particular            problems and aware that there had been very few

incidents of public disorder.             Officers had responded to a number of

public houses following            reports of rowdy and unruly behaviour by

supporters but matters were well            contained by the resources available

within my Division.,



After   checking with the Control Room,            I made my way to my office on

the third floor of West Bar Police Station and was in my office, a

little after 3.15 pm (1515) when Sergeant JONES came and told me that

'Operation Support" had been implemented due to Liverpool                  supporters

having invaded the pitch at Hillsborough and there was, apparently,

large scale public disorder taking place.                I was aware,   from the

Sergeant,     that other resources from           *D ’ Division had been deployed and

we travelled immediately in a patrol              car towards Hi 11sbo ro u gh ,

arriving the re a little after 3.20 pm.               (1520).



On arrival at the ground, we made our way round to the Penistone Road

entrance and I saw a large number of officers milling around the

gymnasium and also the point between the North Stand and the spion
                                hfleQll
kop.    I there saw Inspector SEWELL and Superintendent MARSH of the

Operations D i v i s i o n .    I made my way to these officers in an attempt to

establish exactly what was taking place and to ascertain what

assistance     I could be.



Inspector SEWELL advised the Control Room of my arrival and also the

fact that other officers from ’D ’ Division were available for

deployment.        I looked towards the West Stand and could see a large

number of officers being deployed and I could also see both civilians

and police officers            carrying people,   who were obviously injured,
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            S3621

towards us.



Simultaneously,   an officer,   whose identify I am not sure of but
                             H u n *
believe him to be Police Constable 773 ADAMS of D2 Sub-Division,

approached and told me that there were a number of casualties              in and

around an ambulance by the Penistone Road ent ranee, adjacent to the

spion kop.    I went immediately with that officer and saw a number of

casualties milling around an ambulance and also a number of people

lying on the ground,    obviously distressed.      I then became even more

aware of the number of casualties and extent of those injured being

carried towards that end of the ground.



At that location,    I also saw two male bodi e s .      The re was an of f i ce r

present with these bodies, which were,        in fact,    being overlooked by

fans from the spion kop gallery.        I instructed an officer to shield

the bodi es and remain with t h e m .



At that point,    because of the difficulties we were having

communicating with the ground Control,        I instructed Sergeant JONES to

contact West Bar Police Station and implement the Force Casualty

Pureau.   By this time,    fans were    running towards our location carrying

injured and people who were obviously d e a d .     Obviously, many of these

fans were distressed,     even bordering on the hysterical.



I was made a w a r e , very qui ckly, by an officer whose      identity I am not

aware of, that the gymnasium was being utilised as a temporary

mortuary/first aid reception area.         I was aware that there were

ambulance offi cers near my 1o cat ion checking these casual t i e s , who

were being carried on makeshift stretchers.
                                                                    PAGE        5
                                                                    S3621

However,    there was a distressing situation quickly escalating.

Casualties were being dropped or laid down on the ground in the access

area to the playing surface and there were also many people

congregating    in the area outside the gymnasium, which was obviously

preventing ambulance staff getting through to the West Stand.       I moved

quickly towards the gymnasium,    realising that people could not get

casualties into it.     I instructed officers to form a clearway towards

the entrance doors and also to prevent obstructions being created

between the gymnasium, ambulances and Penistone Road.



I moved into the gymnasium, there was obviously a lot of confusion,

people were distressed and,    in fact,   I witnessed a number of

skirmishes breaking out involving supporters.       In the gymnasium,   I saw

a number of senior officers,    including Superintedent McKAY of 'F’

Division.



I called for a loudspeaker and microphone and asked that casualties be

divided.    Those that were in need of medical attention were

congregating to the left-hand side of the gymnasium (when standing

with your back towards the North Stand), and people, who were

apparently dead, were being laid on the floor to the right-hand side

of the gymnasium.



I instructed officers, who were accompanying these bodies,      to remain

with them for identification purposes and also called for medical

assistance to the gymnasium to examine the casualties.       Additionally,

I took steps to bring some sort of order to the situation and very

quickly witnessed the number of bodies increasing.       The injured were

clearly being identified,    prior to entering the gymnasium, and

transported to hospital    by the Ambulance Service.

       instructed him to obtain the vfiajor incident equipment and

       officers to assist wi ti-y casual t ies outside the gymnasium,

       I recall       liaising with Mr HQPKINSQN,               the Deputy Chief Ambulance

       Officer,      on a number of occasions              in relation to the supply of body

       bags,       treatment of the injured and,               ultimately,    the t rans po rtat ion of

       the dead.          I also had regular        consultations with a number of doctors,

       whose       identities    I am not aware of,            but I gave instructions that

       their details be recorded by the respective                        Inspectors.



       Some time later,          I was approached by,            I believe,    Inspector SEWELL who

       advised me that a further eleven bodies were                        located in an area at

       the rear of the Leppings Lane entrance and that these bodies were

       being supervised by officers who were attemping to provide cover for

       them.        I gave instructions that these bodies,                  together with their

       police escorts,          should be moved,       at the earliest opportunity into the

5s     gymnas iu m ■

                                                                               S3&21

After some short time accompanied,          I believe,      by Inspector SEWELL,        I

made my way towards the Leppings Lane perimeter fence, where                 I saw a

number of officers supervising,         I believe,       eleven bodies.    I recall

that these were all males.         There was a van already at that location

and I recall that some bodies were be i ng loadjra into it.



I made my way to the Police Control^^oom,            which was nearby,     and,    on

reaching the steps,        I met a colleague, Superintendent MQRDEUi, from D2

Sub-Division.         I approached/Xhe Control Room but was m e t , at the top
                                y W IIIX
of the stairs,        by Superintendent M U R R A Y . After a very short

conversation,        I retur/fed
                       -         to the temporary
                                             £    mortuary in the gymnasium
                                                                         —
where   I was joined by Detective Chief Superintendent ADDIS and Chief
        NttfoO                                       —                             ——
Superintendent MOLE.



Mr ADDIS adv ised me that he would cont i nue with enquiries in relat i on

to the temporary mortuary,        assisted by Mr M c K A Y .    Whilst we were

speaking        I was being advised that the re was apparently outbreaks of

public disorder,        involving supporters making their way back towards

the city centre.



Conscious of the fact that I was the senior Divisional Officer on duty

that day,       I arranged with Mr ADDIS to leave the temporary mortuary and

return to the city centre to co-ordinate events there.                As   I was

leaving Hillsborough I recall deploying           Inspector DEWS     <now Chief

Inspector) and his units to the city centre to quell any outbreaks of

dis o rd er .     I then made my way, with Sergeant JONES to the city centre

to co-ordinate events.



I then spent some considerable time visiting junior officers of my

Division,       de-briefing them and counselling those that were           in obvious
                                                                                   PAGE

          need of counselling.        1 returned to West Bar Polj,-€g Station later that

          evening where       1 had a discussion with ms   rommande r , Chief

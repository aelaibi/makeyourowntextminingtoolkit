1.   I am a Qualified Ambulanceman.
2.   Detailed byu Control to proceed to Derbyshire/South
     Yorkshire border and make contact with South Yorkshire
     Metropolitan Ambulance Service Control via the emergency
     Radio Channel.        The message was that SYMAS required
     assistance at Hillsborough football ground.
3.   On approach to the football ground, police directed us to
     enter a particular area and we obeyed.        As we proceeded
     into what appeared to be the perimeter of the ground we
     observed what I thought to be a SYMAS Mobile Control
     Vehicle.      Wearing full protective clothing including hard
     hat I proceeded towards a police officer who simply directed
     me to go forward to treat casualties, further forward to
     approximately 30 yards.
4.   There were no obvious ambulance points set up and my
     colleague and I were confronted with masses of casualties.
     Some were sat up and conscious,           some lying down and
     conscious, but others were unconscious and lying against
     fencing.      The radio had become poor in reception so my
     colleague     and   I commended work on     the   unconscious
     casualties.     My casualty was lying face down with his shirt
     around his head.        He was a youth.       After the usual
     examinations 1 commenced CPR.
5.   A police woman approached and asked if she could help.       I
     quickly instructed her in heart compressions whilst          I
     continued to ventilate the patient.
6.   A second police person arrived and I enlisted his help.
     After another quick instruction he was ventilating with my
     Brook airway and I subsequently prepared my equipment and
     intubated the patient.    At this point I was joined by a
     doctor who initiated a quick paddle check using our
     defibrillator which had just been obtained by my colleague,
     I should make it clear that in carrying out a paddle check
     the doctor only used the monitor, which forms part of the
     overall defibrillator equipment, and that the defibrillator
     itself was not actually used.    All this time my colleague
     was working with a consultant on another casualty.
7.   The doctor accompanying me subsequently placed a Cannula
     into our patient and set up a drip using Haemaccel.
8.   The doctor thought there may be a chance of reviving this
     patient due to him being young and asked if I would
     accompany him on a SYMAS ambulance to the Royal Hallamshire
     Hospital, thus leaving my colleague working at the scene.
9.   The doctor continued heart compressions en route to the
     hospital whilst I continued ventilation with oxygen through
     the endotrachael tube.    Also I monitored the patient using
     our defibrillator.
10. After handing our patient over to the Royal Hallamshire
     Hospital resuscitation team and recovering equipment
     replacements we proceeded back to the incident.
11. On our return to the incident SYMAS Control detailed (via
     radio) all mobiles to proceed to an ambulance parking point
      at a large bus station approximately ja quarter of a mile

      from the incident.
12.   A doctor alighted from our ambulance and we proceeded as

      detailed.
13.   After approximately 10 minutes of       our arrival at the
      ambulance parking point I relocated my colleague and we both
      commenced an equipment check.      We then awaited further
      instructions from Control.    My colleague had transported
      six casualties between us re-uniting.
14.   Having stood by our radio for some time the SYMAS Control
      detailed us to stand down from the incident.          After
      informing Control (Derby) we had been stood down we stated
      we would endeavour to return to base.   The return was most
      difficult as traffic was now tremendous and we had to first
      call at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital to retrieve a
      catheter mount and tube.
15. On return to base my colleague and        I had to clean our
      equipment more thoroughly before going home and we finished

      at 1940 hours.

     accompany him on a SYMAS ambulance to the Royal Hallamshire
     Hospital, thus leaving my colleague working at the scene.
9.   The doctor continued heart compressions en route to the
     hospital whilst I continued ventilation with oxygen through
     the endotrachael tube.    Also I monitored the patient using
     our defibrillator.
10. After handing our patient over to the Royal Hallamshire
     Hospital resuscitation team and recovering equipment
     replacements we proceeded back to the incident.
11. On our return to the incident SYMAS Control detailed (via
     radio) all mobiles to proceed to an ambulance parking point
      at a large bus station approximately a quarter of a mile
      from the incident.
12.   A doctor alighted from our ambulance and we proceeded as
      detailed.
13.   After approximately 10 minutes of our arrival at the
      ambulance parking point I relocated my colleague and we both
      commenced an equipment check.        We then awaited further
      instructions from Control.      My colleague had transported
      six casualties between us re-uniting.
14.   Having stood by our radio for some time the SYMAS Control
      detailed us to stand down from the incident.           After
      informing Control (Derby) we had been stood down we stated
      we would endeavour to return to base.     The return was most
      difficult as traffic was now tremendous and we had to first
      call at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital to retrieve a
      catheter mount and tube.
15.   On return to base my colleague and       I had to clean our
      equipment more thoroughly before going home and we finished
      at 1940 hours.




Dated this        day of May, 1989.

  We responded to a call for support by SYMAS at the Hillsborough ground at 15.30 as
  we crossed the border into South Yorkshire the J5RC     channel was used.    SYMfS con tiro1
  being contacted, they instructed ue to proceed to the ground later pEi5 si.n£ a
  message to all mobiles to progress to gate 'O' (Zero).    Upon arrival at tlp.e ground
  (.15.55) we attempted to find the above mentioned gate during which time tljic Police
  instructed us to enter the ground, wc did not know which gate this w ^ s , the Police
  further instructed us to a point some 300 yards, within the ground,   it thj.s point
  the SYMAS mobile control unit was present.

 As we climbed from the vehicle we were faced with approximately 20 p;4tienfcs lying
 in a row, immediately resuscitation attempts were begun, QAM P Hcwes resuscitating
 one patient along with the help of a doctor, whilst. I began on a,noth< r, b^sio
 resuscitation was performed by myself.

  Shortly after this time QAM P Howes transferred hie patient onto an c.wai'.^i.g
  SYMAS vehicle and along with the doctor left for the Royal Hallamshire Ho$pita3 .
   taking the defibrillator with him.                                  I
                                                                                                                        i
 I was .joined by another doctor who using my intubation equipment intutjated; ,ry
 patient whereupon resuscitation was continued for a short time,    Further I
 resuscitation was abandoned under the authority of the doctor (Medicdl Ro^istrar)
 who also directed me not to resuscitate the other 18 patients who weite all deceaeeu.
 1 wan then requested by the doctor to accompany him to the gymnasium |wher£ more
 casualties were to be found, upon arrival there, it was observed that no f u r t h a r
 treatment was needed the patients either being deceased or awaiting transiortation
 to Hospital.                                                    i

 From this point on I returned to my vehicle whereupon I discovered s4veraj minor
 injury patients on board, we were allowed to leave the scene with th^se. patients,
 by a SYMAS officer.  We transferred these patients to the Royal Hallarnshii'e Hosp.i-.al

  SYMAS control then gave us instructions to proceed to Herries Road Bijis station
  and standby.                                                  j

__________ states :


1.   I am a Leading Ambulanceman.
2.   We responded      to a call    for support   by SYMAS at the
     Hillsborough ground at 1530 as we crossed the border into
     South Yorkshire the ERC channel was used.           SYMAS Control
     being contacted, they instructed us to proceed to the ground
     later passing a message to all mobiles to progress to gate 0
     (zero).      Upon arrival at the ground (1555) we attempted to
     find the above mentioned gate during which time police
     instructed us to enter the ground, we did not know which
     gate this was, the police further instructed us to a point
     some 300 yards within the ground.      At this point the SYMAS
     mobile Control unit was present.
3.   As   we   climbed   from the vehicle we      were    faced with
     approximately 20 patients lying in a row,           immediately
     resuscitation       attempts were begun.        QAM P.     Howes
     resuscitating one patient along with the help of a doctor,
     whilst I began on another, basic resuscitation was performed
     by myself.
4.   Shortly after this time QAM P. Howes transferred his patient
     into an awaiting SYMAS vehicle and along with the doctor
     left for Royal Hallamshire Hospital taking the defibrillator
     with him.
5.   I was joined by another doctor who was using my intubation
     equipment, intubated my patient whereupon resuscitation was
     continued for a short time.         Further resuscitation was
     abandoned under the authority of the doctor (Medical
     Registrar) who also directed me not to resuscitate the other
(    18 patients who were all deceased.     I was then requested by
     the doctor to accompany him to the gymnasium where more
     casualties were to be found.         Upon arrival there it was
     observed that no further treatment was needed the patients
     either being deceased or awaiting transportation to
     hospital.
6.   From this point on I returned to my vehicle whereupon I
     discovered several minor injury patients on board.     We were
     allowed to leave the scene with these patients by a SYMAS
     Officer.     We transferred these patients to the Royal
     Hallamshire Hospital.
7.   SYMAS Control then gave us instructions to proceed to
     Herries Road Bus Station and standby.
8.   At Herries Road    I rejoined with QAM P. Howes.           At
     approximately 1730 we were stood down and told to return to
     base, eventually completing our duty at 1940.


Dated this       day of May, 1989.
I authorise Dibb Lupton Broomhead to release my statement to the
West Midlands Police in connection with the Hillsborough Inquiry.

                          I

Thank you for passing to me a copy of Professor Phil Scraton’s final submission to Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny into the Hillsborough Disaster.

My officials have contacted the Scrutiny team who have confirmed that they have received
a copy of Professor Scraton’s submission.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has indicated that he hopes to complete his report shortly. I do
not know what he will conclude or recommend but his terms of reference allow him to
recommend any action which he considers appropriate in the light of the evidence he has
received. His advice will be made public.

I am sure you will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this
stage on the evidence under consideration.

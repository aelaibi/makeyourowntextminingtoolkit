            Before the start of next season ! want you to arrange a Seminar for
    stewards and programme sellers so that they can be informed exactly of their
    duties.

            It is important that you draw up a list of stewards and their
    respective duties, and similarly with programme sellers. In the case of
    programme sellers they must be instructed that this job is a selling job and
    they must go out to our supporters to sell and make some vocal contribution to
    it. They must be strategically placed and their’performance monitored.

             Many of the-above requirements apply also to stewards.
             Do you think it would be rewarding if other people such as our
    turnstile operators were also properly instructed along these lines?




                                                                                     \k’

        EVACUATION OF SPORTS STADIA
        I have pleasure in enclosing a copy of Appendix ’L’ of our Force Standing Order
        on the policing of football matches. You will see that it incorporates most of
        the points made by Mr. Justice Popplewell following the Bradford Fire.
   I hope that you can find the time to read through the Appendix prior to our
     meeting at Bramall Lane at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday 10 July 1986, as obviously it
     will assist our deliberations and hopefully, agreement, in respect of crowd safety
     during the forthcoming football season.
        I look forward to meeting you on Thursday but if there is any point on which you
        require further clarification, please do no~ hesitate to contact myself or
        In )ector Godwin at West Bar Police Station.

                     fied,    (~afety certificates should be referred to).

                     The system of alphabetically identifying segments
                     is worthy of consideration, especially in ccn-
                     junction with the operation of CCTV effectively

Dear Mr Chester
Following your recent telephone conversation with Mr Wilkinson on 28rh July 1986
in regard to your Club supplying passes for Officers from the South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Service, I am submitting a~_e following information for
you to discuss with your fellow directors.
On the 16th July 1986 Mr Wilkinson visited your Club along with two other Office~s
from the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and Sergeant Godhard
of South Yorkshire Police. The meeting was held with Mr Ward, Senior Groundsman.
After touring your complex and discussing evacuation plans with South Yorkshire
Police, it was felt that the Ambulance Service would normally only become involved
in any events after they had already occurred and therefore, slight delays could
be experienced on occasions in responding to the incident, To avoid this I would}
ask if two passes could be supplied to the Ambulance Service which would enable
us to ensure that an Ambulance Officer was in your ground at all home fixtures.
There would be no cost to the Club for this facility, and it would improve ground
safety. In the event of any untoward occurrence my Officers would be in a posir~on
to identify problems prior to them happening and would therefore be in a much
better position to respond to any emergency.
If you require any further information then please do not hesitate to contact
Mr Wilkinson on Rorherham 361581 extension 259~ who will ask one of our
Offciers responsible for the safety of your ground to contact you.

Yours sincerely




A ~opkins
Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer

             Town Hall,

 |           Dear Sir,
                                    Safety of Sportsgrounds Act 1975
 |                     Application for Increased Crowd Capacity on the Spion Kop
                    I am grateful to Mr. Bownes for sending us a copy of your
 |          letter to the Club dated 14 August. This enabled me to see it over
            the weekend, and to do a little research into the points you have
  I         raised.
                    The proposed meeting at 2.00 p.m. on 21 August is convenient
    I  ~,,~ for the Club officers. It is likely that the Chairman will be present,
       ~Obut he is indisposed at the moment. A director with special
            responsibility for the ground, Mr. Keith Addy and the club secretary
    i       will also attend, and I will hope to deal with the technical side
            assisted by John Strange.
    I               Turning now to the matters raised in your letter, I think it
            appropriate to make a preliminary response, so that the members of
    I       theWorking
                   be informed
                          Party may of our thoughts. No doubt there
            will be fuller discussion at the meeting on Thursday.
    I        letter.
                     I will use the same nomenclature a to f, as is used in your

             (a)      The statement is made that the new terrace construction does
    i       not comply with the plans submitted to the Council for Building
             Regulations Approval.
     I               As far as I can see it is incorrect to say that our drawings

       do not show the steepest slopes.
              I should explain that the submission of plans was
       complicated by changes of mind which were forced on the Club
       my c~rcumsuances DeyOna t~ea~ control. *The intention was to
       redevelop the Kop broadly as the present scheme. They were
       informed at a very late stage that the level of grant which
       had b~en expected may not be forthcoming, because of demands
       from other clubs following the Bradford fire. The scheme was
       therefore changed in January of this year, to roofing with no
       extra accommodation.     All our drawings had to be changed.
       The contract was let in early February and we sent a very full
       set of drawings and calculations to the Council on 24 February
       1986.     Following a good run in the cup the Board were able
       to revert to the original scheme in March.     By that time the
       steel frame for the roof only schemewas ordered and we had
       to make use of it. The columns and the bracing arrangement
       against wind now had to be modified to receive the new terracing.
       In effect a third scheme had to be prepared utilising steel which
       was more suitable for the roofing only version.     Thus, we had
       to do completely new calculations anddrawings in March and April.
        This necessitated a re-submission for building regulations approval.
               However, that re-submission showed the steepest slope
       which occurs on the terracing, and the drawings submitted in
       March and April show accurately what has been built.
               I enclose a photo-copy of our letter of 30 April which was
’II    the one which accompanied most of the drawings relating to the
       new inclined terracing. It will be seen that it lists the drawings
!      which were enclosed, five of them, Nos. 45, 47, 48, 49 and 51,
       being drawings of the Kop terracing. Prints of these five drawings

I      are enclosed.
               It will be seen that each of these drawings has a small

 I      triangular diagram above the steps which gives the rise and the
        tread of the steps, and hence indicates the overall slope.

         =                                                                 .

              Four of the drawings, Nos. 45, 47, 48 and 51 show
       sections through the main part of the new deck and have a slope
       of 173/330 which is just over 27}".    The drawing 49 shows a
                           ...... ~ ..-~,~ au the mack of the stand.
       This has a slope of 173/285 which is just over 31".    The
       slope occurs everywhere in the wings, and there is nowhere
       on the Kop where a greater slope occurs. Thus it is not correct
       to say that the terrace ’does not comply with the plans
  "~   submitted           and in particular.......
                         ’     ’                   is now steeper,.
  ~O .........
              We believe that because the City Council did not respond
       to the drawings which were sent on 30 April within the five
       weeks allowed, we have Building Regulations approval for the
i      construction shown on those drawings.
              It is expected that this development is subject to the
i      Safety of Sportsgrounds Act as well as the Building Regulations,
       but as the same officers advise the Council on both matters, there
I      could now be a possibility of a charge of maladministration if the
       Council dec£des to restrict the crowd capacity in the Safety

I      Certificate because of the slope of the terrace.
              With regard to possible danger, the Green Guide clearly
  ~O envisages 30" slopes because the spacing of crush barriers for
I " ~" such a slope is given in table 12.3.
              No doubt there will be discussion on this matter at
i      the meeting on Thursday, but the slopes we had to use were
       determined by the very crude shape of the existing Kop. Matching
I      the main new part of the terrace to the old part so as to give
       good sightlines determined the slope of 27", to which we assume there
I corner
       is no objection. Because of the presence of Penistone Road the
              had to be swung round and this modified the slope in the

 i wing    areas to just over 31".    We consider this difference of just
       over i" to be acceptable bearing in mind the very good crush
       barrier arrangement and the excellent viewing which will stop the
       crowd craning forward and thus causing a surge when some exciting
       play takes place in the goal area (the viewing can only be judged
       by visiting the ground).

      (b)     The vertical steps from terrace level to the new gangway
      can be measured in different ways depending on which foot it is
      assumed will be used to step down. As a result of observation

      found that the spectator generally holds the rail with one hand
      and steps down with the opposite foot. This reduces the step to
      just over lft. Even if he does not use the opposite foot he
      still steps onto the higher step which is available.
             But if it is thought to be necessary, the addition of a
    ceshort length to the barrier running parallel to the gangway
      can direct the spectator a little further up the slope, so that
      he will automatically take a small step downward. This can be
      discussed with the Fire Service and the Building Control Department.
      Only one or two of the gangways need consideration.

       (c)     It has always been intended to sheet down to the ground
       level at the Ozzie Owl corner, but the precise detail had to wait
       until that part of the Kop was built, and the trees cleared. When the
       frame had been erected it was my view that it was preferable not to
       sheet to ground level for reasons which I have expressed to the
       Working Party. As my view was not agreed the work is proceeding
       as was intended.

         (d)     We are a little surprised that the Building Control officer
         who has spotted a pre-cast step resting on (as we understand it)
         a bearing of 5Omm instead of the intended 75mm did not point it out
         to either my resident engineer or to the contractor so that if there
I        was need to take remedial action it could have been done there and
         then.
                However, we understand that it is one of the concrete steps
         which has a short span, and it rests on steel.   In that case it is
         probably incorrect to say that the seating is sub-standard. The
         Code of Practice to which we are working gives the Engineer
         discretion to reduce the step below 75mm.  (See attached, photocopy
         of clause 5.2.4.3). Firstly the seating is subject to a permissible
         tolerance so this will reduce the 75mm. Also this is a solid step
Ii
                                                                      SHEET   .

        with a full width of bearing to take the load. In other buildings,
        Drecast units are often n=v~ ~- ........  ~: ....-~ .....
        and all the load is concentrated on the narrow beam. A smaller
        seating can clearly be permitted where the beam is of full width.
        If as we understand it the beam in question is of short span, which
        means the load at each end is small, I think it highly likely that
~       when I know which one out of the approximately i000 new steps
    ~<ehas the smaller than specified seating I shall take the view that
        it is perfectly safe and no action is needed. If I think it necessary
        we can weld a small plate to the steel on which it rests to increase
I       the bearing width, but this is very unlikely to be necessary.
               I am surprised that this matter has been raised in this way.
I       (e)     The reference to the provision of a toilet and kiosk underneath

I       the new terrace not featuring in the application is surprising. The
        word ’provision’ makes it appear that these have been constructed
        as part of the scheme. They were built about three years ago. The
        work was not designed by us, but I know it was subject to building
        control from discussions I had with the Building Control Department
        at the time.
               The presence of the kiosk and the toilets was shown on various
        of our drawings. For example the drawing 6648/16 (a copy is enclosed)
        shows the way in which the foundations had to be orientated to miss
        the toilets and also the kiosk. This drawing was submitted for
        Building Regulations approval. Drawings 7 and 9 were issued for
        distribution to the Working Party together with others to explain
I       our scheme, on 23 December 1985 (see last page of attached copy
        of my letter). These drawings each show parts of the toilets or
I       of the kiosk protruding from under the stand (copies enclosed).
               The drawing No. 6648/9 showing the rear elevation of the stand,
        which was included with our planning application in July 1985 shows
        the upper part of the kiosk projecting into the sheeting.   Our
        drawing No. 6648/7 which was also distributed via the Working Party
        secretariat in December, 1985, shows the toilets and kiosk protruding
        from under the roof of the Kop

                 The Building Control department was visiting the site very
          frequently during late February and March, 1986, to watch the
          piles being installed immediately alongside the t0iletsandthe
          kiosk. Visits have taken place frequently since May.
                 I am at a loss, therefore, to understand why this matter is
          being raised now. However, the kiosk is not used for storage.
          All saleable material is taken back to a central store after each
    ~     game.     During a match the goods on sale consist of no more than
    ~e    packets of crisps, and Bovril, tea and Coke served in paper cups.
          The number of cups and packets of crisps is not great and there
          is no significant fire hazard.
                 The kiosk performs exactly the same function as the several
          kiosks inside the south and north stands. These kiosks are also
          on exit routes, and have never been considered a hazard by the
          Fire Service.
                  One matter which might cause concern is the fact that the
          roof of the kiosk is combustible. If this matter is considered
          critical, the Club would no doubt be prepared to put a fire resistant
           inner and outer skin on the roof.


I ~<O
    (f)     The discussion on evacuation times which has arisen in the
      last month was apparently sparked off by the Popplewell report
          recommendation No. 24. This says that the Green Guide should be
          revised to make it clear that the suggestion of an eight minute
          evacuation time is concerned with ’the effect of crowd turbulence
          on the rate of flow’ which arises if there are delays in evacuating
           spectator accommodation.
                  It may be that the wording of the Green Guide had not
           always been understood by other licensing authorities, but there
           was no misunderstanding on this matter in the South Yorkshire
           Working Party when the ground was granted its Safety Certificate
           in 1979. The calculated evacuation time for the Kop with its
           pre-certificate capacity of 20,000 (23,000 until the Ibrox disaster
           in 1971) had been about 16 minutes (or 18} minutes pre 1971).
            At that time there were far fewer crush barriers to control
            turbulence in the crowd, and the barriers were not so strong.
        EASTWOOD b PARTNERS




          The very experienced police officers on the South Yorkshire
          Working Party, who had been in attendance at games for many years,
          sa, id they had never seen turbulence occur when the crowd was
          sufficient to give an evacuation time in excess of 8 minutes.
          SU
          It should be remembered that through the 196o’s ~ ,e~~.~
          It
         .~c~’h~ ~u=n that more than ii,OOO people would be on the
          Ko] at almost every game (this number could just get out in
         Kop
         88zminutes with the exits as they were at that time).
                   The present Chief Fire Officer, Mr. Harry Wright, was
         on
          ~n the Working Party at the time. He requested an extra exit
        route
          ~O~     from the very top of the Kop. This was constructed by the
        Club
                at a cost of £16,OOO (1979 prices).    He was prepared to
        count the exits onto the pitch as part of the evacuation system
i       in an emergency (each gate is controlled by a policeman). With
        these measures the evacuation time in an emergency was brought
        below eight minutes, and disregarding the gates onto the pitch the
        evacuation time in normal circumstances with a full Kop (16,850)
        would be 113/4 minutes (see attached extract from Minutes of
        Working Party dated 2 April 1979).
                  The Fire Service at that time took the view that the very
i        slight risk of turbulance (if there really is such a risk) could_
         not justify greater expense to the Club. The Fire Service in
    ~?~ its advisory role is always having to balance money against
    *~/O slight or very slight risk, and this was a calculated decision
        which Mr. HoE. Wright supported.
i              I area frequent attender at   the ground. The police are
        there every week. There has never    been an occurrence to my
i       knowledge of turbulance associated   with this 113/4 minute
        evacuation time in the seven years   since the ground received
i       its Safety Certificate. The police can give their own view.
               I know that at other grounds longer evacuation times have
        applied without there being the slightest trouble. For example,
        at Bramall Lane, the evacuation time was almost 20 minutes at
        the Bramall Lane end until the new exits were constructed onto
        Bramall Lane near the centre of the stand about three years ago.
        There had never been ’turbulance’ of the kind envisaged in the
        Green Guide as far as I know.
               Further, in recent years Various police forces have
        adopted a policy of keeping the gates closed at one end of the
                                                                       SHEET 8.

       EASTWOOD 8’ PARTNERS




           ground for iO minutes or so after a match to keep th~ ~---~
                 ==~,     i~ ~ ~ne e~gn~ minute rule in perspective.
                  The words ’eight minute rule’ are not really correct
          of course. The Green Guide uses the words ’it is suggested’.
i
i
          It is not nearly so positive as it is about its other
          recommendations.
                  With this as background the Club has been quite shocked
I ~i~
          by the suggestion that the gates onto the pitch should be ignored
I         in the calculations of evacuation times, and that eight
         minutes should be achieved by means of ordinary exits. They
          feel this change of view cannot be justified,
                                                         The fact that
          Popplewell has clarified what it is the Green Guide suggests
          is of no relevance in Sheffield where we have always interpreted
i        the Guide correctly. The change of View is not the result of
         Popplewells clarification.
I                If the City Council chose to ignore the gates onto the~
         pitch in setting the number of spectators which will be
I        allowed the effect would be to limit the capacity of the enlarged
         Kop to almost the same as it has been since 1979. The completely
~   ~ new exit which has been built at the south end of the Kop, and
         the widening of the exit at the north end, will only cancel out
         the loss of the exits onto the pitch.
                 It should be emphasised that the provision of the new
       decking to accommodate almost 6000 more spectators, the new
il     exit routes, extra toilets, and the part of the roof over the 6,000
       extra places, will have cost about £500,000. It has stretched
       ingenuity to find room for the new exit routes, as the Fire
       Service will I am sure agree. I see no way in which further exitS
       could be provided even if there were unlimited money available.
              However, it should be brought to the attention of the City
       Council that I entered into discussion with the South Yorks
       Working Party at a very early date and kept them informed of our
       proposals regarding the exit arrangements for the Kop at all times.
       In particular, I sent a clear exposition of our proposals in a
       letter dated 25 October, 1985. It will be seen that near the end
        EASTWOOD b PARTNERS




I       of the letter I described the proposed new exits and enclosed
        drawings showing their positions. I also gave the arithmetic on
        which our proposals were based (see copy attached).
         ¯          ~-~P ~-~ .~ ~±a~ ~re une Working Party on
        13 November, 1985, and their decision was sent to me in a letter
i       from S.Y.C.C. dated i~ November 1985. A copy is enclosed. It
        w:ill    be seen       that under item 2 on page 2 it is stated that the
I ....~ Working Party "agreed with your calculations and proposal to increase
    .... the tunnel exit on the north side of Spion Kop to 8 clear units
    ¢~ and
I            to provide a complete new 6 unit staircase on the South side".
                The only change we have made since that submission in
I        October is to improve the arrangements by widening the tunnel
         exit to 9 units instead of 8.

I               In the light of that completely unequivocal acceptance of
         proposals last November the Club has proceeded with the scheme
         in its entirety. The Fire Service did not voice any second thoughts
         until July, 1986, by which time the structures were virtually
         complete. It is now not feasible to construct a new exit route.
         The new decking for the extra places, the new exit routes, and the
         extra cost of making the roof large enough to provide the extra
    ~;~h places amounts to about £500,000. This would now be wasted.
                It is quite unacceptable that with the Popplewell report
         being published in January, 1986, only a few weeks after our proposals
         had been approved by the Working Party, the Fire Service did not
         give any indication of a possible change of mind until July, 1986.
         This is clearly maladministration in the Club’s view.
                The Club did not make the decision to install the extra
        decking until March, and did not erect it until June/July. If the
         change of policy had been indicated earlier the Club could have
         been saved much of the additional expense.




               With regard to the proceedings on Thursday, we would like to
        have a clear statement of all the points which cause concern, so
        that we can properly answer them. I presume that the various matters

       wall be explained to the Committee by officers of the Council or
       by the Fire Service representatives. Followingthat, I presume
       we will be allow~d to ask questions. It will then be our turn to

              Finally, I suggest there will be a brief summing up.
              I mentioned in our telephone conversation yesterday that
i      the Club thinks it would be very helpful to the Committee in
       coming to its decision if At would inspect the Kop. Indeed we
I      believe it will be very difficult for them to get a true picture
    ¢Oto enable them to make a fair decision from drawings. They would
       be welcome to visit on Friday afternoon, say if they decide to
       reconvene their meeting at Hillsborough, or such other time as
       will suit their convenience.

           The main tension reinforcement in a corbel should be designed and the strength of the corbel checked,
        on the assumption that it behaves as a simple strut and tie system. The reinforcement so obtained should
        be not less than 0.4 % of the section at the face of the supporting member and should be adequately anchored.
        At the front face of the corbel, the reinforcement should be anchored either by welding to a transverse
        bar of equal strength or by bending back the bars to form a loop; in the latter ~ ,’,," ~,"- "-" ~e .,.

           ;;hen the corbel is desig, ned to resist a stated horizontal force, addkional reinforcement should be pro-.
        vided to transmit this force in its entirety; the reinforcement should be welded to the bearing plate and should
        be adequately anchored within the supporting member.
           Shear reinforcement should be provided in the form of horizontal links distributed in the upper two.thirds
        of the effective depth of the corbel at the column face;~this reinforcement should not be less than one-half
        of the area of the main tension reinforcement and should be adequately anchored.

        5.2.4.2 Comimom co~ete nibs. Where a continuous nib less than 300 mm decp provides a bearing as on a
        boot lintel, the nib should normally be designed as a short cantilever slab in accordance with the following
|       provisions and definitions:
         (1) the projection of the nib should be sufficient to provide an adequate width of bearing for the type of

I       member to be supported (see 5.Z.4.3)° The reinforcement in the nib and any reinforcement in the supported
        member should have a minimum nominal overlap on plan ot"60 mm;
           (2) the line of action of the load should be assumed to occur at the outer edge of the loaded area, i.e. at the
!       front edge of the nib, at the beginning of the chamfered e(lge, or at the outer edge of the bearing pad as
        appropriate;
           (3) the maximum bending moment in the nib should be taken as the product of the load supported and the
!       distance from its line of action to the neares~vertical leg of the links (see (6) below) in the beam. The tension
        reinforcement in the nib should not be less than that required by 3.11.4,1 and should be adequately anchored;
           (4) the tension reinforcement should extend as near to the front face of the nib as considerations of
!       adequate cover will allow and be anchored there, either by welding to a transverse bar of equal strength or
        by bending the bars through lg0° to form loops in the horizontal or vertical plane. Vertical loops should, be
        of bar size not greater than 12 ram;
          (5) the shear resistance of the nib should be checked in accordance with 3.4.5.1 except that ~, given in
        Table 14 may be multiplied by 2d/a.. where a. is the distance defined in (3) above:               .


    I      (6) links capable of transmitting, in addition to any other forces which they resist, the load from the nib
        to the compression zone of the main beam should be provided in the main beam.


    I   $~.4.3 Width of l~mria~s for ,orecm’t Hits. The width of bearing of precast units should be sufficient to
        ensure proper anchorage of tension reinforcement (see 3.11.7.1). Precast units should have a bearing of at
        least 100 mm on masonry or brickwork supports and of at least 75 mm on steel or concrete; this bearing may
        be reduced at the discretion o£ the engineer, taking into account relevant factors such as tolerances, loading,
    I   span, height of support and the provision of continuity reinforcement. Nevertheless, when reduced bearings
        are used, the minimum anchorage lengths of reinforcement required by 3.11.7.1 must be provided and
        precautions must be taken to ensure that collapse of the unit cannot occur due to accidental displacement
        during erection.

        $.2.4.4 Burin~ stresses. The contact surfaces should not contain excessive irregularities and when adequate

    I   intermediate padding is not provided, the compressive stress in the contact area should not normally
        exceed 0.4f,, under the ultimate loads. When the members are made of concretes of different strength, the
        lower concrete strength is applicable. Higher bearing stresses may be used where suitable measures are taken
        to prevent splitting or spalling’of the concrete at the interface, such as the provision of well-defined bearing

I                    Safety of Sport Grounds Act, 1975
                   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club plc
           Thank you for your letter of 18 December, 1985enc3~sing~m
      comments of the Building Authority to which I would reply as follows:-

      Disabled Facilities
           There is no doubt that the Kop is covered by the Building
           Regulations and that we shall need Building Regulations
           approval. However, there has effectively been no change
           in the 1985 Regulations.
           Even if there were a change in Regulations, it is obviously
           commonsense that facilities for the disabled apply to the
           ground as a whole and not to one particular building. At
           the moment there are perfectly adequate facilities under
           the overhang of the roof of the North stand. There is a
           level approach. The disabled are under the co~e~ of the
           cantilever roof. Any facilities at the front of the Kop
           would be less sheltered from the rain, and more prone to
           disruption by the fans immediately behind. It is not a good
           place at all for disabled people.

              With regard to the proposal that a glazed shelter might
              be placed over the’disabled accommodation in front of the
              North stand, it was not our intention that any seats within .
              the North stand would have an obscured view although a few
              of the spectators might have to look through the glass of
              the canopy to see the near touchline. There are materials
              available for the glazed roof.which might prove to be safe for
              that purpose.                    .,                            .o
              I regard it as regrettable that there has been such a
              negative attitude on this particular matter. We have not,
              of course, taken the design study any furt3er with regard
              to the possibility of a covering for part of the disabled
              area nearest to the Kop end of the North stand, but would
              reconsider the matter if the Working Party has a change of
              heart.

              Enlarged Kop
                   With regard to the request for a barrier to protect
              the ladies toilet, it has perhaps not been realised that
              there is handrailing already in place. A gap will be
              created for an entrance to the ladies toilet. The
              final version of the proposed arrangements is shown on
              the attached print of drawing number 6648/53. The new
              brickwork is shown shaded.


     ~’.!   Roofing the Kop
                    We are really surprised by the suggestion that the
               steel frame of the gable walls and presumably the back of the
               stand should be sheeted over. It is a common feature of
               every stand structure that I know of in any football ground
               in the country that the. sheeting rails and other bracing
 I             members are exposed on the inner face. In older structures
               they are generally only at 1.2 m centres but in more modern
               structures they are generally at 1.8 m centres. With the
               1.8 m spacing it would be extremely difficult indeed to
               climb up except adjacent to a column. However, I know of
               no instance where the sheeting rails of an existing stand
               are regarded as being such a hazard that they should be boxed
               in, with an inner skin as well as an outer Skin. I find
                it very surprising that this matter is being pressed.

                   This correspondence on these matters leads me to believe
             that there would  be great advantage if the Club’s advisers were
    ¯                      I
             present for part of each of the meetings of the Officer Working
i            Party. Matters of this kind need to be discussed ro~Lnd the
             table rather than in lengthy correspondence. We can be of great
I            assistance in providing information which may result in fewer
             matters becoming contentious. It is also inevitable that we

            to give the opportunity to co---ent at an early stage. The

I           plans are incomplete in some respects and this may lead to
            misunderstanding of what is intended or a lack of appreciation
            of the th~ng behind what is proposed. There is also the
            difficulty~in the light of comments received from the Club, and
            indeed those from the Working P~ty, quite significant
            changes may take place at a very late stage. It is desirable
            that any late changes be dealt with in as short a time as
            possible. In this regard ~ now enclose six prints of each of
            our drawings numbers 7Cr 8Ar 9Ar 17A and 56. As ~he Club
            will be wishing to place an order for the mew building ~ot
            later than the end of January, it may be that an oral l~:~-sentatior~
            to your Working Part of what is proposed might be bene~al
            all round.

                              Yours faithfully,

                tne ~roup conciudea that this so-called "’eight n~ute rule’" woa concerned solely with the effect
                of crowd turbulence (arising from delays in evacua~ng specator accommodation) on the rate of
                flow. It was not related to emergency evacuation time criteria (see paragraph 32 below) and the
                Group recommends that the Guide sko~d ~ thb clear.




II(o    Photocopy of Recommendation 24 from Final Popplewell Report.




                  6.5 Recent research has indicated that when it takes more than
                 .7 minutes to vacate an area of sr~ctator acconimoo~don the
                  ~d no~ ~d~ to ~,m~ U~u~ In th~ con~o~ in-
                  dividuals can lose control over their own movement and the rate
                 of flow may be reduced. It is therefore su2gested that the exits
                 from each area of spectator a=ommodation shbuld be so designed
                 that the spectators can. if desired or r~uired, leave that area in
                 8 minu~s or less.

         le    Scope and Objectives of DiscUssions

          Mr. H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were
          ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best in Europe. Crowds had been
          averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
    ~A had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
    \ ~’vlable, and it was hoped to expand this side of the Club’s activities. The Club’s
          eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

         IT WAS AGREED -
         1. That, whLlst Designating Orders did not specify time limits for the issue of
         General Safety Certificates, it was essential to aLm for the Certificate to be issued
         by the start of the 1979/80 Season.



                                                 .




!
!
|      2.    That, as the Club wanted to attract representative games, the aim should
       be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.


!      3. That as much work as ~ssible should be carried out in the close season,
       bearing in mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
       will be more restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah’s Witness Rally had

!      also to be borne in mind.

       2. Discussion on Standing Areas

|     A. Spion Kop


|     IT WAS AGBEED -

      1. That the slting and angle of the new barriers t~) be installed be the subject

|     of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

      2. That the Club consider the installation of simple lateral barriers (not of the
I O   climb proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
      central block (but not so as to obstruct the gangways).


I     3.    That, in view of the clearance time of 11~ minutes compared with the
      8 mivutes specified in the Guide, the means of escape be discussed in detail
      between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service ~includin~ the re-sitl-~ of the gZtes
I     "~n the existing barriers and, possibly the widenin~ of the existing, gates and/or
      an increase in their number).

I     4. That the headroom at the North end under the bridge be increased to the
      maximum possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

!     5. That representative parts of the concrete wall and boundary posts and fences
      be tested to the appropriate standards.

      6. That the condition of the concrete at the lower end, the height of some of the    .w
      crush barriers and the scoreboard structure,be the subject of detailed discussions   ej
      between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.
I     7. That the Club’s longer term proposals for the improvement of the means of

i     egress be unanimously welcomed.

      8. That the maximum capacity of the Spion Kop be determined after the foregoing
      points have been resolved.

             I have now received the detailed comments of all of the disciplines
             represented on the Working Party.

             These have been collated into the attached schedule which, together with
             plans, confirm formally in writing the matters discussed by the Working
             Party with the Club over the series of meetings held so far and which
             the County Council feel require attention so as to secure reasonable
             safety at the Ground.

             They are, of course, individual requirements on specific matters and are
             additional to the general requirements set out in the specimen form of
             General Safety Certificate forwarded to the Club with my ietter of
             8th December, 1978, and discussed at the meeting held on 13th December,
             1978o

             After the Club has had the opportunity of considering the schedule, perhaps
             you would let me know which of the requirements you feel will be able to
    (°       be carried out in the close season.

             Should you have any queries, Mr, D. Vaughan of my staff (ext, 422) would
!            be happy to discuss them with you.

                     Sheffield Wednesda~ Football Club Ltd.
                          Splon Kop Development
          As design of the roof over" Splon Kop and the extension of the
     terracing proceeds ¯we’thought ’that the Working Party should be
     given an early opportun’ity to comment upon the proposals. At this
     stage the roof, °although it will be an impressive structure, does
 ~i:~:~ not h01d the individual interests of all members of the Working
   ~arty and we will deal with the roof at a later date. However, we"
       would, like to discuss the parameters surrounding provision for the
       disabled, the increased capacity of the Splon Kop and the exit routes
       as we see them.                        "" ~" ~- " ’~-:’ "
         :’~ Enclosed are six prints of our drawings 6648_/7, 8, 9, !6 an_a_ 17
       showing in outline t~Je areas of terracing for the enlerged Spion
       xop to e, r with the e’ Its.: .... --
            It was inltlally th0ught°::that the disabled could be aucommodated
       along the front of Spion Kop between the North stand in front of the
       perimeter fence, which would be set back about two-metres. There
       are disadvantages to this proposal. The advertising boards would
       need to be mounted well into tb~ perimeter track level reducing
       its width. The disabled would be in the ’firing line’ of mis-~ued
        8




            shots on goal but also it would mean that the emergency exit
            gates could possibly be obstructed. Providing suitable ~. :~!
            protection for them from the weather would also be difficult.
            The new roof cannot be   Dro4er~-~

            ~,= ~r~ection and a purpose made, low level cover, could
            obscu~ethe vision of spectators behind them.
              There are ways round these difficulties and it is not
        one hundred percent certain that the disabled will not eventually
        be accommodated along the front but the present favour~ proposal
        ~s to Ibave them where they ~re, in front of the North stand, and
        provide them with a cover. The cover may be constructed using a-
        timber frame with clear polycarhonate ioof sheets so as not
        to obstruct the vision of People ~t~ind them in the stand.
              The number of wheelchairs attending matches variee but it
        probably everages about 33. As you would expect the number
         increases to say 40 or more for the attractive matches. The
         ambulant disabled occupy normal seats in the stands.
              To serve hhe disabled whether they are placed in front of
         the North stand or eventually along the front of Spion Kop we
        propose that toilet facilities are provided, possibly beneath
         the eerracing adjacent to the ramp leading down the side of the
    ~ North stand gable.. We _calculate. that. tb~ new capacity of SDion
                will be Zl,SSo, without the disabled a!ong front.
t                The number of exit widths required to evacuate the terrace
            in eight minutes is therefore 46.   The unit widths of the exits
            are shown on the prints.
                  The tunnel exit on the north side will be increased in width
            to  eight clear units whilst a complete ..new six unit staircase
             J
            is proposed for the south side.. ’,(o

            you wish to have a meeting to discuss the proposals we shall

         Dear Sirs,
         Safer7 of Sports Grounds Act, ,1975
         Sheffield Wednesda7 Football Club plc
         The.0fficerWorkin~ Par~~ {Sheffield District) me~ yescerda7 afternoon to
         consider the proposals c0ntainedin your letter dated 251h October, 1985
         and accompanTinR plans.
         I.    Disabled Facilities

|        The Officer Working Party expressed reservations on both of your suggestions
         for the disabled. If the disabled continue 1o be acco~nodated in front of
         the North Stand, they will still be in the "firing line" of mis-aimed shots
         and any clear sheetinE over the top of the area they occupy could constitute
|        an unacceptable hazard 1o persons who might vacate the North Stand in an
         emergency situation by climbing over the front wall of the stand onto the
         pitch perimeter. It is accepted that the means of escape does not provide
|        for this 1o be done, buC it has 1o be recognised that in practice this is a
         real possibility. The structural strength of such a structure could also be
         something of a problem. The ocher suggestion of accommodating the disabled

I        in front of the perimeter fence along the front of the Spion K~p (nearest 1o
         the North Stand) is also unacceptable for the reasons stated by you.

ill ~. The suggestion of the Police representatives was that the front area of the
|  =~i:~ lower Spion Kop (nearest 1o the North Stand) should have the terracing
   ~iOlevelled 1o provide, say, a ~wo-tier level landing on which 1o accommodate
         the disabled, with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch
II       perimeter fence in front of this area could be removed, and the disabled
         could continue 1o gain access from the ramp between the Spion Kop and the
        North Stand as at present. This would also enable free access by the
         disabled 1o the proposed disabled toilets under the rebuilt terracing of
         the SpionKo~;

                                                                                        /Contd. . .

     The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.
     In the circumstances, the Officer WorkinE Party consider that the
     proposals for the disabled suggested by the Police should be supported
     subject, of course, to there being no obstruction of exit routes and
     flows.
     2.     Enlarged Spion Kop
     The Officer Working Party agreed with your calculations =~ proposals to
     increase the tunnel exit on the north side of the SpionKop to 8clear                        L


     According171 the Officer Work~n~ Party agree rh~t~ subject to the follow, n:.
     points, the proposals for the enlarged Spion Kop are generally acceptable:~               ¯" ~.


     (a) adequate   headroom being provided between the new roof and the upper            T
           rear and the new south side exit routes;                                       -k
           to battlers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents’
I          toilets and the new ladies’ toilets in the new six unit staircase
           on the south side;
     (c)   to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
I    (d)
           gates in the pitch perimeter fence (as at Bramall Lane);
           to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
           the south side and on the Penistone Road side;
I    (e) until   acceptable alternatives are available, the new exit gates to
           be fitted with a turn-bar arrangement under the control of stewards.
i    3.    Roofin~ of Spion Kop
     It was accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals has been supplied
     to date, but the Building Authority point out that it appears that the gables
     are not to be lined and thus it would be comparatively easy for them to be     r
     climbed.
     Also the Police asked me to stress that should any of the proposed works on
     enlarging or roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the close season,
     it will be a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be secured to
I    prevent unauthorised access.

     4.    Crowd Flow at the Leppin~sLane end of the Stadi,--
I    The Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the merging of spectators
     from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Lane end.

I    It was agreed that it was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the
     physical restraints to achieve this could conceivably be more of a danger than
     allowing the present position to continue, but I was requested to register the
I    point.
                                            Yours faithfully,

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
 SAFETY CERTIFICATES:
 SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB, HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD.

 I write with reference to the above and following the recent
 telephone conversation that took place between my Environmental
 ~ealth Officer, Mr. Moore, and your Mr. Addy.

 I would confirm that a number of defects are felt to be in
 exlstance with regard to structural aspects of the clu~s extended
 "splon kop" and tha~ these may constltu~e a significant hazard to
 members of the public using this facility.   These include the
 apparent lack of a suitable pedestrian guard rail, the unsuitable
 positioning of radlatln~ gangways and the gradient of the terracing
 at some areas.


My officer understands that, in the opinion of the H.S.E., these
matters are best dealt with by the provisions of the above
legislation and hence by the Local Authority Licensing Team.
Furthermore I understand that you do not wish to attend a
programmed site visit or make represetations to the clu~s
Management upon these matters.

 I shall, with your approval, convey these findings to the Council’s
 Chief Licensing Officer so that he may request a safety input into
 the certification procedure from my Department.


 Yours faithfully,

Eop to 21,000 spectators subject to the follovin~ eonditfoua:-

     ($)     that the ~nfi!!tn~ of crush barriers takes place prior to the match
             on 25th August:

     (b)     the oth,)r ~rk referred to before tho Pane] be ompleted u~th~n 2
             woeks (~.c. by 4th S~ptember 19S6):

             extra stevardin~ bo provtSed during the next 2 matches to the
             tatisfaction of the Fire Service and the PolJce.

Obviously. all work ts to ~ carrte~ out to the satisfaction o* the
Certlficatln~ Authority and the Panel authorised me to take any neceasat’y action
to secure cmep1~anc~ w’.th the abov~ conditions.




                                                                       I   /

             ~~t~urlng gr. Bownes’
                             visit to the match on 25th August It ~s noted that very.
         llttlc of the fencing vhlch should have been installed to protect the sheeting
         at th~ rear and s~des of the ~op was in fact In place and (t is also understood
         that the P.A. System on the Kop was not in operation during that match. Xt was
         also noted that several pieces of fencing were ~n tact v~_red to the structure of
         the Xop presumably as a temporary measure. I consider these items important and
         that tt’s in everyone’s interest that tbey are dealt trith !nmedlately and in
         any event before the match on 30th August.

                  During the summer inspection Inspector Calvert asked for some //I
   of the barriers at the Leppings Lane end of the ground to be
   removed so as the allow easier access into the various pens.

   Rather than ask Ackroyd & Abbott’s sub-contractor to do the work,

                           SAFETY AT SPORTS GR~NDS - REVISED EDITION
                           OF THE GUIDE TO SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS


          I have gone through thewhole of this extremely comprehensive doc~nent
          and whilst a considerable amount of the contents is applicable to management
          of the club, engineering proble~ and fire officers, certain paragraphs
          are worthy of mention in relation to Sheffield Wednesdays Football Ground


          Paragraph 16 relating to crowd pressures. As you are aware the kop has
          had a tendancy at recent matches to produce this wave effect and it is
          necessary that when a large match is anticipated in the future, we should
          ensure that the numbers allowed onto the kop strictly adhere to the capacity
          allowed. It is imperative therefore that the automatic counting system       m
          is always in working order for ’A’ and ’B’ category matches, such as the
          visits of Manchester United, where almost capacity crowds can be expected.

          Paragraph 23 onwards lays down tile management responsibility very clearly ~"
          and is to be welcomed, since there ha,’c i nthe past, been grey areas~s to
          who is responsible for crowed control et~./

          Paragraph 28 recommends the appointment of a safety officer and identifies
          his duties. I can only presume that the safety efficer is in fact ~ Lock, /kJ0
          although I have never heard him designated as such. this should’n
           clarified with the club. Furthermore, in the discussion of a central
           control point being designated (other than then police control), one would       ""
           assume that the central centrol point designated in respect of the Sheffield
          ’Wednesday ground would be [ne video viewing room in the south stand.

           Paragraph 43 relates to records of tests kept and examination of the ground.
           I am not aware that these are kept by the club.

           Paragraph 199 relates to exercises of stewards regarding emergency procedures
           and I am not aware that the club have ever carried out exercises in this
           respect.

           In conclusion, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have complied with the      I/
           8uide to a very large extent, more so I would suspect, than the majority
           of clubs in .the country, and it is only on minor points as identified above
           where improvements could be made, so far as police procedures are concerned.

                                                                            /
    Thank you for your letter dated 3rd November, 1986, in respect of the above
    Club.

    Please find below my observations in response to outstanding matters.

    An inspection of the ground was carried out on 17th November, 1986. The
    comments appended below do not take into account the numbers of persons using
    individual areas, lateral and radial gangways or units of exit widths, as
    it is assumed that from previous correspondence and documentation that the
    various working parties and committees have adequately dealt with these items.

     MEANS OF ESCAPE IN CASE OF FIRE

     North Stand

     Timber framed and clad buildings are constructed and located under the stand.

     The only reference as to the acceptance is minuted in meeting dated 7.8.85
     in which one large store for bulky items was agreed on a temporary basis.

     There is also no record to indicate whether these buildings have been treated
     with fire retardant paint or solutions. Confirmation is required as to treat-
     ment of these buildings.

     Spion Kop
     A.      Timber framed and clad unit located on main central exit route has not
             received any approval, no approach has been made by the Club for its
             installation, this should be removed immediately.

     S.      It is understood that the gates in the pitch perimeter fencing form l~
             part of the emergency exits. The gates for reasons of security, fasten


                                All communications to be addressed to the Chief Fire Officer. O0~UME~ ~. ~ ~ 0
                                                                                                                                 I
      with barrel bolts secured to the gate both top and bottom and open in IH
      a sideways direction.      It is doubtful that if it were necessary to
      evacuate the stand onto the pitch in an emergency that the gates would
      open if pressure were generated by a crowd. No record can be found
      in respect of discussion on gate fastenings. It is recommended that
      a satisfactory security device easily openable from the pitch side should
      be found and fitted to all perimeter gates.

C°    During the inspection it was observed that several concrete steps on
      the lower terracing were in need of repair and in one case the complete
      step had erroded away. Every endeavour should be undertaken to ensure


D.    The wire mesh protecting the stanchions and bracing supports from being
      climbed is ineffective.     It has been observed that patrons visiting
      the Kop can, in l~ge numbers from the back of the Kop, climb into the
      lower half of the roof. The mesh should be extended to alleviate this
      situation.

      It was observed that where the terracing is above I m higher than the
      lateral gangways wire mesh infill had not been located along the full
      lengths. Where the mesh had been provided this had been spot welded
      but the mesh had not been given an additional vertical support.

Fo    Exit gates should be unlocked and keys held by stewards manning the
      gate before patrons enter the stands.

West Stand

A.    Timber framed and clad units located under this stand have been there
      for some considerable time. No record exists of:-

      (I)    acceptance of these units or,

      (2)    that they have been treated with fire retardant paint or solutions.




 The accommodation is divided into four areas:-

Ao    Ground floor offices, directors suite, players area, function suite,
      kitchen etCo

 B.   First floor, upper stand walkway, press lounge, players lounge, paint
      stores, disused bar area°

 C.    Lower stand, uncovered stand seating.

 D. Rear stand, covered seating.

 With respect to the four areas, the following observations are made:-

 A.   Ground Floor:-

            (i)   During normal working hours most doors from the office area
                  are kept locked shut. All doors marked ’Fire Exit’ should
                  be made readily available for use by any person within the area.
                                     -



       (ii)   A number of rooms at this level i.e. kitchen, laundry, stores
              and directors’ suite ventilate via openable windows and/or extract
              fans into the long corridor between areas A and C above. It
              also appears that a number of the openable windows are protected
              by corrugated, lightweight plastic sheeting.

              The separation between the corridor and such ground floor areas
              should be to a minimum half hour fire resistance, any ventilation
              requirements being met by ducting to outside on the South Wall.

      (iii) All storage should be removed from stairway enclosures., and these

                                         <
B,   First Floor:-

        (i)   Again, a numbe~ of rooms i.e. players’ lounge, press lounge,
              the store room previously used as a licensed bar and the paint
              store ventilate into this area. Any ventilation requirements
              should be met by ducting to outside on the South wall.

       (ii)   Valves should be fitted to the gas supply line to each of the
              five refreshment positions in order that the supply can be cut
              off should an emergency arise.

      (iii)   All timber construction within this area should be suitably
              treated so as to be flame retardant.

       (iv)   The paint stores contain a quantity of flammable paints and
              mixtures and present a hazard which it is considered should
              be removed from this area. Proposals to relocate the stores
              should be discussed with the Fire Authority before any work
              is commenced in order that suitable siting and any need for
              licensing under Petroleum legislation can be ascertained.

        (v)   The timber constructed cupboard and the portable sales kiosks
              should be removed from this area.

       (vi)   In the cleaners’ cupboard to this area, the fire resisting
              separation between the ground and first floor levels is breached
              by the passage of cables through a wall. The area around the
              cables should be infilled with material to ensure a minimum
              fire resistance of thirty minutes.

      (vii)   All rooms onto the upper stand walkway should be separated from
              it by minimum half hour fire resisting construction, any doors
              being to the same standard and made self closing onto 25 mm
              rebates.

     (viii)   Spaces above toilet accommodation are being used for storage
              purposes. Again, these areas must be maintained clear of storage.

C.   Uncovered Seating Area:-

     The means of escape from this area is along the corridor in front of
     the rear part of the stand. Should this route not be available then
     evacuation onto the pitch is possible subject to persons having ~the
     ability to climb over the front wall on to the pitch perimeter tr~hk.
     This wall is approximately 1.5 m high at the Spion Kop end decreasing
     to I m high at the West end.
                                           2a77



     To facilitate easier forward evacuation on to the pitch it is recommended
     that openings be provided in the wall at the foot of radial gangways.

D°   Covered Seating Area (Rear Stand):-

     The means of escape from this area is not considered to be satisfactory
     in that escape is possible in one direction only, this being down through
     areas described in A and B above.

     Subject to all the recommendations outlined in A and B above and made
     later in respect of automatic fire detection being implemented, the


AUTOMATIC FIRE DETECTION

In 1979 the working party discussed the provision of automatic fire detection
in the South Stand.

It is recommended that such provision should be made in all areas beneath
the seated area of the stand as soon as possible. The system should also
cover the Tavern Club which has a direct link on to the first floor corridor
of the South Stand.

The automatic detection provided should be tied in to the existing fire warning
system.

In order that persons using the Spion Kop can receive early warning of any
fire occurring in the "Stands" Club, it is also recommended that automatic
fire detection be provided in that Club.

EMERGENCY LIGHTING

Spion Kop

The emergency lighting has yet to be tested - no test certificate received.

South~ North and West Stands

In letter dated 12th November, 1980, from Eastwood and Partners, it was
suggested that following test certificates dated llth August, 1980, a period
of 5 years should elapse before re-testing for South Stand and 2 years for
North and West Stands. As of today no record appears to exist as to whether
these areas have been re-tested or that the test certificates together with
maintenance records have ever been re-presented.      The emergency lighting
system should therefore be re-tested for the whole of the ground and test
certificates produced.   In addition the whole of the system should conform
to SoS. 5266.

FIRE ALARM

West Stand

 Existing call points to be relocated to accessible positions outside of
 franchise areas and be increased to cover the upper areas of the stand.

 North Stand

 As West Stand above.

(OContents of letter dated 18.2.$7 (~YCFS - D Bo’~es]. were discussed, and agreed that
  these matters be taken up with t::e Club. ’~o~It:< _~g~.~:~ -~ the trmber buildings
     beneath stands, it was agreed that the C!ub "=e req.aes=ed to remove or resite these
     structures.
      With respect to locked doors under the South Stand, it was agreed that this matter
      would be dealt with under FP Act 1971. Fastenings to sliding gates were also
      discussed and a copy of a sketch showing a single hock arrangement for securing
      such doors was circulated¯ it was agreed that D Bownes would put this solution to
      the Club for their comments.
      Stewarding and securing of all gates was discussed and the Fire Service indicated
      that existing arrangements were only acceptable subject to exits being stewarded
      and unlocked during t00% of the time that the gro’.:nd :,’as in use for a designated
      purpose. Any relaxation of this would mean an insistance that panic fastenings
      only be provided.
      Discussion then took place on areas of responsibilit[.’ and ground inspections.
      On areas of responsibility D Bo’~n%es did not ~-:ant to be tied do~:n to individual
      references

      all others present would prefer definitive areas of responsibilit’: (a!~’’
      there must be some overlap] , David Bo~:nes preferred to refer bac.~: to a future
      meeting following further consideration of the matter.
      On ground inspections, D Bownes referred to the recent Lords deczsion that grounds
      should be inspected annually, he anticipated that this would mean a much more
      thorough examination than the oresent system of hi-annual inspections, and that this
      would be backed up by inspections during games.
       This was agreed by all nresent, but reservations about the suggestion that during
       game inspections be carried out by the whole workzng party were expressed by the
       Fire Service. It was agreed however that one such ’during game’ insoection would be
       set up and the outcome monitored.

                  S6 Isw
                   Dear Sir,
                  ,Safety of Sports,Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesda7 Football Club

                   In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to co-~ent on the
                   condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
                   have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
                   received them as yet,

                   The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
                   with the stadium and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
               I   receive is very satisfactory.
                   The Fire Service have, however, made a number of cot,,.ents and I attach for your
                   information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. Some points in the
                    letter have now been further clarified as follows:-
                    (a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
                    from the valkways.
                    (h) As far as the locked doors in the south stand ~e concerned they will be
                    dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

                    (ca~~Ces~st be unlocked and stewarded at all times, during matches: if this
                    ca~_~/arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.
                    I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory bat I would                    l~
                      arrAcularly like to refer to the cou~ents which are made in respect of final

          For the attention of D. O. Grimshaw


          Dear Sir,

          Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
          Future Administration of the Council’s Certificating Function
          Following a meeting on Tuesday 10th March I have given some further thought to
          the above subject.

          Many points were raised at the meeting but I thi~k that the general feeling was
          that the roles of each Authority involved in the system should be defined
          perhaps along the lines adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

          I have no objection in principal to roles being defined in this way but I should
(         make it clear that if it is agreed that particular Authorities adopt particular
          roles then they will be under a duty to consult with other interested parties
          where there is an overlap of interest. As I see it the Authority which carries
          out a particular role will have the responsibility of advising the Council as
          Certificating Authority on all matters falling within that Lead Authority role.

          I have drawn up a draft Schedule which attempts to define Lead Authority roles.
          I should point out that the draft is intended to be open for discussion and I
     d°
          would therefore welcome your comments on it. Would you please also let me know
          if there are any other matters which should be included in the Schedule.

          Moving onto the question of inspections of stadia, this point was alsodlscussed
          at the meeting on 10th March. My view is that the existing system of bi annual
          limited inspections is no longer appropriate; I feel that one major inspection
          per year should be carried out on each stadium which should include all the
          areas and installations within the scope of the legislation. To back up this
          inspection there should be a number of "during performance" inspections by
          Officers. I think that there is general agreement in relation to "during
           performance" inspections as they would highlight the performance of the safety
           system at each stadium whilst it is in operation.             Cont...

                                                                                                                                 734690 - Mr. Bownes

                                                                      -2-

                Perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
                Authority carries out such inspectionsindependentlywith a degree of central
                co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
                first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it might be
                appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives from
                all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
                escountered.
                ~^,,~-= ~- to the "wor~n~ nar~v" structure I think it is clear from the meeting
                 Of 10th Mazli~ =nat some clari£1catlou v£ i~ s~a~us ~s requ~re~, iL ~s
                 reasonably clear from the County Council’s records hhat the working party as
                 such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
                 powers. However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
                remain with a Committee or Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purposes
                 Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
                 myself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
                 as a forum for°4-iscussion-
                I take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
                a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
                to be submitted to the CerKificating Authority. I propose that when an
          oo-
                Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with
                my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then make arrangements for the
                meeting to take place. An agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
                meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will prepare a list
                showing the subjects ~iscussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
                Aathority. This list r~_’ll be circulated as well.

                Would you please consider the points I have raised and let me have your comments
                on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
                General Purposes Panel on the admiaistration of the Certification system.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Future Adalnlstratlon of the Council’s
Certificatin8 Function

Please note that I have arranged a meeting for all interested parties on
Thursday 16th July, 1987 at 9.30 a.a. in the Town Hall to discuss the above
matter further. I hope that the meeting trill produce a consensus view on future
administrative procedures which will form the basis of a report to the General
Purposes Panel of the City Council. I should eaphasise that no decisions have
yet been aade on this subject and any consents or suggestions whlch you have
will be most welcome. I intend that my report to the Panel will be near
completion by the end of July and it is, therefore, important that the maximm
advantage is taken of the meeting on 16th July.

This aeeting may also provide a useful opportunity to discuss dates for
inspections of the stadia prior to the beginning of the 1987/88 football season°

 Should the need arise please do not hesitate to contact my Chief Licensing
 Officer, Hr. Bownes on the ~aber given below.

 Yours faithfully,

         Dear Sir,

         Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
         Future Administration of the Council’s Certificating Fun,ctlon

         Following a meeting on Tuesday 10th March I have given some further thought to
         the above subject.

         Many points were raised at the meeting b~t I think that the general feeling was
         that the roles of each Authority involved in the system should be defined
         perhaps along the lines adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

         I have no objection in principal to roles being defined in this way but I should
         make it clear that if it is agreed that particular Authorities adopt particular

o        roles then they will be under a duty to consult ~rlth other interested parties
         where there is an overlap of interest. As I see it the Authority which carries
         out a particular role will have the responsibility of advising the Council as
         Certificating Authority on all matters falling within that Lead Authority role.

         I have drawn up a draft Schedule which attempts to define Lead Authority roles.
         I should point out that the draft is intended to be open for discussion and I
         would therefore welcome your comments on it. Would you please also let me know
         if there are any other matters which should be included in the Schedule.

         Moving onto the question of inspections of stadia, this point was also discussed
         at the meeting on 10th March. My view is that the existing system of bi annual
         limited inspections is no longer appropriate; I feel that one major inspection
         per year should be carried out on each stadium which should include all the
         areas and installations within the scope of the legislation. To back up this
         inspection there should be a number of "during performance" inspections by
         Officers. I think that there is general agreement in relation to "during
         performance" inspections as they wnuld highlight the performance of the safety
          system at each stadium whilst it is in operation.
                                                                                        Cont...

                                                                               734690 - Mr. Bownes
                                     Fo, mkq~ae ~mqu~r~ m ~ ~ ~ ri~ ...................... (sin Code ol4l)
                                                   Tim 64243 (Adminimio. ¯ I,ao~)
Perhaps "during perforuance" inspections could be arranged so that each
Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree of central
co-ordlnatlon to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it might be
appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives frou
all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which uay be
encountered.

l’tOVlIlg Ota 1:O line wOrKln~ pal~l.y ~’~":~.~tL-~ & ~IIjLnK J.t: £~ Ux~ett ~om ~tze ~Ct.~.~i~
of 10th Narch that some clarification of its status is required. It is
reasonably clear frou the County Council’s records that the working party as
such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
powers. However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
remain with a CommLttee or Sub-ComLtttee (in this case the Ceneral Purpose~
Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this ca~e
myself), I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
as a forum for discussion.

I take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
to be submitted to the Certificating Authority. I propose that when an
Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with
my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bow-~es, who will then make arrangements for the
meeting to take place. An agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will prepare a list
showing the subjects .discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
Authority. This llst will be clrculated as v~llo

Would you please consider the points I have raised and let me have your comments
on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

Yours faithfully,




 Head of Department

    Future Administration of the Councilts Certificating Function.


    Dear Sir,
                I refer to your letter dated 14 May, 1987.

                So far as the ’Division o~ Responsibilities between Authorities’ ~ concern



    to consultation being necessary with other authorkties.

                I feel that whereeer possible the SOSGA 1975 officer working party should        meet

    as a group and that the meeting should be minuted by the licensing authority. This leaas

~#~t good working~.~Q/lhip ~a~ all members of the working~ ~ ". ’~         ~ ,,~ p~yL~e     aware eq-~

    issues that ~%discussed and hopefully reso~ve~._-~, th~ -cctinG~gest




    ~t I am in general agreement with the ’Divisions of Respohsibilit~
    allowing for some ’Overlap’ in for exam ple~ means of escape~ emergency lighting, stadium

    capacity, evacuationprocedures, etc~                           "         ~ at a meetinE~
    with all parties present,                t               o "       "              "
    I ~ note that ’Communications’ is not ir~cluded and this is of particular concern to

    the police at stadia.

      o//I agree that there should be one major inspection of ~ stadia each year by the
    officer working party. ~o far as ’during performance’ visits are concerned, these are

    of course constantly monitored by police officers carrying out duties at the grounds.

         I am, as you will have noted from my prev&ous comments in full agreement with your

    recommendations at the penultimate paragraph of your letter, the officer working group

    having due regard to the 1986 issue of the Guide to Safety at Sports Ground which covers

    of course the areas of responsibility.

         Finally~ I note, as I understand do the fire service, that the areas of responsibilit
    allocated te the Director of Environmental Health and Consumer Services (Sheffield City

    Council) are generally covered by ’Means of escape’and that ’Food aa~ety and hygeine~

    toilet accommodation’ are not really matters for the Safety of Sports Ground Act Officer

    Working Party.
    ACC (n~
            Meeting of S.A.S.G.A.G - 16th July, 1987

            Mr. B~nes.opened the meeting and stated that’the discussions would be divided                  °.

            into four areas:-

            i. Definition of Rolls
            2.   Inspections
            3.   Status of Group
                                                                        .~


                  t was agreed that rolls should be broadly defined and responsibilities
             .



                 I!
                  aken on by the appropriate of the three "lead authorities" i.e. Police,
                  ire and Building Surveyors subject to agreement where overlam occurs.

            4.   Individual authorities to correspond to the spnrts grounds through the

                 Meetings of the group will be held at irregular intervals dependin~
                 on need and can be called by any member of the group. Individual
                 authorities need not attend specific meetings if they have no "interest".

                 Agendas will be issued prior to each meeting.

    Dear Sirs,

    SAFE~f OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 -
    DRAFT REPRISED SAFETY C~RTIFICATE COND-TTIONS

    in reply to your letter dated 7th July re the above, please find below
    the obse~¢ations of this Department:-

    Section $(a) An additiona! item a~reed with Barnsley and Doncaster Councils
                  in respect of their st-~ndard conditions is that the. axe .<


    Section 10(a) ~ilst specified in the ~een~-~uid.,
                                                 ~    itis difficult to
                   imagine how this task c~n be controlled by s~wards, This ~I
         I         matter should be considered further.

    Section 10(!) Reference should be made to the opening and securing open
                  of exits on the intiation of any emergency procedure or
                  at the end of a game and to assisting and directing spectators
                  out of the exits.

    Section 18     Add . . . "The emergency power supply should operate independ-
                   ently of the main power supply and come into automatic
                   operation on the failure of the latter and be capable of
                   maintaining the necessary power output for a minimum period
                   of three hours.

    Section 23     Reference to "compressed gas or liquid" should be ~ended
                   to . . . "flammable liquid or compressed gas (except fire
                   extinguishing apparatus)".

    Section 24     Add after "whatsoever" "whether combustible or not".

     Section 28    The old SYCC certificate required that the Police had knowledge
                   of the whereabouts of the doctor.

     Section 29    Again the old SYCC certificate required that members of
                   the press, T.V. and radio were identifiable.
~J




     Se,ction 35(d) This requires that the electrical installation be examined
                   and a report submitted to the Council every 12 months.
                   The same requirement should also apply to emerEency lighting,
                   and fire warning (including P.A.) systems.

     Section 35(f) Sub paragraph (iii) requires emergency liEhting to be tested
                   at least 24 hours prior to an activity. It would be preferable
                   that the original requirement of testing 3 hours before
                   ~n activity be maintained.

     T~o additional items for consideration are:-        ¯ ~=~

      (i)   That a competent electrician employed or retained by the Holder
            shall be present during a specified activity.

     (ii)   The Holder shall provide and maintain withLn the stadium to the
            satisfaction of the Co~ucil the access routes for emergency vehicles
            sho~m on the plmns.

     SCI{EDb~E - Interpretation

     ~ereas the old SYCC Certificate required certain mmtters (e.g. fire alarms,
     extin~ulshers e:co) and the maintenance of these to be to the satisfaction
     of the Chief Fire Officer, the proposed Certificate now requires these
     to be to satisfaction of the City Co,~ncil.

     This Department does not foresee this causing ~uy problems subject to
     copies of the required annual Certificates of test being fomcarded to
     us for examination.

     if there are ~uy queries on the above matters, please contact Divisienzl
     Officer Grimshaw.

     Also enclosed for your information is a list of sports grounds ~ud indocr
     sports premises within Sheffield and huo~ to this Department.

     Yours faithfully,

           SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB, PENISTONE ROAD,         SHEFFIELD
           SAFETY CERTIFICATION INSPECTION, 6TH AUGUST, 1987.
           I write with reference to the above and following our recent site meeting
                           o ............ ~ ..... ""     nt’s findings t the "Safety of
           requested, I would now submit my Departme
           Sports Grounds Advisory Group" and to yourself as Certificating Officer.

           Spion Kop

           i.        An area of the corrugated metal sheeting used as cladding
                     to the side of the Kop is corroded and torn.

           2.        It was noted that in some places the stair nosings serving
                     radial gangways had become defective.

                     At some positions within the new development there is a
             .
                     difference in height between a terraced area and radial gangway
                     of over 600-,,. As such these areas require to be protected by
                     a suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.

           4.        Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
                     minor repairs. It was agreed, however, that this defect would
                     be adequately controlled by means of "ongoing" maintenance.

                     The defective rendering to the final exit gate wall requires
             .
                     to be repaired.

            North Stand

            i.       It is important to ensure that the groundman’s store beneath
                     this stand is not used for the storage of potentially inflammable
                     fertilisers or weedkillers.

            Health and Safety - General
            le        At a number of points within the standium various pieces of
                      abandoned builders waste were readily available for use as
                      projectiles by the crowd. Such material should be collected
                      and suitably disposed of.

                      The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate
                      first aid equipment for the treatment of spectators should they
                      become ill or injured within the sports ground.

                 o    In order to ensure that the football club fully discharge their
                      duty to supply an adequate number of first aiders, I would require
                      that a minimum of 12 be employed to render first aid to sepctators
                      during an activity. If the club continue to use the voluntary
                      services of the St. John’s Ambulance Brigade, then it would be
                      necessary to formalise their relationship with them in order to
                      ensure adequate deployment.                           |

                                                                            Ii

         I am to understand that~the club is~now~re~ared to appoint,
         in writing, a safety officer of adequate status and authority.
         I would propose that he has the functions described in the draft
         safety certificate conditions.

     Conclusions

     During the inspection of the football club’s standium it became obvious
     that the stands and associated areas are subject to excellent standards of
     maintenance and upkeep.    Bearing in mind the size of the premises the

     impressed with the level of ground management being maintained.

     I would advise that the identity and role of the Ground Safety Officer be
     formalised in accordance with the green guide and without undue delay.

                        Introduction

                        The Panel will recall that on ist April 1986 the City Council inherited from the
                        South Yorkshire County Council the role of cerrlflcatlng Authority under the
                        1975 Act. The Act itself is basically aimed at ensuring adequate standards of
                        safety at designated stadia; there are three of these in Sheffield at r_he moment
                        - Sheffleld Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield United Football Club., and the
                        Owlerton Sports Stadium. A detailed report on the Act and its application in
                        Sheffield was subm!tted to the Panel on 6th May 1986.                   /I / /~
                                                          ,.    ~       --
                        The Current Situation                                  ~ ~ ~2 ~.l~ ~

                        The Panel at its meeting in May 1986 identified several --in areas for further
                        investigation.
|
                        Firstly it was accepted at the time that the broad outlines of the
                        administrative system organised by the County Council should be continued for
                        the time being. This system has now been reviewed and the proposed
                        reorganisatlon is detailed later in this report.
i
i                       The Panel also asked that the Health and Safety Executive be kept informed of
i                       all matters relating to sports ground safety and that the Association of
|
                        Metropolitan Authorities also be asked about r.he HSE’s involvement. As far as
                        keeping the HSE informed of safety developments at the stadia the Execur_Ive mad~
                        it fairly plain that they would not make any co~ents. The practice ~as
                        therefore discontinued. The involvement of the AMA in nhe HSE issue has been
                        somewhat forestalled by action at central Covernment leve~ to review ~he HSE’s
                        relationship with local authorities; this review was announced in the
                        Covernment’s reply to the Popplewei1 Report but no results of that review have
                        yet been received. Fortunately, however, the Council’s Director of Health an~
                        Consumer Services has permitted his Officer’s to provide ahealnh and safety
                        input into the decision making process in relation to safety of sports grounds°   qD

                        This subsr.itution, therefore, 1emporarily covers the absence of an input from
                        the HSE.

                        The Panel also made reference to consultation on the safety of sports grounds
                        policy with the other District Councils in South Yorkshire. Unfortunately,
                        attempts at arranging consulta~ion meetings have been unsuccessful to date. ~
                        is proposed to try again to organise some consultations in the fairly near
                        future, perhaps when the Certification system has settled down in each area.

    Future Administration of the Council’s Certificatin~Function

    Follo~ing a thorough review of the legislation is has become c14~ ~ha~ a
    detailed adminisErative system needs to be established in connection" wish the
    Counc!l’s CertlficaEing function. Discussions on Ehls matEer have been underway
    for some time with the Police, she Fire Service, the Council’s Building
    Surveyor and the DirecEor of Health and Consumer Services on the establlshmenE
    of such a system.
    Accepting ~hat the Council as she Certlflca~ing Authority will act on shebasis
    of advice from experts (such as she Fire Service) the question arises as to how

    an Officer Working Par~y which was apparently used as a forum for discussion
    be~een Officers prior ~o ~he final formula~ion of advice So she Council. Tha
    parnicular working party also appeared to have had some decision making powers.

    As it is essential ~ha~ meetings take place due to she potential overlap of
    requirements in many areas, all she b~horlties and Officers have now agreed
    that it would be appropriate so establish a revised form of the working par~y t~ ")
    perform a similar function for she City Council. It is recommended ~hat she
    "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group" (which would consist of
    representatives from the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor’s
&   Uiv~slon and the Department of Heal~h and Consumer Servlces), would function as
    a forum for discussion between Officers; its most regular use would probably be
    the discussion of Itl of advice to she Council before they are finally
    formulated by the appropriate Authority. Meetingsof the Group would be held at

    li
    ~he request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request she Head of
    A~hnimistration and Legal Department woul~.arrange a meeting and despatch a llst
    ~f ine~s to be discussed. A~ the Conclusion of the meeting a further llst of
     tems would be. prepared and the details of action agreed to be taken~by each
    Authority would be noted. It is then anticipated that detailed written advice
    would be provided by each discipline an~ be acted upon as appropria~e.

    In addition r~e Head of Administra~ion and Legal Department will keep copies of
    all relevant correspondence which will be available to all partic!pants in ~he
    Group.                                      °

    Under" the old CountyCouncil administrative structure the different Authori~ies
    represented in their working party had fairly clearly defined roles within which
    no opera~eo Although it can be seen that there is some merit in this idea the
    areas of potential overlap of responsibility are quite extensive in dealing ~th
    spornn grounds. However It appears tha~ the various Authorities and Officers
    ~lsh for some definition of roles and the following have been agreed:-

             It is anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department would have an
             input to the Advisory Group on (a) aspects of general safety; (b) the general
         !   safety management of stadia; (c) various special items such as first aid
             requirements~ It will be appreciated that these areas of responsibility are not
             exhaustive but it is anticipated that any areas of doubt will be dealt wiuh-’b-y-"

                                                                                     b


             Inspections
             Moving on to a matter of more general policy it has been suggested .that one
             large scale inspection per stadium should be carried out by the Group backed up
             This proposal is in line with both the Popplewell Eeport and with licensing
             practice in other areas,
             Delegations

             There is also a further question to be dealt wlth at this stage and that relates
             to the day to day decision making required for the running of the Certification
             System, At the moment decision making powers rest ~-Ith the Panel but this. is a
     0       highly impractical arrangemen= which needs to be reviewed urgently, It seems -
             that as an interim measure all r~rine matters could be delegated to Head of
             Administration and Legal Department ~rith other matters remaining at the
             discretion of the Panel, It is proposed ~hat when the revisedCer~ificate
             Conditions are in force then the deleganlon will be --~ch more closely defined.
             Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment with the current Certificate of
             Conditions,
             Reco-,-endatlons
             The panel is recommended to:-

             (a) Note the current situation;
             (b) Approve the revised administrative system detailed in tb!s report including
                 the establishment of the "SafeLy of Spor~s Grounds Advlsory Group’,      qb

 Whilst it is not intended to restrict the time local authorities
 may feel should be devoted to this task, lnspections under
 section 10B (when taken with existing commitments to inspect
 designated spor~s grounds) should not result in significant
 resource implications. The scope of inspections under paragraphs
 3 and 4 of the Statutory Guidance, together with associated
 report work, are not intended to be as detailed or extensive as
 that often required of the holder of a safety certificate, or
 that which may sometimes be necessary prior to the issue of a
 safety certificate. In general, inspections are not expected to
 take more than about 2 man days per ground on average.
 To assist local authorities prepare a report and record of
 inspections a suggested basic format which can be adapted
 according to preference is enclosed at Annex A.

Supplaentary advic~ and explanatory notes to the Statutory
Guidance to local authorities given by the Secretary of State
under section 10B(2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975


Introduction
1. The following advice does not form part of the Statutory
Guidance given under section 10B of the 1975 Act. The following
advice is given in good faith but it should be remembered that
only the courts can rule authoritatively on interpretation of
points of law.
Objective of Inspections
2. The object of the inspections is to monitor the suitability
of the terms and conditions of the safety certificate (where
issued) in the light of any change in the condition of the ground//
and secondly, to assist local authorities in enforcing compliance//
with the terms and conditions of the safety ¯certificate or other I/
notice served on the ground occupier.
 3. Local authorities may wish to note that the inspection is
 not intended to shift responsibility for spectator safety away
 from the holder of any safety certificate or ground occupier, but
 rather to help see that he succeeds in achieving (and
maintaining) the safety standards intended to be set by any
 certificate for the number of spectators authorised to enter the
 ground for a specified activity.
General
4. As the size, age, configuration, condition and usage of
designated sports grounds as well as the attitude of management
can give rise to different inspection needs, the discretion of
local authorities to carry out more frequent or more extensive
inspections than is laid down by section 10B of the 1975 Act is
not restricted. The requirements of the Statutory Guidance have
been set at what is seen as the desired minimum likely to achieve
the objective described above leaving authorities free to add to
the content of the inspections or increase their frequency
according to locally determined needs. In this context local
authorities may wish to bear in mind that inspections carried out
under section 10B of the 1975 Act are in addition to, not a
substitute for those required to be carried out under the terms
and conditions of the safety certificate by or on behalf of the
bolder.
Inspection frequency
5. As section 10B(3) of the 1975 Act stipulates that an
inspection should take place of a "designated" ground at least
once every twelve months, this frequency must be observed even if
the issue of a safety certificate is delayed. Where a safety
certificate has not been issued, the inspections carried out
prior to its preparation and issue should be such as to fulfil
the requirements of the Statutory Guidance. Once a safety
certificate has been issued at least one further inspection of
                                                                °..
¯-




      the 9Tound should be carried out either:-
      within a year of its issue, or
      within a year of the last inspection, whichever is the earlier.
      Thereafter, inspections should take place at least annually from
      the date of the last inspection.
      Where an inspection of a sports 9Tound takes place at the
      discretion of the local aut.Lority for some other reason, for
      example as a result of proposed alterations or an application for
      amendment to the safety certificate, that inspection can be
      regarded as an inspection carried out under section 10B of the
      1975 Act provided the criteria of the Statutory Guidance are met.
      Inspection Team
      6. The Statutory Guidance allows the local authority to
O    determine how best to arrange and effect inspections under
     section 10B of the 1975 Act and does not stipulate that they
     should be carried out by a particular professional discipline.
     As it is nonetheless important that inspecting officers are      JY
     qualified for that purpose, the guidance places an onus on the
     local authority to be satisfied on this account. (The Guide to
     Safety at Sports Grounds (paragraph 36) envisages that
     inspections arranged by ground management will be carried out by
     someone who is professionally qualified. Local authorities may
     wish to consider whether inspecting officers should also be
     professlonally qualified.)
     7. Local authorities are also asked to bear in mind the
     potential advantages of a team approach to inspections under the
     Statutory Guidance and the role of the fire authority, building
     authority and the police. Local authorities in London and
     metropolitan counties may therefore wish to arrange at least one
     inspection per year to be carried out with a representative of
     the fire authority in attendance. Elsewhere, local authorities
     will no doubt wish to consider inclusion of a member of the fire
     service as well as a representative of the buildlng authority.
     Local authorities may also wish to consult the Chief Officer of
     Police so that the opportunity can be given for a police officer
     to attend at least one inspection each year. (It is not intended
     that these considerations should interfere with any internal or
     locally agreed arrangements between the local authority, fire
     authority, building authority, police and any other agency with
     an interest in safety at the ground.)
     Scope of Inspections
     8. Where possible all the items listed in paragraphs 3 and 4
     of the Statutory Guidance should be inspected and tested. It is
     recognised however that there may be occasions when one or more
     of these elements cannot, for some reason, be inspected. For
     this reason there is a degree of discretion within paragraphs.2 -
      4 of the Statutory Guidance. In this way it is hoped to avoid
     the situation where the local authority has to pay repeated
     visits to a ground in order to comply with the Statutory


                                                            _
    ..    .




         Guidance.
         9. The Statutory Guidance does not require that an inspection
         should take place at any particular time so the local authority’s
         discretion to carry out an inspection whilst the ground is in use
         is not restricted. An "in-use" or "during performance"
         inspection could therefore constitute part of the inspection
         required by section 10B of the Act even though it might not be
         sufficient (having regard to the requirements of the Statutory
         Guidance) to be an inspection itself.
         Records
      10. Local ¯authorities will doubtless need to keep a record of
      all inspections carried out under the Statutory Guidance and may
     wish to consider whether a copy of any report/record should be
     sent to the holder of the safety certificate. Local authorities
      are also asked to consider affording a reasonable opportunity for
      any such report to be made available for ~nspection, if so
      requested, by members of the public.

     1.0 S~pion Kop
     I.I   The timber ticket hut adjacent to the refreshment bar on the main
           means of escape exit route from the KOP should be removed, since
           it is causing both a high risk and a narrowing of the escape
           width.                                                              B.S.

    1.2    A broken concrete post supporting the end of a crush barrier
           adjacent to the tunnel exit at the north end of the KOP to be
           removed, and the crush barrier be modified to Join onto the end
           of the new steel supported barrier directly adjacent to it.         B.S.

    1.3    A timber hut at ground level, under the KOP structure should be
           removed.                                                            B.S.

    1.4    An additional length of crush barrier is required to be installed
           adjacent to the base of the ramped stairway from the extended
           terracing. This was agreed on site by Dr. Eastwood.                 B.S.

    1.5    An area of the corrugated metal sheeting used as cladding to the
           side of the Kop is corroded and torn.

    1.6    It was noted that in some places the stair nosings serving radial
           gangways had become defective.                                      HCS

    1.7    At some positions within the new development there is a
           difference in height between a terraced area and radial gangway
           of over 600am. As such these areas require to be protected by a
           suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.                          HCS

    1.8    Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
           minor repairs. It was agreed, however, that this defect would be
           adequately controlled by means of "ongoing" maintenance.            HCS

    1.9    The defective rendering to the final exit gate wall requires to
           be repaired.                                                        HCS
@   2.0    North Stand

    2.1    A broken glass panel in the west gable end should be replaced.      B.S.

    2.2    The step between seats 12 and 13 on row 43 is loose and should be
           correctly bedded down.                                              B.S.

    2.3    It is important to ensure that the groundman’s store beneath this
           stand is not used for the storage of potentially inflammable
           fertilisers or weedkillers.                                         HCS

    3.0    West Stand

    3.1    Signs over the front parapet wall at the upper level are to be
           permanently secured at the following positions:-

           a) between seats I and 14                                           B.S.
           b) between seats 20 and 28
           c) between seats 136 and 150.
       Binding wire ties are not considered to be satisfactory for this
       purpose.

       Additionally the sign brackets adjacent to seats 62 and 72 are to
       be correctly bent (or otherwise suitably checked) and secured.

3.2    Rain water drainage holes through the upper level slab should
       have a gauze inserted so as to inhibit the dropping of missiles
       onto the crowd below.                                                                       B.S.


3.3    It is felt that discussion should take place regarding the
       suitability of the gate fastening device at the base of the
       emergency exit stairway on the south end of this stand. The
       fastening consisting of a patent lockable barrel bolt which
       cannot easily be unfastened in the direction of travel, and is
       impossible to be unfastened from the other side.                                            B.S.

4.0    Miscellaneous Points

4.1    At a number of points within the stadium various pieces of
       abandoned builders’ waste were readily available for use as
       projectiles by the crowd. Such material should be collected and
       suitably disposed of.                                                                       8CS

       become ill or injured within the sports ground.                                        ’!   HCS

4.3 The provision of qualified first aiders is being revie ed at the

            Safety of Sports Grounds Act
            Stewarding at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.,
            Hillsborough, Sheffield

             I am advised by a member of my staff, who has attended recent games, that
             there has been a lack of effective stewarding on the Kop, resulting in
             the crowd occupying the radlal gangways as additional stan~--fg areas,
            ~1~--0-ughout the games.

            Although it is appreciated that these games were important Cup-ties and,
            therefore, attracted increased crowd capacities, stewarding must be of a
            quality and of such numbers as to maintain these gangways free from
            congestion during performances.    -----

            lit is also understood that the turnstile capacity on the Penistone Road
             frontage was insufficient, and that many of the spectators were still
             entering the ground up to 15 minutes after the kick-off.

        I The c°mbinati°n of late arrival and ineffective stewarding c°uld lead t° ~~--aang~x____~u~ occaz~uce~.

             It is considered that the Club should be made aware of these matters and
             be required to confirm that stewarding will be made available to keep these
             areas clear.

             This is possibly a matter that should be raised at the next meeting of the
             Working Party, so that police and fire authority comments may also be sought.

  1        S.W.F.C. - Building Surveyor’s memorandum of 2.2.88

           The Building Surveyor’s representative outlined the
           memorandum and the circumstances which gave rise to it.
           Superintendent Stuartindicated that the gangway problem
           had been discussed with Sheffield Wednesday who were
           going to take measures with their Stewards in an attempt
           pto resolve it. As far as the turnstile question was
                                                                             [
            concerned, a pattern has developed of people arriving
            some 15 mins. before the start of the game hoping to
            gain admission. This trend may be due to the banning of~
            alcohol at sports grounds which could lead to people
            going elsewhere for refreshment prior to the football
            match. As the available turnstiles operated quite
            e, ectively for the majorit~ ,~ the time, and that the
            late arrival problem could perhaps only be dealt with by
            education of spectators.



            Owlerton - General Principles

            Discussion took place about the south and east terraces
            which Eastwoods in their original report had recommended
            be closed. There was no disagreement with the idea of
            closing the south terrace (which is in a very poor
            condition), butwhether or not there should be
            maintained along the front of the terrace a public
            walkway so that Complete public access could be allowed
            around the perime%erof the stadium was not finalised.
            It was mentioned.that the Company planned in due course
            perhaps to re-si~e the speedway pit on the site of the
            old south terrace~t



       3    The Capacity of Owlerton Sports Stadium

            There was a fairly lengthy discussion about capacity
            principally r~volving around Eastwoods’ original capacity
            estimate of 6,781 people. There was also discussion
            about controlling the access/of spectators to particular
            areas or zones of the stadium by various means. It was
            recognised that such area control would be difficult as
            the stadium is no% at the moment physically split into
            differen~ zones or sections. As the stadium at the
            moment requires considerable works ~o be undertaken to
            bring i~ u~ ~o reasonable s~andards, it was felt that

            Means of Escape in Case of Fire
             North Stand
                  With the exception of a small hut and the steel
             clad groundsman’s accommodation, which are both
             located under the ramp and not the stand, the timber
              clad buildings have been removed.
                   We believe that the reference in the minutes
              dated 7 August, 1985 was to storage facilities and
              not to buildings.

          removed so that the width of the exit route is not
          reduced.
          b)     This item has already been dealt with in our
          letter dated 15 January.
          c)     Some of the concrete terrace steps have been
          repaired but, as has always been accepted, the
          repairs will continue to be a regular maintenance
          job.
          d)     The intention of the mesh was not to prevent
e         people from climbing onto the steelwork but to act
          as a guard preventing spectators damaging and
          possibly loosening the rear sheeting.
                We disagree that spectators climb onto the
          steelwork in large numbers although we do not deny
          that the police have, at some matches, had to tell
          a few spectators not to sit on the steelwork.
                The cost of erecting a full height fence
          would be several thousands of pounds. The Club is
          not at present contemplating that magnitude of
           expenditure just to protect a few spectators from
           their own foolish behaviour.
           e)     There are four or five lengths of barrier
o          where the drop in front is just over one metre,
           but as far as we are aware this has not created
           any hazard. In fact to the contrary, because
           people can leave the ground by going under the
           barriers onto the lateral gangway. This is a
           common feature of most league grounds.
                 The welding is performing well and it seems
           that any additional vertical support is
           unnecessary. However, the welding can be inspected
            at regular intervals to make sure that it con-
            tinues to hold the mesh securely.

         f)    Exit gates are unlocked before spectators enter
         the ground. The keys then remain in the possession
         of the steward(s), given the responsibility of
         unlocking the gates, until after the end of the
         match and all spectators have left the ground.
         West Stand
         a)    Do we understand correctly that the
         reference to ’timber framed and clad units’ is to
         the bar fittings at first floor level? If so, then
e        those fittings were part of the original construction
         for which Building Regulations Approval has been
         granted. There has not been any previous comment
         about the presence of the bar fittings in that stand
         or other stands. We do not consider that they
         present a hazard.



        /b)     This item has already been dealt with in our
          letter dated 15 January.
          South Stand
          a)    (i) We note the comment about the doors and
          this point has been dealt with under the regular
          procedures of obtaining a Fire Certificate under
e         the Fire Precautions Act of 1971 for the offices.
          Fire Officer                 has been dealing with
          the matter.
               (ii) We see the principle behind the creation
          of fire compartments. That is sensible. Sealing
          off the windows is not difficult but the provision
          of ducting to the south wall is, and furthermore
          very expensive. A major exercise such as providing
          ducting would by necessity have to wait until the
           redevelopment of the South stand in 1991.
    EASTWOOD D PARTNERS                                 SHEET 4




             (iii) We agree that stored materials should be
         removed from stairways and exit routes. There is a
         particular problem outside the kitchen area, at
         ground floor level, but the caterers have been asked
         to clear that particular area well before the public
         are admitted on match days.
         b)     (i) It was agreed in 1979 that the fans
O        ventilating the lounges at first floor level should
         be fitted with intumescent grilles with smoke
         controlled shutters. Those grilles and shutters
         were fitted although we see that two recently
         installed fans do not appear to have similar grilles
         and shutters. As the form of fire protection from
         those lounges has already been agreed with the Fire
         Service, the Club are not prepared to have ducting
         installed, although the new fans should perhaps be
         fitted with intumescent grilles and smoke controlled
         shutters.
              (ii) A close inspection of the gas supply pipe-
O        work in the five bars revealed that four bars have
         valves fitted to the feed pipe or to the appliance
         when there is only one appliance in the bar. The
         pipework in the bar nearest to the Spion Kop has
          been replaced recently but without a valve.
                    However, there is a master valve, at
          ground floor level, which isolates the gas supply
          to the whole of the first floor. That valve was
          installed at the request of the Fire Service in
          1980.
              (iii) We confirm that all the timber facing onto
          the public circulation areas was treated with an
          intumescent paint during the work carried out in
          1980. Since then the walls have been re-decorated
    EASTWOOD D PARTNERS                                SHEET 5




         but this does not reduce the effect of the
         intumescent paint underneath.
             (iv) We cannot understand this comment because
         the paint store was constructed in its present
         position on the advice of the Fire Officer. A
         special ’non-sparking’ light fitting was even
         installed on his recommendation. It is not contem-
         plated to move the store again after spending money
         to build the store in its present position.
0              (v) We do not consider that the two laminate
         covered toilet kiosks present a hazard. As for the
         wooden cupboards, they have been on the first floor
         for many years and no previous adverse comments
         have been made by the Fire Service about their
         presence.
              (vi) We agree that the holes round the cables
         should be plugged with an appropriate fire resisting
         material.
             (vii) As far as we are aware all doors leading
         onto the first floor and ground floor circulation
         areas were provided with 25mm rebates and the doors
e        made up to a nominal one hour standard. That work
         was done in 1979-80.
            (viii) We agree that the spaces above toilet
         accommodates should not be used for storage but
         believe that the Club have now removed the stored
         materials.
         c)    We believe that cli~ing over the existing low
         wall does not present any difficulty in the event
         of an emergency. Spectators will go over the wall
         whether there are gates or not. We do not consider
         that the installation of gates is necessary.

         d)    Escape through the rear of the stand has always
         been accepted by the Officer Working Party. Further-
         more, it has been readily accepted with the
         protection which has been provided so far to the
         escape routes.

         Automatic Fire Protection
              We will suggest to the Club that proposals
         should be put forward for the provision of a fire
O        detection system but the system is not likely to be
         installed until the major re-development of the South
         stand which is planned for 1991
         Emergency Lighting
              Testing of the emergency lighting system is
         being organised and we will be contacting the Fire
         Service in the next day or so to agree a date and
         time for carrying out the test.
              The testing of the general electrical circuits
         will also be organised over the next few weeks and
          a current IEE Certificate produced.

O         Fire Alarms
               The Club was told by the Fire Service to put
          the call points in the bars in the stands. Moving
          the call points again is out of the question.
          Inidcator/Control panel
               The Officer Working Party was asked, at the
          time of installation, where the indicator/central
          panel should be placed. The Club was told that it
          should be located in the Police control centre,
          where it is now. No duplicate panel was asked for
          and it is not considered that one is necessary.

         Gates
              The comments about the gates are noted.

         The Club have expressed to us their increasing con-
    cern that with the introduction of each new member of the
    Fire Service to the Officer Working Party new or
    different recommendations are put forward by that officer,
    which in some cases openly contradict the recommendations
    offered by his predecessors. Whereas we agree that many
O   of the observations and recommendations are of a
    subjective nature the Club cannot be expected to continue
    spending money on matters which are purely a matter of
    personal opinion. Some consistency in the comments
    offered by members of the Officer Working Party would be
    appreciated.



                                           Yours sincerely,

    Dear Sir,
    Do you provide the best standards of Ambulance Care for the large number of
    Employees and Members of the Public whilst they are on your premises?
    Major Sporting Events have always relied heavily on the resources which are
    provided by the Voluntary First Aid Organisations.
                                                                                    J
    We acknowledge the very valuable contribution which the St John Ambulance /
    and British Red Cross Society make. There are, however, areas where the I
    level of care which we can provide, of necessity, exceed those which can be /
    provided by the Voluntary Societies. These include Advanced Ambulance Aid,/
    Treatment of Fractures with the most modern equipment available/
    (particularly Spinal Injuries), Stabilisation of patients with Head/
    Injuries,    Intubation,    Intravenous    Infusion,    Cardiac Monitoring,
    Defibrillation and the Administration of Drugs.

    If we can’t help with your immediate requirements, please place this letter

     are able to offer.

            THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

            ANNUAL INSPECTION OF SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB
            ON THE 19th MAY, 1988

            I write with reference to the above and following our recent site meeting
            and safety inspection of the named premises.

            I would confirm that while the general standards of health and safety
            being maintained were found to be satisfactory a number of points did
            require attention. I have itemised these below for your convenience.

             Spion Kop Development

             i.     The pylon situated to the left-hand side of the kop was not suitably
                    protected from unauthorised access and climbing.

                    To several locations around the kop, accumulations of associated
              .     builders wastes and stonework that could easily be obtained for use as
                    projectiles were noted.

             3.     At some positions within the new development, there is a difference in
                    height between a terraced area and radial gangway of over 6OOmm. I
                    would advise that these areas be protected by a suitably constructed
                    pedestrian guardrail.

             4.     An area of stair nosing was found to have become defective upon the
                    "new" part of the spion kop and a similar defect was located upon the
                    older radial gangway¯

                    Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of minor
             5.
                    repairs¯
             6.      A loose rainwater pipe and length of guttering were located to one of
                     the Penlstone Road turnstiles.

              7.     An area of glazing serving one of the Penlstone Road turnstile huts
                     has been broken.

              8.     The club might consider the now combustible nature of much of the
                     vegetation situated immediately behind the splon kop and take the
                     appropriate remedial action¯

              9.     The rendering to the entrance gate side wall was still found to be in
                     a loose and defective condition.

                  West Stand

                  i. In a number of cases terrace noslngs require to be repaired.        ~ ?,


                                                                 /Contd ....
                                                                               .I
        A number of seats were defective and require to be renewed or
    .
        repalred.

        To the left-hand side of the stand, some pieces of old barbed wire
    .
        were found to project over a walkway at head height.

                Supplementary equipment
                The approved code states that where first aiders and occupational first aiders are
                employed in an establishment the employer should provide appropriate carrying
                equipment for them to use. In addition it is recommended that w]~ere such
                equipment is provided, blankets should be stored alongside the equipment and in
                such a way as to keep them free from dust and dampness.
                ~roOtective Clothing and Equipment
                    tective clothing and equipment should be provided near the first aid materials
                where there is a possibility that the first aider or occupational first aider might need
                protection to avoid becoming a casualty himself while administering first aid.
                Protective clothing and equipment should always be properly stored and checked
                regularly to ensure that it remains in good condition.                        ~~

                  Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                                    Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                          Barrier Testinq 1988
                                 Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, Lne fourth
                  part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
                  The barriers tested were numbers 121 to/~24, 124A,~25 to 128,
                  128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
                  the lower area of terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
                  The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
          ,e      1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
                       The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
                  procedure set out in Appendix C of the ’Guide to Safety at Sports
                  Grounds’.
                       In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully    ~/
                  withstood the applied load. A clip over the rail of barrier 124                                                                                   IA
                  broke before reaching the full test load.                      "\
                         Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
                   that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
                   tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those tested on the
                   Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
                   load.

                 The rail onbarrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
            replaced now. There was also a lot of movement of the rail on
            barrier 144, when tested,and we also recommend that that rail
            is also replaced.
                 As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
            be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
            the start of the coming season.
                 Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
            results of the barrier tests.

          Following your telephone call I am very pleased to enclose
     a copy of my report to the Club concerning the barrier testing
     at the West end of the ground in July, 1988. You will see from

     was certainly sent to Mr. Butler in your department and to
     Mr. Bownes in the Legal department.    I know it is our normal
     practice to send you all the record sheets but if we did not do
     so, a full set is now enclosed.
          I also enclose a copy of the test certificate from Sheffield
     Testing Works who checked the calibration of the testing equipment
     the previous week.

    Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                      Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                            Barrier Testlng 1988
         Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
    part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
    The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
    128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
    the lower area of terrace at the Lepplngs Lane end of the ground.
    The location of the barriers tested Is shown on our drawing
    1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
         The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
    procedure set out in Appendix C of the ’Guide to Safety at Sports
    Groundsi.
          In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
    withstood the applied load. A cllp over the rall of barrier 124
    broke before reaching the full test load.
          Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
    that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
    tested on the Splon Kop last year and also those t ~sted on the
    Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
    load.

              The rail on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
 ¯       replaced now. There was also a lot of movement of the rail on
         barrier 144, when tested, and we also reoommend that that rail
         is also replaced.
              As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
         be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
         the start of the coming season.

         results of the barrier tests.                                   .

             DESCRIPTION:                         One hydraulic pump complete with two hydraulic cylinders.
                                                  The force on the cylinders, under an applied force is
                                                  measured by a pressure gauge mounted on the pump.


             IDENTIFICATION:                      Pump: D948OO5
                                                  Gauge: BGF 168 SR
                                                  Cylinder I: 04773 Model RC 53AF9N
                                                  Clyinder 2:04772 Model RC 530J8N


             METHOD

             The calibration was carried out in a Grade 0.5 lever arm testing machine in
e            terms of the Technical unit of force the ton force (tonf). The uncertainty of
             the forces applied during the calibration is +0.5%.

             Three tests were made on each cylinder.

             Tests were made to determine the reading indicated on the gauge at fixed loads.

        during the time that this year’s quota of crush barriers
        were being tested by my firm.
             The results of the crush barrier testing are given
                                                                                                                                                      !
        in a separate report of today’s date.
      e      I made a visual inspection of all the main structural
        features of the ground. Particular attention was paid to
        gates and entry and exit routes and to boundary walls and
        fences.    No significant defects were noted.
             The roof of the South stand was inspected from the ground.
        No deterioration in its condition was observed.
             I certify that in my opinion the various structures on
        the ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate for
        the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid down in
        the Certificate of Ground Safety.

                                                      GROUND


              Tuesday 9 Auoust 1988, a meetina was held at Hammerton
         I/On
          ~Road Police Station to re-establish further liaison with the
         II Fire and Ambulance Service in the event of a major disaster
         q occurring at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.
            The meeting was chaired by Superintendent Murray and attended
            by Superintendent Marshall, Chief Inspector Zeal and Inspector
            Sewell, Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer Hopkins and Assistant
            Chief Ambulance Officer (Operations) Jones, South Yorkshire
            Ambulance Service and Assistant Divisional Officer Rowlands
            of the South Yorkshire Fire Service
O           A senior ambulance officer already attends all home matches
            at the Sheffield Wednesday Ground and is allocated a compli-
            mentary ticket for the South Stand. He is in direct radio I
            contact with ambulance control and in the event of a major
            disaster at the ground, he would be the firs: line contact
            with ambulance control. Contingency plans a~= already in hand
            for the South Yorkshire ~bulance Service to rendezvous with
            their vehicles at Herries Road bus garage and the senior
          ~ ambulance officer airea~at the Wednesday Ground would control
            the ambulance vehicles in and out of the Wednesday Ground.
            Arrangements have been made for the senior -mbulance officer
            who attends the Wednesday Ground to meetthe ’F!’ Liaison
            Inspector outside the players’ entrance at 2.15 pm, before
            each home match to re-establish contact and a!so contact will
            be maintained with Mr Lock, the security officer at the
            Wednesday Ground. In the event of an eveninc kick off,
            further arrangements wi!l be made to estab!isn contact time
            with the ambulance service.
            In the event of a major disaszer occurring, :he senior
            ambu!ance officer at the ground would, where ;ossib!e, make
            his way to the gymnasium to direct his opera:ions.
            It was considered that this ambulance officer would be better
            based in the North Stand so he could get to the gymnasium
            without problems. However, the senior ambulance officer who
            attends is off duty and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
            only wish to allocate the complimentary tickets to the ambulanc
            service for use in the South Stand, so that the club physio,
            Alan Smith, can signal straight away to the ambulance officer
            if an ambulance is required for a Wednesday player.
     (2)



    Following discussions with the Fire Service Officer it was agreed
    that the fire service would attend by the quickest possible
    routes direct to the immediate scene of any fire and as such
    no rendezvous points or pre-arranged routes could be determined.
    The main points raised, in relation to the fire service, were

    I
    that it was imperative that the Police Control give the exact
    location of any fire or incident and as much detail as possible
    given. No senior fire officer is on duty at the match.
    To assist the fire and
                                                                  1

                             ambulance services in any major disaster,
    two Police Tango units   will be specifically detailed to assist,
    one with the ambulance   service and the other with the fire service.
    The exact details wil!   be written into the serial order for the
    mobile unit concerned.

         Safet~ of Spor=s Grounds - Draft Revised Safer7 Certificate Condlt~ons

         I refer to your letter of 13th August 1987 (your reference FPIg/2/4:RG/EB) in
         connection w~=h Safety Certiflcate CondiCions.

          I now enclose for your aCtenCion a copy of the final revised Safety Certificate
          Conditions which as far as possible incorporate the comments made in your
          letter. You will apprec~aCe ChaC the wording of certain of your comments has
          had to be amended sllgh=ly buC I hope thaC the objective has none the less been
          achieved.

          There are four polnCs which require some furCher consldera=ion:-

                     (a)   You say in your feLLer chat an age range should be specified in
                           connecCion with sCewards. I think however that the wording of
                           Condition ii should be satisfactory without sCIpulatlng an age range.
                           No final decision has yeC been taken on this issue and you may like to
                           consider it further;

                     (b)   police knowledge of the whereabouts of a doctor - I bel~eve =his is
                           adequately covered in Condition 7;

                     (c)   IdencIflabili=y of press T.V. and radio personnel - I am not sure of
                           the justification for such a Condition and wonder if you have any
                           further commen=s on i;;

                     (d)   the aCcendance of compeCenC elecCrlclan - again I wonder what che
                           jffStlflcatlon for this Condition would be.

          Would you please le; me have your comments on the new Conditions in due course.

    INTRODUCTION ::-’~.

    This note has ~een prepared by the Sheffield City Council in".!order to inform
    Certificate Holders as to the general background of the Safety.. Certificate
    Conditions. The Council in dealing with Safety Certlflcates~’takes advice from
    the Chief Fire Officer, the Chief Constable, the Director of’ Health and Consumer
    Services and the Council’s Building Surveyor. These Offlcer’s!~,’and the Council
    itself is concerned to see as far as possible that the spedtators at any
    specified activities are reasonably safe.               ";,l~.-[.-i

¯ ~’ GUIDANCE .....
    Where advice is given to the holder by any of the four Officers mentioned it
    should be acted upon in accordance with the time constraints given in the:
    advice. The holder is reminded that failure to take steps to ensure the
    reasonable safety of spectators could give rise to a prosecution.
    The Chief Constable and his Officers have a particularly important role in
    relation to "public order" situations the correct handling of which should
    reduce any risk to spectator safety.
    The Chief Constable must therefore be provided with appropriate facilities at
    the stadium for control, crowd surveillance, detention and administrative
    purposes. These facilities are essential if public order is to be maintained
    and the risk to spectators mlnimlsed.
    The Chief Constable must also be informed at the earliest possible moment of the
    proposed date and content of all specified activities so that appropriate
    plannlngcan take place.

     In addition there must be consultation and agreement between the holder and the
     Chief Constable well in ~dvance of specified activities about the proposed
     methods of admission and the segregation of spectators. Consultation must also
     take place if advance information is such that public order difficulties may
     arise. As a result of this consultation it is possible that the Chief Constable
O    may require, for reasons of preserving public order, that the specified activity
     is "all ticket" or the specified activity should not be played at all at the
     Stadium or the day and the time of the specified activity should be changed.

     The Chief Constable should also be able to use whatever means are appropriate to
     exercise control over spectators for reasons of safety and as part of this
     control he and his Officers should be allowed full access to all areas of the
     Stadium.

                I refer to the correap~:~dence from Chief Superintendent (KS) in
                respect of the above.

                 Enclosed for information is a copy of the Certificate issued by
                 the then South Yorkshire County Council in December 1979. Also
                 attached is a copy of the first Draft prepared by the City Council
                 in August 1987.

                 Referring to the latter could I draw your attention to paragraphs
                 4 5 & 6 which have been totally deleted from the new draft.
                               ~ I draw ~’ur attention to paragraph 10 which outlin_ed the
                                                                                    4~S
                 duties of stewards. To some degree the f~rst draft made the stewar
                 answerable to police officers. In the latest draft the reference to
                 police has been totally removed.

                 Generally speaking the new draft certificate ,apart from matters
                 relating to the police, is reaso?~bly consistent with the first
                 draft. However you may consider it appropriate at some stage to seek
                  the views of Chief Superintendents Broomhead and Duckenfield.

 As discussed on the telephone with Mr Alderman, I enclose a copy of
 correspondence received from the Adminisl]’ation and Legal Department of Sheffield
 City Council and relating to the Council’s proposed general conditions to attach to

 the legislative provisions regarding the aUendance of police at sporlmg events.

 I should be obliged if you would kindly advise me on the propriety of Ihe Sheffield

    attendance o4 police officers at football matches, as provided by SecUon 2 of the
    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (as amended by SeclJon 21 of the Fire Safety and
    Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987). I am forwarding a copy of your correspondence
    to the Police Authority Legal Department for advice on the matter and will contact you
                                                                                            A

  INTRODUCTIOU

  This note has been prepared by the Sheffield City Council in order to inform
  Certificate Holders 88 to the seneral hacksrouud of the hfety Certificate
  Conditions. The Council in dealin~ with Safety Certificates takes advice from
  the Chief Fire Officer, the Chief Constable, the Director of Bealth and Consumer
  Services sad the Council’s Buildtn~ Surveyor. These Officers and the Council
  itself is concerned to see as far as possible that the spectators at any
  specified activities are reasonably safe.

   GUIDANCE

   Where advice is given to the holder by any of the four Officers mentioned it
   should be acted upon in accJrdance wlth the rise constraints slven in the
   advice. The holder is reminded that failure to take steps to ensure the
   reasonable safety of spectators could sive rise to a prosecution.

~- ’~ Chief Constable and his Officers have a particularly important role in
    relation to "public order" situations the correct handling of which should
    reduce say rlsk to spectator safety.
    The Chief Constable must therefore be provided trlth appropriate facilities at
    the stadium for control, crowd surveillance, detention and administrative
    purposes. These facilities are essential If public order is to be maintained
    and the risk to spectators mlnlmlsed.
    The Chief Constable must also be informed at the earltesc possible moment of the
    proposed date and content of all specified activities so that appropriate
    planning can take place.
     In addition there -=,st be consultation and agreement between the holder and the
     Chief Constable well In advance of specified activities about the proposed
     methods of admission sad the segregation of spectators. Consultation uust also
      take place if advance information is such that public order difficulties may
      arise. As a result of this consultation it is possible that the Chief Constable
                                                                                      that the specified activity
-~’~y require, for reasons of preserving public order,
~’s "all ticket" or the specified activity should not be played at all at the
      Stadium or the day and the tlne of the specified activity should be changed.

     The Chief Constable should also be able to use whatever ueans are appropriate to
     exercise control over 8pectJtors for reasons of safety and as part of this
     control he sad his Officers should be alloyed full access to all areas of the
     Stadiun.

                        Barrier Testing 1988
        Following your telephone call I am very pleased to enclose
  a copy of my report to the Club concerning the barrier testing
  at the West end of the ground in July, 1988. You will see from
  the carbon on page 2 that a copy of the letter part of our report
  was certainly sent tQ Mr. Butler in your department and to
  Mr. Bownes in the Legal department.     I know it is our normal   I
   practice to sendyou all the record sheets but if we did not do
    so, a full set is now enclosed.
         I also enclose a copy of the test certificate from Sheffield
    Testing Works who checked the calibration of the testing equipment
    the previous week.

                                                                   Yours sincerely,

THE GUIDE TO SAIETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

A/,~I,~:~NTS TO ~ GUIDE
The Guide %0 Safety at Sports Grounds was published in    1973   and is based .on the.

.echnioal Appendix to Lord hqleatley’s Report of the Inquiry into Ground S~fe%y
at Sports Grounds. Since its publication, its use on a volunt~u’y basis has
brought to notice ±he need for some a~nend~nents to be made to the guidelines

when applied to football grounds.


2. During consideration of the Safety of Sports Grounds ]Jill, Ninisters mentioned

that if the provisions of the Act were applied to sports grounds other than

football grounds, separate guides would be compiled for the different classes of

sports grounds. The existing Guide will accordingly be revised and re-printed

as the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football). The amendments which will

be made for this F~’pose are, in the meantime, attached as an appendix to this

 note.

 3. qhese amen&ments include a new chapter covering the reco~men&ations of the.

 Minister for Sport’s Working Party on Crowd Behaviour which was established in

 1974 1o look into m~ans of combating hooliganism at football grounds. Mutters

 of crowd control inevitably he.ve a bearing on safety at sports grounds and it

 has accordingly been thought right to incorporate the Working Party’s

 recommendations for the general convenieHce of clubs and other stadium authorities.



  .
         The main amendments in the attached list are as follows:
         a. Exits¯ from each area of spectator accommodation should enable the

              Spectators to leave that area in 8 minutes or less.

         b. Every spectator on the terrace should be within 12 metres of a

              gan&n~ay o~ exit.

         c.   Railings a~:d fences dividing sections of the aa-ound should be of

              the same strenz%h as handrails.

         d.   Depending on the condition of the individual stand, the time

              specified for the evacuation may lie between the prezcribed

              maxi~un oo.ud minimum.
    i




           A recommended distance from terrace to touchlinc is now given

           only for a terrace gradient of 30° or more.

    f@     The recommended flo:-n’ate from all sections of the ground has

           been increased to 60 persons per minute per unit of exit

           width except in the case of stands (where it remains at 40).

        g. Recommended stren~hs are given for handrails in various                  ! °°k ?


            situations.

        h. Recommendations of the Working Party on Crowd Behaviour.

5. It is again cmphasised tlu%t the recommendations made in the Guide to Safety


at Sports Grounds are essentially~idelines and should be ~pplied to existi~’g~

’{oo~bhll~ounds with the necessary degree of flexibility to %al;e account ~o, th~

~particul~-r cimcumstances at individual grounds. %he aim of securing a~

~nable degree of safety should be kept uppermost in mind;! it would.be]

~easonable~ even if it ,were prac%icable:~ to seek %he absolute safety of,

eve~cn,e,-r "~;.itending a ground. ~

    18.      Recommend~tions of the Worl-in,q Party_on Crowd Pehavlour

    18.1      Crowd movement on terraces should be severely limited in
              order to give the Police the fullest opporbanity for crowd
              control. Lcss problems occur where the terraces ~xe
              divided as f,~r as possible into sections by the use of"
              railingz or berr.iers, boi~i radial ~Id latera.l. Ideally,
              each section should be self-contained stud should be
              serviced by its own entrance/exits, refreshment facilities
             "and toilets. (see para. 7.7.)

    18.2      "Home" s~d visiting7 supporters should be segr.egated. It
              should not be possible for spectators to trmtsfer from one
              end of the ground to the other.

    18.3      Access to playinT pitches must be made as difficult as
              possible in normal circumstances while, at the same time,
              providing the Police with proper access to the terraces for
@             the purposes of crowd control ~u~.d enabling the pitch to be
              used in the event of serious emergency, One alternative
              to fencing is the construction around the pitch of a wall
              with a smooth surface which should be not less than 4 feet
              in height on the terrace side. This bounda.r~f w~ll should
              have gates or access points to the pitch which could be
              manned by the Police or ste~lards. A wa].~’~4f between the
              boundary wall ~Id the terraces, which would be solely
              occupied by Police, First Aid au.l official club personnel,
              has been feared to be effective as regards safety and
              secu’eii:y. In order to achieve this, it might be necesss~y
              to remove one or two rows of tenor.acing ~md to protc.~ct the
              w8!kway fl’om the terrace by a co~tinuous line of barriers,
              so designed as to discourage access to the v:al]~vsy except
              at authorlsed points. ~e access points from terrace to
              w.~_l~’:ay should be reasonab].y near the access points from
              w alk~ve~v to the pitch° (see para 7.10). Z~ere a wa].~z,;’a7
               system is in use, sliding gate.s mr~ be installed at the
               access points from the walkway to the pitch, ie where "there
               ca~’~ be no crowd press~n:e against them. (.~ee p~,.ra 6.14.2
               ~.’egarding use of sliding gates elsewhere). A ba~:rier to
               the pitch is um~ecess~y where seating extend~ to the level
               of the playing area.

    18.4      Clubs should carefully consider: their arra~gements for the
              s~].e of alcohol. In ~ny c~se all refreshments sbou].d be
              served in plastic containers.

    18 -5     Home clubs should consider, in conjunction ~ith the Police,
              each of the matches 2n~d determine which should be all-ticket,
              and the a].locntion of tieke[[.s to the visitir~j c]ub. So far
              as the terraces ~re concerned, any allocation should have
              regard to the manner in which the terraces are divided so
              that policing crrm’..gezents cm~ be effective.

              q~e home club should, as a gen:~ra! ~le, make it their
     18 o6
              policy not to i°~~U~¯ tickets for ~unounced ~l-tiehet matches
              to aw~y supporters on the day of the gme~e. Hey:even, the
              local Folice rill be bust able to a,~zess the situation snd
              their advice should be fo].lo~ved, but it is impo.rt~nt where-
              ever possible to discourace supporters from tr~-velli~g to
              all-tich~;t matches without tic!cots-

      During" the c(:~::~~ ’~ ~"’                  o-           ~owtng points ~ere made:.--

      (a)       the Stadium had been a~ed for many capacity matches over the ),ears and
                its ~afe*y re~.crd w~.s t~e equal of any ir~ ~he count,-~;

       (b)      i[tne Cede of Practice ,xere to be applied literally, then there would
                prob~~bly be, minor.~ts,~
                                     ~," ’~          "" ~- such as in the width of the steps on the
                                              ’ "~"leo
                                          ! ev:,-n,,
                Spion Kop and in the width of the gangways and exits in the Stands;


                                                        1.
    (e)       in order t... ¯ "°- a base ~_o~,
                                         ~-    ’’
                                               w.,aich to work, Ml of the crush barriers
              would requ~ - : ~.~j be tested initially, with up to 20% tested annually
              thereafter;

    (d)
          ~   it was likely that the fire risk in the North and West stands would be ]/~
              minimal, but the main stand would probably require more detailed   v/
              attention: however, only a detailed inspection by the Fire Service would
              reveal the true position;

    (e) the police w~.,’.J~d be happy with the existing position of the Police Control
              Centre: but felt the present structure would not meet their requirements;

    (0        the North and West Stands were modern structures, but the main stand
              had originally been built some 50 years ago and there were now no
              records, which would mean that a complete survey of this would be
              necessa~-;

          the only activ~W which normally took place at the Stadium other than
0         football was the Annual Jehovah’.~ Witness Rally, and an endeavour would
          ,be. made to make provision for thi~ in the General Safety Certificate so as
          to obvmr.e tb~ ~,eed for the Spec~.al Safety- Certificate procc~dure;

    (h)   to avom a~:edh-~’~, compiication should a change of Club Secreta~- occur,
          the Ce,’Lilic~:e :~’ould be .in the ~ame of the Club with a nominated person
          being nc.t[Ae.~) i.~,. writing r,c: the County Council.

    ({)   as regards the cll~aft General Safety Certificate:-

              (a)    the definition of ’THo!der" wor!d need to be amended,

              (t~)   ~:,::~L~og,.’a;~ 3 of Part 2 would need the words "of rnedlcine" adding
                     afte-~.:,~e ~:ord ~’doctc:’",

              ~c !   paragraph 12(3) of .Part 2 weuld need amending by deleting the

    0)    the County Council would require the detailed information and plans referred
          ~o in the concluding paragraph of the letter dated i3~h September, 1978 from
          the Chief Exeeut.ive to the Club before any formal progress could be made on
          the application.

o   At the invitation of the Club, the Working Party took the opportunity of carrying out
    a~ informal inspection of the Stadium in company with the Club’s representatives.

              ~,, 13th December, 1978, it w~s ~.greed that Dr. 3astwood would prepare
    I~ui submit a comprehensive survey report on matters relating to the ~.bove Act.

      You may consider it ~dvisable thzt, before receipt of that report, members of my
      staff m~ke ~ joint survey of the prentises under consideration with representatives
      of the Fire Service szd, possibly, the Police. If you agree with this suggestion
      I suggest that you m~ke the necess~-ry arrangements with the Fire Service ~nd Police

                       This recort, together with that of Dr. Eastwcod~ would form the

                        It is my opinion that the necessary comprehensive survey could not
                        be undsrtaken satisfactorily without plan drawings¯ In this respac~
                        i refer to paragraph 1.3 of the ’green cods’:

                        "The prmbl-~m of crowd safety at football grounds is complex and
                        c annot be solved simply by ensuring that each component of a grounm,

    than the survey referred to will be limited and if we involve
    ourselves in consultation with the Club following the submission
    of Or. Eastwood’s report with limited information this could
    prove unfortunate in the long term.

    As previously mentioned I prefer to await the 9rovision of the
    plan drawings which have already been requested and if any
    action can be taken to expedite this matter it would bs
    appreciated.

    Dear Sirs,
                                    Certificate of Safety - Interim Report
              We have now progressed sufficiently far with our
     survey and assessment to be able to submit an interim report
     covering the probable ground capacity and the likely costs of
     improvements which will be required by the certifying authority.
               The green guide has been used as a basis for our cal-
     culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
0    will no~ be possible to sattsf~ all the recoe~endattons in the
     gutde.~ ~asonable compromtse~tll be needed on the part of
     the fir~ officer and t~e pollce-I ~~~)

      (a)          Spion Kop
                          The general layout of Spion Kop is good. It
                    has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings ......
                    well below the maximum laid down in the guide. The
                    slope strikes a happy balance between the require=ents for
                    good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                             The only questions therefore are the adequacy
                    of the crush barriers to Justify a high number of
                     permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of

                                                                       ~4Err 2.

         the exits.
                      Where the barriers are adequate in strength
          and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
          of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m2 of plan
          area. Disregarding the gangways the area of Spton
          Kop is approximately 3120m2 which would provide
          accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
e              Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
          standards. Category A must be able to withstand a
          test load of 6kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
          and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
          In 1973 you had tests made on all the barriers by
          Tort and Brocklebank Ltd. Of the 101 barriers on
          Spton Kop,~_~atled to carry the test load of 400 lb
          and a furthe~r~arried the load but had some actual
          or incipient d~fect which needed attention. Host of
          those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
          would probably not satisfy Category B standard either.
          On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of
           a long barrier which was weak. The general situation was
           satisfactory compared with most grounds.
                      Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the

        ~ should
           arriers up to a uniform category A standard. It
           b
                  be kept in mind that it is now five years since
           the tests and there will have been some deterioration
           due to rusting. Most of the barriers are made from
           2t,, diameter tube which only has a thickness of O.192
           inches when neW; Rusting i8 now very slow in Sheffield’s
           atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers.axe subject
            to more rusting than others and we must expect some
            increase in the number needing attention.
                  .... pr~Ided’a battier can withstand 6kN/m, the -
            maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
            guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5° to 2.9m                  /

           for slopes of 30°. These figures apply to ’peak
           viewing’ areas. Splon Kop has an average slope
           of about 17° for which the recommended spacing is
              3.6m.
                         In calculating spectator capacity each barrier
              is assumed to cater for an area of ground immediately
              behind it which is either 3.6m wide or up to the
O
              next barrier, whichever is the smaller. We have
              surveyed the Kop, and our drawing 1610/1 attached
              shows the proportion of the Kop which will be
              admissible in the spectator calculation if all the
              barriers are brought up to category A standard. It
              will be immediately apparent that the great majority
              of the available area will quaiify. Our calculation
              shows that the permitted number of spectators should
              be about 13,9OO i.e. the number ofplaces ’lost’ will
              be almost 3, OOO.
                        If you wish to retain mo4t~of these extra places
              (aiming for a ground capacity of at least 50,000

               say) then new barriers            could be constructed at positions
               shown by the red lines on the second copy of drawing
               1610/1. The capacity would then be 16,OOO.
                      In proposing the extra barriers we are mindful

          l    that in some cases they will possibly hinder the
               close packing of spectators. Clearly, there is no
                                                                                     /
               point in spending money in order to achieve a large
               permitted_grougd capacity, ifthat-numberrcannot
               then be packed in. However, we think that even with
               an uneven distribution of spectators it will still be
               possible to accommodate 16,0OO spectators.
                      You may wish to consider whether the cost of .....
                these extra barriers will be Justified by the additional
                income they might generate over the years.      It is
                                                                                         /
                                                                               14e

          likely that new barriers, which will require fairly
          massive foundation and anchor blocks will cost between
          £50 and £60 per metre run. Thus the extra 235 metres
          of barrier will cost about £~00 per extra standing
          place.
                     Spion Kop is not ideally catered for by exits.
          A very adequate gangway system feeds to only three
O         exit points. The total width of these three exits
          at their narrowest points is 12.5m. The guide assumes
          a maximum flow rate through these exits of 60 persons
          per minute for each 55Omm of width. Thus the
           theoretical time to discharge 16,OO0 spectators from
           Spton Kop would be l~minutes, compared with a maximum
           of 8 minutes indicated by the guide.
                     The exits at each end of the terrace are reasonably
           free from hazards, except the one at the North end passes
           under a bridge with a headroom well beloT the recommended
           value of 8ft. This defect could be removed by lowering
           the floor level, but I would argue strongly that it is
           far from essential to have such a large headroom, and
O          the cost of modification iS not justified in an existing
            structure.
                         The exit at the back of $pion Kop is likely to
                                                                              /!

                          There may be considerable pressure to increase

               the total exit capacity. We can argue that the
               eight minutes allowed for complete evacuation is only
               really valid for stands where there might be a risk
               due to fire, or explosion~_ or structural failure. In
               the case of terracing it is only the impatience of
               spectators which might create danger. For an interim
               period, at least, this should be acceptable.

               over Spion Kop. It would be possible to incorporate in
               such a scheme a *squaring off t at the top which could
               increase the area available for spectators, However,
                this would probably mean that additional entrances would
                be needed, possibly by tunnelling through the bank at
                lower level. This would certainly make it easier to
                pack the crowd more uniformly. However, this is a
                matter for the future and is unlikely to be part of the
                present exercise.

         (b)    The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North West Corner)
L r
                      The west terrace is not quite so well endowed with
                barriers as Spion Kop. The present layout is shown on the
                attached drawing 1610/2. Our measurements sbo~ a total
                area of 148Om2 but there are no gangways. We feel that
                 some allowance should be made for circulation space as
                 spectators have to move quite considerable horizontal
                 distances to achieve good packing. The full area would
                 Justify abo~Pectat°rs’ but we suggest ttvould
                 probably be apvropriate to allow 10~ as the equivalent
                 of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators. The
                 barriers should be designed to match this figure approximately.
                            The shaded area on drawing 1610/2 is that which
                 may be counted if the existing barriers are of class A.
                 About 15 of the existing barriers are likely to need
                                                                                    SHEET 6.

              strengthening to achieve thisstandard. Even with
              this strengthening only 4,300 spectators could be
              accommodated, representing ~ loss of nearly half-
              We presume this would be unacceptable.
                    The extra barriers required to achieve
               approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
               second copy of drawing 1610/2. You may feel that
               some of the proposed new barriers which are close


             l to the entrances might restrict the passage of
               spectators undesirably. In that case they could
                 be omitted.
                            The three exits have a total width of about
            ~,,. ll. Sm which would permit about 1250 people per minute
                 to leave the ground. Thus the stand could empty
                 in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                            The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
~/~    ,
                   should be within 12m of a gangway or exit. There are
                   no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an

                   is about 565 m2 Thus if the crush barriers were
                   adequate and the whole area is included the number of
                   spectators could be about 3,050.
                              Unfortunately, the crush barriers in this area
                   were shown to be very inadequate when tested in 1973.
                   Only one was tested £nd the rail and posts were bending.
                   at a load of only 270 lb/ft. Becaule of this result
                   none of the others was subjected to a test load. We

             have examined the drawings of these barriers and
             in addition to the weakness of the rails and posts,
             the holding down arrangements appear to be very
             inadequate and might be treacherous. A sudden
             failure of a bolt, and they are very highly stressed,
             could lead to a collapse without warning. These
             barriers need major strengthening as a matter of
@             urgency.
                    Assuming that the barriers are strengthened
              it will be seen from the drawing 1610/2 that they
              also need considerable supplementation. The sche=e
              shown on the second copy of this drawing does not

            /#calculations. But it would be reasonable to count
             //say 2900. This would bring the total standing at
            I/!the Leppings Lane end to 10,1OO.
                        The exits serving this part of the terrace are
              very adequate, but there may be requests for central
               handrailings to be provided.

@
       Seating Accommodation
       (a) The North Stand
                           The form of construction of this stand is such
               that it presents a minimum fire hazard. The exits
               are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy the
               recommendations of the guide.
                       Two matters might cause concern. The first,
                the fa~t tha~ ~t~ee~its are marginally below,~e ....
                recommended minimum of 1.1m, is we think of yery .little
                consequence.           However, the second, the narrow gangways
                which are only about half the recommended minimum may
                cause som~di~i~ul:t~y~" ~twouldbe possible..to~ide~
                the gangways by taking one seat off the end of one of
                the rows meeting at each gangway. As the gangways
                                                                                      .



EASTWOOD b PARTNER8




          are the same in the other stands the total number of


          ~
          seats lost would be 1,O41. This is almost unthinkable
          and must be resisted strongly.
                     Fortunately, the timing of spectators leaving                _
          the ground on 6 January showed that a peak of 80 per
          minute passed through one exit. This is the figure
          quoted by the guide for a 1.1m gangway. With 18 exits
          for 10,OOO people the average would be 556 per unit.
          Thus the stand would empty in about seven minutes,
          which is within the recommended limit of eight minutes.
                     Our observations on 6 January showed that everyone
          had left this stand, apart from a few people who were
          in no hurry, in about six minutes, althoughwe also counted
          about 40 per exit who left before the final whistle.
          The overall picture appears very satisfactory and
          encourages the hope that this stand will be accepted
           as not needing any significant modification.

    (b)    The West Stand
                 This stand is very similar to the north stand
@             in its construction. We were not able to accurately
           assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
           January because there were many seats which were unsold.
              However, there is every reason to believe that there
              will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
              eight minutes also. There should be no need for
              significant modifications.

    (c)       The South Stand .... " ................ - .......

                                                                                      v/

          those serving the directors box) so that an average
          of 570 people need to pass through each exit. The
          count on 6 January shoved an average of just over 70
          per minute passing through one exit which corresponds
          to an emptying time of about eight minutes. Indeed
          there were very few people still trying to get out six
          minutes after the final whistle. A few had no doubt
          left early and a few were still standing around, but
          the stand had substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                     Having left the top of the stand the spectators
          have to make their way from the first floor landing via
          one of three staircases. Two of these are 3.6m wide
          and the other 2.4. This is equivalent to 17~ ’lanes’
          of 55Oeun. At 40 people per lane, 700 people pass per
          minute. To discharge 5710 people (less those in the
          directors box) will therefore take almost exactly 8
          minutes as per~itted by the guide.
                    The fire officers were clearly very interested
          in the first floor. There is very little ’fire load’
          on this floor - the snack bars and the office/lounge.
          But quite a small fire Night fill this area with smoke.
          we suspect that           there might be a request for it to be compart-
          mentaltsed by fire doors.
                    At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
          almost straight to the open air,. through a compartment
          which is separated from the main part of the building.
          The third staircase ~s not so well separated and some
          structural work may be needed. Apparently the paint
          store is beside this staircase. This may not be wise.
                      There may well be requests from the fire officer
           for cQnsiderable extra precautions and structural .....
           alterations in this building.

                If all    the new barriers which we have suggested
    are installed the capacity will                become :-

                If it is required to increase this capacity at some
    time in the future Spton Kop could be ’squared off’ at the
    back using a steel framed structure and perhaps a further
    4OOO places could be provided.                 The Kop could also be
    roofed over,      of course.

                          This total should not at this stage be taken as
    more than a broad guess. We may have pleasant surprises
    but there could be shocks. The total does not contain
    any allowance for the local authority’s charges in
    connection with the issuing of the licence or for our
     professional fees.

     Future Action
               sUbject to your approval wesuggest that the next
     steps might be as follows :-

     le                    We should pass copies of all drawings to the police,
                           the fire brigade, the city Building Surveyor and the
                           County Council. In addition to drawings showing
                           the results of our surveys of the Kop, the Leppings
                            Lane terrace and the south stand, we are preparing
                            suitable drawings of the north and west stands,
                            measuring from the photo-copies of Husbands drawings.

                            We should make firm proposals to the police and the
          .
                            fire brigade for the new crush barriers, together
                            with our computation of the number of spectators, and
                            invite comments including any suggestions of further
                             measures which maY be needed.
                             At the same time we should make detailed drawings and
              .
                             specifications for the strengthening work on the

                                            REPORT ON GROUteD CAPACITY


                   This report            sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity

       which is attainable.
                  It dealatn broad terms with the necessary strengthening
       and Supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
       calculations are made of the theoretical exit times.
                  Calculations of exit times are also ~ade for each of

        the stands and reference is made to the observations which were
        made at the end of the third round cup-tie on 6 January, 1979.
                   The green guide has been used as a basis fo~ our cal-
        culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
        will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
        guide. Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the
         fire officer and the police. ....

     Standln~ Accommodation
     (a)     Spion Kop
                       The general layout of Splon Kop is good. It
             has a very adequate number of gangways, wlth spacings
             well below the maximum lald down In the guide. The
             slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
             for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                        The only questions therefore are the adequacy
             of the crush barriers to Justlfy s high number of
             permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of
             the exits.
                        Where the barriers are adequate in strength
             and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
             of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10:2 of plan
             area. Disregarding the gangvays the area of Spion
             Kop is approximately 3120N2 which would provide
             accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                  Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
             standards. Category A must be able to withstand a
             test load of 6kN/metre~Ldth (400 lb/foot approxiemtely)
             and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
             In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Tort
             and Brocklebank Ltd. Of the 101 barriers on Spion
              Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb and
              a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
              incipient defect which needed attention. Most of
             those which failed the tes~,:failed so badly ~tha~. th~y
              would, probable:not satisfy category B standard e~ther .... .
              On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of a
              long barrier which was weak. It should be emphastsed
              thaT. theEeaeral, situation was satisfactory compare~
              with most grounds.
                    Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
                                                                                      /

           barriers up to a uniform category A standard. It
           should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
           the tests and there may have been some deterioration
           due to rusting.   Most of the barriers are made from
            2t,, diameter tube which only has a thickness of O. 192
e           inches when new. Rusting is now very slow in Sheffteld’s
            atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
            to more rusting than others and it is possible that
            there will be an increase in the number needing attention.
                       Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/m, the

            maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
            guide varies between ~n for slopes of only 5° to 2.9m
            for slopes of 30°. These figures apply to ’peak viewing’
            areas. Most of Spion Kop has a slope of about 17°
             for which the recommended spacing is 3.6m. The slope of the
             upper part changes to 25° for which the spacing is
             3.1m.
                        Whilst we believe it is arguable that parts of
e            Spion Kop could be considered as not being ’peak
             viewing areas’ we are prepared to accede to the police
             view and use peak viewing area standards for all barriers.
             This also applies to the stands at the west end of the
              ground.
                         We propose that the existing barriers should be
              supplemented by new ones as shown in red on the attached
              drawtng.1610/1X. The green shaded area behind each
                           shows the area which can then be assumed to be

              available for spectators. This area is 2958m which
               at 54 persons/1Om gives a capacity of 15,973. It
               should’be kept in mind that as many as 20,000~_e~a~s ....

                      Splan Kop has three exits, one near each
              end and one at the top. The total width of
              these three exits at their narrowest points is 12.~n.
              The guide assumes a maximum flow rate through such
              exits of 60 persons per minute for each 550mm of
@             width. Thus the theoretical time to discharge
              16,OOO spectators from Spion Kop would be 11~ minutes,
                                                               the
              compared with a maximum of 8 minutes indicated by
              guide. We do not consider this to be a serious
              matter. Rapid evacuation (in say 8 minutes) is very
              desirable for stands where there may be a risk due to
               fire, or explosion, or structural failure. In the
               case of terracing it is only the impatience of spectators
               which might create danger. We believe that for an
               interim period at least the evacuation time of 11~
               minutes should be acceptable.
                          The exits at each end of the terrace are
                reasonably free from hazards, except the one at the North
@               end passes under a bridge with a headroom below the
                recommended value of 8ft. This defect could be
                removed by lowering the floor level, but we believe
                 it is far from essential to have such a large headroom,
                 and the cost of modification is not justified in an
                 existing structure.
                            The exit at the back of Spion Kop would benefit
                 from handrails dividing it into lanes. Some remodelling

             be made for circulation space as spectators have
             to move quite considerable horizontal distances
             to achieve good packing. The full area would
             justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
             probably be appropriate to allow 10~ as the equivalent
             of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.
             The barriers should be designed to match this figure
                                       Those barriers which cannot withstand
             6kN/m should be ap:r::::;::~Y strengthened, and extra
             ones provided wher         Y.
                       The extra barriers required to achieve
              approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
              attached copy of drawing 1610/2X.
                       The three exits have a total width of about
              ll. Sm which would permit about 1250 people per minute
              to leave the ground. Thus the terrace could be
              emptied in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                         The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
O             should be within 12m of a gangway or exit. There are

             lno gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
               exit. But we feel this is of no consequence as
               movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
                 and quick.
                 The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace

                       This area is also illustrated in the drawing

                 gan~ays) is ibOu~" 565-2" Thus if the crush barriers
                 were adequate and the whole area is included the number
                 of spectators could be
                                      theabout 3,050.

            shown on our drawing 1610/2X, the area which can
            be used in calculatlng spectator capacity is that
            shown in green. This area is about 535m2 corresponding
            to about 2900 spectators. Thls would bring the total
            standing at the Lepplngs Lane end to 10,100.
                       The exits serving thls part of the terraces
            are very adequate in width and there w111 be no
e           dlfflculty in emptying in eight minutes.


     Seating Accommodation
     (a)     The North Stand
                        The form of construction of this stand Is
             such that It presents a minimum flre hazard. The
             exits are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy
             the recommendations o£ the guide.
                    The exits are very ~u~rglnally below the
             recommended 1.1m width, but we do not consider thls
             to be of great consequence.
                        Gangways are only 640mm wlde for much of their
e            length (they widen round the exit). This is well
             below the green guide reco~endatlon. However, It
              is clearly appropriate to take into account the
              general nature of the stand, the number as well as
             the width o£ the gangways, and above all the ease and
              speed wlth which spectators can evacuate the stand.
                          On 6 January we counted the number o£ spectators
              leavlng in successive minutes after the £1nal whlstle.
              The figures were 71, 72,-80 and 73. Thereafter
              the number £eli off as the spectators were In no hurry.
              Thls establlshed that In an emergency the green guide
               figure of 80 per mlnute (relatlng to a 1"1m gangway)
               can be achieved. Wlth 18 exits for 10,0OO spectators


                                                                                     J

            the average is 556 per exit. Thus the stand would
            empty in about seven minutes, which is within the
            recommended llmlt of eight minutes.
                    Our observations in company with the fire
            officer~ staff on 6 January showed that everyone
            had left this stand, apart from some people who were
            in no hurry, in about six minutes, although we also

O           counted about 40 per exit who left before the final
            whistle. The overall picture appears very satisfactory
             and we suggest that this stand should be accepted
             as not needing any significant modification.

     Cb)     The West Stand
                   This stand is very similar to the north stand
             in its construction. We were not able to accurately
             assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
             January because there were many seats which were unsold.
             However, there is every reason to believe that there
             will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
             eight minutes also. There should be no need for
             significant modifications.

      (c)    The South Stand
                   The structure has been surveyed and appended
              are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
              show the plans and cross-section. Also attached is
              a seating plan, drawing No. 1610/6.
                         The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
              has 5710 seats.   These are served by 12 exits (excluding
              those serving the directors box) so that an average
              of 476 people need tO pass through each exit. The
              count by the fire officer’s staff on 6 January showed
              an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
              exit which corresponds to an emptying time of about
              seven minutes. Indeed there were very few people

                                                                          J

              still trying to get out six minutes after the final
              whistle. A few had no doubt left early and a fee
              were still standing around, but the stand had
              substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                         Having left the top of the stand the spectators
              have to make their way from the first floor landing
O             via one of three staircases. Two of these are 3.6m
              wide and the other 2.4. This is equivalent to 17~
               ’lanes’ of 55Omm. At 40 people per lane, 700 people
              pass per minute. To discharge 5710 people (less
               those in the directors box) will therefore take almost
               exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.
                          At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
               almost straight to the open air, through a compartment
               which is separated from the main part of the building.
               The third staircase passes through a wide lobby which
               will probably need three sets of self closing fire
               doors to separate it from the remainder of the building.
               The club intends to move the paint store from the
O               space behind this staircase.
                          The front, open-air part of the south stand is
                well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
                one passage. This passage has a theoretical capacity
                of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.
                This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes. Because
                the stand is open to the air and there is very
                ready access to thepitch we do not think this rather~ _
                long emptying time is of any great consequence, i ,~


     General Requirements
               The police and the fire officer, and possibly the .................
     Building Surveyor, will no doubt wish to discuss a number of
     matters. Prior to holding a further formal meeting they
                                                                                     j

    will probably wlsh to study the drawings and to pay a
    further visit. We would like to be present when any
    further inspection is made and would appreciate contact
    being ~zde with Dr. Wood d~uring Dr. Eastwood’s absence
    which will extend to 15 February.
              If the police would like to suggest the kind of police
0   post they would like, this can be considered by the club
    and drawings prepared by us as a matter of urgency.
              A meeting to discuss all aspects of the application
    might be held around say 16 February.
              In the meantime EastTood k Partners will be checking
     the various electrical services so that we shall be in a
     position to discuss these at the meeting.

        Purpose of Meeting

Following the Working Par ty’ s meet[ng wi th the repre sentative s of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 13th December, 1978, the
Secretary of the Club had (by letter dated 22nd January, 1979) circulated a
Beport, together with Plans, drawn up by Dr. W. Eastwood of Eastwood
and Partners. The Secretary had also suggested a meeting on Friday,
16th February, 1979, to discuss the documents.

The purpose of today’s meeting was to consider the views which the Working
Party should put to the Club on the 16th February.

2.      Prans

(a) Whilst the "Notes for the Guidance of Applicants" stated that detailed
plans at 1:100 scale should be supplied of all buildings and other accommodation
for spectators, some of the plans supplied were to 1:200 scale. The Fire
Service felt that the latter size were acceptable provided all of the plans were
to the same scale, and it was AGBEED that the "Notes for the Guidance of
Applicants" should be amended to read plans to 1:200 scale.

(b)     The site plan at 1:500 scale had not been supplied as required by the
Notes, but Eastwood and Partners had undertaken to prepare this in time for
Friday’s meeting. The firm had also promised that all site fixtures would be
indicated on that plan.
                                          I.




                                                                                !
     (c) It ~x~as A GI~ EED that the olans suppI:.ed h~fl inaccu_,yac~.es and
     inadequacies, hi particular. ~,-.y lacked indications of cross sections,
     profiles, structural smbili.ry, uosition of hand!,’ails and balustrades, width
     of stairways, etc. Where appropriate, these could, as an alternative, be
     described in a Report.

     (d) The County Council’s hope was that, in view of limited resources in
     the Architectural & Building Services Division, the plans supplied and finally
     accepted by the Working Party could form the basis of the Certificate
    ~Drawings.

    3.          B eport

        (a)     General

        It was recognised that the criteria set out in the Home Office "Guide to
        Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)" required new work or reconstruction
        to be to a standard not lower than the standard set out in the Guide, and that
        in existing situations the criterion was that o[ a reasonable degree of safety.
O       As the Guide stated, it would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable,
        to seek the absolute safety of everyone attending a ground.

      With these factors in mind, both the Fire Service and the Police felt that
    ~ the flow of spectators was the most :muortant criteria to be adopted.
      Whilst not disa.gree~_ng with this viewpoint, the Building Authority suggested
      it would be use[ul to know the reasoning bebind the recommendation in the
      Guide that gang’ways should not be less than 1.1 me~es wide. The County
      Council AGREED to try to find this information out, and the Fire Service
      AGREED they would contact their colleagues in other areas who had been
      involved in the Certification process to ascertain how nearly the 1.1 metre
    ¯ gangway recommendation had been observed in existing situations in their
      respective areas.

        At the request of the Fire Service, the County Council also AGREED to try
        and find out if there was any general recommendation on reduced
        admission if a ground were used at a night time instead of during the day
                                                                                    O
        lime.

         ~o) " Front Cover

        .Whilst it was probably a typing mistake, it was AGBEED that the wording
        on the Front Cover should read ,~EPORT TO SOUTH YOBKSHIBE COUNTY
         COUNCIL" and not "BEPOBT OF SOUTH YORKSHIBE COUNTY COUNCIL".


                                       -2-
    (c)    .SpJen Kop (pages 2, 3 & 4)

    The Working Party agreed with the Ctub’s view that, with the existing three
    exits, there was no way that the recommended discharge time of 8 minutes
    could be met. Where they disagreed was that an evacuation time of 11~
    minutes should be regarded as acceptable. If no more exits were to be
    provided, the Working Party A Glq EED that a crowd limitation of 11,040
    on the Spion Kop should be imposed.

    The existing exit at the North end passed under a bridge with a headroom
    below agreed by the Club to be less than the recommended value of 8ft.
    As this was in fact some 6’6", the Working Party AGBEED that the Club
    be informed that in their view it is essential that the floor be lowered to
    remove this danger to spectators.

    The exit at the South side would also require widening, and possibly flow
    barriers would need installing.

    The area at the back of the Kop would also require close attention.
O
    If new exits were to be provided by the Club, it was AGREED that at least
    TWO would be required. The most economical way of providing one would
    be to use the gates in the existing barrier, provided these were lined up with
    the gangways, with discharge onto the pitch surround, and the other v~uld
    require to be a completely new exit.

    The Building Authority felt that the majority of the crush barriers would fail
    the tests, and consequently any necessary re-siting would probably not be
    too much of a problem. Certainly the suggested additional barriers would
    require careful consideration.

    For the purposes of crowd control, the Police suggested there should be some 1]l:

    I
    form of lateral separation. The Working Party AGBEED, and it was suggested
    that three metal fences sited centrally in the blocks (as opposed to adjacent
    to the gangways) should be provided, with access between each limited to a
O   padlocked gateway under the control of the Police.

    A s recent adverse weather conditions had proved, ice and snow on the Kop
    could cause problems, and it was AGREED that Paragraphll (4) of the draft
    Certificate should be amended so as to require the Club to take steps to
    clear the Kop of ice and snow before a game was played.

    The Building Authority pointed out that information was still required from
    the Club on profile and step dimensions and the slope of the Kop.

                                    -3-
    (d)          The West Terrace (pages 4&5)

    in view of the lack of depth of t, his terrace, the Club’s offer to reduce the


    l___ga
    spectator limit to 7,200, and the discharge time of 6.6 minutes, me
    Working Party AGREED that it would be unreasonable to insist that //
       ngways or ~dditional exits must ~e provtded.                      ~-

    However, even if the existing crush barriers were to pass the tests, the
    Working Party A GR EED that the barriers would require special attention
    in view of the apparant sharp edges, corrosion, etc.

     (e)         The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 6)

     The Working Party AGREED there were no real problems here, but the
     Building Authority pointed out that as well as the crush barriers, the
     existing corrugated sheeting would require to pass the appropriate tests.

     (f)         The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)
O
     Whilst the flow rates and discharge times were probably satisfactory (the
     construction and width of the ramps being such that they could quite properly
     be regarded as elevated roadways), the fact remained that the gangways in
     the North Stand were only 640ram wide for much of their length, compared
     with the recommended width of I. I metres.
      Additionally, observations had shown that t-~vo-thirds of the spectators used
      the upper exit, whilst the remainder used the lower exit. An ideal would be
      to provide additional exits at the top of the stand but, in view of ’.ts cantilever
      construction, the cost would be prohibitive.

      A s an alternative, the Working Party A GREED that consideration might be
      given to removing a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangnvay
      to the upper exits, with a physical barrier across the stand below the upper
      exits to ensure more equal use of both upper and lower exits by spectators.
      If this woutd cause difficulties, a barrier in the gangways only below the upper
O     exits might be considered.

          So far as the Wire Mesh barriers under the stand were concerned, the
          Working Party AGREED that these must either be removed or made of a
          permanent construction.

           (g)     The West Stand
           Whilst the exits were adequate and well spaced and the discharge times
           were acceptable in view of the type of stand, the Fire Service felt that
                                             -- 4 --
                                       6J
    the means of escape were not adequate as the only means of egr~ss "~,~
    by way of two s.ttt[rcases. The Work:,ng Party AC!~E!~D that [t was essential
    that another staircase be provided, and one on the south-west corner was felt
    to be the most acceptable.

    (h)     The South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

    So far as the seating arrangements were concerned, tbe Working Party
    felt that it was the front, open air part which caused the concern. Because
    of the bad ingress/egress, the Working Party AGBEED that two additional
    exits would be required. It was suggested that the most economical way of
    doing this was by means of one discharging at the Spion Kop end and the
    other by breaking through the wall by the Tea Bar.

    Additionally, the penning arrangements of the seating would need to be
    looked at closely.

    A s the balustrades and handrails were constructed of timber, the Building
    Authority considered they would be likely to fai! the appropriate tests.
O   Also, as the staircase was a 24 instead of the maximum 12 riser recommended
    in the Guide it was probable that this would have to be reconstructed.

    Contrary to their initial reaction, the Fire Service felt that, provided that the
    necessary increased fire resistance measures were carried out, the stand
    would not be the problem from a combustabi!ity point of view that they had
    anticipated.

    The Building Authority expressed concern as to the corrosion of the steel
    work of the stand, and considered that this wouid require investigation.

     The police expressed concern about the use of the car park behind the
     Stand. Persons entitled to use this car park frequently arrived just before
     the start of a match and drove through the spectators attempting to gain
     access to the ground. As they ].eft immediately afterwards, the same thing
     occurred at the end of a match. This practice had to be stopped, either by
     banning the use of the car park entirely on match days or imposing some sort
O    of time restriction on its use before and after a match.

      (h)    General lqequirements

     ¯ These were not discussed by the Working Party at this stage.

        I refer to my minute of 5th March, 1979, and to the recent telephone
        eonversaUoas between Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff and Divisional Officer
        K. Jones of your Fire Prevention Seclon.

        Following the return from holiday of the Chairman of the Sheffield Wednesday
        Football Club Ltd., the Club Secretary Informed me that the 30th March,
        1979 was not convenient. That meeting has, therefore, now been arranged
@       for 2.30 p.m. on Monday, 2nd April, 1979, after conferring with the members
        of the Working Party.

I.       :Purpose of Meetin~

Following the postponement of the meeting with the Club because of adverse
weather and the di~culty in agreeing a mutually convenient alternative
date, the purpose of the meeting was to review the position since 12th February,
1979, prior to the re-arranged meeting with the Club which was now to take
place on 2nd April, 1979.

2.       Plans

The plans at 1:500 scale and indicating a11 site fixtures were, it was sti!! understood,
to be supplied by East~vood & Parmers at the meeting ~d*,h the Club.

3.       Report
(a)      ,General

The County Council had contacted the Home Office, but had been given little
information addkional to that conta!’nedln tl~eir various Circulars. Basically,
they had said that any new work or reconstruction had to be to a standard not
lower than that set out in the Guide. However, ~the maximum flexibility had
to be maintained in the case of existing structures and differences in such
matters as age, size and mode of construction had to be taken into account.

 The Fire Service had contacted four other Brigades with designated grounds,
 and only in one case had the recommendations of the Guide been strictly
 adhe re~r~’d"~.

                                    lo
        (b)      Spion Kop (pages 2, 3 & 4)                                             \
                                                                                            \

        Additional to the points mentioned on 12th February, 1979, coucern was
        expressed by the Building Authority as to the general maintenance of the Kop
        and the loose and broken concrete at the bottom in particular. If attention
        was not given to this, it was AGBF~.D that it would be necessary to restrict
        admission to the Kop, additional to the restric~on to 11, C40 if the extra
        exits are not provided.

        On the question of exits, it was again AGREED that it was essential to line
        up the gates in the existing barrier with the gangways. Of the existing two
        exits, concern was expressed as to the effect of ~e right-angled ~urn on
        the embankment at the exit at the rear. After discussion, it was AGREED
        that the best compromise was to leave things as they existed, provided
        handrails are provided on the stairways, taking into accoun~ ~he
        desirability of maintaining a smooth flow.

        The Fire Service q~eried the exact form of the lateral separation discussed
0       at the meeting on 12th February, 1979, as this would naturally have a
        bearing on the means of escape recommendations. After discussion, it
        was AGREED that the metal fences should not be of the climb-proof type,
        that it was not intended that they should obstruct the gangways, and that
        in consequence the padlocked gateway recommendation should be dropped.
        However, it was AGREED that it was still desirable to seek 3 x 2central
        barriers b-~t, if the Club really resisted the suggestion, 2 x 2 could
        reluctantly be conceded. The t~ilding Authority stressed that whatever
        barriers were provided would have to pass the appropriate strain tests.

        The fact that the height of many of the existing crush barriers was below the
        recommendation in the Guide, in some cases well below, was pointed out by the
        Building Authority. The corrosion point mentioned at the last meeting was
        also reiterated. It was AGREED that these points must be drawn to the
        Club’s attention, as must the condition of the Score Board Structure.

        (c)      The West Terrace (pages 4 & 5)

      As well as the condition of the crush barriers mentioned at the last meeting,
      the Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places of the
      terracing in small areas near to the stand. The cross-fall on the steps on
      the north-west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw
      people forward. T~he height of the crush barriers mentioned in regard to the~ /

    ~
    _ Spion Kop also applied. h was AGREED that all these points must be drawn
      to the Clu-6~s attention.

        (d)      The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 6)

        Having now had the opportunity of having a closer look at the existing corrugated
        sheeting, the Building Authority confirmed that it would require alteration to
        meet the requirements of the Guide.

                                              e
      (e)         The North S~nd (pages 6 & 7)

      The removal of a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangway
      to the upper exits and the removal of four seats at lhose exits was
      confirmed as being a reasonable compromise to put to the Club.

     As the asbestos sheets at the top of the stand were protected, the Building
     Authority felt that these could be accepted, and confirmed that the glazing
     at the ends of the stands was not glass and so would no~ shatter.

                 The West Stand (page 7)

     Consideration was given to the Building Authori .ty’s suggestion of lateral
     gangways and +.he segregation o/" exits but, after discussion, tr was AGREED
     that the additional staircase agreed at the last meeting should be coiffirmed.
     So long as it was of 4-unit exit width, it was AGREED it was not necessary
     to insist it should be on the sGuth-west corner. Such staircases could be
     bought "off the peg" and, if not installed in the close season, it was
O    AGREED that a ½ reduction in capacity would be necessary.

                 The South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

    As mentioned at the last meeting, the penning arrangements of the seating
    and the numbers of scats in the rows caused problems. Bearing in mind ~e
    need for reasor a~!eaess and to make the situation be~mr, it was AGREED
    that, even thcragh not strictly in accordance with the Guide, that the Desz
    compromise was to seek the removal of the existing barriers and their
    re-alignment, together with the widening of the gangways at the position
    of the wings.

    The Fire Service potnted out and it was AGREED that Fire Resisting Doors
    would be required leading to the Directors’ seating, and i hour fire
    resistance would be required for all problem areas under the stand. This
    could be reduced to ½ hour if automatic detection equipment were to be
O   Installed.

    For their part, the Building Authority reiterated their concern as to the
    corrosion of the steelwork of the stand, and a!so pointed out the concrete
    spalling which was occurring. Again, the likelihood of t.he ba!ustrading,
    barriers and guardrafls needing to be rei.,fforced or replaced was mentioned.
    It was AGREED all would need to be given attention by the Club.

    (h)      General Requirements (pages 8 & 9)

    As well as the Fire Service pointing out that the present temporary
    structures used for police and first-aid purposes would need removal
    from a means of escape point of v,:ew if the capacity of the North Stand


                                       Q
                                                                                     v "--.,




      wus not to be reduced, the Police stated that they were ready to dis~os---
    ~with the Club the facilities they would recluire. Briefly, they envisaged
    I!la permanent structure almost t~4ce as large as the existing ~emporary
    Iltstructure, and expected communications, detention, toilet, parade room,

    ~ete., facilities.
     So far as First-Aid was concerned, the Sheffield Area Health Authority
     had confirmed tbe~.r wil]inguess to provide advice on First-Aid and
      Medical Faci!itiez, b,,t the perzen uominated (Dr. H. Bailey - Specialist
     in Commvnfty Medicine (Sociat Services)) was on holiday until
      2nd April, 1979. He had been invited to the meeting, with the Cl’ab on
      2nd April, but it was recognLsed that possible practical difIic~,lties might
     prevent his doing so.

                  Representing the Working Party

                  Dr. H. Bailey (Sheffield Area Health Authority)
                  D. Hurst (South Yorkshire Police)

          Scope and Objectives of Discussions
     .


    Mr. H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were     t
    ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best in Europe. Crowds had beenIv
                                                                                   ~j
O averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
   had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
   viable, and it was hoped to expand this side of the Club’s activities. The Club’s
    eventual ambLtions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

    IT WAS AGREED -
    I. That, whilst Designating Orders did not specify time limits for the issue of
    General Safety Certificates, it was essential to aim for the Certificate to be issued
    by the start of the 1979/80 Season.


                                           lo
    2. That, as the Club wanted to attract representative games, the aim should
    be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.

    3. That as much work as possible should be carried out in the close season,
    bearing in mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
    will be more restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah’s Witness Bally had
    also to be borne in mind.

     2. Discussion on Standing Areas

    A. Spion Kop

     IT WAS AGREED -

     1. That the siting and angle of the new barriers to be installed be the subject
     of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.
                                                                                           (
    I 2. That the Club consider the installation of simple lateral barriers (not of the
    ~ climb proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
    ~centrai block (but not so as to obstruct the gangways).
     3. That, in view of the clearance time of 11~ minutes compared with the
     8 minutes specified in the Guide, the means of escape be discussed in detail
     between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service (including the re-siting of the gates
     in the existing barriers and, possibly the widening of the existing gates and/or
     an increase in their number).
      4. That the headroom at the North end under the bridge be increased to the
      maximum possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

      5. That representative parts of the concrete wall and boundary posts and fences
      be tested to the appropriate standards.
      6. That the condition of the concrete at the lower end, the height of some of the
O     crush barriers and the scoreboard structure be the subject of detailed discussions
      between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

       7.    That the Club’s longer term proposals for the improvement of the means of
       egress be unanimously welcomed.
       8. That the maximum capacity of the Spion Kop be determined after the foregoing
       points have been resolved.

     B.       West Terrace

        IT WAS AGREED -

        I. That the Club’s proposals for the installation of additionRl barriers and the
    I/  r eduction in capacity to 7,200 spectators without the need for additlonal gangways
        should be implemented.

    ~/f2.    That the question of the cross-fall on the steps on the north-west corner      I~
    Ill exlt, the height of some of the existing crush barriers, as well as their corrosion
     I and sharp edges in places, be the subject of detailed discussion between
    I~
     Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.
    ~
        C. North West Corner Terrace

        IT WAS AGREED -

        1. That the Clubs proposals to bring the crush barriers up to standard and
O       supplemented by new barriers with a consequent capacity of 2,900 spectators should
        be implemented.

        2.    That the improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting be
        the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

        3. North Stand

        IT WAS AGREED -

        I.     That, in view of the obvious difference of opinion between the Club and the
        Working Party as to the appropriate steps (if any) to be taken over the width of the
        existing gangways, both sides be requested to consider all the points made, and
        to re-consider the matter at the next meeting.

        2.    That the question of fire protection works to the Store Boom and to the Team
        Room be the subject of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the
        Fire Service.

        3. That the replacement (from a fire hazard point of view) of the existing Police
        and First-Aid Temporary Structures under the Stand be accepted in principle, and
        that the facilities required in the new permanent structures be considered later in
        the Agenda.

        4. That the existing Wire Mesh barriers under the Stand be the subject of
        discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service.

        5. That the question of the provision of handrails be the subject of discussions
        between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

    4.    West Stand

    IT WAS AGREED -

    Tl~t, whilst the upper level of the Stand can be emptied in the required time,
    consideration be given to reducing the congestion which may occur in the lower
    leve! by examining the possibility of erecting an additional stairway at each
    end of the Stand (possibly of the Fire Escape type for emergency use, rather
    than for normal use).

    5.    South Stand

    IT WAS A GREED -

    I.    That Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor discuss in detail the apparent
    spalling of the concrete frame at high levels, apparent corrosion of the main
    steelwork columns, removal of the timber casing at base level for inspection (2
Q   only as representative sample), and load testing of a representative sample of
    single and double skin walls.

    2. That, to overcome the means of escape problems in the upper part of the
    Stand (the covered area), ~f.he existing barriers be removed altogether, the Club
    to deal with any problems about different admission charges by way of coloured
    seats or some such alternative.

    3. That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the methods of upgrading the
    fire resistance in the central area, protected escape routes, and the provision of
    handrails down the stairways.

    4. That the means of escape problems in the front open air part of the stand
    be dealt with on the West side by making an additional exit for emergency use only
    through the Tea Bar wall to the foot of the existing stairway, and that on the east
    side consideration be given to providing an addi tional gangway to exit on to the
    derelict land adjoining the Spion Kop.

    5. That no immediate answer seemed to be available with regard to a possible
    limitation on the use of the car park behind the Stand by entitled persons immediately
    before a match, even though police had control of its use after a match.

    6.   Ground Exits

    Dr. Eastwcod apologised that the 1:500 site plan had, unknown to him, not been
    already supplied some time ago. He undertook to ensure that copies were
    circulated without delay.




                                              .
    7.     Communications

    IT WAS AGREED That consideration would be given to the installation of an
    Improved public address system, with the Police having access to Its control
    from their Control Room, together with its use as a fire alarm system, subject
    to an emergency back-up system in the event of failure.

    8.     Police and First Aid Facilities

     IT WAS AGREED -

    I.   That the Club accept the principle of permanently contructed Police and
    FirstAid Facilities.

     2. That the Police would supply the Club Secretary with a copy of their initial
     sketch plan showing the facilities they wished to see, and that Dr. Bailey would
     inspect the existing first-aid and medical facilities and then discuss future
     facilities with Dr. Eastwood.
O
    9.     Any other Topics

     IT WAS AGREED That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the existing
     and any proposed emergency generating and fire-fighting equipment.

     10.   Future Action

     The Club stressed that they wished to carry out as much work as possible before
     the issue of the Certificate by the start of the 1979/80 Season. If this was to be done,
     it was essential that any points for discussion between the various representatives
     of the Working Party and Dr. Eastwood had to be cleared without delay.

                   E. England (Secretory)
                   H. E. McGee (Chairman)
                   lq. Whitehead (Director)

                   lqepresenting the Working Party

                   F. Davis (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
O                  D. Hurst (South Yorkshire Police)
                   K. Jones (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

                   D. J. Shirtclif.fe (South Yorkshire County Council - Admin. Dept.)
                   D. I. Vauglmn (South Yorkshire County Council- Admin. Dept.)

    Apologies for absence were received from Dr. H. Bailey (Sheffield Area Health
    Authority) and H. £. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service).

    The Note (previously circulated) of the meeting held on 2ndApril, 1979, was considerec
    in conjunction with a Note (circulated at the meeting) of a meeting between Eastwood
    and Partners, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the City of Sheffield
    Metropolitan District Council Building Surveyor’s Department held on 13th April, 1979.

    The Note of the meeting held on 2rid April, 1979, was agreed, subject to the following
    amendments and additions in the light of the further investigations and discussions:-

            Splon Kop

    Paras. 1 & 2 - lqevised copies of drawing no. 1610/IX were circulated at the meeting
    showing the proposed new crush barrier layout, includh~g the two lines of radial
    barriers. This was AGIqEED in principle.

    Para. 3 - A 16,850 crowd capacity on the Kop as existing would mean an unacceptable
    evacuation time of some 12z! minutes. Larger and re-aligned gates in the barrier
    and improvement of the existing upper exit could reduce this time to some 10 minutes,
    but 8 minutes could only be achieved by installing a new exit of 3 metre overall width.

    i
    This could be integrated into the proposed future scheme for enlarging and roofing the
    Kop. The Club AGlqEED.to give consideration to the proposals.
      Pare. 4 - The exploratory work regurd[ng the Improvement of the beadroom had
      still to be carried out, but was not expected to be a major item.

       Pare. 5 - Because of the dlfflculty in devlslng a suitable method of testlng In places
      "(such as the top of the Kop), [t was AGIqEED that proposals should be formulated
       after further discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.
    I I Pare. 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard I

   _ ~ I etructure should be looked at. It was AGBEED that the question of the h~ight of some
<’-i~l[l of the crush barriers be considered again after It was seen which of them failed on


       Pare. ? - The Club stressed that their proposals for the improvement of the means of
       egress would hopefully be carried out in the shorter rather than the longer term future.

       pare. 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush barriers, together with --
       the installation of the new crush barrier layout and alteration of the gates in the existin.~
@      barrier, could all be carried out in the close season. Their aim was to achieve a
       16,850 crowd capacity.

       213     West Terrace

       Para. 2 - The Club accepted that in view of the cross-fall on the north-west corner
       exit, the steps should be re-built. R w-as ~GIqEED ~hat the other matters would be~
        considered again after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing. /~

        2C     North West Corner Terrace

        Para. 2 - Whilst accepting the need for the improvement or replacement of the
        existing corrugated sheeting, the Club felt they wished to consider whether to carry
        out more extensive works so as to bring the existing unused area into use for an
        additional 250/300 spectators.

        3.   North Stand

        Pare. i - Dr. Eastwood, the Building Surveyors and the Fire Service had reached
        agreement on a scheme which could be recommended to the Club. This would
        involve the removal of 10 seats from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats from in
        front of each of the 9 upper exits. The result would mean a loss of 126 seats
        compared to the 225 in the original proposals. The Club AGBEED to give
        consideration to the proposal.

        Pare. 2 - The word at the end of the first line should have been ’Tea’ and not ’Team’.
        It was AGIqEED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service would discuss in detail any
        fire protection works considered to be necessary.




                                                    1
     o      West Stand

    The Club AGREED that additional exits ofshnple steel construction should be
    provided from each end of the upper stand.

    5.     South Stand
    Pars. 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor timber.
    Whilst rusting was not excessive, it was AGREED that all bases would be exposed for
    inspection and, if necessary, steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
    encasing in concrete for permanent protection. Because of the apparent accumulation
    of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
    Club also AGREED that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.

    I:~ra. 2 - Provided the penning barriers were removed entirely, it was AGREED that
    it would not be necessary to remove any seats for escape purposes in the upper part
    of the stand (the covered area).
O
    loam. 3 - It was AGREED that timber handrails should be provided down each of the .
    outer edges of the main staircase; that the existing iron centre railing should remain,
    and that a new handrail down the centre of each side of the stairway should be installed.
    It was also AGREED that the brick staircase walls should be buttressed where crowd
    surge pressure could be generated.

    Pare. 4 - So far as the front open air part of the stand was concerned, it ~-as AGREED
    that on the west side a new exit through a new i. 2 metre wide door adjacent to the exLsti~g
    snack bar should be provided, with appropriate fire resistance measures in the
    surrounding area. On the east side, consideration was given to an extension of the
    footway at the front of the stand and the remo~al of the wail, provided the new exit was
    isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the ~’ire Service
    should consider precisely what measures could be considered satisfactory so as to
    avoid any loss of seats.

    6.     Ground Exits

    The 1:500 site plan was in the process of being circulated.

     o      C0mmun[cations

    The Club stressed they were thinking in terms of an upgrading of the existing public
    address system. It was AGREED that the Police should have an over-ride facility
    from their Police Room, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look into the possibility of
    achieving this through radio, rather than wire, means.

      o     Police and First Aid Facilities

    Paras. 1 & 2 - The Police stressed that it was essential that there was no gap in
    the provision of police Facilities when the temporary structure was replaced by
    the permanent structure. With this in mind, they were happy for the safety aspects

                                              o
                                                                                             I

    to receive first prlority and to ~It for the 1980 close season for the work to be
    carried out. It was understood that Dr. Bailey had not yet completed his Investigations
    Into the fLrst-aLd and medical facilities.

    9.     Any other Topics

    The evening of the 27th April was agreed as mutually convenient to test the existing
    emergency lighting equipment.

    I0.        Future Action

    Mr. McGee stressed that it was essential for decisions to be taken urgently if the
    club were to complete their plans, both from a financial and practical point o[ view.

     The Club were to make application for financial assistance under the Football
     Association’s Ground Improvement Scheme, and bad to have over 50,000 crowd
     capacity if the aim of attracting international matches ~-as to be achieved. The latest
@    proposals, if implemented, appeared to give a capacity of some 50,750.

     So that they could be noted and returned for agreement, the Working party asked for
     2 copies of all plans (as revised) to be supplied by Dr. Eastwood, especially to the
     Fire Service and the Building Surveyor.

     Mr. McGee requested that he be advised if it appeared that any undue delay ~-as
     occurring as the club wished to ensure that the certification procedure proceeded ~thout
                                                                    r

      delay.

         gangway length above each central exit, and remove 4 No. seats immediately
         below each exit to allow for barrier erection .....................

     @
         Replace existing wire mesh barriers by suitable substantial barriers
         complying with guide recommendations.

    It is noted that there are no handrails to the stairs from the stand, but in
    view of restricted ~idth and length it is not proposed to require these.

    North-West Terrace

    I. Replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear is required.
@   2.   The removal of under-strength barriers and their replacement by new ones
         constructed to guide recommendations.

    Spion Kop

         The arrangement for crush barriers as produced by the consultant, whilst
         not complying fully with the guide recommendations, is considered adequate
         if the other requirements are fulfilled. These other requirements includ,
         the 2 No. radial barriers indicated on Plan IXA and the provision of an
         additional 3 m wide egress route to South-East area, and of gated openings
         to give access from the radial gangways 1o the ground perimeter area.

    2. Make good all broken and spalled concrete terracing.

     o   Increase headroom to North-Fast egress route to a minimum of 2.1 m.

         replaced, or strengthened, where necessary.

         Provision of handrails and suitable headroom to egress routes to be re-
         assessed after re-routing of gangways etc. has been carried out.

         Fire resistance and restriction of flame spread to be improved to all areas
     .
         as discussed; the consultant is to confirm the work proposed to be carried
         out. Arrangements to be made for the clearance of all combustible material
         from under stand areas.
    Nith regard to fUture meetings I think it is essential that all matters agreed
    be recorded, as we are now approaching finality in many areas and it is necessary
    that we have recorded exactly the agreed matters.

    l.would also suggest that in view of the approach of certification it would,
    perB~ps, be advisable to hold fUture meetings away from the ground, and that
    Mr. Vaughan, as the co-ordinator, should chair such meetings.

    Yours faithfully,

                 Dear Sir

                 I refer to your letter, reference number DV/AW/583, dated 20 April 1979,
    @            concerning the above matter.

                 The requirements I wish to see imposed are as follows:-

                I. The existing crush barriers at the ground be tested on a load of
                   400 lb./ft., the maximum required by the guide to the Act. (This is
                   to be done immediately and, thereafter, 20 per cent of the crush
                   barriers, chosen at random, to be tested each year, ensuring that
                   each crush barrier is tested at least once every five years)

                 2"!Vertical barriers be placed °n the Spi°n K°P t° prevent lateral ~ ~movement


                       Gateways in the existing perimeter fencing be realigned with the
                       gangways of the Spion Kop.
                       The police have the facility to override the public address system.~

                5. A suitable police room be provided.
@               Representatives of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have accepted
                these proposals without demur and, with the exception of item 5, will be
                carried out during the close season of 1979. The police room will be
                provided during 1980.

                At the request of your Mr. D. J. Shirtcliffe, I am enclosing a copy of
                a sketch of the proposed police room.
                  ,\

        The existing facilities are much below an acceptable standard and I
        would suggest the Club consider providing a more ~rmanent structure
        which is not likely 1o require up grading for a very long time. The
        internal finish particularly of ~he Treatment area should be of an
        impervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered
        fairly s±erile and req~aire no decoration. This can be achieved by
        the use of tiles or formica type finish etc....



     The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space 1o minimise
     the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

@
    The Treatment Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
    patients at any one ~ime and consideration should be given to the
    needs for privacy wi±hin the treatment area, bearing in mind that
    the three patients may well be lying on couches.

           --u


    Good lighting is essential ard at %be present ±ime s+~rip lighting
    is very much in vogue and would be satisfactory. The provision of
    a power point would also appear to be a basic requirement.

    WAT~

    A supply of hot a~ cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
    for drinking. I1 would also appear reasonable 1o request provision
    of a hand basin and a large Belfast type sink. The Club should
    consider whether i1 would be cheaper in the long run 1o provide
    stainless steel basins which are not subject 1o chipping.

    . I[ET m UIRE       E
    The Club should provide at least one male and one female toilet, for
    the use of the public and should consider whether they should provide
    an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

    S~D~


    ~
    S%orage facilities are required for six stretchers, and for two sets
    of wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen. This storage
    should be lockable.

    EQUIP~NT

    The following is a minimum list to provide a basic service.

    Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
    on space available and/or number of cubicles~ if the accommodation is

A telephone facility would appear 1o be basic in 1979.   This can be
achieved by an extension from the main switch, or sharing with police



The Club may also consider what facilities should be extended to %he
                                                                        /

    Dear Sir,

    ,Ssfet~r of Spor’t.s Grounds Act 1975

    I have now received the detailed comments of all of the dLscipLh~s
    represented on the Workh~ Party.
@   These have been collated into the attached schedule whlch, together with
    plans, confirm formally in writing the matters dkcussed by the Working
    Party with the Club over the series of meeUngs held so far and which
    the County Coanc[l feel require attention so as to secure reasonable
    safety at the Ground.

    They are, of course, [ndlvidualzrequIrements on specific matters and are
    addiflonalJto the general require-~ents set out in the specimen form of
    General Safety Certificate forwarded to the Club with my letter of
    8th December, 1978, and discussed at the meeting held on 13th December,
    197 8,

    After the Clu~ has had the opportunity of considering the scheduin, perhaps
    you would let me kn~w which of the requirements ye~a feel wilt be able to
    be carried out In the close season.
@   Should you have any queries, Mr. D. Vaugban- of my staff (ext. 422) would
    be happy to discuss thegn with you.

                                      Yours faithfully,

                   of an additional 3m wide egress route to South-East area, and of ~ ~
                   openings to give access from the radial gangways to the grouna penme~er

Po    Public Address System_

       The existing public address system to be upgraded, with the Police having an
       over-ride facility from their Police Room.

Qo     Police Facilities

       A suitable permanent Police Room (with facilities as shown on the sketch plan
       marked AA ) to be provided in the 1980 close season.

 R.    First Aid Facilities

        (L)         Structure

                     The extstLng facilities are considered to be below an acceptable standard
                     and it is suggested the Club consider providing a more permanent
                     structure which Ls not likely to require up-grading for a very long time.
                     The internal finish, particularly of the Treatment area, should be of an
                      impervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered fairly
                      sterile and require no decoration. Thls can be achieved by the use of
                      tiles or formica type finish etc ....

           (it)      Waiting Area

                      The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to minlmlse
                      the cost, where sitting cases could walt for attention on chalrs.

                      patients at any one time, and consideratLon should be given to the needs
                      for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that the three
                      patients may well be lying on couches.

                 Good lighting Is essentLal and strLp ILghting would be satisfactory.   The
                 provLsLon of a power point would also be a tl~sLc requirement.

    (v)          Water

                 A supply of hot and cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
                 for drinking. A hand basin and a large Belfast type sink should also
                 be provided. The Club might consider whether it would be cheaper in
                 the long run to provide stainless steel t~tslns which are not subject to
                 chipping.

     (vi)        Toilet Requirements

                 The Club should provLde at least one male and one female toilet, for
                 the use of the public, and should consider whether they should provide
                 an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

     (vii)        Storage
                  Storage facilities are required for slz stretchers, and for two sets of
                  wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen. This storage should
                  be lockable.

      (viii)      Equipment

                  The following Ls a minimum Iist to provide a basic service:-

                   Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
                   on space available and/or number of cublcles, if the accommodation is
                   cubicled.

    The original intention of the visR had been to check that the outstanding matters
    referred to In the Note of the meeting held on 12th November had been completed
    or were in the course of completion prior to the anticipated issue of the Certh~cate
    by the County Council this week.

    2.      Minor Matters

    An Lnspectionof the ground showed that a number of minor matters still required
    attention, butthe Club undertook to ensure that these were attended to Ln the m xt
    few days.

    3.      Major Matters

    A.      Emergency Lighting - South Stand

     The meetLngs which had taken place between the County FLre Service and Messrs.
     Eastwood and Partners sLnce 12th November on the South Stand Emergency Lighting
     had produced agreement on an interim arrangeme~ whLch would be regarded as
     acceptable for the duration of the existin~ battery life. Further modifications at
     that time would remedy the shortcomings of the existing installation. Details were
     contained in the letter dated 12th December which Messrs. Eastwood and I~ tners
     l~ad addressed to the Fire Service.              ]+
         /

             South Stand Construction

     The Building Authority expressed concern as to what they saw as a lack of structural
     integrity In the South Stand. In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
     progressive deterioration of the Stand which, It was felt, could only be properly
     determined by a full structural survey. The report forwarded by Messrs. Eastwood
     and Partners in the last week was not considered to be sufficiently comprehensive
     to provide the required information, and the basis of calculation used could not be
     agreed as appropriate. Whilst it was agreed that there had not been a specific
     written request for such a full structural survey of tl~ South Stand, the Building
     Authority felt that it had been inherent [n the detailed discussions which had taken
II   place that such a report would be forthcoming. The Building Authority were
      concerned at the possibility that the requirements of the Building Regulations and
      the Code of Practice Safety Factors could not be met; In particular the Structural
      stability of the South Stand in eonditbns of gale force winds and heavy snowfall
      was mentioned.

     For the Club, Dr. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obviously not be built to the
     same specification or the same construction standards nowadays, but pointed out
     that, for Instm ce, none of the buildings in Sheffield built before 1970 could meet
     the latest wind pressure requirements. Even the Building l~esearch Station was
     evidently thinking in terms that these requirements were unrealistically high. In
     his professional Opinion, the Stand was structurany safe and able in practice to meet
     the loadings demanded. In any case, the conditions which had been described as
     being possibly dangerous would mean In practice that a match could not be played
     and consequently no spectators would be present.

      Experience of the corrosion of indoors steel In th~ Sheffield area showed this t~ be
      minimal, and the Stand was regularly test loaded by spectators. Structures such
      as this would show obvious external signs, such as cracks, well before there was
      any possibility of collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
      visual inspection. Even though he did not consider it essential, pla:~ of the
      front steel columns had been carried out as a compromise to try and meet the
      Building Authorttyls concern. He agreed there might well be a continuing
      maintenance problem with tl~ stand, but this was a different matter to saying there
      was a structural problem, l~eference was made to the Guidels advice that when
      assessing whether existing situations provided adequately for the safety of spectators,
      the criterion to be used is that of a reasonable degree cf safety. In Dr. Eastwood’s
      view, it would be unreasonable and unnecessary to Insist on a full structural survey
      of the South Stand or to delay the issue of the Certificate. It was his professional
      opinion (which he was most jealous of and v~uld not put in jeopardy) that the S~nth
       Stand was structurally safe and that the basis of the calculations provided was
      appropriate. He was prepared to advise the Club to use the appeal procedure open
       to them should this be necessary.
                                                  log,



         IT WAS AGBEED that:

               as there was no obvLous deterLoratlon In the South Stand structure of such
               a nature as to be of Lmmedfate concern, no objection would be raLsed to the
               continuance of the derby game wLth Sheffield Unlted on Boxing Day morning
               provLded that no extreme weather conditions occurred Intbe intervening
               perLod, and

         (b)    a fur~er meeting should he held as a matter of urgency between the BuUding
                AuthorLty and Dr. W. Eastwood to discuss tl~ structural tntegrLty of the
               South Stand and the appropriateness of the calculations used (Mr. D. Vaughen
               to be present at Dr. Eastwood’s request).

:I       NOTE As the discussions on the South Stan~ Construction hinged on structural
               theories and practices, the Fire Serzice and Police representatives felt
               there was little they could contribute and left the meeting prior to its
     O         termination.

          Dear Sir,

          Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

          Further to my letter of 21st December, 1979, the County
          Council has now formally decided not to charge a fee for
          the General Safety Certificate in respect of the Hfllsborough
          Stadium.

                                                      Yours faithfully,

                         EHER,q~CY EVACUATION PROCEDU.~,

The followinq notes of guidance are prepared and issued to assist all
official stewards and others in a position of responsibility at the
Hillsborough Stadium on the action to be taken and procedures to be followed
in the event of the D~ssibility of evac~atlon of the stadium during the
playing of a game when sp~-ctators are present. The notes are not intended to
be a comprehensive list of all the action necessary, but are for personal
issue to each steward and for retention by the steward for immediate ref-
erence all the time he/she is on duty at the stadium.
It is appreciated that the ";easons evacuation may become necessary are many
and varied, but the most obvious are fires or information that explosive/
incendiary devices have been placed somewhere withln t~he stadlum/ground.
That infoznnation may be received or discovered either by members of the staff
at the stadium, or by telephone to the stadium: police; local or national
newspapers.
IT IS STRESSED THAT ~KENEVE~R SUCH INFOR~%TION IS RECEIVED THE RESP(kNSIBILITY
FOR TEE DECISION TO E~:ACUATE ALL OR PART OF THE GROUND RESTS WITH THE SENIOR
MANAGEmeNT OF ~ CLUB. (The senior police officer on duty will be in a
position to advise as to whether the ’bomb call’ is likely to be genuine or
not).

Whenever such information becomes known, a message will be relayed to the
police officer on duty in the ’:P. A. Commentary Box" at the ground, who, on
instructions from the sanior police officer, and irrespective of whether
th~ match is in proqress or not, will cause the record ’~F~~~TC~! to
be played over the loudspeaker system.                      P LLW: erTa
The playing of that record will indicate to everyone present at the qTound,
other than spectators, that a possible emergency situation exists.

N.B.   As part of the regular Dre-match brief of referees and linesmen and
       both teams, this information should be passed to them so that the
       game officials are also aware of the possibility of an interruption in
       play and the significance of the playing of the racord.

On hearinq that record all club stewards will make their way to their des-
ignated duty points on gangways/gates/exits, etc. Those on exit gates will
open the gates and remain at that point. Duzlng this period senior
officials will consider the nature of the emergency alleged and will decide
to evacuate all/pe~t of the stadium. Once that decision has been taken, but
not until, the senior police officer on duty will cause a spoken message to
be relayed over the ~’P. A. System" which will have the effect of:-

(I) Stopping    the g~me and removing players from the field of play;

(2)    Informing the spectators/officials of the precise nature of the
       emergency ~md its location if kn~¢n, and requesting all or specified
       sections of the public to leave their seats and make their way out of
       the ground by the nearest normal exit route unless specifically directed
        to do otherwise by means of the :~P. A. System".
       IT IS STRESSED THAT NO EVACUATION ~’TILL TAKE PI~:ACE EXCEPT ~; EXTRF~o~
       EMERGENCY ~-~ND ALT}iOUGH THE PREP.~RATORY WARNING ~CORD ’THREE BLI~ MICE’
      -~Y BE P LAY~D, THERE IS EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT INITIAL ENQUIRIES WILL
      ESTABLISH THE PERPET~h~TIO~! OF A HOAX, ~TC., AND iN THAT ~, ~;STEAD OF
      A SPOKEN MESSAGE TO EVACUAT~ ; THE FACT THAT THE F2~RGENCY H~S PASSED
      WILL BE INDICATED BY T~’- P£AYING OF THE RECORD - ’~~~A’ .~d 4 ~ u~
      ON ~ARING THIS ’ALL ~’ STE~;IARDS ON EXIT GATES AND GANGWAYS WILL
      REMAIN ON STAND-BY AT T~AT POINT .~OR FIVE MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING THE GATES ~-~
      AND RESUMING THEZR NORM21L DUTY POSITIONS.

      In the event of any steward/club offlclal discovering a fire or receiving
      information that an emergency situation ~xlsts within the ground, he will
      immediately -

          (i)    Notify the Club SecrGtary by telephone;
      (ii)       Inform any polic~ officer.

    (ill)        He must also, on discovering a fire, activate the fire alarm system
O                by means of a ’Break Glass’ call point°

     The activation of the call point will not imm~diately sound any form of
     audible alarm but will indicate by llght signal in the police staffed
     control point the Iccation of the emergency. The police controller can
     then deploy manpower to investigate the cause.

    In the event of discovery of fire by a steward, he should take additional
    action in accordance with the following points:-

     (A)        Sound the alarm by breaking the nearest break glass call point;
     (B)        Tackle the fire with the appropriate extinguisher if safe to do so~

    (C)         Clos~ doors within the immediate vicinity of the fire;
    (D)         At no time mention the words ’Fire’ or ’Bomb’. Remembera if you
                don’t panic, neither will th~ crowd;
    (E)         Upon completion of the evacuation of your section, report to the
                assembly area (which has been specified by the Club) and report to
                the person in overall charge, who will, in turn, report to the Fire
                Service and any other relev~mt emergency service wh!ch may be in
                attendance.
    ALL STEW~!~DS MUST FAMIL ~IARISE THEMSELVES WITH THE LOCATI~ OF:-

    (a)      Fire Alarm ’Break Glass’ call points;

    (b)      Location of the Fire Fightinq Equipment;
    (c)     Knowledge of all escape routes at their sector of the ground.

    62. The barrier numbers used in the following descriptions of
    the tests are as shown on these two drawings.

     (a)         A total of 19 barriers failed to carry the specified test
                 load of 6 kN/m length when first tested.¯ Seven of~ these
                 failures (Nos. 40, 41, 42, 57, 58, 62 and 68) were caused
                 by defective retaining clips on the horizontal rails.
                 Seven failed because the horizontal rail suffered permanent
                 deformation (Nos. 34, 87, 91, 92, 93, 97 and 98) and five
                 failed because of bending of vertical posts (Nos. 4, 18,

                                                  Reglzte, n~l in England - No. 1134531

          19, 37 and 38).
               During the course of the testing careful inspection
          was made of each barrier and it was found that, although
          the7 passed the test, a number of barriers had-minor
          defects mainly due to corrosion. A total of 32 new clips,
          eight new rails and five new posts were fitted in addition
          to strengthening of those barriers which failed the test.
          All protruding or sharp edges were removed.
               One further barrier was modified because it was initially
          significantly lower than the minimum height recommended in the
          green Code of Practice.
               Following construction of the new additional barriers on
          Spion Kop and the completion of repairs to the old barriers
          a second series of tests was made. All the new barriers
          and all the repaired barriers now passed the test.

    (b)   Leppings Lane
               In the first series of tests six barriers (Nos. 104,
          105, 106, 107, 110 and 123) had failures of the tube
          retaining clips.    Five barriers (Nos. 107, 114, 115, 121 and 130)
          suffered permanent deformation of the horizontal rail.
               All these barriers were repaired. In addition 13 new
          clips and five rails which were badly corroded were replaced,
          and any protruding or sharp edges removed.
               After construction of the new barriers, they and all
          the repaired barriers were tested and all withstood the
          test load satisfactorily. ........

    (c)   North West Corner
               The initial testing of the first few barriers in this
          corner showed that all of them were only capable of taking
          about half the test load. The rails deflected excessively
          and the holding down bolts were also inadequate.
                                                                             ¯
                                                                   SHEET

                 Major strengthening in the form of extra posts to
            shorten the span of the rails and to share the load with
            the existing posts were installed. A new type of holding
            down arrangement was devised¯
                 When re-tested all existing barriers plus all the
            new barriers successfully withstood the specified load.


   O ,~he Safety Cage
            When the first series of tests were made on the crush
      barriers it was found that the safety cage along both ends of
      the ground had defective supports. It was found that certain
      holding down bolts had not been fixed when the fence was
      installed¯ There was also a need for support from the
      concrete perimeter wall in some places¯ After appropriate
      remedial work the fence was successfully test loaded An 4m sections
      along both ends of the ground using the normal crush barrier
      loading of 6 kN/m length.

       Boundary Fences
              Concern had been felt for the boundary fence along the
        ~dge of the ramp from Spion Kop. Any failure of this fence
       ~s the crowd leaves the ground could result in people being
       spilled down a steep bank. The whole length of this fence
       from the score board down to the bottom was therefore tested
       using the lateral force specified in the green Code of 2.74 kN/m.
       The whole length carried the load satisfactorily¯
              The continuation of this fence round to the north-east
 ~-<corner of the pitch~,~ p1~~the’-t~6 llnes ~f fence which protect
~ : the island of spectators to the west of the tunnel were also
        appropriately tested (the lengths marked in red on the attached
        print of drawing 1610/11). All the sections successfully
        carried the test load without signs of distress.              ¯
               It was also found to be possible to test load five sections
        of the boundary fence round the top of Spion Kop as shown by the
        short red lines. The load applied was again that appropriate to
                                                                                ¯
                                                                        SHEET

     the lateral force on exit routes¯     Again the load was
     satisfactorily resisted¯

   South Stand Balustrade
         The final testing was on the south stand balustrade.
   At the foot of every gangway a length of 2m was subjected
   to the same test load as crush barriers i.e. 6 kN/m length.
 ~In every case this load was resisted without distress.
         In between the gangways, the balustrade was subjected
   to a test load of 3 kN/m length applied to the whole span
   between successive pairs of supports. Again the load was
   everywhere satisfactorily resisted.

     Future Numbering of Crush Barriers
           Many of the barriers have been lengthened and also
     additional barriers have been installed.   It is obviously
     inappropriate to continue with the old numbering system.
     We therefore include prints of two new drawings 1610/63 and 64 which
     show a new numbering system for Spion Kop and the whole of the
 ~   west end of the ground. It ks proposed that these numbers
~ ~will be used in all future reports.                              /

          After consultations with the Building Authg~ity and in view of the fact
          that all of the barriers were tested prior to certification, the County
          Council is able ~o agree this year with the course of action which you
          propose. However, I would stress that this agreement is conditional
          upon it being recognised and accepted that it is without prejudice as
          to what may be required in future years under the provisions of paragraph
          25(2) of the Safety Certificate.
          May I also mention the Certificates by:-
          (a)      a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer (as required by

                   parts of the S=adium, excluding crush barriers and handrails;

                       an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
                   26 of the Safety Certificate) as to the electrical installation
                   within the Stadium; and

                   ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED
                            BY THE CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY

            On various dates in fJuly ; made inspections and had
                                    /
      approximately one-fifth office crush barriers tested by members
     of my staff under my control.    A final inspection was made on
        August in company with Mr. D. Sheriff C.Eng., M.I.Struct.E.
     of the City of Sheffield Building Surveyor’s Department, acting
     on behalf of the licensing authority.
           In my opinion the various structures on the ground are in a
     satisfactory condition and appropriate for the stadium to be used
{ ~e to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of Ground Safety.
                   The crush barriers Nos. 1-39 (see our drawing No. 1610/63)
      were tested in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Guide
      to Safety at Football Grounds on 21-23 July.    Certain barriers
       suffered excessive deflection, generally on the second or third     )
       cycle of the test load. In some other cases retaining clips had
       to be replaced.    The barriers concerned were Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15,
                                                                                                                                /
        17, 18, 24, 26 and 34.    After remedial work these barriers were
        successfully re-tested on ii August.
              I am now able to certify that all 39 barriers have a satisfactory
        strength.
              Certain items of maintenance work which it is suggested should
        be carried out at an appropriate time have been reconlnended to the
         club.         A list is attached.

        The Chairman opened the meeting by stating its intention of assessing ~he
        planning, action and incidents relating to the FA CuD Semi-Final between
        Tottenham Hotspur and ~lverhamDton Wanderers held at Hillsborouqh on
        Saturday ll ~ril 1981.
        Certain problems had occurred but in his and ~he Chief Constable’s opinion
        we had acted correcr_ly. One letter of ccmDlainu had been received from a m~_mbe~
        of the public as well as one letter prais~g the police action in a dangerous
        situation. C.hief Superintendent Herold mentioned ~at other letters
        congratulating the police on ~eir actions had also been received.

        Mr Goslin said that it was his decision to remove smectators from the Lamminas
        Lane end of the ground to the other side in order to ease a "~cangerous situation
        where serious injuries or even fatalities were a real possibility. He then
        read the letter of complaint, which contained an allegation ~nat the police
Q       herded more and more people into ~he LeDDings L~ne enclosure when it wa~ obvious
        that it was f,all.                   .. z-
                                                    -.

      The Chairman invited views on this point. Superintendent Chapman said ~hat the
      entrances to Leppings Lathe were controlled to ensure an even distribution of
      fans. H~9owever, as .the ~q~E~dJ~!!ed up the usual .Dacklng problz~s occurred.
      There was s~ace in ~he centre of the enclosure but fans refused to "move over
      a nd fill it. Police officers were placed into the crowd to ensure that the
    ~ best use was made of the available space. The Mounted Depa~ment also assisted
      at theorear of the crowd to prevent mor~ people entering that par~ of ~he
      ground.
                                                                   o
      Chief Superintendent Herold Pointed ouu ~hat the probl~ was exacerbated by a
      s eries of incidents which culminated in ~he late arrival of a large number of

      it and caused problems on t-he motorway. The pontoon bridges and extensive
      road.~orks on the motorway in the Derbyshire Police Area also created delays.
     This 90 minute delay resulted in a sudde-~ flood of vehicles, all of them
     "S~urs supporters, into Sheffield. Acting Chief Superintendent Thompson took
      up this point and said that he accepted that the traffic route, designed to
      di~de, the football sup Do~ers from the city centre shoppers, was too tortuous,
      a!-~hough this may not have proved a problem had there been a steady flow of
     s=ectators rat-her than the sudden influx caused by the incidents described by
     M_~ Herold.

     The Chairman then sought t_he views of the meeting over the crushing incidents
     when several spectators were injured and which necessitated the removal of
     sc=e spectators from the Leppings Lane enclosure.

     Mr Herold said t.hat the capacity for the Leppings Lane enclosure, stated in
      fine ce~ificate issued under ti~e Safety-of Spots Grounds Act, is 10,lOO.
     T.~’S mus~, of necessity, contain a safety margin. The actual turnstile
      r-adinglwas 10,425 to which must be added the 70 Spurs supporters who had
J
     ~.aged to obtain tickets whici~ put them amongs~ t~he Wolves su~_~crters. These
     had be~_~ moved to Leppings Lan~ from the ~mp for their own safety. This made
     a total of 405 s~ectators over t.he authorised limit. Ins_~ector Calvert pointed
     out that t_kis created a similar situation to last year when about 400 forged
     t±~<e~s were prLnted for the Leppings Lane end, although the same problem was
     net experienced ~nen.

     Mr Herold had already referred to the late arrival of a large number of
     spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppings Lane enclosure when
     t~ne match started. The f!ashpoLnt occurred when Tottenham scored after only
     th___-=~ minutes. The spectators_ just entering pushed foz-~-ard to see what was
     ha;~eninq and caused a crush, which resulted in t_he injuries, Lnspector
     Gr-enwocd also mentioned that t-here had been t’~o or three fights, albeit of
     a r/nor nature, at the same time. This had resulted in the order from Mr Goslin
     tc open the gates at the fron~ of Leppings Lane in order to release some
     s~ectators onto the pitch surround. This was done by openLng the gates,
     releasing a few spectators and t.hen closing ti%em to allow a steady flow. T.his
     was difficult to maintain because as soon as pressure was relieved at the
     front the crush from the back filled the void.
     The lack of a reserve serial between’the Sou~h Stand and the LeppLngs Lane
     stand (where one has normally been situated) causea a few minutes delay in
     ~".e deplo~ent of officers to police this situation but this problem was soon
     overcome. Superintendent Chapman stressed that there was still room in the
     centre of the LeDpings Lane enc!osure a!ti-.ouqh it -~’as quite full. This was
     on!y to be ex~eczed when there was a capacity crowd, but the refusal of
     s~ectators to fill spaces had caused difficulties elsewhere in the enclosure.

     The discussion progressed to the construction of the Leppings Lane enclosure.
     Mr Goslin fe!t that it was inadequate and required more divisions so that ~A
    ~spectators are not in such a solid mass. He also felt that t~he limit of’vl
    lO,lOO was toc; high, although Superintendent Chapman disagreed wi~h this.
     The Chairman disagreedwith Mr Harold’s suggestion of a’6 ft to 8 ft wide
     channel do~ the centre of the enc!osure to divide spectators and segregate
     opposing fans on the grounds that such a small segregation gap only encouraged
     opposing spectators to throw articles at each other and a~ police officers
     in the middle. Inspector Calvert expressed concern about the central


                                                                       Continu£d/ ......

         entrance to the Leppings Lane area because it always causes delays and
         bloat.ages. It would benefit from reconstruction.

        .The Chairman said that talks would take place with S~effie!d Wednesday
         Football Club on the ground capacities end for any reconstruct_ion thought to
         he necessary.

         The discussion progressed to the fans who ran onto t-he pitch during the half
         time interval.
        Mr.Herold said that t~he trouble stemm.ed from the front central gate being
        opened from where about 150 young f~--ns were led onto the pitch surround.
        These were t, he ones who ev~ntually r~n onto the pitch although at t-he time
        it was necessary for tiue gate to be ope.-.ed to relieve crowd pressure. The
        match re=e~e-.,
                 - - - Clive Thomas, had said htka ~ ~he was unable to start the match
        whzn he wanted to. This was, however, based on a five minute half-time
        inte-~val ~nd not on the normal ten mi.nute one. It was unfair to suggest
        that the ~atch was held up as a result of the fens on t-he pitch.
O       ~ Goslin said %i-~t he may have made a "~Tcng decision at half-t~e to try
        and get the fans from the pitch surro~d onto the Kop. They had not been
         causing e-.y r_rouble %.:here they were, ye-. the decision to move them onto the
        ~p precipit-.ued a minor pitch Lnvasion. The half-time inte,~al was, on
        reflecZ/on, insufficient to carry out ti:e necessary, manoeuvre. Some of the
        people who were beLnq shepherded Lnto ~’.a ~p refused to go in, resultinq in
        a minor ’break-ou~’ whici% was .quid<ly czn~rol!ed. M_~ Eerold said that it was
        apparent, for future reference, t~hat wh~. people have to be moved from the
        Kop the area behind the hoardings is an ideal position to put t~hem into. Chief
        Inspector Smith also pointed out t-hat 5C-!OO fans had been successfully removed
        from the pitch ~-nd placed into t, he centre of t-he Kop. M~r Herold said t_hat
        this situation prompted the only critici-~ of t~he police by the club J_n t~:at
        we seemed to be helping faDos to climb ever the railings. Inspector Sykes
        replied to this criticism by saying t/nat cnly.t_he fans who had become stuck
        whilst attempting to cl~_m_b over t.he rai!in~s to avoid the crush had been
        helped by police officers so they did nc~- inj~e themselves. The o~er fans
        were released, in small groups through a ..~olice controlled gate.
O       One p.-oblem which was totally u.nnecessa_~.~- was that caused by the sale of
        unwanted tickets by Wo!verhamDton Wa~-der-rs direc: to Tottenham Hotspur, This
        is contrary to FA directions and neither the FA, Sheffield We~.nesday FC nor
        the police were told of this decision. This made a nonsense of the
        segregation arr~.~emen~ end was a contr~uting factor to t~he diffi~alties
        which occurred. ~isoussions were to take place about this situation.

        The Chairman then asked for any cot.tents cr criticisms which could prove
        useful for future occasions. The following points were raised:

        Acting Chief Superintendent Thompson
                                               g
        The rou~e for traffic from the motor~ay was too tortuous and t~he more direct
        rou~e, ~he Parkway, should be considered in the future. Chief Superintendent
        Herold ~oin=ed out tha~ this would bring the fens through the city centre
        and intm.direct conflict with the bus rou=es for walking spectators.




                                                                          Ccntinuec/ ......

           Mr Thompson also relayed criticisms that officers outside the ground had
           made no attempt to direct traffic at blocked up junctions. This cricitism
          -was not accepted because with the size of the crowd some delay must be
?          accepted a/%d anticipated.

           Sup e-~intendent C.hapman
           The absence of a reserve serial between t_he Sout-h Stand and West Stand caused
           a slight delay in t-he deployment of officers to the disorder situation and
           t-here should be a reserve stat’ioned there in future.
          ~T
            here should be f~ma!e officers available at the turnstiles to assist in any

      I    necessa-~-y searches. There was a marked absence of f~male officers-at the
           gates.

          The back to back radios are not useful in t_he situation when t~here is
          extensive media coverage at fine ground. There is a high degree of inter-
          ference.
O         Ac~-ing Superintendent Ruddy,
          The communications had proved successful with three channels beLng used
          (1, 2 am.d 4). The splitting of the ground control and the public order control
          meant that the caravan for public order control need no longer be situated
          Lnside the ground and could be moved about outside for optimum reception.

          Mr Ruddy also pointed out that t~he supervisory officers from foreign
          forces had made m~ny complimentary remarks about the planning, organisat!on
          and operational aspects of this event. He felt that we were being over
          critical of ourselves.

          Inspector Calvert

          Mr Calvert suggested the inclusion of a de-brief chart so that the comments
          of any officers at the grmund could be included for discussion.
O
          Inspector Sykes
          On ~his occasion officers from foreign forces had been employed on duties
          Lnside the ground. Mr .Sykes felt ~hat this should be the duty of the re cular
          officers (’F’ DivSsion)° w~ are familiar with ~ne territory.

      Mr Herold pointed ouu that the reverse situation had applied last year .~nd
      ~here were s~ill difficulties. ~ fac=, the local knowledge of the visiting
      officers who were inside had helped to overcome situations which our own
      policemen may not have been able to deal with easily. There are also
      logistical difficulties wi~h the deployment of foreign officers outside the
      ground.

      Serce=_nt Purdv

      Difficul~ies were experienced because officers from foreign forces had not
      r~ad or understood the correspondence sent to t2,em. Despite having maps and
      being taken on a tour of the ground, some had gone to a different part of


                                                                           Continued/ ......

         the ground to where they had been deployed. This could have had serious
         consequences ~ ~ ~ l assistance was urgently needed.


        ¯The local call signs (eg Sierra 5 - Sergeant] should be stressed to visiting
         officers as the lack of t-his knowledge could lead to confusion.

        There had been too many people inside the control room -. a me.xim,’_m of nine
        persons during the critical stages in a room designed for ti~.ree, and this
        had shown that the ventilation was inadequate. On this ~oin~ Su~erintende.nt
        Chapman said that the number of senior officers in the cont--~o! room at t~his
        time had caused o3nfusion because on occasions conr~_icting instruct_ions had
        been given and the contro! room staff did not know wh_ch p2_rticular
        ~--nstruction to accept and relay.

        The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) agreed to consider al! ~.he points
        raised for future occasions and thanked el! _present for t/heir attendance.

             Dear Sir,                   :
                                                    .........
             SEMI-FINAL - 11THAPRIL 1981
             On the occasion of the above match, there was an incident
             at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, in the standing
             enclosure, which resulted in injuries to spectators
             because of crushing.

             From our enquiries it appears the crushing was caused
             through Tottenham supporters arriving late, due to
             problems on the Motorway, and rushing to their places
             after the game had commenced, thereby causing problems
             to spectators at the front of the terracing who had
             been in the ground a considerable length of time.

             According to our turnstile readings there were 335 in
             excess of the stipulated capacity for that particular
             area; this was the result of Tottenham fans having
             purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival
             at Turnstile tNt, Penistone Road, which was the
             Wolverhampton standing area, were directed by the
             police to the other end of the ground where the
             Tottenhamfans were standing.
              I give below details of injuries reported to me:-
                  30 spectators treated by St. Johnls Ambulance
                               Brigade for minor ailments, etc.

South Yorkshire County Council        15th April 1981




Treated at the Northern General Hospital - 5 Spectators.
As the hospital refuse to co-operate with names, addresses, etc.,
I can only tell you that according to the police, injuries
received were:-
                     2 - Broken arms
                     1 - Broken leg
                     1 - Head graze
                     i - Not known

The overall report of crowd behaviour, both inside and
outside the stadium, was very good indeed.

               Copy to Chief Executive
              Dear Sir

              FA CUP S~4I-FINAL - Ii APRIL 1981
/r   ". \    I would refer to the FA Cup Semi-Final match between Wolverhampton
\            Wanderers Football Club and TottenhamHotspur Football Club, held at
             Killsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
             Saturday ii April 1981.       °. ., .
              ¯o.

             AS you will no doubt be aware many similar Semi-Final matches have been
             held at this ground without previous problems. The stadium is issued with
             a certificate under the provisions of the Safety in Sports Grounds Act 1975.
             This limits the total capacity of the ground to 50,174. The area of the
             Leppings Lane enclosure has a capacity of i0,iOO.

             Prior to the match itself, difficulties were envisaged because both sets
             of supporters were obliged to use the M1 Motorway. This problem was added
             t~ when a major road accident occurred on the M1 near to its junction with
             the A38. The problem was exacerbated by a coach breaking down further along
             the motorway, and by extensive road works. This set of circumstances
             caused a large number of spectators, predominantly Tottenham Hotspur fans,
             to be held up on the motmrway for some 90 minutes. As you will appreciate
             traffic jams built up and resulted in a sudden influx of large numbers of
             football supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the
             start of the match when a fairly steady build up of support throughout the
             afternoon could have been anticipated.

             I now wish to outline an aspect of the problem which could have been avoided
             and which should be anticipated for future similar occasions.
             On t.he day before the Wolverbmmpton ticket allocation was put on sale to
             the public, Tottenham Hotspur played Coventry City Football Club au Coven~-ry
             in a league match. Many Tottenham Hotspur supporters stayed overnight in
             Coventry and travelled the short distance to Wolverhampton to obtain tickets
             which were at a premium in London. Others also made the journey from London
             to Wolverhampton on the Sunday. This completely defeated the spectator
             policy which is put intm effect at these matches and which places the largest
             groups of standing Supporters at opposite ends of the ground. Neither of
          the two participating S -Final clubs saw fit to inform the South
          Yorkshire Police, Sheffl.eld Wednesday Football Club or the Football
          Associa_t!on. about this situation and in that event the mixing of supporters
          was not properiy’cater-e~ for. The result of this was that some 400
          Tottenham fans had to be removed from the Spion Kop, in the interests
          of general safety and public order, and were acco~nodated in the Leppings
          Lane end of the ground,, which had been designated for use by Spurs
          supporters.          ......
~. :¢,II l~The capacity at the Lepp’~gs Lane end is i0,i00 and this obviously contains~
     L~u’ ///a safety factmr. At a previous match some 400 bo!ders of for~ed tickets
         ~Igained entry into this part of the ground and were absorbed without any
           apparent difficulty. Hgwever, on this date turnstile readings showed
           that i0,435 people were admitted to this part of the ground.       --

          A policy of packing spectators occurs at most football grounds where
          large crowds are in attendance so that all the available space is utilised.
          On this occasion the To.tten~mm Hotspur fans, who had arrived early in the
          day and taken up advantageous viewing points, refused to move into the
          centre of ~hi~ e~c!e_~e:" ~h~hy crea~Inq a j~-~ng effecu a~ r/%e----
         ~~ The late arrivals caused an immediate problem upon
         -gaining access to the Leppings Lane area because of rushing forward
          immediately upon entering after Tottenham Hotspur had scored a goal soon
          after kick off. This resulted in a number of crushing injuries on this
          terrace including broken arms, legs and c~ashed ribs. Ira. all, some 38
          fans received treatment either at hospital or from the St John Ambulance
          representatives present at the game.
          As a rema!t of tb.is the safety gates at the front of ~%e Lepp"n~z L~--ne
          enclosure were opened and spectators at the front were allowed to go
          onto the playing area perimeter track to relieve the pressure within the
          terrace. Due to the probl~ns being created by crushing, my officers also
          refused access to the Lep_Dings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to
          get in. In my view no other course of action could have been adopted in
          the interest of public safety.
          During the half time interval my officers attempted to move the spectators
          who were standing or seated within the tracks around onto the normal
          spectator areas. During this manoeuvre some rather foolish youngsters
          did run onto the pitch but the situation was quickly brought under control
          by officers within the ground.

          In conclusion I would add that there were no other incidents either
          inside or outside the ground other than those caused by the circumstances
          I have described. The circumstances I have outlined have been discussed
          at length and will be borne in mind in the pl~.-~n-:ng of future similar
          events. Discussions are to take place with my officers and officials
          of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding suggestions for obviating
          the problems caused within the Leppings Lane terrace on this occasion.

          Yours faithfully

         Note of a Visit to the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield,
                           on 8th June, 1981

PRESENT:      Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

              E. England (Secretary)

              Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

              C. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
              F. Davis (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
              R. Grimshaw (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
              R, Herold (South Yorkshire Police)
              A. Roberts (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)

              D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
              D.I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

lo         Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on lOth February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive’s letter to the Club dated lOth January, 1981. The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on llth April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

           Inspection of Stadium
     .


The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

 (a)       South Stand

The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel
trusses referred to at the meeting on lOth February was queried but, in
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be g~ven.

 It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
 metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
 public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
 be provided.

 (b)        West Stand

 The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
 distress on the concrete pillars" supporting the steps at the rear of the
 stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
 had been made good.

 As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
 the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
 (nearest to the South Stand).
                                                                          A
 Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were    ~iI
 considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand,
 An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
 when these had substance.
                                                                             I/
                                       -I-


                                                               H
(c)    .Xo r th-~es t Terrace

The two small areas ~-here water seepage had coutinued to take place after
treatment had now been satisfactorily treated.

It was also noted that the tie bars through the upper level concrete
area to the rear had been protectively wrapped.

(d)    North Stand

The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
Kop) had been made good.

(e)    Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
original exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would
be attended to shortly.

The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of the
new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop origin~l exit steps (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.

(f)    General

It was noted:-

(i)     that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the
rear of the Butcher’s Shop on Penistone Road required attention because of
corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall between the Spion
Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

    ~I~i: "You- are both aware of my feelings that Club Stewards at Hillsborough often~

        ~o lass than theyrespect~ve
                 and our   should androlef.
                                       are at times no~ aware of our func~on and  ’~ //
       ~ c~ossed swords wlth them personally once or ~A£ce last season and in an
       effor~ to set th~ngs right for the comLng season I have arranged, t%-~ough
    ... the C!ub Chairman and the Secretary - Mr. England - for the stewards ~o
       attend in the gymnasium at 1 pm on Saturday, 22 August 1981, prior to
     ¯ starting their duty, and Z should like you to address them.
       They sh6uld be told very bluntly t.hat each of them should he aware of the
       location of their respective fire points, emergency exits, the rec=-=t!y
       introduced evacuation procedures, how to react-to the broadcas~g cf the
       nursery rhyme records, etc.etc. They should also have draw~ to their
       attention the Ground Rules of the Club, and in part_~cular the recently
       intIoduced (and even more recently revised) Rule 15 w’nich, in effect,//
       appoin~.s police officers as agent~ of the Club and allows us to deny
       admission to the ground on the Club’s behalf.                                   I
             khotild stress to ..:the stewards .~.at the ad~ission of slpectators and the
                                        at t.~e b~.~’~g.am.es .on.to the terracL~g iS .
                    theirs’function and not a police one.

       Such unruly behav~our as the throwing of cushions, etc., also falls within
       t.~eir res~onsib~l!~/,.....         .                    " ’
       When I received critical letters from the Club Chair~an~as~ yea-- after
.
        several of the matches, I replie~ ~o the effect that mu~h o’f the c~--iticsm
        he levelled at the pol,_’ce "should ~ore properly have been levelle~ at his
    ". own administration and the s~ewardso                                  "

       We should cooperate, fully wit.~ ~.hem and they with us, and not pull in      :-....
       opposite directions.

       I remember cn.e p~,_’cular ~ncident (~ bel~eve during the Derby County
       game last year] when the steward on the Sout!l S~and Terracing c~ose to our
       new Control Box quite deliberately ignored fans c!~mbing the railings
       between the Leppings Lane Terracing and the South Stand Te_-racing when I
       and a number of other officers had witnessed ~t and drawn it to his attention.
       The steward subsequently maintained that the fans in ~es~ion had occupied
       those sea~s for the whole of the t~-me, obviously with a view ~o ’~ing tire
       easy way out’.

       That is not their function, and indeed it would be my intend!on ~ certain
       circumstances to call upon stewards to give s~atemen~s of evidence that
       might support a prosecution. In the past we have never done that but they
       would 5e good and relatlvely independent w~tnesses.
                                                                               .,

       I~e yoU~ll~ both understand wha~ I have in mind and get          the message
      ~ver_uo v~e s~/~=ards, r have already personally told the Club Chairman and

      !~he Secreta~y~my v~ews and they bo~h support them.

         County Hall,
         BARNeLEY, 5. Yorks.
,qtlJ s’to
         For the attention of Mr. ,D" Vaughan.


         Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                               Sheffield Wednesda7 Football.Club Ltd.
                                 Rsdial Fences at. Lep~ings Lane Znd

                 We have been instructed by the Club to organtse the

            ~tallation of two r.adial fences on the terrace at the~
         Leppings lane end of the ~round.

          , It is intended that these fences are so positioned
          that they divide this section of the terrace into
       ///1/aPpr°ximately three equal areas, each served by its own
       /// .ntrance~-~----- -- -- " .....                      ~ ~ ~ ....
                 By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
          should result. A visiting teas with only a few followers
          will be allocated one section, with the other two sections
          retained by the home supporters,
                     Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
          accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers
         ¯dictate.                                           -"           ¯ .............     "

                     A 1.15 metre wide gate 18 proposed at the rear of
          each fence to give access for maintenance and~
          during a game. The-gate couid be left opens but fastened
          back, to connect the areas during a g~ if adjacent ones
°o

      -°                                                                          2




     are accupied by supporter| of the same team. men establishing
     the height we have considered that the vtelm to the corner
     flags should not be restricted any furtber than they are at
     present by the perimeter fence. We therefore ~ropose that the
     top of the fence should be ap;woxinately 1680=m above the
     terrace.
            This nay not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
     but should eli~tnate a ~s invnalon fron one area to
     Fences this height appe~ to work successfully at St.
     Park, the homo of Newcutle United.
            We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
     within the Working P~ty and your com-ents forwarded to us.

             Also to be included in the same contract are some gates at
     various locations around the north stand. Nov the ~ymnasium is
     open to the general public security to ~her parts of the ground
     must be n~Lntained. It is proposed that gates are provided at
     the top of the ralrixJ at both ends of the stand with additional
     gates at ground floor level st the Penistone Road end of the
     stand. A separate gate will be placed behind the vest Tamp tO
     prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium tovardm
     Leppings Lane.
          8ix copies of our drawing 3563/1 to~ether with two copies
     of our dravingt 3563/2 and 3 (for reference only) are enclosed.

       As previously intimated to you we carried out tests
   o~ approximately one fifth of the crush barriers in July and
   also made a prellndnary inspection in company with Mr. Sheriff.
~One or two of the crush barriers showed signs of distress

 Ithe Kop at the North East corner it was discovered that certain
   of the stays were rusted through. Remedial work has now been
   carried out and the defeotive crush barriers have been successfully
   subjected to the test load. We shall be inviting Mr. Sheriff
   to inspect the remedial work in the next few days following
   which I will issue a certificate on the lines of that which X
   sent to you last year.

i.     Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 2nd September
and plans submitted by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners on behalf of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. relating to the proposed erection |
of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and
Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand now that the !
gymnasium was open to the general public..

2.     Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
from the proposals. For insta~c~ there could well be problems with
opposing fans mixingat the rear of the West Stand and/or ~ i" "i
gates,-~u~ the poli-ce considered that ~ey could cope with any problems
of this nature.

The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of

~
the radial barriers was also discussed~ as well as the use of the
 xistin~ ~ates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
 errace.

   was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head-
room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the
radial barriers and gates be installed.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the proposals to instal
two 168Omm high radial barriers, with 1.15 metre wide gates at the rear,
on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to:-

       (i)         the further calculations required by the Building
                   Authority being satisfactory;

       (ii)        confirmation that adequate headroom will be
                   available at the rear of the Terrace, and

       (iii) ~ the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being ~
              under police control.
                                                                        ’I
3.     Security Gates around North Stand

Now that the gymnasium was open to the general public, the Club wished to
erect security gates at the top o~ ~the ramps at both ends of the North
Stand, with additional gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road
end of the Stand. A separate gate would also be placed behind the Wes~
Ramp to prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
Leppin~ Lane.

These gates would.be fastened when the gymnasium only was in use so as to
provide security for the rest of the ground. However, on watch days they
would be secured in the fully open position to allow unrestricted access.~

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partner~
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the erection of security
gates around the North Stand, subject t~ the gates and/or their supports,
hinges, etc not implnging on the existing critical ramp widths, and to the
gates being secured in the fully open position on match days.

4.    Police and First Aid Facilities

It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first aid
facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim basis.
The Club had undertaken to provide purpose built facilities in a similar
position to the existing timbered facilities during the 1980 close
season. Whilst some progress had been made in discussing details of the
facilities, no firm indication had yet been given as to when they would
actually be provided.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr.oD. Vaughan should press the Club and/or its
~
Consultants for a firm indication as to when the new police and first
aid facilities are to he provided.

5.    Lottery Ticket Boxes

Attention was drawn to the blocked egress which could result if the
timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps were to
be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should draw the Club’s attention to the
desirability of re-siting the lottery ticket boxes.

                  Dear Sir,
                  Safe, t7 of Spots Grounds Act~ 1975
                  Sheffield Wedaesda7 Y0otball Club
                  Referring to your letter of 9th September, the Officer Working Party
                  (Sheffield District) has considered the proposals referred to in your
     ¯
         -k
                  letter of 2nd September and accompanylns plan~.

                  1. Ead£al Barriers on West Terrace

                  Whilst welcoming the increased control on =he Terrace which should
                  result, concern was expressed as to the problems which could occur v~h
                  opposing fans mixing at the reaz of the West Stand and/or at the entry/
                  exi~ sates. However, it was felt that only experience vould show
                  whether this vould prove to be a reality and, if realised, whether the
                  problem was of such a snell =cal, that ~t could be easily coped v~th by
                  the police.

                  Accordingly, the Officer ~orkin~ Parry at this sta~e sees no objec~io~
                  to the proposals to instal two 1680~high radial barriers, vith 1.15
                  metre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject to:-

                  (a)    the further calculations required by the Building Authority being
                         satisfactory ~.r. Sheriff to contact you direct);

                  (h)    eonf~rmation that adequate headroc~-will be avzilable st the rear
                         of the ~errace after i~stallation of ~he barriers and ~a~es, an~

              t   (c)    t henew gates at the rear of the ~errace also bei.-~ under police

                         Securlt7 Gates around North Stand
                   .


                  The Officer Working Part7 fully recognises the Club’s need to provide
                  security for the remainder of the stadium when only the gymnasium is ~n
                  use,

                  Provided that the sates and/or their supports, h~n~e8, etc. do not
                  impinge on the exlstins critical ramp widths and the gates are secure~ .--
                  in the fully open position on match days, the Officer Working Party
                  sees no objection to the erection of security gates around the North S~and.

           It yes recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first
           aid facilitiu under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim -
           basis on the understaddinE that the Club would provide pErpose built
           replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

           It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are
           still continuing, but it is felt that the Club should be asked to g~ve
           a firm indication when the new police and first aid facilities are to/
           be provlded.

          ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REC~UIRED
                    BY THE CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY

      On 23 September 1981, I made an inspection of the ground,
 after having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
 and sections of the perimeter fence on Spion Kop tested by members
 of my staff under my control.
      In my opinion the various structures on the ground
 are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate for the stadium
 to be used to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of
 Ground Safety.
       In July, crush barriers numbers 40,41,42,47,48,49, 50,
   55, 56, 57, 58, 59,60,61,68,69,70,71,85,90,114,115,116 and 118 (see
   our drawing 1610/63) were tested in accordance with the procedure
   laid down in the Guide to Safety at Football Grounds. Certain
   barriers deflected excessively and would not sustain the test load.
   In one instance a clip retaining the horizontal tube had to be replaced.
        Remedial work was carried out on barriers 41 (one post)
   and II 5 (one post and one clip). At the same time two corroded fence
   posts and four corroded fence post stays were replaced.
         After remedial work the sections of barriers which failed
    were successfully retested on 9 September. I am now able to certify
    that all 24 barriers have a satisfactory strength.
         The step at the top of the original stair flight at the
     back of Spion Kop has been filled in to give a safe landing.

EASTWOOD r:l" PARTNERS




             A permanent barrier has been installed adjacent
        to the servery at the bottom of the new stair flight
        leading from Spion Kop and a new concrete landing added
        in the same area.
             Certain items of maintenance work which it is
        suggested should be carried out at an appropriate time
        have been recommended to the club, A list is attached.

                       and Security Gates

        The work on the radial fences and security gates
  indicated on our drawings 3563/1-3 WhLch we sent to you on
 2 September 1981, "Is now substantially complete.
         Three f~rst team home games have been played s~nce the
 fences were erected. We have not heard any formal comments
  from the Working Party about the operation of the fences and
  their access gates but we understand that representatives of the
  South Yorkshire Police have Inspected the work and they are
 sattsf~ed w~th the new arrangements.
          To increase security ~t ~s proposed that pa~rs of gates
 are ~nstalled at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of
 the West Stand. Two cop~es of our drawing 3563/4 are enclosed ~
 showing details of the gates.                            ~:’~" °

     Dear Sir
    SAFETY OF S’PORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975
    S~FFIELD WED~.~ESDAY FCXDT3ALL CLUB LTD

    I rofer to your letter of 23 December 1981 and to the letter from Messrs.
    Eastwood & Pa_~-~ers - the Club’s consultin.= eng!meers - relating to their
    pro_~osals to erac-, a pair of se.--arity gates a~. ti~e base of the two stair=ases
    at ti~e rear of ~.he West Stand a~. t.he ground. Fz~om a pc!!cL~g poLnt of ~lew I
    see no proble=s whatever ccnce-~n, ing the erection of these gates, subject of
    course to them beLng sea, red L~ a fully o~Den position during ~ time the
    public Darts of the .~T.o%und are occupied when matches are beLng played.

    Dealing now with the radial fences which have recently been insta!led on the
    Leppings Lam.e terracing, I can confirm t.hat the f~ces ere working paz~icularly
    we!! am.d prov/r.g to be most satisfac~.o.~y, in effec-.Lng t-he segregation of
    opposing gr-ou.~s of fauns. Since t.he fences were put up there has been no
    fixture at t-he gT-ound of sufficient !.~terest to result Ln t_hat entire section
    of ter_-a=ing beLng given to one group of fans and so I a~ u.nab!e to c~nt in
    t.ha= respect, bur I see no problems whatever.

     However, there are one or t~o points concerning ~.he actual construction of the
     fencin~ which give cause for concern from a police point of view. In so~e
     places the existing barrier rails .~ave been extended up to and com!~.letely
     ~!~rough ~he new radial fences a~ a height of 4’6" or so from the ground,
    mak!.ng it ve_--f easy for fans to c!imb from one pen to anot.her. In other
     places the existing barrier rails have been cut off shor~ of the radial
     fences, leave.rig what the police consider ~o be dangerous pieces prot~ad!~ng
     into some of t_he g~nTsays. This matter has been drawn to the attention of the
     Cl-ub Secretary, who has been advised of my intention to brLng it to your
     notice. I would point out that M--~. F_ngland totally agrees with police
     observations regarding t.he const-~acticn of t_he radial fences but I understand
     from him that it is being suggested ~.hat any alterations could conceivably
     result in a reduction in the capacity of the Leppings Lane terracing. I am
     not aware of ~.he thinking behind than but for my par~ see no reason why t.hat
     should be.

As the Annual winter inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium is due

For the ,attenti,,on,, of Mr. D. Vauqhan
Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                   Safety of. Sports Ground Ac~
          Thank you for your letter of 20 Janua~z.
          Z believe the small number of points needing
clarification have already been discussed between
John SZrange and Mr. Sheriff. One Of these refer to the
need for a goal post type frame over the gates but this is
in fact already provided by the sheeting fr~. There is
also a small amount of rust staining aEising-frommisplacement
of reinforcement in the lO0~mthick retaining wall. There
18 no immediate danger arising from this and an appropriate
maintenance repairwillbecarrled out.
          Turning now to the radial barriers on the West
terrace it is of course accepted that where there is a
crush barrier passln.g ~ugh or close to the radial barrier
-it will make it easi&~.:.for ~anyone~ho_s~ishes-.~o ~limb :.
o~r, Nevertheless we~elievo it is not ~easonable to
leave the crush ba~iers as they are, If all barriers
were re~ed back to a disf.a~ce .say 1,2m lro~the fence It
~ould mean a 2,4m wide gap~ich is ~ot protec~by~riere,
                                                                                                                   o°
                                                                             .. o           ,. ip
                                                                                                          ¯ ....




                                                                                                         d
              There would be a consequent loss of calculated spectator I//
              capacity which is undesirable from the Clubes p41nt of
              view. However from the polnt of view of safety a strip
              of that width without a single crush barrier would be a
              major hazard.
                      It should be kept in hind that the introduction
              of these radial barriers has affected a very great
    0         improvement from the point of view of segr~ation of
              spectators but to achieve perfection from the point of
              view of segregation brings with it other dlsadvantages.
              I believe that what we have done is a reasonable omprom!se
               between the various interests.
                           In the second paragraph on this subject you
              refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding from the
             crush barriers. I have not had an opportunity to check
              this since receiving your letter but I am informed that
              the word ’dangerous’ is a little exaggerated and they
              do not of course protrude into a gangway as there is no
                                                                                                        I

              stand the Point at issue is whether the encroachment into
              the gate width is at all critical. The remaining clear
              width is 3.30,mR which is equivalent to a slx unit exit.
              Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in

                ¯here ~ore very good s~ruc~u~a~ reasons for placing

 I.        Purpose of Meeting

 The purpose of the meeting was to discuss~&he apparent difference of opinion
 on’-~r=~i~aspects of the radial barriers ins=ailed on the West Terrace
 and--~-he-security gates-at~ the top o~ the North stand ramps, as well as to
 carry." out the usual winter inspection of the Stadium.

 2.        Ground inspection

                                                           relatively     in the
                                                                             for pen

 nearest to the South Stand, a small length of-existing crush barrier had been

 IT WAS AGREED -

,I(i) That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
  prevent crowd surge by "=he-existing barriers being extended up to and/or
  through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
  able to cli=b from one pen to another, subject =o review at the end of the
 current season.

 (ii) That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
 be cut off.

                One of the.securit7 gates ..~ich the Club wished to instal at the bottom of                                                               :
                the two staircases had now been erected .........
                IT WAS AGREED that this could be regarded as satisfactory.
                C.         North Stand
                The Fire Service felt thaT the ~anner in which the security gates had been
                installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available.

                The Club’s Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
                of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
                applied in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the top
                of the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or nor.

                IT WAS AGREED that, as the point might well have been covered in the
                initial consideration of the Club’s application for a General Safety
                                                                                                                                                     3
                Certificate, the point would not be pursued at the moment.

                           NOTE - A search of the file subsequently revealed that, as
                                  suspected, the point had been considered at a
                                  meeting of the Officer Working Parry on 12.2.79,
                                  the relevant part of the Note of the meeting reading:-

                                           "the construction and width of the ramps being
                                            such that they could quite properly be
                                            regarded as elevated roadways".

               Do          Spion Kop

                It was noted that the infil!ing of =he step adjacent to ~he ha=drail on
                the left of the original exit a= the top of the Kop had =aken place; the=
                the boundary fence a= the top of =he Kop had been reinforced, and that the
                existing barriers had been perm_anentiy e~:tended and the area a= the foot
                of the new Kop exit (adjacent :o the brick’built refreshment poin=)                                                                    J
                levelled off as agreed.

                E.          South S=and

                The agreement to visually inspec= the roof trusses for apparen= defiec=ion
                after excepzional gale or snow loading conditions was recalled.

                F.          Items of General Maintenance

                IT WAS AGREED that the following items of general maintenance required
                attention:-

                (i) The rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
                the exit at the southerly end of the West Stand (to be done that day), as
                well as the rounding off of the brackets to the North Stand securi=y gates.

                (ii) The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
                fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
                Gate "0".


                                                                                 -2-

            refreshment point and the Owls Club to be fixed more securely.
                                           .°.

            (v) The brick wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop (nearest
            to the South Stand) to be 5:pointed.
                                        ¯


            (vi) The concrete supporting strut to the wall between the Spion Kop and
            the South Stand (nearest ~o the Spion Kop) to be protected (cracks and
            exposed bar).

            G.      Temporary Structures

            Concern was e.x-pressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability
            of temporary structures, such as scaffolding used in connection with
            television transmissions.

            Paragraph 20 of the Club’s General Safety Certificate required T.V. cameras
            and portable equipment to be placed only in such positions as may be agreed
    0       between the Police and the Club. The Club also were generally required to
            ensure that the Stadiun complied with good engineering and building practices
            and with the relevant British Standard Specification or Code of Practice.

            IT WAS AGREED that the question of temporary structures should be kept
            under review, and that the Club’s Consultants should give advice to the
            Club.
            3.      Future Developments                      ..r



            A.      Police and First Aid Facilities

            It was likely that, follo~ng continuing consu!ta=ions ~th the Police, the
            Club would shortly be in a position to formally notify the County Council
            that the new Police and First Aid Facilities would be provided in the
            forthcoming close season.
    _ /
     .o

            B.      Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate in Penistone Road
        °

            The Club hoped to formally notify the County Council shortly of their
            intention to proceed in the forthcoming close season with the demolition of
            some of the existing toilets on the Penistone Road side of the Stadium in
            order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate on that side of the
            Stadium.

            C.      Widening of Walkway and Erection of New Fence

            Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the
            rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Owls Club) had had to be removed.
            When settlement was complete, it was intended to widen the existing
            walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.

     For, the attention of Mr~ E. England

     Dear Eric,
                         Annual Certl,flcate of Ground safety
               we have completed the testing of the remainder of the
     ~barriers at the Splon Kop end of the ground excepting
      t hose bar%i&es which beaause of their position cannot be

     isubjected to the test load. I am pleased to say that all
      the barriers withstood the load but unfortuaately in a number
      of cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed
      conslderably. It is inevitable thatwwater gets under

 @
./
     ithese clips and they rust thus becoming weaker with the
      passage of time. In one or two csses the clip actually
      snapped as the final load was taken off. A total of 25 new
      clips are needed on Splon Kop including a few on the barriers
      at the top which have not actually been tested. John also
      inspected the Leppings Lane end and I0 clips are sufficiently
      cozToded to make it wise to change them rather than wait until
      they are tested during the next~ea~s~~e are using
                                        " :~-. ....

                                                 clips so that. ......

               The metal in the tube beneath the clips is also subJ~ect
      to corrosion and II lengths each about "8ft. long on Spion Kop
      are clearlynearing the end of their llfe._ We have t0 bear .
      in mind that the corrosion which can be seen on the outside may

                                                                                       /

    be matched by corrosion Inside the tube which cannot
    of course be painted. ~tlst all 11 lengths successfully
    carried the test load you may think it prudent that they
    should be replaced now because _they could become dangerous
    within five years,
         If all this work is castled out (new clips on both
    Spion Kop and Lepplngs Lane plus 11 new lengths of harrier
    top tall on Splon Kop) the likely cost Is between I1250
    and £15OO exclusive of professional fees. Z should be
    pleased to have your view as ~whether we should carry out
    the whole of this work or merely replace the clips on
    Splon Kop which deformed under test in which case the cost
    of the work would be approximately halved,
         John has already walked round the ground and he tells
    me that some splitting and spalling of the concrete columns
    is developing at ground floor level at the back of the
    South stand, I-shall be making my inspection in company
    with the Building Surveyors department representative during
    this month and it is likely he will raise the matter. In
    any case it is important that splitting of this kind be dealt
O   with reasonably quickly so as to retard the" rate at which the
    reinforcement corrodes, I will discuss this matter with you
    when I have seen the dama~emyself.

                                        Yours sincerely,

               Many thanks for your letter of the 12th July re barriers on Spion ~3p

            l  detailed in order that ~ have no dangerous harriers for the start
               of the season.

      ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED BY THE
                      CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY

              On 16 August 1982, I made an inspection of the ground,
    after having had approximatelyone fifth of the crush barriers
    on Spion Kop tested by membersof my staff under my control.
              At the end of June, crush barriers numbers 43, 44, 45,
    46, 51, 52, 53, 54, 62, 63, 63A, 65, 66, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78,
    79, 80, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 92, 94, 95, 97, 98, 99, iOO, iO1, 103,
 e 104, 105, 107, 108,
                        109 and iiO were tested in accordance with the
    procedures laid down in the Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.
        All the barriers sustained the test load although in some instances
        the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed.    These clips have
        been replaced.    At the same time, other clips and horizontal rails
        showing signs of advanced corrosion were replaced.
                  I am now able to certify that all 41 barriers have a
         satisfactory strength.
                   Two radial fences have been installed on the Leppings
         Lane terrace to segregate spectators.
                   Gates have been installed at various locations around
         the ground to prevent intruders entering the stands.
                   Repairs have been carried out to six stanchions
          supporting sheeting along the boundary wall near gate ’O’ on

                   8pans 3 and 4 of barrier 136 could not be loaded because
              of the recently installed radial fence. 8one spans of
             barriers 144, 145, 146, 149 and 154 could not be tested because
             being tovards the back of the terrace the absence of a suitable

        Annual Inspection of the Hillsborou@h Stadium as required
                   by the Certificate of Ground Safety

      On 25 July, 1983 I made an inspection of the ground after
 having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
 tested by members of my staff under my control.
       At the end of June, crush barriers numbers 121, 122, 123,

  and 154 (part), all at the Leppings Lane end of the ground
  were tested in accordance with the procedures laid down in the
  Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.
       In all but one case the barriers sustained the test load
  although in two cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube
  deformed. These clips were on barrier 136 between spans 6-7
  and 8-9. New clips have been fitted.
       The only failure was the centre support of barrier 141
  where the angle leg parted where it was badly corroded. The
  angle has been plated and new bolts inserted.
       I am now able to certify that all the barriers tested
  have a satisfactory strength.

Kop and protection of the North side gable stanchion in the
West stand have been completed as part of the maintenance
programme.
     Certain other items of maintenance work which it is
suggested should be carried out in the near future have been
recommended to the Club. A list is attached.
     New toilets and turnstiles have recently been constructed
behind Spion Kop. During these operations the ramp down the
back of Spion Kop was disturbed by movement of the embankment.
In particular the hand rail and concrete wall guarding the
edge of the gangway moved sideways. The hand rail and wall
have now been tested in accordance with the requirements of
the Code of Practice and in all but one case, where there was
excessive deflection of a hand rail post, successfully
resisted the test load.
     Following these inspections and tests, I certify that in
my opinion the various structures on the ground are in a
satisfactory condition and are appropriate for the stadium to
be used to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of
Ground Safety°

League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

2.        Ground Inspection

 the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
 by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

 should be infilled with mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly
 with the appropriate Regulations-

     (iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
     of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

     The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation wlth the South
     Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
     of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
     temporary barriers. This worked yell but on all other normal occasions it
     was thepolicy of the Police to aim f6r’exclusive use byvlsi~ing supporters
     of the West Stand and Terrace. On those occasions when the number of
     visiting supporters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
     obviously desirable to allow home supporters access to a sheltered area.
             £ WAS AGREED -

         (1) That the Club would consider at some future date a scheme for

        ~permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals

         Stand should receive appropriate trea=ment by the Club.

         ~o co0xnents¯

         D.      North Stand

         IT WAS AGREED that so long as larger, not easily ccxnbustlble, materials
         continued to be stored in the timber screened store area under the Stand,
         the area would be regarded as acceptable.

         E.     Spion Kop

         It was noted that the remedial work to the roof of the tunnel exit from
         the Kop had stabilised its condition for the time being (pending the
         Club’s development proposals proceeding~ that the loose coping stores
         had been removed from the too of the wail between the $pion Kop and the
         South Stand, and that the damaged corrugated metal sheeting between the
         Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.

          IT WAS AGREED -

          (i) That the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop should
          continue to be monitored.

                       ~AJOR INCIDENT PLAN

 Introduction
 A major incident is a situation that we can never predict, it can occur
 at any place at any time. The object of this plan is to enable us to
 deal with any incident in an or~sed .professional way, by each and
 every member sticking to their own job and knowing exactly what their
 role is.

The Ambulance Service has more problems regsmding manning levels than
the other two Emergency Services especially at night, the weekends and
Bank Holidays. This problem alone makes the construction of a plan
such as this a major task due to the difficulties that can occur in
contacting off duty personnel. The plan has been designed to be s~mple,
easy to read and each duty itemised so individuals can concentrate on
the areas that concern them and all unnecessary information left out.

Attention must be drawn to the following factors:-

The colour of Safety Helmets will denote the duties and rank of the
wearer i.e.
     Ambulance Personnel transport          =    White
 ,
     Leading Ambulance Person               =    White with Black Band
     Emergency Support Team (Foot Squads) =      Yellow
     Ambulance Officers                      =   Blue
2. All personnel must ensure that their H. V. jacket and suitable
   footwear are taken to the scene of any m~jor incident with other
     items of persons! safety equipment.
It is most important that the Incident Officer resins in or close to
the Cummmications Vehicle, this being the centre for directing and
monitoring the whole operation. He must also ensure that a V.H.F. R/T
Handset (which will be marked) is given to the first available crew
that depart for the designated hospital so it can be handed over to the
Liaison Officer who will be on duty.
Ambulance crews must rennin with their vehicles at all times, their
role at a major incident is transportation and ~mbulance Nursing whilst
mobile, all rescue and treatment duties will be performed by the
Emergency support team which are Ambulance Personnel without smbulances.
Delegated officers will be issued with a U.H.F. R/T Handset to enable
communications to be made via the mobile Control.
The support and cummnication vehicle will be based at Heackluarters, this
vehicle will contain all the necessary equiunent and drivers will be
allocated by Control.

To enable the plan to run efficiently, it is essential that all personnel
concentrate on the objectives and check list of their individual role.
    MAJOR INCIDENT/CAT~PHE PLAN




    Definit ion: -

~i!i~~ ~ Dear Mr Chester
         SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS TO LEPPINGS LANE END OF THE GROUND

        With reference to our conversation of last week regarding improvements
        required to the West End of the ground, I forward herewith our thoughts.

        You will see that we favour the erection of a stone wall on the ground side
        of the current terraces, with such wall housing a bank of turnstiles. Our
        belief is that once a spectator goes through the turnstiles he should then
       ~e_~_f/om the other fans, and this can be achieveq~--~e        by      erection
        of permanent high metal railings on that concrete area at present behind
        the Stand. Similarly, there should be a high metal railing down the centre
        of the West Stand. What is then created is total segregation of all three
        portions of the Terrace and the two areas of the West Stand, with each of
      ~these segregated areas having its own refreshment and toilet facilities.

        If you have any query on these recommendations, no doubt you will come back
        to me.

        Yours sincerely




        Chief

        Segregation of Visiting Spectators at Leppings Lane End




t         The club is anxious to segregate the visiting team’s supporters!//
    as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control/"
    their exit at the end of a game.
           We have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
    drawing 6705/2. This involves the construction of two new banks of
    turnstiles (Nos 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various runs of fencing
    and new gates.
        It would be appreciated if the Working Party could consider th~s
    proposal at an early date. Mr Chester has already given a copy of
    the drawing to the police so that they have had some advance notice°




                                                                 Yours sincerely,

                District) held at the Police Sports.& Social Club, Niagara
                              Sheffield, on 18th Avril i985


PRESENT: N.   Atkinson (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
         C.   Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
         R.   Grimshaw (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
         G.   Stanley (South Yorkshire Police)
         T,   Stewart (South Yorkshire Police)

           D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)
           A. Vickers (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)


I.     Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
 and plan from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
 the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of
 turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates in order to achieve
 segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
~llsborough Stadium.

2.     Consideration of Proposals

The Police representatives pointed out that the proposals had been
prompted in the main by conmmnts they had made to the Club. At one
time, both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element of use by
home supporters as well.

The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
Police representatives, subject to:-

 (a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
       and the wall of the inner access road;

 (b)    the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral area or
        visiting supporters’ terrace) being divided in half by a new
        central radial fence running from the J:tt~fice to the
       p1~ide security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
              diverted to either half as aR~K~tr~._~the proposed new
        ~condary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
        on the plan to be abandoned);

 (c)    the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters’
        terrace) also to be dlvided in half by a new central radial fence
        running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
        fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral area and
        home supporters - to have a second gate installed;

 (d)    the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
        installed - one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters
        area

                                          lo
    The County Fire Service saw no objection in principle to the prooosals, lJ
    subject to more detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects,
    and the Building Authority similarly saw no objection, subject to
    submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of
    Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

    3.   Action
                                                                          J
    IT WAS AGREED:-

    (a) That R. Grimshaw should investigate as a matter of urgency the means


~   of escape aspects of the proposals and let D. I. Vaughan know the


 (b) That, subject to satisfactory clearance of these aspects by the
County Fire Service, the outline proposals submitted by Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners be agreed as now amended by the suggestions of the South
Yorkshire Police, also subject, of course, to the submission of the
necessary detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

     Dear Dick,
                       Turnstiles at Leppings Lane
          After speaking to Sharon last Wednesday about the number of
     turnstiles required to serve spectators using the Leppings Lane
     end of the ground we have altered our proposed layout accordingly.
     Three prints of our drawing 6705/3 areenclosed.
          The eighteen existing turnstiles will remain. Ten will serve
     the North stand and eight the terraces for the home supporters.
     In addition to four turnstiles from (A - E), which can be re-used,
     twelve new turnstiles will be required. Four each of these will be
     for home and away spectators using the West stand, four for visiting
     supporters using the terrace under the score board and four more,
     primarily for away supporters to the centre terrace, but they could
     be used for home supporters if the need arises. We understand the
     police have suggested a central fence to divide the middle section
     rather than provide a 2 m wide sterile area to one side. This may
     work providing you are happy having home and away supporters in the
      same area outside.
           Would you and Sharon be kind enough to have a look at the
      drawing because I would like to hear your comments before proceeding

                                                                                            I

    further, though in the meantime we are pressing on with the toilet
    facilities.
         We have spoken to Mayor Turnstiles Ltd who supplied the
    turnstiles on Penistone Roaa and they have told us that it the
    new turnstiles are wanted during the close season they will want a
    letter of intent within the next few days. Other clubs are busy
    installing new turnstiles and their order book is getting full. We
    can deal with this on your behalf but an indication that the numbers
~’~hown are correct would be useful.

                                                      Turnstiles at Leppings Lane

          Thank you for returning the marked copies of our drawings
     6705/2 and 3. After our telephone conversation yesterday we
     have altered the layout accordingly. Two prints of our drawing
     6705/4 are enclosed for your comments.
          We have equalised each combination of turnstiles and gate II
     as requested but each gate needs to be at least 2.75 m for exit
     purposes.
          If this arrangement fs satisfactory, or~ even if you wish us
     to make more alterations, we would be available to have a meeting
     with you and South Yorkshire Police sometime next week to discuss
     the proposals in detail.
                                                                       Yours sincerely,

             Further to the joint meeting on 18 April 1985, to discuss the proposals for
             new crowd control arrangements, the means of escape implications have now
             been considered. The scheme would appear to be satisfactory providing that
             certain gates have the minimum widths (in metres)   as indicated on the enclosed /I/I0,
             plan. It is understood that these gates will be    supervised  by either the police/I
             or club officials.                                                                    11
              Should you require any further information, plea                               e do not hesitate to contact
              this Department.

    Dear Dick,
                        Re-0rganisation of Turnstiles
                 and New Toilet Facilities at Leppings Lane
            As requested we have now prepared an estimate for the
    cost of works envisaged at the back of the West stand for the
    segregation of visiting spectators.
            The scope of the work falls into two categories, firstly
    the turnstiles, fences, walls and gates, and secondly, the
    toilets and refreshment facilities.
            The proposed layout of the turnstiles etc. at the back
    of the stand is shown on our drawing 6705/4, a copy of which is
    enclosed.    Including the radial fence on the West terrace, we
                                                                 i
    estimate that the cost of this work, including professional  /
    fees, is likely to be in the order of £66,600.    This
                                                                 /
    assumes that five of the existing turnstiles can be re-used
    and seven new turnstiles are purchased.
            Also enclosed is a print of our drawing 6705/7 showing
     the proposed layout of the new and refurbished toilets beneath
     the West stand. We estimate that the cost of the toilets,
     again including professional fees, will probably be around
     £60,700.    This includes stainless steel fittings which are fairly
     resistant to abuse but are expensive. The saving if vitreous
     china is substituted for stainless steel urinal troughs and
                                    An Unlimit~ Compan~ R~ister~ in England-No. 1~31~/ ....

sinks would be about £2,200¯    If the items of maintenance
work, listed by S.Y.C.C. Working Party on their last visit,

concrete frame at the back of the South stand and the corrosion
of stanchions at the back of the West stand, repointing the
boundary wall on Penistone Road and providing the me&h infill
on the bridge to the kitchens are added to the same contract
we suggest that an allowance of £3,000 be made for this.
        The total expenditure for the whole scheme
 the mainteannce work is therefore likely to be ab~£130 ~O~ ~

                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

                         In reply to your letter dated 9th April, whilst a meetinE of the
                         Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) was held o~ 18th April
                         to consider the proposals which you outlined, the County Fire


                         I
                         Service requested additional time to consider the means of escape
                         aspects.

                         I am now able to say that, subject to the incorporation of the

       For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

       Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                   Safet[ 0f Sports Ground Act 1975
                 Sheffield Wednesda[ Football Club PLC
               Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
       of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
       to you on 9 April.
               In the interim period several of the points which you
O;3Hh raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
      which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.    However I
      would ask that further consideration should be given to the i~i
       request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a second gate to

     ibe installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
      barrier which you have asked for to have two gates. If these IA
      gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having a I/IiI
       steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of whichlll/J I/~I
      would hardly be justified. It is our view that in the event of 1
      emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the ,I
      gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear./~j
      We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
      Fire Officer’s staff should you so wish.                        tl                                          t

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday ~ootball Club PLC
In reply to your letter of 8th May, the extra gates referred to in ParagraPh
(c) of my earlier letter o£ 2nd May were included pri~arily at the request
of the South Yorkshire Police.

Provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
are incopEorated in the l~test ~roposals (yet to be considered by the Club),
the Police are Drenarer~ to concede the request for two gates ~er radical fence
in the right ~and area of the ~ppings Lane End Terrace (indicated as ho~
supporters’ terrace on the plan).


                                        Yours faithfully,

Dear Dick,
                Alterations at Leppin@s Lane End
     We have pleasure in enclosing two prints of each of our drawings
6705/5 and 6705/8 showing two possible alternative arrangements for
the turnstiles and toilets at the back of the West stand.
     Both drawings show the following turnstile arrangements.
          Turnstile Nos 1 - 8 - North stand
                         9 - 13 - North west terrace, home supporters
                        14 - 16 - West stand, home supporters
                        17 - 19 - West stand, away supporters
                        20 - 23 - South west terrace, away supporters
     The proposals for the toilet and refreshment facilities are also
the same on each drawing. You will see that we propose to build a new
ladies toilet for away supporters using the end of the existing
refreshment bar. The existing ladies toilets will be refurbished for
the use of home supporters. The existing gents toilets will be
divided and refurbished.
     Drawing 6705/5 indicates present turnstile housings (17 & 18)
remaining with the ajoining fence covered with sheeting to completely
separate the home and away supporters. However, doing the calculations
for the evacuation of the ground reveals that there is a pinch point at

the two external gates on the left hand side of the row of six.
It could take over 20 minutes to evacuate that end of the ground
depending on how many people leave the South stand from that side¯

arrangement by demolishing the two end turnstiles (17 & 18) and
constructing a new dividing wall angled across to enclose three
gates on the left hand side instead of two.
     We believe that the cost of the scheme on drawing 6705/5 will
be about £57,500 and for the one shown on drawing 6705/8 around
£59,500, both including professional fees. To these figures add
say another £3000 for the maintenance work mentioned in our letter
of 2 May.
     If a decision to proceed with one of the proposed schemes is
given within the next few days it may be possible to have the work
substantially complete by the start of next season. This is not
certain but we would have a go.

                            Yours sincerely,

                 As requested I met the police representatives on Thursday,
       13 June.     I had some difficulty in persuading Mr. Moseley
       that it was not appropriate to have a high segregating barrier
e
~      d own the middle of the seating area in the West stand.    I think
       he finally accepted that it was not necessary to do any more
       than have a relatively low level rail which would be sufficient
       to make the two lots of spectators go to the appropriate
       refreshment bars and toilets and also make their way out through
       the correct route.
           Superintendent Moseley was very concerned about the
       segregation of the two lots of spectators on the West terrace
        on those occasions when the centre of the terrace will be filled
        by visitors.    He said that on the occasion of the Liverpool
        match he had had to station policemen in pairs down the full
        length of the dividing fence and this had been a very uncomfortable
        situation for the officers.    Not leas~ of his difficulties was
        that it was not easy for the officers to get in and out of that
                                                                      ,?

         particular area if the ground was packed with spectators¯
         He felt that a higher fence than the present one or a double
         fence was necessary¯ I suggested that we should have- --- I/a-double_~
         ~ence wltn a gap Detw~een so as ~ ~eep the s~c~ac~ apaz¢ . //
         and to provide a space in wnlcn nls o~icers cou~a s~a~u. Y/
         F-e-war p~ would ~ needed if the ~ had a                 (
         gap between them.    It so happens that right alongside the
         existing fence there is a gate on to the pitch and if the
     ~iii’0 second fence were placed on the other side of the gate, it
          will provide an easy access gangway for the police and they
          will be able to move in and out of the gap depending on the
          situation¯    Mr. Moseley was clearly very pleased by this
          suggestion and subject to your approval, we are including
          the work in the contract for segregating the spectators at
          Leppings Lane end.
              I should point out that it will mean losing ah~ a metre
          of advertising space because the hoardings carry straight on
          past that particular gat__ee--k-----at presen___tt. There w-ill hav~ to be-
          a gap in the                 enable the police to get in and out and

          of course, to evacu~ the crop.emergency¯

                 Purpose of Meeting.
          The purpose of the meeting was to consider the detailed plans submitted by the
      letter dated 25th July from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners of arrangements
      for the segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
      Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. It was
      recalled that consideration of outline proposals had taken place by the
 ~,~: Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985. Whilst formal application had been
 ~    made for Building Regulation approval and some of the work had actually
      commenced, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had apologised by ’phone that
      submission of the detailed proposals for Safety of Sports Grounds Act
      approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and staff

          The 14 detailed plans submitted wereeach consi.~ered and discussed individually.
          IT WAS AGREED ~ that, subject to thefollowing points and to the submission of
          the necessary detailed calculationsto the Building Authority, the proposals
          for segregating visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane End of the
          Hillsborough Stadium were generallyacceptable:-

        If (a) Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress purposes,
        VLa pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided; .                                   //
 ....     (b)    Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by Turnstile 23 to be either
-Q        shortened or re-aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer
-J        "(river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
          the new handrail not to be less than the width of the roller shutter gate
          between Turnstiles 16 and 17;
          (c)    Plan No. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the interal walls
          (e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
          substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
          be required;

          (d)    Plan No. 6705/IOA - same comments as for plan 9A;

          (e)    Plan No. 6705/IIA- no objection in principle, but details of exact
          location required;

          (f)    Plan No. 6705/12 - no objection in principle, but no barrier height
          indicated;

          (g)    Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved by steep
          slopes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped" arrangements to give
foothold, the proposals are satisfactory but the possible need to take
measures on top of the wall to discourage persons from attempting to climb
over will have to be borne in mind;

(h)     Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last year, the front
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered 5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;
(i) Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
purposes, a Fitch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;

(j)    Stewarding of New Gates - as m~ntioned in my ’letter of 2nd May, 1985,~/

      For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

      Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                       Safet[ of Sportsground Act, 1975
                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                  Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
      outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.   We note
      the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
      by the Building Surveyors Department. We believe that all the
      calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
      checking and comment.
             With regard to your detailed observations our response
      is as follows :-
       (a)     We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
      the proposed extra security gate. There is already a gate in
      the 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the
      police. This same gate will still be available for the spectators
       in emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace

     iwhich will be under the control of the police.
      ¯
                                                         This point may
       perhaps be clarified during the Working Partyrs visit on 7 August.
          (b)        The foundations-for this fence are in fact already aligned in
                                                               R~ister~d,, ’in Eng~ - No. 18331~ ~,~.~, ’

                                                                         O~OMETN0. ~                                   ~ ~ ,~C

  the way you suggest.
  (c) and (d)
         We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
  single block thickness is not sufficient for tn~ u~ cle
  walls. The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
  vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
  Studding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
  durability, and would probably invite vandalism.
  (e)     The refreshment area is under the most westerly
  staircase up to the north west corner terrace. There will
  be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.
  (f)     The handrail is to be at a height of 125Omm (4’ i")
  above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
   step.
   (g)     The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45°
   chamfers which will not form good footholds.
   (h)     Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
   object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
   the precise location can be discussed on 7 August.
   (i)     As with point (a), we are not sure what is intended,
   and the matter can be discussed on 7 August.
   (j)      Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
   taken care of by Mr. Chester.

           It will be much easier for your Working Party to
   appreciate what is intended when they see the works under
   construction. There will also be an opportunity to see
   the metal decking of the South stand.

                              Yours sincerely,

   I.    Purpose of Meeting.

   The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "summer" inspection of the
   Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
   the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

   2.    Ground Inspection.

  A.     Leppings Lane End

   The progress of the works to segregate visiting supporters behind and on the
   West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
   points raised at the officer Working Party’s meeting held on 29th July,
   (forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive’s letter
   of 3Oth July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of Ist August.

   Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
   were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
   checking and comment.

    On the insvection, the Building Authority pointed out.what they considered
’~ to be the poor standard of workm.anship in the construction of ~b~ new
    dividing wall which was being bullt behind the Stand. The pesltlon of the
     Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by
     45 .chsmfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.
’ The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
   aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer (rlver) wall
   and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on the plan sutmitted).
                                                                                  r

    As regards the single block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
    in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
    Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
    was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that °tb~ walls were braced:        i~i,
    by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted ~ ....   ~._
    the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the               ::



                                                                                       :, %
     dividing walls in the new toilet facilities evidently did not have any
     foundations, apparently having been built straight onto the existing
     concrete slabs. It was noted that tb~re~were some 9 inch thick brick walls
     in the Male Toilets, it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
     would be more likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

     The Club pointed out that the new toilet facilities would not be completely
     finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
     temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would
     be left on site.
                                                                         .
     up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been bumlt
     straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

     On the Terrace itself, it was noted that~there was an existing gate in the
     new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the Police.       /
     This gate would still be available for the use of spectators in an
     emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
     Police would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. wide gap.
I)   However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required. It
     was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South
     Central Terrace Pen.

     As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
     sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
     both the Stand and at the Access level.

     IT WAS AGREED:-
     (a) that the condition of the internal walls in the new male and female
     toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;

     (b) that the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
     extended or have steps to provide easier access from the new 2 m. wide gap
     formed by the new radial fence;

     (c) that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence should be provided from
     the new South Central Terrace Pen;
,O
     (d) that the advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated stand
     area should be securely fixed to the concrete wall;                               @
     (e) that the spalling of the concrete of the wall at the front of the
     upper seated stand area should receive attention as am after of maintenance;

     (f) that the corrosion of the steel columns at the rear of the Stand
     should receive attention on a maintenance basis.

     B.    South Stand

     Messrs. gastwood & Partners reported that the condition of the upper
     concrete outer portion of the exterior wall of the Stand had been
     investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.
     It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
     Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the non-sllp
     surface was to commence very shortly (and certainly be completed by the
     start of the season).
        IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
        Stand should largely overcome the flammability problems inherent in such

        wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
        laying of the metal sheeting.

        Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details of the Club’s
        proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of the
        Officer Working Party by letter dated 2~nd July. As part of that scheme,
        the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed, Its present condition


        In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
        additlonal gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
        uo the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which could
        uccur when large crowds were present. ~

        IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new gate in the pitch perimeter
        fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
        arrangement to assist access and egress.

        stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
        basis.

For the attention of J.C. Harris M.A. LL.M.

Dear Sir,

Many thanks for your con~mmication dated 9th August 1985.

I can confirm that arrangements have been finalised with South Yorkshire
Police Authorities, Hammerton Road, for the staff concerned to be briefed
on matters relating to safety/emergency procedures prior to our first home
game, Saturday 17th August 1985.

The written instructions are already in existence with the amended ’%~arning
message" of an emergency situation confirmed during season 198415.

My Head Steward and various sectional senior stewards, are kept fully
informed of the various matters and are responsible for advising the
’~atch day" staff accordingly.

In addition the staff are supplied with distinguishing attire, and are
given specific duties to perform and required to be in attendance at tbmse
points throughout the entire period.

With the approval of South Yorkshire Police, due to holidays and the
unavailability of a full complement of staff, I have delayed the convening
of an evenings seminar/instructional course, by the Fire Authorities until
after the season has commenced. Having spoken to the Fire Authorities they have
confirmed their willingness to attend leaving only the finalisation of the date
 in abeyance.

Yours faithfully,


                                                                                       OCUM HT la.

          ~aar Dick,
                Many thanks re= your note of 12 August enclosing the
          copy of David Vaughan’s now ~f the meeting be:M at the ground
          on 7 August. A copy of my letter to David Vaughan was sent
          tO yOU ~ Sl day io that our letters have crossed in the
          pOIt.
  (
                  You will see that I have taken up very strongly the
          suggestion by Don She~Zif that the workmanship in the brickwork
          was poor a~d ~uld lead to woakneII. It is unfortunate that
          David Vaughan°dld not record t.hat I had caeplot~ely refuted
          what Don Sheriff said. David now recognises that this waI a
          mistake but i~ putting the matter right by circulating a copy
          of my letter. ...... . .. ....... ........... . ..............              , ......
                Turning- to .the.matters .on .the second..pa~Is~ .........................................
          ¯ It was agreed*                       "
          My commentI on the points you have in mind are aI followI I-

          (bl      This refers to the existing gate between the new 2m wide
                   gap formed by the radial fence which ~ll be used for
                   police access only. You will notice from the wording
                   ~f Davldes minute that I persuaded theR that steps oould
             be used. I have interbreed this as belna from
            /the inside only which means that we will not lose
            ///any of your advertising space, we have added the
            I( provialon of some timber steps on the inside to
            --the work being carried by Gleeson.

¯ .0 () The other radial fence forming the small visitors
             pen has left a length of terrace without a dire~
             access on to the pitch. There is of course a gat~
             at the top of the terrace connecting into the nex~
             pen and we had hoped that t.he police would accept.
             that as an adequate means of exit in emergency.
             However at the meeting they made the point very
              strongly that if someone had to be got out of the pen
             which has no ga~e or if there was misbehaviour the
             police would only be able to get in via the neighbouring
              Pen, passing up the terrace through the gate at the
              back and then down again in the isolated pen. They
              considered this unacceptable. Z think that this
              particular item can be paid for out of the contingency
              sum and suggest that it be added to Gle~son’s work°

      (d)     You will recall that when you and I went round with
              Superintendent John Freeman he pointed ou~ that the
              advertising hoardings on the parapet of the seating
              area of the West stand were simply hookid ove~ the

              We agr.ee.d..th~t_~_f£xing would be. provided. He had ................... .,
              apparently reported this to David Vaughan so the
              matter wEs raised again° It is clearly a good point
              because nny hooligans in the seated area could easily
              drop an advertising beard on to people below. I have
              in mind that the hoardings can be fixed by a runner
              of timber and again subject to your approval, this
              can be carried out as part of the present works.
                                                   I/tl
,t                                                                      e




           next year.

     (f)   You will probably know that the bases of the steel columns
           behind the West stand have benn queried year by year
.e         by Don Sheriff who has requested ~hat exaavations be
           harried outto ensure ~hat the steel is not rusting
           below ground level. By chance Gleesons had exposed
           one of the columns and I was interested to see that it has
           not suffered badly. However I have pointed out that the
           columns do n~ccarry any load.    They form part of the
           previous structure and were chopped down to that level
           when the new concrete stand was built for the World
           Cup. They merely form a frame within which the brick
           wall is built. There is therefore no cause for concern.
           At the next meeting in February I will try to get this
           item deleted from the list.

O
           Quite a number of items have nov been added at Police
     request. In addition there is the cost of the new gas Lain
     and also unexpected costs in connection vlth the electricity
     supply to the new refreshment area in the North West corner.
     I m~ asking John Strange to check on all these items to see
     whether they can be acco.--odated within the contingency s~
     which we included in Gleesons contract. X~Lm "~n holiday but


                            Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football ClubLtd.
                      S afet~ of Sportsgrounds Act
                         Roof of North Stand
      I spoke to you before going on holiday regarding the very
advanced state of corrosion which we discovered when I made an
examination of the external steelwork of the North stand roof
at the end of the last football season.
      Attached are four photographs which are representative
of the conditions which I discovered.      Photograph 1 shows one
of the main trusses. It will be seen that the vertical
member and the top boom and diagonal were fairly rusty and they
clearly needed a paint treatment because the paint had largely
disappeared and corrosion can be expected to accelerate from now
on.     It has to be kept in mind that the roof was designed for
the pre-1970 wind loadings including downward suction when the
wind is blowing from the back of the stand so that factors of
 safety have always been slightly less than they would be
                        An Uniimit~ ~m~,RegistemdinEng~ -N~!~

                                                                 SHEET   ¯




     EASTWOOD a’ PARTNERS




      according to the present day Building Regulations.
             At the time of my first inspection the bottom boom
      member was utw~red by some flashings which hid two side
      legs.     I arranged for representative lengths of these
      flashings to be removed and as you will see from photograph 1
      rusting had been taking place rapidly for many years. It seems
      that when the roof was painted last time the flashings were
      left in place so that there had only been the original paint
      treatment which had disappeared long ago.      Photograph 2
      was taken on the same day at another location. You will
      see that there is a very large rust lamination on the nearside
      leg of the bottom boom where a large piece of rust is splitting
      away from the remainder of the steel.
             In addition to the very serious rusting of the vertical
      flanges, there were many places on the web of this bottom
      boom member where rust had progressed quite considerably.
      The web had clearly been painted 18 years ago but because
      of the very shallow slope of the bottom boom (parallel to
      the roof) the rain which falls in it had been ponding thus
      keeping the steel wet for a considerable portion of the time.
4D    This had tended to occur locall~ where small dams of dust had
      built up.
             As a result of these findings I reported to the Club
      that all the steelwork needed painting as a matter of urgency
      but in addition, the bottom boom would need to be blast
      cleaned before painting and finally that a completely different
      form of flashing should be incorporated which would stop
      rain from falling into the trough and which could also be
      easily taken off when next the roof is painted.
             The Club took the decision to carry out the painting.
      Tenders were obtained and work began at the beginning of
       July.    When the flashings were taken off everywhere, we found
      even worse conditions in some places than had been discovered
       in the original inspection.    Photograph 4 shows the extent to
                                             .,~6" ~"-                      SHEET 3.

               which metal had been lost in some parts of the bottom boom.
               Photograph 3 was just as bad but the damage does not show
               up quite so well in the photograph. Incidentally, photographs

               of the members. This steel had of course already been painted
               and does not represent the original condition.
                      During the work on the underside of the roof which
               has also been painted but for which the Club is not intending
               to apply for a grant, we discovered that at many places
               water had been leaking between roof sheets and had caused
               some localised rusting.     The reason for this leakage is clearly
               the very shallow slope of the roof which is only about 1°
                (i in 60).    A normal minimum roof slope is about 5°.   With the
               1° slope it seems that when the wind is blowing from the south
               rain which falls on the roof can be blown up the slope under
               the lap between sheets and small amounts leak into the stand.
                     In order to give long term protection from this leakage
               which could in time cause the steelwork beneath the roof to
               become unsafe, I have recommended to the Club that they spend
               approximately £3,000 in having the lower edges of each roof
               sheet lifted and a seal placed before fastening the sheet down
               again.
                      The Club will therefore be applying for a grant towards
                the cost of :-
                (a)   painting the external steelwork
                (b)   blast cleaning the steelwork which was worst affected
                      by rust.
                (c)     completely new flashings o%~r the bottom boom of the
                      main trusses of a kind which will shed the rain and
                      can be easily taken off for future painting.
                 (d)  placing of the seal between all roof sheets.

                      For   your information the total cost of all this work
                including   professional fees will be in excess of £60,000.
                This does   not include the cost of the internal painting for
                which the   Club will not be applying for a grant. It is
                                                               SHEET        ¯

     can certify that i., :its ~ini~- ~ ~-~m~ ~f. w~-~ I:~ !h~ ....
     (c) and (d) set out above were essential in the interests

  For ÷he attention of Mr. M.P. Robins.

  Dear Mr. Robins,
                     ~nesda," ?ootball Club 1
                      Sea re=at ion work at Lep?inqs Lane
       The segTegatlon of supporters at the Leppings Lane
  end of the ground was first proposed some time before
  September 1981. We do not know the exact date but the
  original request that schemes be looked at was made by
  South YoEkshlre Police in the days when ME. England was
  the Club SeoEotazy. Some rough outline s~m were
  prepared at ~hat ~ hut the work did not proceed.
        In Febzuazy this yeaz the matter was raised again
   end more schemes devised. Approval of a schmm was
   qiven by S¥CC in May. Shortly aftez that another, much
   less expensive sr..heae was put fozwa~. After agreeing
   several matters of detail with SYCC and the C1nb,
   constructlon work eventually started on 22 July, 1985.
   The work 18 now almost complete.
        Enclosed are copies of the following documen~
   relating to the 8e~e~ation week:-
         a) Ou= letter dated 9 April,to SYCC.
      b)     Their reply dated 2 May.
      )      Our letter dated 8 May to SYC¢.
      d]     Their reply dated 10 May.

             Bill of Quantities received from Cleeson
             S&keffteld) Ltd.
       The scheme involved the alteration of existing toilets,
the provision of new ladies toilets and refreshment
facilities because segregating walls prevented access to t
the existing toilets and refreshment bars by either the
home or visiting s~ectators.

     Also included in the Contract were various items of
ground safety work. These are items 6 and 8, page 7/1 of
the Bill of 0uantlties, items I to 4, page 8/lfor the
repair of barriers on Spion Eop which faile~ the load test
earlier this year and items 1 to 3, page 9/1.
     Enclosed are copies of the following documents
relating to that safety work:-

  I.     Purpose of Meeting

   The purpose of the meeting was to consider the response to be given to the
   proposals outlined in the letter dated 25th October, 1985 and plans received
i~from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to facilities for the disabled, an
"~-Ln~creased capaczty for the Spion Kop and consequent additional exit routes.
  Qtline details of the roof to be erected over the Spion Kop had also been
   provided.

  2.     Disabled Facilities

  The Officer Working Party exuressed reservations on both of the suggestions
  proposed by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for the disabled. If the disabled
  continued to be accommodated in front of the North Stand, they would still
  be in the "firing line" of mis-aimed shots and any clear sheeting over the
   top of the area they occupied could constitute an unacceptable hazard to
  persons who might vacate the North Stand in an emergency situation by
  climbing over the front wa~ of the stand onto the pitch perimeter. It was
  accepted that the means of escape did not provide for this to be done, but
   it had to be recognised that in practice this was a real possibility. The
  structural stren~hofsuch a structure would also be something of a problem.
  The other suggestion of accommodating the disabled in front of the perimeter
   fence along the front of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) was also
~unacceptable for the reasons stated by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners.

~he~a suggestion of the Police representatives was that the front area of the
   lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the terracing levelled
   to provide, say, a two-tier level landing on which to accommodate the disabled,
   with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch perimeter fence in
   front of this area could be removed, and the disabled would continue to gain
   access from the ramp between the Spion Kop and the North Stand as at present.
   This would also enable free access by the disabled to the proposed disabled
   toilets under the rebuilt terracing of the Spion Kop.

   The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.

   IT WAS AGREED that the proposals for the disabled, as now
  ,outlined by the Police representatives, should be supported and
   ~transmitted to Messrs.,Eastwood & Partners as the views of
   the Officer Working Party, subject to there being no obstruction of exit
   routes and flows.

   3.    Enlarged Spion Kop

   The Fire Service and the Building Authority agreed that calculations showed
                                                           " DOCUMENT No. 5
                                                           l                         I
that the enlarged S~ion Kop would provide for an increasp of ~ome 5,000
spectators on the present capacity o~ 16,850, and that the number of exit
widths required to achieve evacuation was 46. The prop-sals to increase the
tunnel exit on the north side of the Kop to 8 clear ~Inits and to provide a
complete new six unit staircase on the so,th side were regarded as acceptable¯
As when the original calculations had been made, the units of exit wLdth
included the emergency gates in the pitch perimeter fence, but it was cons-
idered that landings in front of these gates should be constructed (as has
been done at Bramall Lane).

IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, the proposals from the
enlarged Splon Kop submitted by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners were generally
acceptable :-

     (a)   adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the
           upper rear and the new south side exit routes:
     (b)   to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents’
           toilets and the new ladies’ toilets in the new six unit staircase
           on the south side;
     (c)   to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
           gates in the pitch perimeter fence;
     (d)   to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
           the south side and on the Penis tone Road side:
     (e)   until acceptable alternatives are available, the new exit gates to
           be fitted with a turn-bar arran[;ement under the control of
           s rewards.

4.     Roofing of Spion Kop

Whilst it was accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals had been
supplied to date, the Building Authority pointed out that the plans showed
that the gables were not lined.

IT WAS AGREED that this should be pointed out to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,
as well as the fact that should any of the proposed works on enlarging or
roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the close season, it will be
a requirement that the areas concerned wi|l have to be secured to prevent
unauthorised access.

      Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

The Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the merging of
spectators from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Lane end.

It was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the physical restraints
to achieve this could conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present
position to continue.

      Duties of Stewards Booklet

IT WAS AGREED that the                       repared by the South Yorkshire Pol~ce
outlining the duties of* s~~e~iards was acceptable and should be distributed
to designated grounds for\the info.~mation and guidance of stewards employed mt
such grounds. Factors peculiar to particular grounds could, of course, be
added if considered appropriate.

7.     Spot Checks at Designated G3 )unds

The Fire Service reported on the    ~ccess of the recent spot che~k carried out

                                        .2.



                                                                           J

                                                                  c
at the Oakwell Ground of the Barnsley Football Club in conjunction with the
Police and the Building Authority, and reported that th~ Divisions of the
Brigade were being asked to carry out similar spot checks at designated
grounds in their areas.

IT WAS AGREED that such spot checks were essential to ensure that tile required
standards were being maintained by the Clubs.

    W
            Dear Sir,
            Following lengthy discussions between The Football Association
            and The Football League, we are now able to send you, over our
            joint signatures, a revised Memorandum on Crowd Management.
            This document sets out to amplify and clarify the’responsibilities
            of Clubs in relation to this most difficult problem. Both our
            bodies are fully aware of the enormous amount of time, money and
            energy expendedby our Clubs in ensuring that the public can
            attend matches in safety. With the eyes of the world on us,
            however, we cannot afford to relax for one moment.
            We ask you to st uudy the Memorandum in qreat detail. Failure to
            act on any o~he recommendatlons may be taken into account should
            a Club subsequently be charged with misconduct under Football
            Association Rules 23 and 24.

    C.°.   SEGREGATION

i          1. Clubs must make adequate arrangements for the segregation of rival
              supporters.
           2. To ensure segregation, it will be necessary to reserve a
              section or sections in the stadium for visiting supporcers.
                ~It is essential in this process that adequate information
                 on the likely movements of visiting supporters is obtained
                 by the Home Club in consultation with the visiting Club and
                 the bodies listed In BI.
            .
                 If the match is not "all ticket", maximum publicity must
              ~ucn areas musu De clear±y S~gn-posted at the Stadium.
           4. As far as possible, the arrangements for the Transport of
              visiting supporters should ensure that they do not come into
              contact with home supporters when making their way to and
              from the ground.
           5./ Contingency plans must be made to move supporters situated

                /in the wrong section to the area or areas allocated for them,
                 or else to be expelled from the Stadium.
            m    Wherever possible, segregation should be effected by permanent
                 structures such as wall, bert%era or fences. Only in
                 exceptional circumstances should Police be called upon
                 to form a "human" barrier.
           7. Double barriers and walkway systems should be installed to
                 allow the Police to reinforce segregation and to gain access
                 to terracing or seating should the need arise.
           8. Spectators must not be able to circulate freely between
                 sections of the Stadium.

                 to insure the best possible behavlour among supporters.

                 are available to help Clubs on request.

             MEASURES TO BE ADOPTED BY THE AWAY CLUB

             1.       Clubs should take active steps to co-ordinate and control
                      the movement of their supporters away from home.
             2. Clubs should voluntarily, if in any doubt as to their ability
                to control their supporters, decidenot to take tickets for matches.
             3. Clubs should appoint Stewards to help manage and inform spectators!JA
                at matches and to accompany parties of supporters travelling away.            /L
             4. Clubs must ensure that insofar as is practical alcohol is not
                made available to travelling supporters.
             5. Clubs should consider arranging close circuit transmissions
                o£away matches to discourage travelling supporters.
             6. Travel should be co-ordlnated so that supporters arrive as near
                to klck-off as possible and depart immediately afterwards.
             7. Clubs should-llalse with Police over visits to motorway service
                areas by supporters travelling to away matches.

                  1
                      It is the responsibility of the away Club to advise the home Club
                      of the recent behavlour of their supporters at away matches,
                      irrespective of whether the behaviour has resulted in d~sciplinary
                      action by The Football Association or not.
             %. The visiting club with experience of their supporters travelling
                      to away matches should co-operate in every way with the home club
                      in matters of security, even physically checking segregation areas,
                      vehicle parking areas, etc. Such assistance would not affect the
         shared responsibility of the home club.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

 Dear Sirs,
                Safety of Sport Grounds Act, 1975
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club plc
      Thank you for your letter of 18 December, 1985 enclosing the
 comments of the Building Authority to which I would reply as follows~=


 Disabled Facilities
 a)   There is no doubt that the Kop is covered by the Building
      Regulations and that we shall need Building Regulations
      approval. However, there has effectively been no change
      in the 1985 Regulations.
      Even if there were a change in Regulations, it is obviously
      commonsense that facilities for the d~abled apply to the
      ground as a whole and not to one particular building. At
      themoment there are perfectly adequate facilities under
      the overhang of the roof of the North stand. There is a
       level approach. The disabled are under the cove~ of the
       cantilever roof. Any facilities at the front of the Kop
      would be less sheltered from the rain, and more prone to
       disruption by the fans immediately behind. It is not a good
                   place at all for disabled people.

                                    An Unlimited Company, Registered in England- No. 1833144
                                                                                                 IOOCUMEHT Iio. 5
                                                                 SHEET   2

    b)    We have no intention of entering into further discussion
          regarding a way in which the 50 or any other number of
          places could be provided under the new Kop. There are
          adequate facilities for the ground as a whole at the
          moment.

    c).   The Building Authority clearly has no knowledge whatever

          £500,000 is made up of several components. Firstly,
          there is a steel frame supporting a precast concrete
          deck, some of it at very high level. Very expensive
          piling is required for the columns of this steel frame
          because most of the columns are high up on the bank.
O
          Secondly, the main roof girders have to carry very much
          more load, because of the larger area. The spans of the
          radial girders are also that much greater so they have
          to be stronger. The cost per square foot of all the
          covered space is increased. In addition the framing and
          sheeting at the rear of the stand are on average very
          much higher and, therefore, more expensive. Thirdly,
          the addition of the extra spectators has resulted in
          the need for complete re-organisation of exit routes with
          considerable extra expense. New turnstiles are needed and
          additional toilet accommodation. A re-examination of our
          figures shows the additional cost for the 5,000 extra places
          is about £560,000. To simply roof over the existing Kop with
          no extension would reduce the cost of the scheme to less than
          a half of that for the enlarged Kop. I trust we shall have
          no more of this uninformed opinion.
          This extra money is being provided to achieve 5000
           extra spectators. If we give up I000 of those spaces to
           provide for say I00 disabled plus i00 helpers then over
           £100,000 of the extra cost of the enlarged Kop has to be set
           against the disabled accommodation. The Building Authority
           must accept that the extra £580,000 the Club intends to spend
           is to cater for those days when the ground is full or nearly full
           to capacity.
                                                                 SHEET   3

    EASTWOOD b PARTNERS

        With regard to the proposal that a glazed shelter might
        be placed over the disabled accommodation in front of the
        North stand, it was not our intention that any seats within
        the North stand would have an obscured view although a few
        of the spectators might have to look through the glass of
        the canopy to see the near touchline. There are materials
        available for the glazed roof which might prove to be safe for


         I regard it as regrettable that there has been such a
         negative attitude on this particular matter. We have not,
         of course, taken the design study any further with regard
         to the possibility of a covering for part of the disabled
O        area nearest to the Kop end of the North stand, but would
         reconsider the matter if the Working Party has a change of
         heart.

         Enlarged Kop
              With regard to the request for a barrier to protect
         the ladies toilet, it has perhaps not been realised that
         there is handrailing already in place. A gap will be
         created for an entrance to the ladies toilet. The
         final version of the proposed arrangements is shown on
         the attached print of drawing number 6648/53. The new
         brickwork is shown shaded.

          Roofing the Kop
               We are really surprised by the suggestion that the
          steel frame of the gable walls and presumably the back of the
          stand should be sheeted over. It is a common feature of
          every stand structure that I know of in any football ground
          in the country that the sheeting rails and other bracing
          members are exposed on the inner face. In older structures
          they are generally only at 1.2 m centres but in more modern
          structures they are generally at 1.8 m centres. With the
           1.8 m spacing it would be extremelydifficult indeed to
           climb up except adjacent to a column. However, I know of
           no instance where the sheeting rails of an existing stand
           are regarded as being such a hazard that they should be boxed
          in, with an inner skin as well as an outer skin. I find
          it very surprising that this matter is being pressed.
                                                                 SHEEr 4

               This correspondence on these matters leads me to believe
          that there would be great advantage if the Club’s advisers were
          present for part of each of the meetings of the Officer Working
          Party. Matters of this kind need to be discussed round the
          table rather than in lengthy correspondence. We can be of great
          assistance in providing information which may result in fewer
          matters becoming contentious. It is also inevitable that we

          to give the opportunity to comment at an early stage. The
          plans are incomplete in some respects and this may lead to
          misunderstanding of what is intended or a lack of appreciation
          of the thinking behind what is proposed. There is also the
                    ’ t
          difficultyiln the light of comments received from the Club, and
e         indeed those from the Working Party, quite significant
          changes may take place at a very late stage. It is desirable
          that any late changes be dealt with in as short a time as
          possible. In this regard I now enclose six prints of each of
          our drawings numbers 7C, 8A, 9A, 17A and 56. As the Club
          will be wishing to place an order for the new building not
          later than the end of January, it may be that an oral presentation
          to your Working Part of what is proposed might be beneficial
          all round.

                            Yours faithfully,

     Dear Sir,                                                                       I
     As a result of several incidents during the recent past, involving casualties
     within Sports areas, I have decided to delegate one of my Officers the
./   specific task of liaison with the FootDall Clubs within the South Yorkshire
     boundaries.

     This Officer will have the task to ensure that advice and, if necessary,
     training can be provided by this Service to members of your staff. It is also
     to be his responsibility to ensure that the South Yorkshire Metropolitan
     Ambulance Service are totally aware of the geography of your ground and of any
     Incident Plans which you may have drawn up in order to ensure the safety of the
     general public.

     Obviously, in order for this task to be successful it is necessary for you to
     accept,in principle, our involvement and I should be grateful if you would
     consider this proposal and communicate with me when you have made a decision.

      I will ensure that if you require a visit or any form of advice associated to
      this suggestion an Officer will be made available to meet with you or your
      colleagues to explain our intentions.

         HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 711986

         SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT 1985

         Introduction
         !. HOC 54/85 and 5/1986 were copied to Chief Executives of
         Metropolitan District Councils and London Boroughs in view of the
         forthcoming transfer to them of responsibility in the Metropolitan
         counties and Greater London for the administration of the Safety of
         Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA). The purpose of this circular is to
         advise successor authorities of the changes to the SSGA brought
         about by the Local Government Act 1985 (LGA) and to give guidance
         on discharging these responsibilities, It is not intended to affect
         any internal or locally agreed arrangements which may be in train to
         ensure that all those who have an interest in securing safety at
         sports grounds are fully consulted¯

         SSGA 1975

         2. The SSGA gave effect to the main recommendations contained in
         the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds which
         was prepared by Lord Wheatley following the serious accident at
         Ibrox Park Football Ground in 1971.

          ¯   The main provisions of the Act are:

              a. A power, exercisable by the Secretary of State, to
              designate sports stadia with a capacity for more than
              10,000 spectators¯ Once designated, a stadium will require
              a safety certificate from the local authority.

              b. An obligation on the local authority to issue such
              certificates¯
                                                                          |




              c. A discretion for the local authority to set terms
              and conditions under the certificate with the object
              of securing a reasonable degree of safety for spectators.
              Safety certificates are of 2 kinds - firstly, the general
              safety certificate (the main form of control) and,
              secondly, the special safety certificate (for occasions
              or activities not covered by the general~ certificate)¯

              d. A right of appeal to the Secretary of State, in
              relation to the issue of safety certificates and their
              contents, the procedure for which is set out in
              regulations made under s.6(1) of the Act.

       ~1~’e. Rights Of various interested bodices (police, building
     ~~authorities or, in the Metropolitan county areas after
     I ~III "abolition", fire authorities) to consultation, access to
       JI~ grounds and information and to the appeals procedure.
     ~fll An emergency Procedure for restricting the admission
            of spectators to a wider range of sports grounds than
            those to which ’the designation provisions apply, if the
            risk to spectators is seen (by the courts) as justifying
            this.
              g. Powers of entry and inspection to sports grounds;
              and prescribed penalties for offences under the Act.

     A sports ground is, broadly speaking, any place where sports or
     other competitive activities take place in the open air and where
     accommodation has been provided for spectators. A sports stadium is
     a sports ground where accommodation for speeta~ers wholly or
     substantially surrounds the area used for the activities taking
     place therein.

     LGA 1985
     4. The combined effect of s~16 and Schedule 8 paragraph 7 of the
     LGA is to transfer to Metropolitan DiStrict Councils and London
     Boroughs the functions, duties and powers as the local authority
     responsible for administering the SSGA in place of the Metropolitanq
     County Councils and Greater London Council. A summary check list
     these responsibilities is contained at Annex A for ease of reference°

     5. Paragraph 7(3) of Schedule 8 of the LGA redefines "local
,o   authority" in England and Wales for the purposes of the SSGA as
     meaning:
          °   a. in Greater London, the London Borough Council or
              the Common Council of the City of London;

              bo in England, in the Metropolitan counties, the
              district council;
              c. in England outside Greater London and the
              Metropolitan counties, or in Wales, the county council
     6. In order to avoid any anomaly or duplication arising out of the
     MetropolitanDistrict Councils’ and London Boroughs’ responsibilities
   Guidance to the SSGA procedures

   9. A copy of the SSGA and the Regulations (Statutory Instrument
   1263 1976) are enclosed with this circular. A detailed description
   of the Act and its provisions is c~tained at Annex B. The Regu-
   lations set out the procedures and time limits associated with
   safety certificate applications and appeals. These same regulations
   also empower local authorities to determine fees in respect of
   applications for the issue or amendment of safety certificates. A
   guide to the procedure for the issue of a general safety certificate
   is at Annex C. Similarly, the procedure for the issue of a special
   safety certificate is at Annex D.

    ,u. L~e ~o~,Z~w±n~ poln~ are ~,~gn±~gnted as oeing Q~ particular
   potential interest to local authorities:

       a. Procedure under s.10. Paragraph 21 of Annex B refers.
       Authorities may wish to note that this procedure can be
       applied to all sports grounds within the meaning of the Act,
       not just to stadia. It is hoped that authorities will not
       feel inhibited from invoking the procedure, as necessary,
       where they perceive the risks to be such that urgent action
       is required to provide reasonable safety for spectators.

       b. The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) (The
       Green Guide). Attention is drawn to paragraphs 5 and 6 of
       Annex B and paragraph 3 of Annex C. Authorities will no
       doubt bear in mind the contents of paragraph 4 of HOC 5411985
       dealing with action on the Interim Report of the Inquiry
       contains additional recommendations on the content and
       structuring of the Green Guide which will be revised as soon
       as possible. In the meantime the existing guide, a copy of
       which is enclosed, may be used until such time as the revised
       version is available.

   Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds
    11. The Final Report of Mr Justice Popp~ewell’s Committee of Inquiry
   into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds was published on
  ~6 January 1986 (Command 9710). A separate Home Office circular,
/ ~umber 511986, was sent to local authorities -inciuding Metropolitan
   District Councils and London Borough Councils - on 20 January 1986,
 ....
   giving details of the Government’s response to the safety recommend-
   ations contained in the Report, and next steps.

   Other

  12. A list of designated stadia for England and Wales is attached at
  Annex E. Management of those stadia in Metropolitan counties and
  Greater London have been informed of the change in responsibility for
  administration of the SSGA and have been advised to copy applications
  for special safety certificates or amendments to existing general
  certificates to successor authorities (see Annex F).

   13. This circular is copied to Chief Executives of County Councils,
    Secretaries of ~he successor authority coordinating committees, and
    to Chief Fire Officers for information. Paragraph 10 is of
    particular relevance.
as "Building Authority", paragraph 7(2) of Schedule 8 of the LGA
redefines, for the purposes of the SSGA,  "building
                                            _       authority" in
England and Wales as meaning:

       a. in England, outside Greater London, and the
       Metropolitan counties, or in Wales, the district
       council.

The effect of this, together with amendments to Sections 3(3), 4(7)
and (8), 5(5), 10(4) and 11 of the SSGA resulting from paragraph 7(I)
of Schedule 8 of the LGA, is that in Metropolitan counties and

are synonymous, the local authority is not required to refer safety
certificate applications to the building authority or consult it
about the terms and conditions of a certificate. Similarly the
building authority in these areas does not have the status of
"interested party" and has no need of the right to authorise entry
and inspection of a sports ground because these powers are vested in
it as the local authority.

7. An additional change brought about by paragraph 7(I) affects thelwS~ ~
role and status of the Fire Authority in Greater London and the
Metropolitan counties. The converse of paragraph 6 applies in
respect of the Fire Authority which, from I April 1986, has the status
of "interested party" in Metropolitan counties and Greater London.
In these areas the local authority is required to refer safety
certificate applications to the Fire Authority and consult it about
the terms and conditions of a safety certificate; and the Fire
Authority will have the right to authorise entry and inspection of
a sports ground. The reason for these changes is that the newly
constituted fire authorities will not (as in the past) be the same
as the local authority.

Transitional Arrangements
8. Under article 2 of the Local Government Reorganisation (Transitional
Provisions) Order 1985 (SI 1985 No 1781), London Borough Councils and
Metropolitan District Councils will acquire certain anticipatory pours,
including powers in respect of safety certificates for sports groun~
The provisions of SI 1985/1781 were explained in DOE circular LGA(L) J
(DOE) 13/LGA(MC)(DOE)16 of 26 November 1985. The Secretary of State
takes the view that Metropolitan County Councils and the GLC are not
empowered to issue new safety certificates or amend existing safety
certificates to take effect on or after I April 1986: SI 1985/1781
therefore allows successor authorities to consider, before I April,
applications for certificates to come into effect on or after I April.
Successor authorities will therefore wish to ensure that they are kept
informed of the progress of safety certificate applications or amend-
ments to existing certificates now under consideration by the Metro~
politan County Councils or GLC. Much of this information will auto-
matically have come to successor authorities in their present role as
building authorities but they may nonetheless wish to establish
early contact with the current ’certificating’ authority to ensure a
smooth transfer of responsibility from 1 April 1986 without impairing
the safety cover afforded by the certification process. In this
context successor authorities will no doubt wish to bear in mind
that applications for special safety certificates for events on or
after I April 1986 may require advance consideration if a certificate
is to be issued in time. Similarly~ successor authorities will doubtless
wish to be acquainted with any other action or initiatives currently
in hand by the present certificating authority in respect of sports
grounds in their area.

          Dear Sir,

          Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
          I enclose for your iolormation a Copy of my Eepor~ to the General Purposes Panel
          on 6th May, 1986, together with a copy of the Panel’s Resolution in relation to
          that Report.
          I would like to make the following comments in relation to the decision:-

          (a)      Al~hough it has been decided to carry on with the old administrative system
                   organised by the County Council I wish to make it clear that the system is
                   under review and may be adjusted in the future;

                   I will shortly write to the other District Councils in South Yorkshire with
                   a view to establishing a basis for consultation as described in the
                   Resolution;
, \
           (c) the re-drafting of the Certificate conditions will shortly be completed and
                   I will then be asking for your comments on them.

           If you have any questions to ask on this mat£er, please do not hesitate to
           contact Mr. Bownes on the number given below.

           Yours faithfully,

                                  Safety 0f.Sp0~ts Grounds Act 1975


      The Panel will recall     that a report was submitted to she Maruh 1986 Meeting

      =overlng the general safety of sports grounds legislation as it affects the City

      ~ouncil. This follow-up :aport aims to des! In de£all with the current

       " ~-r ~- ~=1 ~ ~ ~nhe~ined from the South Yorkshire County Council.

      There are 2 sports grounds currently subject to the leglslatlou - Sheffield

      Eednesday FooEball Club and Sheffield United Football Club; the 0wlerton Sports
      .F.
     ~’.~3ium is likely to be made subject to the leglsla~ion shortly.

~1     -~ield Wednesday Football Club - Eillsborough
      The Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited was designated as requiring a         /
      Safe~y Cer=ificate in August 1978 and such a Certificate was issued by the

      County Council on 21st December, 1979. The S~adlum is currently undergoinK

      major works which, when complete, will form a roof over the Spion Kop and thus

      substan£ial!y improve the accommodation for spectators°

      Sheffield United Football Club, Bramall Lane

      The Club was designated as requiring a certificate In Augus~ 1984 but to date

     ~- cer=ificate has no= been issued as there are outs=a=ding works to be

      c~Dleted. The County Council cook the view that the cer=iflca=e should only be
 issued as and when the Ground was up to the appropria=e safety s=a~dard and not

      before. This procedure effectively insured that the terms of the Safe=y

      Cer=ifica=e ware not breached as soon as it was issued. I= is hoped that the

      Council will be in a posi=ion to issue a certifica£e before the smart of =he

      1986/87 season.

      Owlerton Sports Scadium

      It is understood that the Home Secretary will shortly be designa=ing the S=adi’am

      as requiring a Safety Certificate in accordance with the Popplewell Report

      recommendations. It will, therefore, be necessary to arrange for a full

      inspection of the S~adium in the next few weeks to find out what works are
    2.
    going to be required to raise the standard of the Stadium to appropriate levels.

    The Panel is probably aware that the Stadium is Council owned but is currently

    leased to the Owlerton Sports Stadium Limited. This Lease will expire on Is=

    November, 1987.
    S~£ety Certificate Standard Conditions
    A= the moment the Safety Conditions attached to Safety Certificates are



    have ~ndicated that they would wish this situation to continue for reasons of

    administrative simplicity. The Conditions do, however, give some cause for

[-" concern, as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas. The

   Oafting of these Conditions is of particular importance as it is a serious
     criminal offence to ¢on:ravene any of them punishable by the Statutory Mmximum

     Fine (Currently E2,000) or 2 years imprisonment or both.


     It is proposed to re-draft the Certificate conditions, where appropriate, and to

     submi~ the= ~o the Panel for approval. The Sheffield Wednesday Certificate

     would then be replaced in accordance with Section 4 (i) (b) of the Act. The

     Sheffield Uci~-ed Certificate could then be issued with the new conditions before

     the start of the~ ~e re-drafted conditions would7 of course, be
     submit e          to SerVice, Police and             =llding Su eyor for /
    Oo~her au=hori=iesin South Yorkshire could also be involved" in this process.


         Existing Administrative Arrangements
         The County Council system for administering the Act is based on 2 main

         componenzs - (a) bi-annual inspections of the Stadium; and (b) meetings of an

         officer working party. The bi-annual inspections consist of representatives

         from all the interested authorities and involve thorough inspections of the

         Stadia and the identifying of any defects. These defects are at the time of the

         visit brought to the attention of the certificate holder and its technical

         representative if one is present. Depending on the nature of the faults found
     b

          (if any) steps are then agreed between the Authority and the Certificate Holder
             3.
             =o recuify =hem or so arrange ma=cers =ha= no risk to =he public occurs. The

             Working Paruy consists of represenuaUives from the Police, Fire Service,

             Building Surveyors and the County Council ~ i= considers in decaii various

             matters (such as the Spion Kop development a= Sheffield Wednesday Football

             Ground) and also any outstanding items from the bi-annual inspect!ons.       The

             Working Party is effectively a co-ordinating body which attempts co ensure chac

              a balanced and c0nsiscesc approach is main=ained to currest issues a£ the ~por~s
              Groun4s. Any recommendacious ic makes are subject co approval by this Panel.

              The Health and Safety Executive
      Q°.
              Recommendation 9 of The Popplewell Committee’s Interim Report read as follows
" Q’There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safe=y Executive and

              the Fire Authorities and Local Authorities as to how best to co-ordinate and
              communicate their inspections and reports’. Bearing this in mind the local

              office of the Health and Safety Executive was invited to par=icipate in the

              administrative sys=em for safety at spor~s grounds. This invica=ion was

              declined, The Executive will apparently take no direct par= in the

               Certification system.
               Is view of this problem =he Home Office was contacted and =he position

..°
               explained; it appears that negotiations are under way between the Home Office

            O and the HSE about Popplewe!l’s recommendation but as yet =here has been no

               useful outcome.
               In =hese circumstances the Council could keep =he Health and Safety Executive

               informed of all developments i= Sheffield and to invite their cozments on them.

                  It would then be =he responsibility of the Executive to decide whe=her or no= to

                  respond.

                  ~eas

                  The basis on which fees may be charged is set out in Regulation 14 of the Safety

                  of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 which states "14. A local authority may
                  determine the fees to be charged in respect of applications for the issue or




                                              .°
   amendment of safety certificates but such fees shall noC l= a particular case

    exceed an amount commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done." The

    South Yorkshire County Council did.~not fix any fees under the Ke=~ulation

    apparently as a matter of policy and the Panel is therefore asked to decide

    which of the following options to adopt:- (a) state as a matter of.policy that

    =o fees will be:charged in respect of Safety Of Spor~s Grounds legislation or

     (b)decide in principi~ co fix ~ees and to as~ r~ a ~eporu oac.~ on ~a= ~o~

     ~o thm Council.

 ..~_ Conclusion
~-"   The Panel is asked to:-
    ta) Note the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by =he

            County Council and authorise its continuation for the time being;

     (b)    Note the position of the Heal~h and Safety Executive and request the Head

            of Administration and Legal Department to keep the Executive informed of

            all matters relating to sports ground safety;

      (c)[~Request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to draft new

           Iil
            safe=y certificate conditions in consultation with the appropriate

           I!authorities approval by the Coun.il;
             Either resolve that no fees wil! be charged under the legislation or

             request the ~ead of Administration and Legal Department to report on the

    FROM:   Inspector Calvert
                                                    STATION~’B~T:   Hammerton Road
    TO:     The Chief Superintendent - ’F’ Div      DATE:           ii June 1986

            SUBJECT: POLICING - HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND

            I refer to the memorandum dated 8 May 1986, requesting suggestions
            from various Officers who have been intimately concerned with the
            policing at Hillsborough.

            The policing of the ground is by and large a fairly smooth affair
            but I believe that we could considerably enhance our efficiency
            with certain changes which could be made by the Club in their
            procedures.

            Inspector Creaser has highlighted various of these and all of them
            have been shown before when we have made approaches to the Club,
            in many cases with very little success. One of the greatest
            problems we have is access to-the ground, particularly at the
            Leppings Lane end. The redesigned turn stiles do not give any-
            thing like the access to the ground, either on the Leppings Lane
            terraces or in the West Stand, needed by away fans.

            On occasions la~ season when large numbers attended, we had away
            supporters who were justifyably irate because of the inefficiency
            of the system, which was turned on the police and could have
             resulted in public disorder.

            One of the points which is not mentioned is the access fcu home
            supporters at the Penistone Road end where ticket holders at major
            matches do not have sufficient turn stiles to allow smooth access.
            There is a gross lack of flexibility in the manner in which turn
            stiles operate at the Penistone Road end for the Spion Kop and
            the North Stand, which may well be aggrevated if more home fans
            decide to use the Kop now it is covered.

            I have in the past suggested at the Club that they look at the
            problems, both of allowing ticket holders easy access and stream-
            lining the entry for paying customers by using a number of ’correct
            money turn stiles’, as is the case at other grounds.

            Inspector Creaser mentioned my interest in the manner in which
            packing is carried out on the Leppings Lane terraces. The location
            of the crash barriers on these terraces at the entrances caused
            considerable congestion and I believe that in the event of emerg-
            ency evacuation, the location of these barriers would prevent
            access to the tunnels.

            I am aware that there is a statutory requirement as set out in
            the ’green book’ giving the number of barriers required in certain
            areas, but it may well be that now is the time to look at the
            positions of certain of the barriers with a view to alleviating
            the problems outlined above.

    The West Stand currently has a barrier giving approximately
    a third to away supporters. I was led to believe when this
    was located last year that facilities would be available at
    major matches to move it to give a greater proportion to that
    Stand to away supporters but I have heard nothing further

    Inspector Howland specifically mentions parade times and whilst
    certain serials are not deployed immediately, in particular those
    normally controlled by himself, they are available should they
    be required.

    Since the location of cameras at Hillsborough last year, it
    been apparent that the coloured cameras, whilst being extremely
    efficient in sunlight, are useless in poor light, ie night time
    or at the end of the match through most of the season. The
    location of a camera currently on the Kop will also require chang-
    ing and I suggest that an approach be made to the club to have
    a camera giving a view inside the newly covered Kop, and a second
    black and white camera on the top rear of the new stand giving
    a view of Penistone Road and Herries Road South, which would
    also be able to view the Leppings Lane island area.
O   I must echo the comments made by Inspectors Creaser, White and
    Sykes that the majority of problems as Hillsborough are as a result
    of the clubs inability to efficiently run their own affairs on
    match days.

REPORT ON HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

We spoke on the telephone about the front page article on my
Report in your last Sunday's edition.  I told you that although
the article claimed my report had been "leaked", its account of
the Report1s recommendations was wrong in a number of respects.
I said I would let you know what those were. They are as
follows:-

     i.    it is not true that the Report "questions ban on
           alcohol" (your headline);

     ii.   it is not true that the Report "calls for a review of
           the ban on alcohol sales at football matches" (column
           1 );
     iii. I did not mention "a sudden surge from the pubs"
          (column 1);

     iv.   I did not say of perimeter fences that "adequate exits
           should be provided in future" (column 1). An immediate
           proposal is not that "wider and more gates in perimeter
           fences" be provided (column 4). I expressly say in my
           Report that I make no recommendations now about the
           structure of perimeter fences but will do so in my
           Final Report;

     v.    I did not criticise the lack of training given to
           senior police officers in football crowd control and I
           did not mention Bramshill (column 4).
The fact that in its third column the article says "Taylor's
immediate proposals are understood to include" (my underlining)
suggests to me that, contrary to the assertion in the first
column, "the Report" was not leaked. Otherwise the words "are
understood to" would be inappropriate.

I am sure you appreciate that I have many difficulties in this
Inquiry, which of course continues after the Interim Report.
Misreporting does not help. Following your article last week
there may well be some who will continue to believe, for example,
that I am in favour of alcohol sales at football grounds.  I have
expressed no such view. What should be done, if anything, about
pre-match drinking is, as I said in the Interim Report, an issue
I shall address at stage two.

I hope, therefore, that you will print a suitable correction on
Sunday next.

  At this         time     there were m o u n t e d         officers,             but    I cannot          say

  the    grounds.

  Together         with     other members            of the C & V un j C I^ran                    inside

  the    g r o u n d . We       had to shout at and              p h ^ n c ^ tly        move     people

  who were         standi ng       on the steps           d^^/access                    to the    field.

 On entering             the     field,     I saw                1 hundred fans                on the

  field.         Man y     police     of f i y f r j / ' we r e al ready      present.            I

  thought         it was a nornjirf/case of                 pitch     invasion and so formed

  a cordon on the J ^ f l d                near    to the       per imeter          t rack .

 After a sjhyiH^C^fii 1 e I left                   the    cordon and started directing

  people         to sit     down on the           perimeter        track.

F o l lo wi ng   this     I saw several         fans     c 1 imh^^fg over        the      fence

from the         terraces.        It seemed       sti l T l o       be a pitch       invasion

during w h i c h     several       fans     had s u s t a i n e d    injury.       I went        to

the ai d     of several          fans who were         lying        on the    field,        putting

them    into      recovery       positions and         checking        their     levels         of

re s p o n s iveness.       When they        r e covered      I directed         them to the

perimeter        track     to sit down,          so that we          could get a better

picture      of what was          happening.          There was so m u c h           confusion.

I was    to the      right       of the goal,         looking       towards L e p p i n g s Lru

I could      not    see muc h of what was              h a p pening      on the other

side.      Too man y       people were         rushing about?            several       fans and

Pol i c e O f fi ce rs     started to        break, the adve r t i s i ng boards

and using         them as stretchers.               The y were        br i1 1 i a n t .

One mi d d l e a g e d man a p p r o a c h e d me and stated he was a

Charge N u r s e , offering           his    servi c e s .      I d i r e c t e d him to

several      people       lying on the         field.

I approached         one youth        lying      on the     field.        His    eyes       were

rolled     into     the    ’back    of his h e a d 5 and he was foaming at

the mouth.          I spoke       to him to a s c e r t a i n        if he was okay.

He said,         "Fuck    off,    leave me alone,            I ’m alright".            He

smelled      strongly       of drink.          I a d v i s e d him     regarding          his

position         so that    he    could breathe          properly.

F ol lo wi ng    this     the Notts.        Forest     fans at        the S p i o n end of

the G r ou nd s ta r t e d jeering at the Liverpool                       fans and this

a n g er ed them and several              L i v erpool    fans      charged towards

the Kop.          I gave    chase and grab b e d          hold of two youths,

shaking      them and saying,             “W h a t ’s it going         to achieve,

there are         people    dying".         Fortunately         they     listened and

returned to help those                injured.

We were      then orde r e d to form a cordon efts the halfway                              line

        After      being        there     for a p p r o x i m a t e l y   two minutes         it became

              ■oached several              peojj^e lying          on the ground,             checking

          ilses etc.             We went        from one to another              to    see if      we

        could      render        a s sistance.          We a p p r o a c h e d one man lying            on

        his back?          it    was     obvious       that he was dead.               All we      could do

        was    lift      him     into a m a k e s h i f t stretcher           and      he was      moved

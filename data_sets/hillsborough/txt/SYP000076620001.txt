               I am a married man living ^t the above address.



               On Saturday    15         1989 ( 150489 )^ N ^ n t      to Hillsborough                  (Sheffield

               Wednesdays football ground)          for the FA CupXsemi            final between Livepool

               and Nottingham Forest football          clubs.       I am a\|_^verpool fan and a

               season ticket holder.         It was by virtue of this that I got my ticket

               from Anfield



               I travelled with                                            and                              , all

              mates from a local      pub.        We travelled in my car a Cortina 2.01t.                                   I

               drove the car.      We left                         at about 9.30am                  (0930)        that

              morning.    We stopped at a supermarket            in Fintwistle on the way to get

               some   cans of beer.      We went by motorway to Stockport then down a main
                                                                                       PAGE        2
                                                                                       S2088

      road straight to Sheffield.             We d i d n ’t experience any hold-ups,       in

      the traffic.         We arrived at Sheffield about        10.45am <1045) and parked

      in a side street near to the Float           pub and railway station.           The pub

      was    closed.     We walked down to the ground,         it only took us a few

      minutes,    just to check our route to the turnstiles.              We decided to

      get something to eat and a taxi driver told us that the Beehive                     pub

      was open and       showed us the way.        It took us abotH^ten minutes to          get

      there.      The    only policemen I saw at this time was .a^KsOuple near the
                                                              ej   ^
      turnstiles.         Anyway we went into the BeeiTi^e pub about VT.30 ( 1130)

       When we got       in there,   there was a few^is^erpo\l      fans in t h e r e .     We

      had a couple       or three pints and left there about 2.05pm          (1405).        When

      we left there was quite a few Liverpool            fans still   in the pub.         We

      had a steady walk down to the ground,                ere was one or two Policemen
                                                                     Z.
      on our route down to the ground.                only saiANj.hree Policemen on the

      outside of the turnstiles and they were^sfn horseback.                  When we got to

      the outer metal       gates me arTeL,                  got separated from the other

      two.      There was no queues at theN^urnst i les at all.              The outer metal

      gates we>£\open and       it was just a mass ofNaeople ,          I reckon we got to

      gates about 2.>Q~2.15 (14 10-1415).             I stood i>Kthj.s crush for 40-45

      minutes.         I got 'to within six foot of turnstiles that were on my left

      this was for the West Stand seating fans.                I climbed up on a metal

      fere^e/wall and tried to inch my way toward these turnstiles                     I felt
Sb£   H
      the wall start to move so I jumped back down from where I came                        I

      was still about 5-6 yds away from the turnstiles where                 I was

      supposed to enter - the Leppings Ln s t a r i t u r n s t i l e s .       The

      pressure here was bad,         but   I could breath.    Thf's. would be about 3

      o'clock    (1500).    The pressure eased off as most of % h e mass of people

      were    rotjhqd to the right of the turnstiles.           I grabbers       and moved

      towards the Ntsur\)st i 1 es when I got to them I saw that the gate to my

      left was open about six foot.             Me and       went in through this gate
                                                                                       PAGE          3

        with loads of others.            Once   inside thks gate we followed the crowd

        through some gates to our right and headed\for the tunnel                 under the

        West Stand.       On the approach to this tunnel            3><yd n 't see any signs

        showing me w h e r e \ ^ g o .     I ^ i d n ’t see any   Policemen or stewards about

        either.     We entered ra>s tunnel and started moving towards the pitch.

        When we first got      in the tunnel        it wasn't too bad everyone was jogging

        toward the pitch.        About two yards from the exit to the tunnel we

        came to a halt and then the pressure built up from behind.                   We inched

   Mr   forward and moved round to the left.                When we came out of the tunnel

6f\T    I could see Liverpool       players on the pitch but I can't say if the

        match was being played or not.              We continued inching down the

        terracing    I could hear        people down the front screaming so I tried to

        stop and turn round but I. co uld n’t I just kept moving forward.                 I got

        about half way down the terracing and came to a complete stop.                    I

        could move,     I found it difficult to breathe and I could hear the

        people    in front still    screaming.         I was stood next to a huge man -

        17-18 stone and 6'3.             It was oppressive and I could breathe,       this big

        bloke said he couldn't stand it anymore and he pushed through to the

        left hand sectional       fencing.        I managed to follow him,           wouldn't

        and is.di dn ’t see him again till I was going h o m e . N. I climbed up on
              \                                                          -
        top of the fence and was helped down the other side (pen 5) by a

        steward and a St Johns Ambulance man.                 1 made my way to the front of

        the terrace and went ttjrough the open gate onto the pitch.  I had to
                                \
        sit on the pitch for aboutNjo minutes to get my breath back.   Then I

        got back to the back of the goa-ls.               I climbed up the perimeter

        fencing and hung over       into the c^r oy d .      There was a couple of us on

             fencing.      y e lifted two or threeNav^r the fence and passed them

        to a Policemen on the track.              Then I got down and helped rip up the

        hoardings to make stretchers.              Shortly after     I found                   and

        we went back into the crowd on the wings.                 We left the ground about

          did it of my own accord.       I would like to say that there should have

          been an announcement made on the tannoy system,     letting everyone know

          what was happening.      I also would question the communications system

          between the outside Police and inside Police.

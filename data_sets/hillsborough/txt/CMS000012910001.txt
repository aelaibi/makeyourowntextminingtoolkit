SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS: BUILDING REGULATIONS

1.     You asked Mr Lee for advice on the attached press cutting
about the evidence submitted by the Sports Council to the
Hillsborough Inquiry.
2.     I confirm that the article accurately reflects the thrust
of the views submitted by the Sports Council on the application
of building regulations to safety certificates issued for sports
grounds.
3.     Mr Lee sought views on the article from Mr Mould at the
Home Office.   Mr Mould has advised that the Sports Council's
assertions are a little misleading since under section 3(3) of
the Safety at Sports Grounds 1975 Act a local authority is
required to consult the building authority (and the police) about
the terms and conditions to be included in a safety certificate.
Moreover, section 5(3) 1975 provides a building authority with a
right of appeal to a Magistrate's Court if it is dissatisfied
with any of the terms and conditions of a certificate.
4.     While in London the GLC was both the building and local
authority elsewhere it was the upper tier local authorities who
were responsible for administering the 1975 Act when it was first
introduced, with the borough or district councils acting as the
building authority.    Following the abolition of the GLC and
metropolitan county councils in 1986,         responsibility for
administering the Act was devolved to the London borough council
and metropolitan district councils. Accordingly, the statutory
consultation and appeal rights outlined above became unnecessary
in these areas.    The position in the shire counties (and in
Scotland) remained unchanged.
5.     These circumstances suggest that when issuing a safety
certificate a local authority will be appraised of any relevant
requirements contained in the building regulations and will be
able to impose these through a certificate should it consider
this necessary.     I have asked why there is no mandatory

already explained that originally DOE wanted a "statutory bar" to
                       1975 Act but accepted the "compromise"
solution of statutory consultation and associated appeal rights.

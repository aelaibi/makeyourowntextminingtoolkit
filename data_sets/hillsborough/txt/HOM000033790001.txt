Dear Mr Pugh,

Hillsborough Football Stadium Disaster, 1989

Thank you very much for your letter of 20 November 1997 concerning the BBC s video tapes of
events on the day of the Hillsborough Disaster. As I think you will be aware, these tapes have
always been considered by the BBC to be extremely sensitive and copies have not generally been
made available, even to the families of those directly involved, save in exceptional circumstances.

 That being the case, I am referring your letter to the BBC’s Controller of Editorial Policy, Philip
 Harding, and either he or I will let you have a substantive response as soon as possible.

 Youis sincerely,




 Solicitor  ^

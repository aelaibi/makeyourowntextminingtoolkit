                   can't    say which       route we took but we were held up in very heavy

                  traffic     on the m ot or w ay just outside Shef&i'eld,                   also on a rr iv ing      in

                  At about 2 . 3 0 pm 1430 we           parked our     car     in a little side street about

                   10 minutes walk from the ground.                  I d o n ’t know the name of the              street,

                  D uring    our walk to the ground              I saw the ojga. supporter            drinking    beer

                  from     cans    but    1 never saw any signs         of/dis or de r       fighting    or

                 perimeter     gates and ever^dne            ran in singing,           running    towards    the

                 turns tiles!         There w e r e n ’t any supporters          in the area       in front       of the

    °ls          turnstiles,      th^tj/^were some Police             in front       of the turnstiles.            I

                 h a d n ’t got a clue where         to go    into the ground so            I showed one of the

                 p oliceman my ticket and a sked him where                     to go,    he said    "round the          side

                 son.”

                 I went ar o u n d the side        of the terrace            turnstiles and went        into the

                 ground through a large open gate.

                 I never    handed my ticket          in,    there was nobody there              to take    it.

                 I r ecognised L. player Alan HANSON on the                     pitch.      I knew then that            the

                 and work my way down          into fjen 3 but then             I was just       pushed forward

                 until    I was       pushed up agai nst a metal             crush barrier, w hich I         w ou ld say

         W hen     I first got onto            the terraces,          a lt ho u gh    it was    very     packed and            I

         was      being    crushed a little,               it was   no different          than being          on the kop

         at Anfield.

         But      then very quickly            in a space         of no more         than 2 minutes           it became

         very bad,         the    crush incre ased and when                 I finally ended up aga inst                   the

         crush barrier            I could hardly breath,               the    pressure was that               intense.

         My arms were            pinned behind my back and                  I couldn't move any part                 of my

         body there were             people      screaming all ar ou nd me.

         My chest was            trapped up against              the barrier and          I. could feel myself

         going        light   headed as        the breath was          being s qu eezed out of me.

         There was a man to the                  left     I think     he was,        I c o u l d n ’t say what       he

         looked        like but he dropped and as he fell                      I was able to move and got a

         gulp of air           in the space         created.

         When      I got rny breathe           back       I was able      to scream at a man             in front         of

         me.       he was      in front      of the barrier and was                        to turn around.                I

         sc reamed at him to               lift my foot w hi ch hs^ffid and as he did so                         I just

         popped up above             the    crowd.

         As    I got above         the     crowd    peopij^sort        of    pushed me forwards above                 their

         heads      to the       perimeter       fei

         I think a P o l ic em an th .o jf dragged me over the fence and                            I ran straight

         o n to    the    p i t c h w i th >a n ot h er   lad,    there     were     people    l ying    on   the    track

         by the       fence a n d / D e h i n d the g o a l .

         The      game was    being played, /n e and this other lad ran onto the

         people dead and to stop the ygarne, he turned and                                looked,       his   face went

         wh i t e .

         As soon as other              people/jo t         onto the    pitch the m atch was stopped

         I c a n ’t recall         seeing yfny Police             in the a rea around the entrance                    to

         the      tugne"! as      I entemd         the ground or any stewards.

         Also      between entering            the ground or at any other time                     I never       saw any

signs     of disorder,,           I never       saw anyone      consuming alcohol         inside    the

gru and.

Although        I was    in pen 3 I was           not aware      of any    crush barrier

collapsing        until well        after       the tragedy when we went             back onto the

terraces        to go out at about              4pm   1600.

w hen    I was    involved        in the       crush on the terraces         I was on my own,         I

had been split           up from my friends when they opened up the outer

perimeter        gates,     because     everyone was          charging     forwards     to get     into

the ground.

I never        saw any     crowd surge,          there wasn't      the    room for a surge,         people

were    too tightly         packed together.                                  it/

I s u stained      .injuries on the terraces,                 my arms ^ r e         pinned behind my

back    stuck     between      people      bodies and also         I/was    crushed up again*




A lt ho u gh    I believe      peodfe died aro un d me            in the    terraces,      I am unable

to describe any            persojf who         I believed may have died or any specific

circumstances           of a n y d e a t h .

Once     I had first        gat    on the       pitch   I was    trying    to find my mates,         when

I c o u l d ’t find them          I went       up to many     individual     people who were         on

the     pitch crying and d i st re ss ed to see                 if I could help.

I found one boy,            he w ou ld have only been about                10 years      old,   sitting

by the g&al,        he was        crying       his eyes out,      I a s ke d him what was the

matter,        he said     “My dad's       in there,      he's    dead."     I carried this         boy

                 over    to a policewoman and said to her                  "Can you get a grip of this                      lad"

                 but    she just     looked at me sort of a blank                look     like what       do you expect

                 me    to do,    I couldn't        believe    it.

                 One    thing    I would say        which     Ithink may have          been a factor        in the

                 deaths    or    injured,     is    that when       I got out onto the pitch the gates                       in

                 the    fences     h a d n ’t been opened and you          could see all          the    people       being

                 crushed up against           the fencing,          also when tfo^y were opened they

                 weren't a lot of good              because they are are small-

                 Also    I think what       the     tragedy all      stj^mmed from was         the    lack of      control

                 outside     the ground,       the a bse nc e ojr any orderly queues also                    the fact

                 that a lot of        people       could have/got       in without        having a ticket.              I
         i
                 think    it could have        been a v er t ed had there          been more organisation,

                 1 left the ground through thj tunnel                    at about 4pm          1600 of my own

   %             accord.

                 As we were walking           out    towards       the tunnel    through the terraces                 I saw a

                 bloke    hitting a younger           bloke.        I think    he was     shouting at him you"re

                 robbing     or something          like    that.     I thought     the younger          bloke    had

                 picked something          up off the        terraces.        I also    saw a photographer              being

                 hit    by Liverpool       fans     but    the Police    stepped       in and stopped           it.

                 I can only        remember    seeing a couple          or J p r e e   a m b u l a n c e s , these w e r e n ’t

                 sufficient medical           people       to assist J m e    amount      of   people who were

                 i njured.

                 Also    a lt ho ug h a lot of Police wa^F e helping               o u t , there were a large

                 amount    lined up across           the pitifh for a very long time just not                         doing

                 I think     the    best   people     handling       the si tu at io n were the fans,             they

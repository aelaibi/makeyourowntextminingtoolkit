I am grateful to you and Charles Hughes for explaining to myself and
Home Office colleagues    last Wednesday exactly where   you were in
implementing the "Blueprint" and in particular on those matters which
are relevant to Taylor implementation.

I know that both Roger Miles from the Home Office and John de Quidt
from the FLA together with myself or Tony Baden would find it very
helpful to attend a presentation by your consultants of how you
devised the proposed plan for the development of stadia in accordance
with Taylor requirements. I know that the FLA in particular would find
this very helpful and I understand that John de Quidt would like to
bring along several of his inspectors.

I would therefore be grateful if this could be arranged and a mutually
convenient time agreed.

As we said at our meeting it is clearly in everyone's interest if in
developing your stadia development plan the FLA can be involved
together with the Football Trust so that we have as far as possible an
agreed costed strategy to implement Taylor. I was therefore pleased to
hear at our meeting that a meeting was being arranged between yourself
and the FLA which might provide the opportunity to discuss how to take
this matter forward.

I am copying this letter to Roger Miles and John de Quidt.

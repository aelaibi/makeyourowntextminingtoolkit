                                                                               jecto'r PHENIX.

             My duties were to be 0G20 in company with PC                                                                of West

             Yorkshire Police Dog Section.                            We were to patrol Penistone Road

             North,        paying particular attention to the entrance to the South Stand

              car park at Highbridge, Parkside Road and Catchfoar Lane,                                              extending tj

             Bradfield Road as required to assist 0GS2 in that locat:

              D E N T ).



              At 1000 am (1000)               that date we commenced patrol.                              In order to

              effectively cover our designated patrol areas it was necessary to

              occasionally travel along Leppings Lane, Herries Road and Herries Road
                                                                      PAGE
                                                                      S3804

South, as well as occasionally straying onto iiiddlewood Road.



There was a steady build up of supporters throughout the morning with

movement of fans towards the ground but also back towards city.            All

was good natured.



At about 1230 pm (1230) a* a result of radio messages we began to

monitor the Royal Hot*Tl at the junction of Bradfield Road and

Penistone Road.        large number of Nottingham supporters were     inside

and an equally large number were outside on the footpaths,        drinking

from glasses,   bottles and cans.    Four PC's and a Sergeant were posted

across the road to monitor the situation although at that time,

although boisterous,   all was good natured.



Numbers of fans moving along Penistone Road was increasing and it was

apparent that a large proportion of the crowd either had been,        or

indeed still were drinking.     Cans and bottles were being carried

openly and groups were sat around drinking.       At about 1.35pm (1335) a

radio message was received to the effect that two Special Constables

were   in difficulty somewhere along Penistone Road towards Hillfoot

Bridge.    We patrolled along that road in search of the specials but

without success.     At least three other^p-atis in that area were open

and large numbers of boisterous NoSrxs. fans were drinking outside and

also apparently inside.     H^^ir'fsg worked other big games at

Hillsborough in the past I was surprised by the number of pubs open

and serving fans.      It was also apparent that local off-licences

around Middlewood Road/Catchbar Lane and the ground area were serving

the fans with alcohol.



At 1.40pm <1340) a radio message was received from the Sergeant
                                                                            PAGE    3
                                                                            S3804

stationed at the Royal Hotel      that the crowd outside were becoming

hoslflle and that one bottle had been thrown across the road towards

 he Officers.      We attended within seconds anti spoke with the Sergeant

who said that the Licensee had been outsjrae to say that the fans

inside were    ’smashing the place u p V a n d    he had requested further

assistance, and directed us to jfwait their arrival.             I would estimate

there was at least 200 fdJBa^outside the Royal Hotel.            The area was

covered with glasses,     cans and bottles and other smaller groups were

across the road from the pub also drinking.             The re was a great deal

of noise coming from within and the ai-ace was obviously packed to

bursting.     A large proportion^cTf this number were still drinking from

cans and bottles.       On ap^'ival of other Officers the pub was emptied

and the fans moved away towards the ground.            The pub I believe,     was

closed and staff began to clear up outside.             The fans were still on

the whole good natured.



We resumed patrolling our points at about 2.20pm           (1420) and the

vicinity of the ground was extremely busy.            Still   large numbers of

the Notts,    fans were drinking on their way to the ground,         and there

was also movement of fans along Parkside Road onto Leppings L a n e .

From the radio I was aware that at about 2.33pm           (1435) Leppings Lane

was closed to traffic.



Catchbar Lane and Middlewood Road was heavy with fans, a large

proportion of whom were drinking and just standing around in groups.

Numerous radio messages were being received in respect of the crush

taking place at the Leppings Lane turnstiles.



At about 3pm (150Q) a radio messagendas           received that all dog sections

were to enter the ground via /Sa*e 0.            We attended from Parkside Road
                                                                              PAGE    4
                                                                              S3S04

and were directed with dogs onto the tunnel between the North Stand

and the Spion Hop.      We were directed to remain there.            I could see

fans were running around the playing area.           We were being spat on

from the Notts,   fans above us in the ‘Spion Kop.         Gradually

casualties were being brought off the pitch area via that tunnel and

we were directed to stand by outside the ground with our vehicles.

We returned to Penistone Road North,      Gate 0.       We assisted in holding

back fans who were attempting to enter the ground through Gate 0 as

ambulances were being reversed into the ground.            At this point PC

           and I became separated.      I believe he returned into the

ground to assist ambulance staff, without his dog, and I remained

outside the ground.



At about 3.30pm (1530) we were directed by radio back onto the pitch

with dogs.     Myself and a number of o t h D o g     Section Officers were

deployed by Chief Super i nterydent   UE£>BlT   in a line behind the Spion Kop

goal.     Some fighting b r o k ^ cmjr Ln the North Stand around the half way

line and a number of dogs were re-directed to move to the perimeter

track facing that stand.      I remained behind the Spion Hop goal.



At about 4.30pm (1630) we were directed back to our phase three

points,   ours being Parkside Road/Penistone Road.             We took that

position and monitored the crowd leaving, which on the whole was

subdued and quiet.

At about 4.45pm   (1645) a radio message was       r&tfeived    of fighting    in

Hillsborough Park.      We attended on^-foQ^/with dogs,         but were overtaken

by Mounted Officers.      The fight was at the Middlewood Road end of the

park and was broken up by Mounted.
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                S3804

At 5.05pm (1705) we were recalled to fighting in the park.                    Again it

appeared to be at the Middlewood Road end of the park and we could

play no part.      We continued duties with other officers,           directing

traffic and attempting to clear a way through for Hospital staff and

emergency service vehicles.



At about 6.30pm (1830)    traffic had cleared and we were called to

Niagara.    En route PC               visited the Hillsborough Gym with a

personal   cassette handed to him having been found on the pitch.                 We

were on standby at Niagara until stood down at 7.30pm             (1930) and went

off duty at 8pm (2000).



I have been present at other    ’Big     M a t c h e s ’ at Hillsborough in    the past

both as Dog Section and Uniform.          In general the policing of           the game

appeared to be as the normal    plan.        However, I was amazed at the

drinking taking place amongst thefans, most of which that               I was

involved with being Notts,    fans.      In the past local      pubs have

remained closed,    or merely admitted regulars via rear doors,               but on

this date many seemed open as usual and indeed packed out.                    Local off

licences appeared to be serving to fans, and I cannot recall ever

having seen drinking amongst fans in the vicinity of a game to that
                    C A T   /V v C O f f C V     ^
degree.   In general there was a relaps'd holiday spirit, but a good

proportion were drunk or had Jbeejj^clrinking heavily.

           Further to my previous report;          whilst on standby outside     'Gate O ’ in

           Penistone Road,    I assisted in gaining access          into the ground by

           ambulances.      As soon as the gates were opened by ground staff a

           number of small groups were attempting to enter the ground,

           effectively blocking access to the ambulances.               With other officers I

           kept the gates clear for ambulances to enter and leave the ground,

           whilst other officers cleared traffic whilst the ambulance vehicles

           manoeuvred in order to reverse into the ground.              I remained on that

           duty for several minutes until Dog Section were directed back into the

           ground and onto the pitch.



           Due to the nature of the incident I am unable to give an exact time

           for the above duty, although it was approximately between 3.10 pm

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - QUESTIONS TO DR EASTWOOD

Where possible these questions are related to the relevant paragraphs in
Dr Eastwood's statement.

Para 14:   Were you consulted in the preparation of     the Guide?

           Did you ever use the 1973 version of the Guide?

Para 20: What did you know of the history of the crush barriers on the West
         Terrace when you took over responsibility?

           Did you know what material the barriers were made from?

Para 27: What account was taken of gaps in the lines of barriers?

           Did these gaps comply with the Guide?

Para 29: Were these gaps in the lines of barriers taken into
         consideration in calculating the capacity of the West Terrace?

Para 31: How       can you be sure that barriers 128    and 137 werebent during
& 109    the incident on 15 April 1989?

           Were the barriers inspected for damage after each game?

Para 32: Do you have a written procedure for the testing of barriers?

           How are your operatives trained?

           How is the degree of corrosion assessed?

           What criteria are applied to determine when corrosion is excessive

           Do you apply any acceptance criteria in addition to those in
           the Guide?

           Do you consider that your test method is suitable for barriers
           with wrought iron tubes? Have you done any calculations of
           collapse load?

           Have you had discussions with other companies which test
           barriers?

Para 33: How is deflection measured?

           What is the accuracy of deflection measurement?

           Is the deflection of each span measured?

Para 36: Why were five yearly tests specified rather than four yearly,
         as recommended in the Guide?
Para 40: Was there anything unusual about the test results from barrier
& 113    124A in 1988?

          In what condition was barrier 124A after the test in 1988?

          Was the horizontal tube permanently deformed?

          Was the degree of corrosion assessed?

          After the 1988 tests you recommended replacement the rails on
          barriers 144 and 133, why was 124A not recommended for repair?

Para 45: When the radial fences were planned how was the capacity of
         each individual pen calculated?

.         Were any barriers split   into two e .g by removing one span
'         at this stage?

          And, if so, why?

Para 109:You also tested barrier 136 on Sunday 16 April, what happened
         the first time a force of 6kN/m was applied?

          Was there any permanent deformation?

          When a force of 6kN/m was first applied to barrier 128 was
          there any permanent deformation?

          What did you deduce from these tests about the forces to which
          these barriers had been subjected prior to your tests on 16th?

Others:   Did you modify your test procedure when the Guide was re-issued
          in 1986?

          Did you ever measure the heights of the barriers in pens 3 and 4?
HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - NOTES ON QUESTIONS TO DR EASTWOOD

Para 14: There was a suggestion, by Supt Taylor, that Dr Eastwood had
         been consulted during formulation of the Guide.

         Dr Eastwood does not acknowledge the 1973 Guide in his statement.
         In this version the crush barrier test calls for one load
         application only.

Para 20: The design of the "old" barriers suggests that they were
         considerably more than 20 years old. I would have expected
         a competent person to consider the materials from which the
         barriers were made before devising/applying a test procedure.

Para 27: Allowable gaps in the lines of barriers are given in the Guide
  29     (paras 114 and 115, 1986 version) and, where these gaps exceed
         the requirements, the capacity should be reduced (para 226, 1986
         Guide)

Para 31: Barriers 128 and 137 could have been bent during a previous match.
& 109
         Barriers should be examined after each event (para 39, 1986 Guide)

Para 32: I would expect a competent person to have a written procedure
         for carrying out crush barrier tests. Other companies have
         written procedures in order to ensure consistency and
         repeatability.

         The Eastwood barrier test reports indicate that barriers
         are rejected occasionally on the basis of excessive corrosion.
         This is highly subjective and ought to accompanied by residual
         thickness measurements and a design appraisal.

         Other companies, being not entirely happy with the barrier test
         procedure in the Guide, have added additional requirements e.g.
         a maximum allowable deflection irrespective of recovery. Other
         companies also test the vertical members in addition to the
         horizontal tubes.

         The yield stress of wrought iron is so unpredictable that some
         permanent deformation of the tube could occur during testing.
         This would reduce the capacity for further plastic deformation and
         introduce the possibility of strain age embrittlement (brittle
         failure under impulsive loads).

         Two other companies that test barriers have been contacted
         during the Inquiry. One appears to carry out tests in accordance
         with the 1973 version of the Guide (a single application of force)
         and the other interprets the Guide to mean that one test
         consists of three applications of force and deflections are
         measured from the original datum position. The latter is consistent
         with HSE's understanding of the current procedure but differs
         from the interpretation apparently adopted by Dr Eastwood. The
         latter carries out three tests, each consisting of one
         application of force, and the datum is re-established after the
         removal of each force. This point is critical since HSE's
         interpretation of Eastwoods 1988 data indicate that barrier 124A
         would have failed the first test and a re-test (3 more applications
         of force) was therefore required.
                Deflection under load   =   36mm                      *

                Permanent deflection    -    17mm
                Elastic deflection      -    19mm
                % recovery              -    53%

Para 33: These questions were put to Dr Eastwood by Mr James (HSE) and the
         answers were not satisfactory. I would expectthat the deflection
         of each span would be measured at itsmid-point. It is hard to
         believe that the Eastwood method is capable of accuracies better
         than ,Â±lmm

Para 36: Dr Eastwood's statement does not give a reason why the
         recommendation of the Guide was not followed.

Para 40: The notes under Para 32 are relevant here also.
  113    The amount of permanent deflection exhibited by span 1/2
         on barrier 124A during the test in 1988 was 17mm. Only barrier
          144 was worse than this and Dr Eastwood recommended that the tube
         be replaced.

         The tube on barrier 133 was described as "badly corroded" and
         was replaced, yet no comment was made about the condition of 124A.

         Dr Eastwood's statement that barrier 124A passed the test
         "very satisfactorily" is highly questionable.

Para 45: The capacity of each individual pen should have been calculated
         when the radial fences were installed. There is no indication
         in Dr Eastwood's statement of how this was done.

         The capacities of 1200 and 1000 for pens 3 and 4 respectively,
         shown on Eastwood's drawings, would have been optimistic even
         if the gaps in the lines of barriers had complied with the Guide.

         The numbering and position of the barriers suggests that 136 &
         136A, and 124 & 124A, may originally have been joined.
         Separation may have been achieved by removal of one span and, if this
         was the case, then a gap in excess of the guide requirement was
         created.

Para 109:Eastwood's report on the tests carried out on Sunday 17 April
         suggests that barriers 136 and 128 deformed permanently the
         first time they were loaded. This indicates either that some
         deterioration occurred since the last test or that the tests
         have poor repeatability.

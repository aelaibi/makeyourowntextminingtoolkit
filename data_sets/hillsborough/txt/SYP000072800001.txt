I left        hoare at        about        9.30pm and              picked          the       others        up at a b o u t             10.15am,

from       the      police          to    t he      ground.        There were              a    lot     of P o l i c e           about

Thjrqueues          were         controlled and                 quite            orderly.             Obviously           I had         great

difficulty          entering               the    ground and                never         got    n ear      the     turnstiles.                   I

never      saw     the      main       gate       of L e p p i n g s         Lane         to    the     turnstiles               get    opened

were      obviously          restless,              they w a n te d              to g et        in.      The Police               officer             I

This      would     have         beeg/^bout             2 . 5 5 p m.         I cannot            describe           the      gate       at       all,

except         it w a s     s & H id and          barred.              It w a s         t he     g a t e t h at     l e ad s      off

turnstile          and      I did          not    sur/^nder             my       ticket.           There       was      no       cha n c e .

hard      to    describe,             it all        happened            so       quick.          Whilst        outside            the       ground

I did      not w i t n e s s          any    unauthorised                   entry         to    the     ground.           I cannot

remember         the      course           I took       o nce      through              the     gate     I h a v e mecrtTioned.

The     first      thing         I knew was             that       I     was          going      d o w n a tunjcd-? 1 to the a r e a

I can      hardly         remember           where          I went          once        I got     out       the     other         end       of    the         j

disappeared.                 I had        not       seen any             stewards           at all.          The       tunnel      was

heavily        c o n g e s t e d as          I came           down       it.        Once     I came         out    the       tunnel        I

only    remember             goijjfg f o r w a r d .              If     I went       in a n y       d i r e c t i o n at all           it was

possibly          s1i          1y    right.

As    soon a s e n t e r e d                 t he      pe n    I recall             seeing        the      players       on     the

pitch warming                up.        That        is      the     last        chance        I had        to see a n y t h i n g        of

what    was       happening             on    the        pitch.           I     did     not       know     whether           the g a m e       ever

started.

As    s o o n as       I passed           through             the      tunnel         I was       j us t    carried          forward           by a
  c •Surce
surge o f 1people                 almost          to     the      perimeter            fence       by the         pitch.          The       pen

was    packed          soli d.          I had          no     control          over     my m ov ement             at a l l.        My       legs

seemed      to     get       tangled          up a n d         I j us t        got     carried          forward.

From     entering            through          the        gate       to    entering           the     pens        took    only a matter

of    a few       seconds.

I had     so      little          chance          t h at      I cannot          say whet he r              people       were      consuming

alcohol        in the          ground.              When       I entered              the    pert I sa w          no    disorder            as

such     j us t    a    crush        of      people.              I did         not w i t n e s s a n y           barriers break                   and

I could        not      say wh et h er              I was         stood         n ear      one.

I have      indicated               on a g r i d w h e r e               I may        have    started            off    in the        pen a n d

where     I ended            up     but      as     I say         I am        not     certain.             I can       produce        this          as

an    exhibit          (Ex.       No.                    ) (Ex.          Ref.                 ).        When      I initially

entered        the      pen       I was       w i t h b u t                     we     very       quickly         got    split        up.

As    s o o n as       we    got     in the            pen     I knew          something           was      badly wrong.                I

tried     to m a k e         my w a y        to a g a t e           t h at     I could        s ee      behind         the     goa l.          I

could     not      get       to     it.       It w a s         so      p ac k e d .     As    s o o n as         I entered          the        pen

I found        it d i f f i c u l t          to     breathe            but w a s       powerless            to    do a n y t h i n g        about

it.      I was         ju st      intent          on s u r v i v i n g .              I would        sa y    that as           I went

forward        in the          pen      people           were       collapsing              all    r o u n d me.         I cannot

remember          or    describe             them,          it was ^d^Tt              total       chaos.          Within        the     space

of a m i n u t e        or     two      I started              t^^ass           out.         It w a s       hot    in the         pens,

can s a y           very       little about             what    was      happening          elsewhere             as    I was        just

trying          to       stay alive.

From       the       t im e     I started          to    pass    out      I h|<*e a         very       vague        recollection

of w h a t          happened.              I very       soon    bec^rtfie u n c o n s c i o u s        and      have      no

recollection                   of    time    at    all.

Al l    I remember                  is    passing       out    near      to    the       perimeter         fence        at     the       fro n t

of     the      pen.          At     one    stage       I came     round        to       some    ex t e n t ,     though        only

ju s t .        I was          s t il l    in the       pen, w h e r e    I fell          I think.           There        w e re     people

lying        on      t o p of me,           threj^of          four.       Obviously             I was      only        partially

conscious                so    I can'U^escribe                 them.          I remember           s ome     people          trying         to

pull       me       out       from       under    the    people       on t o p       of me       but     it wa s        hurting           my

ba ck .         A    couple          of    police       tried     to.         I was       in a     lot     of     pain and           I

shouted             at    the       helpers       to    stop.      I find           it    very     hard      to     rec a l l      any

more.           Eventually,                within       seconds       I passed            out a ga i n .




I don't             really          have    any    comments        on h o w         the     incident         wa s      h a n d l e d as        I

was     unconscious.

             However     I would        say    t hat               seen seemed         to   be y o u n g   and

             inexperienced and             did     no             qh at    first.       The

             organisation          of   the    crowd              ound was      virtually       no n

             The    Police   organisation                         year    was   very    good.

             Everything      was        controlle                 specially      the    crowd     outside.

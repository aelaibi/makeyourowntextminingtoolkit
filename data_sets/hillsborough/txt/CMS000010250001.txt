THIRD MEETING OF THE FOOTBALL LIAISON GROUP DUE TO BE HELD AT
11AM ON 5 FEBRUARY IN ROOM 1104, HOME OFFICE, QUEEN ANNE'S GATE.


The report of the House of Commons Select Committee on football
hooliganism is due to be published on 5 February. In the
circumstances and as no matters of urgency have been proposed for
discussion, it has been decided to cancel next week's meeting o f ^
the Football Liaison Group.

I shall be in touch shortly to arrange an alternative date for
the Group's third meeting.

THIRD MEETING OF THE FOOTBALL LIAISON GROUP

An agenda is attached, for the meeting due to be held at 11am on

5 February 1991 in Room 1104, Home Office, Queen Anne's Gate.


It seems to me that the agenda could be dealt with effectively

by correspondence as information becomes available. Therefore,

unless members wish to propose additional items which are of

interest to all representatives, I suggest that the third meeting

be postponed [until the early spring/the Football League's survey

results are known].


Anyone who is unhappy with this approach should let Maggie Sharp

(071.273 3406) know by Thursday 31 January.

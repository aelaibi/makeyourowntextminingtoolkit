             have      been selling        programmes            for three years and             I am used to this

             kind of behaviour             from a m i n o r i t y of football              supporters.

             I con ti nu ed walk in g a r o u n d           the    pitch a nd      I noticed nothing             untoward.

             The 'ijuild up to the game and the a t m o s p h e r e                      insidie the ground was                 no

             At five minutes            to three       I was       in front      of the Leppings            Lane     terraces

             Pens      three and four were             full       buTKj.here was         plenty of       room in the

             a re as    either side.          As     I w^-i^ked past > e n s        three and four.              I saw

             people      right    up agai ns t        the fences but         I did not see anyone                in any

             sUstress.        T hey all        se em ed     in good spirits a nd there was                    some       good

             na tu r ed banter about            me    selling E v e r t o n      pr og rarnrnes.

             I then w a lk e d down to the far end of the ground to take up my                                           position

             in front       of the score           board.

               the bar w it h a shot from Peter Beardsley.        There was a loud roar from

               looked as i f V v e r y o n e in pens three and four had pushed forward.

             I then saw p eo p l e start in g               to    climb over       the    fences.        There was a            line

             of    police    officers        standing        in front of the             fences.       My    initial

             r ea ct i on was     that     there was         going to be a pitch                invasion.

             four were       now full.

             I saw a      policeman        come      onto    the    pitch and speak             to the      referee.        The

             game was       s to pp ed and T>kie players             left    the    pitch.

             More      and more       people were          clYmbing       over   the fences at           L ep pi ng s Lane

          to pull         people over        to safety.

          In a matter            of seconds       more Police          officers a r r i v e d and there was               now

          hu ndreds        of    people on the          pitch.       I w ou ld describe        the scene as          chaos.

          I then saw            people    being    carried towards            the    sports    hall w h ic h    is

          s it u a t e d b ehind the N o rt h Stand.                 I then saw supporters             pulling       off

          the a d v e r t is i ng       boards    in front       of-<^he H op a n d     carrying       them to the

          In the e i gh t e e n y ard box just                 to the      left hand side       of the goalposts                I

          saw a white male age d about 2 0-25 years                           old.     His    face was       blue    he was

          dead.       I cannot de sc ri be           him anymore and           I cannot       remember what          he was

          wearing.          I was s h o ck ed and            looked away.          A few yards     to the      left

          hand side         I saw anot he r        supporter         lying on the ground.              He was about

          e ig h t e e n years      old,     white,      he was wearing            jeans.     He was    slim about

          five      feet    eight       inches    tall.        There was a man giving            him m outh         to

          mouth      recusitation.              I can only say that            this man was        not w e ar in g a

          police      or St Johns          A m b u la nc e    uniform.I      am unable       to describe       these

          people      in any more          detail       because      it    is difficult and u ps etting              to

          recall      the       incidents       o^that        dayM     saw a group of about            one    hundred

          The P olice           then stood       in a line across            the    pitch.     I saw two       people

          s w in g in g    on the       cross    bar.        Two more supp or te rs were         pulling       the       net

              a s s i s t e d a few Police       officers        in trying      to    calm them      down.    I

               co nt i nu e d doing     this    until     about       twenty    past four.

              The    scene on the           pitch was more        calm but      it was     still     crowded.

               I w ent      inside and handed           in the    programme       takings.         I left the ground

               I would       like to add that when the                 crowd were      spilling      on to the     pitch

               I saw a male member             of the St Johns A m b u la nc e          carry an ox yg en bottle

               to the far end of the             ground.         He    returned and       collected another

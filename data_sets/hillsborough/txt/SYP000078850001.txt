            SERIAL 29 SUPERVISOR PS MOSELY A1 ROTA 2

            HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND, SATURDAY15TH APRIL - NOTTS FOREST V

            LIVERPOOL



            At 8.30 am on Saturday 15th April               198 9 , <150489),   I commenced duty at

            Doncaster Divisional Headquarters,              College Road, Doncaster.         I was

            then in company of other officers transported to Hillsborough F ootball

            Ground for duty at the above semi final.                   On arrival at the

            Hillsborough we paraded in the ground area and was then briefed by

            senior officers regarding duties,               placing emphasis on policing fair

            but firm being the order of the day.                  At   11.15 am in company of

            Police Constable 2054 Wilkes              I took up position at the junction of

            Penistone Road with Vere Road,              placing metal     barriers across the mouth
                                                                                     PAGE      2
                                                                                     S2311

            of the junction in order to stop non residents walking through Vere

            Road to Leppings Lane.     At this junction situated one either side of

            the road was an off licence and a fish and chip shop which were both

            open for business.     Both premises attracted a large group of

            supporters being so close to the ground.        Both shops were kept busy

            and were full most of the time between 1115 hours and 1500 hours, most

            supporters using the off    licence were    purchasing 4 packs of beer and

            lager as well as bottles of cider and wine.        Having    left the off

            licence some supporters would then sit on adjacent          property walls and

            some even sat on the central    reservation of the carriageway on

            Penistone Road drinking until being moved off by other officers.

            During this time I had to approach several       fans outside the off

            licence.   These were banging on the shop window and appeared slightly
   r**JLT
            worse for drink.     The people at this time also spilt onto the footpath
^2-^C>V
            making   it awkward for other supporters to walk past and having to go

            onto the road.     I had also a further occasion to speak to a group of

            about 5/6 supporters stood across Penistone Road,            who were seen to

            open beer/lager    cans take several   sips from them   then they would throw

            the can containing alcohol    on the roof of adjacent buildings.         they

            also appeared worse for drink but having been warned re their           conduct,

            dispersed and left the area.

            At about 2 pm supporters    in 2 / 3 ’s kept approaching us showing tickets

            for the North and West Stand.     These were directed along Penistone

            Road   in order to turn right/left     into Leppings Lane,    occasionally

            elderly and infirm people requested that they should be allowed to go

            up Vere Road towards Leppings Lane for various       reasons,     including

            several with children,   who were frightened to go       down Penistone Road

            because of Liverpool    supporters that were about.

            At about   1450 hours the owner of the off     licence at the said junction

            came out of his premises    locked the shop door and said that he had run
out of alcohol    drinks and that he was going to get some more to

replenish his stocks.

At about    1500 hours supporters kept    rushing around showing us tickets

for the North Stand area of the ground and seemed to be frustrated due

to having been outside the ground        prior to the kick off.     The next

thing    I knew was when supporters were     coming down Vere Road shouting

towards myself and Police Constable Wilkes abuse.          The first thi ng we

knew that there was anything wrong was when a local         resident   came up

to us and said that the supporters were on the pitch and that the

game was stopped.     I stayed at that    point until the majority of

supporters had cleared when we were then told by other officers           coming

along Penistone    road from the same serial at about 4.30 pm to return

to the grandstand within the ground which we then did.           On arriving

in the ground I saw that the crowds had dispersed and we then had de­

brief by     a senior officer.     At about 6 pm we then went to Claywheels

Traffic Depot where we remained until we returned to Doncaster Police

Station,   arriving at about 7^.45 pm when I then went off duty.

The atmosphere outside the ground between 3,15 pm and 4.30 pm was

electric and tense giving       concern as we eventually through residents

learned of the picture       inside the ground from fans and local     residents

had been watching television.        T h a t ’s why we remained outside the

ground in case of a n y   trouble from supporters     leaving or again trying

to get    into the ground.

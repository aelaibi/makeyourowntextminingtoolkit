E)ue to my           living       in S h effield,             the arrangements' were                for everyone           to

meet     at my house.                B o t h my        parents a r r i v e d bn the morning,                  at a r o u n d

s h o r t l y a f t e r wards,            roughly about            1130 hours.

We all       went       out to a meal at a public                           house w h i c h    is opposite           the

Hal lam Football               Stadium           but    I d i d n ’t witn e s s        any other       fans    there

d r inki n g .

I
1 e v e n t u a l l y made
  *r?                              my way to the ground                      in one       vehicle w i t h my father
f'dr,
                                   and his son, _______________ ,                         The vehicle was            parked

just     off R iv el in V a l l e y Rd w hich                    I believe         is about a mile            from the

gro u n d and we all               then      p r o ceeded on foot.

We all       a rr i v e d at        the     ent rance         to the        ground     in L e p p i n g s / L n at    just

after        1415 hours.             The     queues at this                 stage a p p e a r e d qjoite orde r l y and

b a c k e d up reaching               just       behind the gates               on Le ppi ng® A_n .         At this

p o i n t I s ep ar a t e d         from the           rest of my           party as       they were going            to use

different            t ur n s t i l e s    to me as         they were          going      to sit    in the N orth

Stand.         I went         to the        rear of the queue                  for the      ’C * block      turnstiles

and    believed           it w o u l d      take about           ten m i n u t e s     to get      inside     the ground.

A fter a couple               of m in u t e s      of waiting              in this     queue,      tine queue sort             of

d i s s o l ve d     into a mass            of    people due          to e v e ryone        "pusming      in" and

trying       to get         to the        front.          This     se e m e d to escalaie           into a problem as

more     and more           people         came,       e v e n t ua ll y    causing a crush.            I, myself,

was    unable         to decide where                  I was moving           to and was,          in fact,      m oved

s i d eways about             f i ft ee n yards.

Du r i n g   this       time      I was      only       looking       forw a r d and was unaware               of any

events       o c c urring        be h i n d me.           I t h erefore         c a n ’t really estimate             how

many     people were w ai ti ng                   to get       in the        ground.        I saw a bit of trouble

d e v e l o p as one of the                 police        horses      came from the d i r e c t i o n of the

t ur n s t i l e s    thro u g h     the     crowd,         causing         e v e ryone    to quickly       split      up,
                                                                                                                       PAG E            2
                                                                                                                       S1654

but    the    gaps were           soon filled             back     in.

The    crushing          c o n tinued         for about        forty m i n u t e s while             I made rny way the

short    distance             to the     turnstiles.               Du r i n g    this time          the s ituairion was

behind       r e ct if ic at io n arid was              very m u c h out             of    control.          I %6w a number

of Liv e r p o o l       s up p o r t e r s    climbing        onto a wall                which    I believe         separates

’B ’ and      ' C " block queues.                    The y then w a l k e d along                 this/wall,         climbed

over onto          the    t ur n s t i l e s     roof,     dropping         down          into thsr ground.            It

a p p e a r e d these         people were            trying      to escape            the     crush that had

d e v e lo p e d outside          rather         than get        into the            ground       illegally.

Finally,       I m an a g e d to get                near the       ’C*    block           t urnstiles        and    became

aware    that       the       side     gate      to my      right must           have       been opened            because

people were          filing a r o u n d             there.       I couldn't a c t u a l l y              see    the gates

but    because       I was        so    close        to the turn s t i l e s              I deci d e d to stick          it

out.     A couple             of m in u t e s       later,     I believe about                 1455 hours,           I managed

to get t hr o u g h the turnstiles,                        handing my ticket                   in on the way.

I then saw,          i m m ed ia te ly          in front       of me,       a tunnel           w i t h the words

’Standi no ’ a b o v e ..:i.t .          To me this see m e d the only entrance ,4'ay in to

the    terracing          as     the other           smaller       sign     I b e l i e v e d to be/poi n t i n g

                                                                                                         /
u p s tairs    to the seating.                      I t h erefore w a l k e d             into the f u n n e l       w hich,       at

this    point,       a l t ho ug h      it was        busy,      w a s n ’t too           congested.

Halfway       into       the     tunnel        I saw the amount                 of    people       on the tepfacing                in

front    of me and             real ised         it was      too     crowded and              I probable/wouldn't

get a space.               I turned           round     intending         to go back              but,    rfue to the

sheer    volume          of    people         now    coming      down the            tunnel,       I yassumed        it would

be    impossible          to get        out.         I th e r e f o r e   pr o c e e d e d     i ryto pen 4 and         began

to make       my way along              the      back,     intending            to go "Uy the empty                 pen on the

flanks.        As    I got        h al f w a y across          the    pen and,             I suppose,          about a third

of the way down,                 I reali s e d        I w a s n ’t going             to be able          to go any

further       so    I stopped.                E v e r yo ne was      very       cramped at this                stage and       I

was    vi r t u a l l y unable          to move.           Beca u s e     of all           the jostling and            pushing
                                                                                                                     PAGE         4
                                                                                                                     SI 654

I was      unaware         that      the m a t c h had a c t u a l l y s t a r t e d but              I believe          it was

just     after       this start           that     J. began to now get                    crushed.         Again    I was

u nable      to     control        where        I was    going,       I just          had to move wit h the               crowd

w h i c h was       slowly going               forward.        At    one     point my         leg got       caught

causing        both my feet              to     come off the gr o u n d but                  I was just       carried

along.

Obvi o u s l y ,     because         the s it ua t i o n was          so bad?          J. began to signal            to a

police       officer         in the       stand above that we were                          getting    crushed and

other      people were             shout i n g     to him.           I was       now facing more             towards       the

back     of the       ter r a c i n g     and     I saw a number                of    people     being      lifted up

into     the       stand above           by f ellow supporters.                       The    crush did not ease

off at all           and     I was       taken     down to about                halfway       in the       pen.     At    this

point      I saw a white                boy,     aged about          fourteen,            behind me.         He    seemed

quite      fat as his             face was        plump and he had straight                       brown hair.             His

face     had turned w hite                 and he had o b v i o u s l y              fainted.      He was         being

s u p p o r t e d by two          older men        that       I presume          knew him but          I don't       know

how    e x tensive         his      c on di t i o n was.

P e o p 1 e at      this     t ime had been c .1.imbi ng over                        the mai n f encirig at          the

front      of t e rracing            to get       onto       the    pitch a w a y from the               crushing.         A

number       of     people        had m a n a g e d to escape              by        this way and one young lad

in particular,               who     could have been only about                           ten,   managed      to get       to

the front           by s c uttling across                everyones           heads        and shoulders           on all

fours,

I then       became aware               that     the    fencing       gate           at   the    front of y?e

t e rr a c i n g    in the        bo t t o m    left of pen 4 had                    been opened. T?hia was

causing        people        to    push harder           to get       to this             mall   gat sr.     I remained

in pen 4 for some                  time        until    the    crowd had             been    reduced to what             I call

a normal           crowd.' I      The    police

                                                       had    now begun to             cut away the          fencing at

the    front,        enabling easy access from t h e                            stand to the          pitch.        The

stand      cleared quite                q ui c k l y after         th/is.I      I e v e n t u a l l y got    onto    the

              pitch w hi ch was,          by now,      e x tr em e l y busy wit h      people and     I saw a number

              of o b vi ou sl y dead        people     s c at te re d all   over      the   place   on the    floor.        I

              was      very stun n e d and         in a state of shock at this                point and    cannot

              a cc ou nt    for any times.            I w a lk ed    round to the N o r t h Stand and began to

              wave rny arms a t t e m p t i n g       to gain the a t t e n t i o n     of the other memb e r s        of

              my     party.       I then s t a g g e re d    back, towards      the    goal    believing     that   I. may

              offer a s s is ta nc e      to someone.          However,     there were        hundreds     of helpers

              an d     I thought       I w ou ld    just    be getting      in the way.         I, therefore,       began

              to walk       back up towards           the h al f w a y   line   in order       to find my father.

               I e ve nt ua ll y      saw him      in the    stand waving and a couple              of minu t e s   later

              he     joined me on the           pitch.

                   Superintendent                      Chapman.                We    were          on    duty          in        connection          with       Notts.

                       ground         control           to      take       the      Land          Rover          to    Leppings              Lane    to       assist       with

                       crowd        control.                I    informed           Mr.       Chapman             of       this        and    drove       to     Leppings


                       Lane .

                       When         I arrived           at       Leppings            Lane         turnstiles                    I was       amazed       at     what       I

                       found.             From     the          turnstiles              to    beyond             the        traffic          lights        in    Leppings

                       Lane         there       was     a       mass     of       supporters.                    They        were        simply          pouring       down

                       Leppings            Lane        towards           the       ground.              At       the        turnstiles              th.re       seemed         to

                       be    making            little           if   any      progress             through                 the    turnstiles.                 The

                       Pressure            at     the       front        of       the    queue          was       tremendous                 and     I    became          very


                                                                                              I

very       concerned.                     I     appealed                  to        the        crowd          to       ease       the        situation              over

the     PA      this        had        no       effect.                    I    told           the       supporters                 that          people           at    the

f r o tit w e r e       L e i no            crushed               and          that           these          were           women and             children,

I he i r     own       people               that         they             were           crushing.                     It    m a d e no       difference.                      I

repealed           my       m e ssages               several                   times           to       no    effect.

i   then        callec            match             control                on       my     personal                radio          and        asked           for    the

kick       off     to       be        delayed                in       order              to        offer          the       crowd something                    to       step

the     crushing              tut           I was            informed                it        was        too      late.

I     then      became            worried                and          I    realised                 people             were        going          to    get        harmed

and     injured              if       something                   was          not       done.               So     I       called       the          Mounted

Inspector              on     the          PA       but       he          could          not-       hear          me     because             of       the     noise

{ r 0 rr. v n e     c ro wd           tut       after             a       minute              or    two       I managed                to        attract           his

at t e n s i o n       ana        1       gesticulated                         to    him           to     form          the       Mounted             Police

Of:'i ct-':         into          i. l i n e         across                the       ire;           parallel                 with       tne       turnstiles                  and

hardly          affected                  with       some             simply             going            under             the    h o r s e s ’ bellies.

The     attitude              of          the       supporters                       struck             me    as        different                because           whilst

there        were        several                adults                with           youngsters                   not        taking          any       part         in    the

matter          but      standing                   to       one          side        of       the        main          stream          of       supporters

pouring           down        Leppings                   Lane             the        bulk          of     supporters                   appeared              to     be

gripped           by    an        urgency                to       get          into           the       ground              and    get       in       now     and        if

someone           was        hurt,             so    what,                it     seemed             as       though              something             more

 important              than          a     football                  match           was          taking           place          behind             the

 turnstiles.                  They             appeared                   fanatical                  to      gain           entrance.

 It    was       obvious              that          the       greater                 part           had,         as        so    often          is    the        case,

 been        drinking             and          had        left            it     too          late          and     on       arrival             seeing            the

 large        crowd          still             waiting                to       get        in        the      ground              had    realised              they

 would        miss          part          of    the          game,             although                 I    didn't              think       so       at     the        time        I

 now     think          the       fans          were              storming                the        turnstiles.

 Just        when       my        concern            was           at          its       peak,          just        as        I was         at    my       wits         end




                                                                                                                                       fc

wondering             what,         I    could          do       next          the        crowd           seemed           to      d i s a p pear            so     fast

that     initially                  1    could          not       believe                 it        and     I    realised              that         a     large

concertina                type          gate       had       been          opened:                   I was        immensely                  relieved               and


very    grateful.

the    rear        cf          the S o u t h         stand          when             I     reached              a gate          at     the       rear          of       the

Police        Match            Control             point          I heard                 a     radio           message              "Everybody                on       the

entry       to     the         ground             and    ran        onto          the          football               p i t ch.

Initially             what          I    thought             I was             seeing               was     just       a     pitch           invasion.

There       were          no    players             on       trie      pitch              and        fans        were        climbing                ever         tne

fencing          at       the       L e p p ln q s Lane                e nci.             I was           not     overly              concerned                because

I   knew      that             we're          quite          easily             capable               of        dealing            with         a    pitch

invasion.                 I         i k e cl t o w a r d s          the         y o a I *r*o u t h          area       a         the       L e p.*p i ric s

Lane.         As      1       did       so    I    saw       that          a    Liverpool                   supporter                 had       got       to      tne

actions          in       the       goalmouth                at     that          end.                    As I w a l k e d a c r o s s              to       the

Lep>pings          Lane         end          goalmouth,                I       turned                and saw           t h a t he          had      been

arrested           around               the       middle          of       the           pitch.              As I      neared              to    the

goalmouth             I        saw Police               officers                 helping                  fans over             the        fencing             and       I

began       to     realise               it       was    more          than           a        pitch        invasion.                  I     then         saw       a

gate     in      the          fence          and    fans          lying           t rapped                on     top       of     one       another               in     the

gateway.              I       looked          behind             the       fencing                   an d saw          that the             fans          w e r e all

crushed          together.                    I    saw       a    young           fan          amongst            them          and        realised               he     was


dead .

I   went      to      the       open          gate       and        tried             to        pull        a    youth           out       of       the       entrance

but    he     said            that       his       foot          was       trapped.                   With        other              officers             I    then

tried       to     pull         a       young       female             out        but           she        was    trapped              by       fans          behind

her    and       she          began          screaming              and         the            other        officers                 stopped            pulling.

1   said      'she's            got          to    come          out,          come            on    pull.'            Uie       eventually                   pulled

My        ne.st       recollfrttion                     is    that       I    drove           the        Land     Rover         onto          Penistone

Road           and      parking               on       the    central             reservation                 and        performing                traffic

duty           dirt cting                ambulances                down       Herries              Road       and        turning             right           into

Penistone                   Road         and       then       into       the       ground.

Eventually                      1 went            to    the       gymnasium              looking            for     Super intendent

Chapman.                    When         I    arrived             at    the       gym     and        I    saw     all      the       bodies                 laid         on

 the       fioor            I    c o u l d n ’t         believe          there           was       so     many,          row    upon          row           of    them.

Eventually                      Detective               Chief          Superintendent                     Addis          began       issuing

 instructions                       regarding                procedures             and        finding              I was       not          required,                   I

 went           into        the       North            Stand        looking             for    Superintendent                    Chapman.                        He      was

 there           w it r         other         supervisor                officers              so     I    sat       in    the    stand.                 I

 remember               seeing               Chief        Superintendent                      Mole        approaching                the          North           Stand




                                                                                                                         f c t i t j

                                                                                R409




from the Police Control.

Af ter be ing stood down by M r Chapman,   I r e t u rne d to the gymnasium to

see if I could assist, but it seemed all organised.         I did a driving

job a llocated to me by Chi ef Inspe cto r Beal    then res ume d to my beat.

Wh en I arrived at Leppings Lane initially,       I was able to travel

freely up to the crowd because there were very few fans walking up

Leppings Lane they were all coming down.       The crowd was of three to


four t housand strong.

The moo d of the fans was a grim d e t ermi nat ion to get in the ground,

no one was laughing or joking,    just the d e t e rm ina tio n to get in.

I have no reco lle cti on of any actions by any stewards.

Radio com munications were not good so muc h so that on previous

occasions   the radio set up in the Lan d Rove r is such that it can be

utili sed as a radio room and has been on previous        occasions by

pr essing the correct buttons.    It receives     and transmits messages via

ma tch control.   At one stage I thought that I would be required for


this.

My normal function on m atc h days is that of driver with the Land

Rover of the C h ief Superintendent and always in position in Leppings

 Lane.   This is a duty I have been performi ng for years.

 I remember that when I was at Leppings Lane and after using the P.A.

 and having had no success, I was joined by an Ins pector who climbed

 onto the roof of the Land Rover and used the P.A. w i t h the same


 result.

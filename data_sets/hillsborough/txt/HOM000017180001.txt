           Mr Douglas Hurd MP

           Dear Sir
           The tragic e vents at Hillsborough on Saturday have affected not
           only Liverpool and all interested in th e game of football but
           th e entire country. We have all been filled with horror and
           sadness.
           This company has been involved in th e installation of security
           systems at several major grounds th ro u g h o u t th e country over th e
           last th re e years or so. We hope to offer o u r services in the
           future.
           However, before any f u r t h e r major security measures are taken to
           secure s p o rts grounds, we would very much like to be involved in
           discussions to advise on th e total security requirements for
           these situations, always remembering th e security of the
           individual fir s t and foremost.
           The plans fir s t muted by o u r company four y ears ago on such
           installations would in practice have relieved th e situation
           which built up on Saturday immediately.
           The undersigned, a long-serving amateur football referee with a
           passionate in terest in the game of football and a high
           reputation in security fields, is available at your request.

           Yours faithfully
           for and on behalf of
           Hercules Security Fabrications Limited

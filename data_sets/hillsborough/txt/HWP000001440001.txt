  The Working Party considered -

   (1) various matters arising from the broadcasting by
        Independent Television on 5th December, 1996 of the
        drama/documentary "Hillsborough" and in particular the

       programme and its contents.


  Resolved that this Working Party -

   (A)-congratulates writer Jimmy McGovern and Granada
       Television for their production of the television
       drama/documentary programme "Hillsborough", broadcast
       by Independent Television on 5th December, 1996;

   (B) notes that the programme

        (i) provided a factual re-construction of events
            surrounding the Disaster and its aftermath, based
            on the issues of justice and accountability for
            the bereaved families of the Disaster - the issues
            upon which this Working Party was created in April
            1989; and

       (ii) has, through its research, revealed significant
            new and unused evidence about the Disaster which

            the Disaster to be pursued and justice to be
            obtained.

  (C) supports the action taken by the Liaison Officer to the
      Working Party, in full consultation with the Family

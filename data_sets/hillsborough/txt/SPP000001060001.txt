 Dear Dr Popper,

 I noticed in the Press at the weekend that you will shortly be retiring from your
 Office as Sheffield Coroner.

 I would like to take the opportunity both on my own behalf on behalf of the rest
 of the Steering Committee and our clients thanking you for your kindness in the
 past and to wish you every happiness and success in the future.

 It has been a very long two years since the Hillsborough tragedy particularly
 as far as the families are concerned.

 The care and sensitivity and inparticular the arrangements made for the families
 at the individual* Inquests was very much appreciated both by them and by us.

 As far as the lawyers are concerned your unfailing courtesy and consideration
 to the advocates and ready response to various problems that we, as Solicitors,
 have had to burden you with have been appreciated by us all.

 I doubt whether any other Coroner has been faced with such a task before and whatever
 you decide to do in the future we thank you for making a difficult time easier
 and send our very good wishes.

 Yours sincerely,




 MISS E M STEEL

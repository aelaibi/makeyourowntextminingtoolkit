On arrival we received a packed lunch and at              1030 hrs


received a briefing by Inspector Hand-Davies,             I/C Mounted


Deployment and were handed the briefing notes.               We were


told ^to be ready for deployment at 1130 hours and that my


officers would receive a hot meal          in two phases; half the


contingent at   1430 hours and the second half at 1530


hours.   This was to ensure that there was a mounted

                                   I

presence outside the ground at all times.



At 1130 hours all mounted officers were addressed by the

During my patrol of Halifax Road I noticed many supporters


sitting on grass verges drinking alcohol     from cans,       long


queue at an off-licence and the public house in Halifa

                           -   4   -


Road near to the railway station was full at 1230 hours.


The weather was fine and warm and there appeared to be a


carnival atmosphere.



At about   1400 hours the contingent detailed to meet those


arriving by train (including myseir; collected some 500


Liverpool supporters and walked them the half mile to the


ground.



On arrival   (approximately 1415 hours)      the turnstiles were


busy but the 500 had no difficulty in gaini-pg. access.


There were supporters in the near vicinity blocking


pavements on each side of the bridge.        These mounted


officers on the escort were initially employed encouraging


those people to make their way into the ground,        if they


had tickets or leave the area.         There was no hostility and


most moved when requested.



At about   14 30 hours it became apparent that the crowd


outside was increasing.    Large numbers of people were


coming down Lepping Lane from Catchbarh Lane,        (the
opposite direction from which we had been told to expect


the Liverpool   supporters) and started to push towards the


turnstiles.     I shouted to officers in Lepping Lane to slow


the flow as the compound and immediate area behind was


full.   Constable 1300 Grunnill and 1696 Stanbridge placed


their horses    in the immediate area of the turnstiles in


an effort to relieve the pressure on those at the front.


The crowd had grown at this time to about 3000.



Other mounted officers used their horses to slow the flow


of persons from Lepping Lane into that compound.     There


appeared to be no reaction to requests    'not to move


forward’ and in fact horses were being pushed in an effort


to reach the turnstiles.     At one point, attempts were made


 to close the wrought iron gates to relieve the pressure


but on each occasion it was pushed back.     At one point I


 saw what appeared to be a can being thrown through the       y


 air.   It narrowly missed Constable Stanbridge but its


 contents scattered over him and those around him.   I


 remember thinking "Thank goodness he was wearing his
r.   384                                    Fofm 10<A

                           -   6   -




reinforced h a t ".



Eventually we were able to form a complete line of horses


from building line to building line, but even then, people


were attempting to push between and under the horses with


a complete disregard for their safety.     Those that had got


past the line continued to push and all requests to be


patient were ignored.



There was a brief time when one horse,    from fear, moved


out of line and there was a surge towards tfc^. turnstiles.


This was quickly filled but as I looked over at this point


and I saw the gate on the left of the turnstiles open.       I


assumed that it had been breached.     A short time later the


gates were closed and the crush appeared to subside. A


matter of minutes later the remainder of the crowd entered


 the ground and I, with my officer 'stood to' near to the


 Directors Car Park.



 At about   1505 hours I heard over the radio that there were


 problems inside* the ground and were given instructions to

                          -    7   -


take part of my contingent to Penistone Road opposite the


ramp.   This was in order to deploy onto the pitch if the


need arose.



We remained at this location until     it was decided to


evacuate the ground.   Mounted officers were then deployed


in two's in the general area of the stadium as all foot


officers were deployed inside.



At approximately 1820 hours mounted officers were 'stood


down' and returned to Niagra for debriefing %&nd


refreshments.



The Merseyside contingent left South Yorkshire at 2000


hours and were dismissed from the stables at Greenhi11


Road at 2300 hours.

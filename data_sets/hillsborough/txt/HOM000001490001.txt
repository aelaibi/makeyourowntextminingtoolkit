I would           describe             rr.yself as        a white          male       about        5*-7" tall             of a s t o c k y

'I can       rscall             vividly       the       fans,     rushing            through        the     gate          and    tha       youn

The      only         crit.ism I w o u l d              offer     was      t hat       I was       disappointed                 to    see       su

a l a rge         number          of    poli cs         off i.cars        forming           a cordon when                 they       could

h a ve     kel-psd out                with    first       aid.       What         I d o n ’t u n d e r s t a n d           is w h y        are

people         segregated                   outside       the     ground and                made    to    go        in s e p a r a t e

seating           and       standing          turnstiles,            when         once       through           the       turnstiles

they         are       mingled          together          again,          it    seems        pointless              because          the

stewards              on the          inside       have     to    separate             them ag ain             to    re d i r e c t        then

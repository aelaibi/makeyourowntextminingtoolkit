Hillsborough,                    I then       informed            them        t h at    if       they      d id      not       infact          have

the      lads     replied           ' W e ’ re L i v e r p o o l         fans,         we    can get            in a n y w h e r e ! 5 .

I saw a n o t h e r          van      pull       up    in the          layby and             a    lad      got       out       and       sold a

ticket         to a      lad      in a      car w h i c h         ha d      pulled          up b e h i n d          it.

We    noticed          that       from about             1 - 1 , 30 p m       the      traffic           was        so    congested

along       the     r oa d       t ha t    the     cars w e r e          at    a standstill.                        However          by a b o u t

2pm      the    r o ad w a s        virtually            empty.

At    about       2 . 3 0 p m we          stopped        two      coaches              w hich were              travelling togethe r

and      the    fans      were        complaining                 t h at      the d r i v e r s         were        g o i n g to        make

them       late     for      the      game.

At    approx,          2 . 4 5 pm we        left       T a n k e r s ley       Intersection                    en    ro ute       to

Claywheels             Lane       for      our meal.

A s we      passed        by H i l l s b o r o u g h         I saw          that       there          w e re    a    lot       of L i v e r p o o l

fans       s till      milling            about       at a b o u t       3pm and            I commented                  that     if the

f an s     didn't       hurry         they would             miss        the     start           of    the      game.

On arrival             at H i l l s b o r o u g h        our      Inspector             and Sergeant told                         us      to m a k e

At    first       we    were        told      to      form        a    cordon and                1 thought               this must        be

because         the      fans       were      going        to     storm        the      turnstiles.                      At    t h is     time

A Liverpool              fan      came      up to me a n d               asked why               he was         not       being          allowed

in a n d       s h o w e d me       his     ticket        and         I explained                the     situation              to him.

As    we w e r e       speaking            an a m b u l a n c e        arrived          and       the      lad a s k e d          why      the

Ou r     serial         was    then        told      to    e nt e r     the      ground.             Once     we       passed       through

th e     outer       gates         I lost      contact           with       our     Sergeant            and      Inspector              and

d i d n ’t see          them again            u n til      after        the L i v e r p o o l         fans       had     left       the

stadium.

The      first       person         I s a w as        we       passed       through            the    gates        was       a man       in

his      mid 2Q*s            who    was     sat      with       his     head       between           his    knees        c ry i n g .         I

then      saw a m a n          in his         m i d 3 0 ’s l ai d           on     the     ground with a teenager

kneeling           at    his       side.       The        man was         having         difficulties                  breathing          and

appeared           to    h a ve     an     injury         to    his     ribs,

I knelt           beside       him and         helped           him     into a m o r e                c o m f o r t a b l e p o s i t i o n to

I then walked                 ov er      to a n a m b u l a n c e         which         wa s    parked        next       to G a t e

Ambulancemen                 were     giving         another          man     oxygen.

make      a space            for    ambulances             to    get      up a n d       down        the    alley.

At     t hi s     stage       fans       began       coming        through Gate                 *C*     in g r e a t e r        numbers

and more           bodies          and     casualties            were       brought            f r o m the       p i t c h a r ea .

Many      of      the    fans       who     came      out       were      very      hostile           towards           the Police,,

passing           comments          s u c h as       ' I t ’s all         your      bastards            fa u l t "      and     "Don't

j us t    fucking            stand       there       you       bastards'.

I saw        one     fan      say     to    several            Policemen           who     h ad      formed        a    cordon around

the      bodies         of    the     dead,       'You b a s t a r d s           ar e    going        to    pay        for    this,

Police          were       really       little         more        t h a n a hi nde r a nee              due     to    the a m o u n t           of

alcohol          t h e y ’d c o n s u m e d .

As     the      injured          were    brought           out we          placed        them       to    one      side,         along       a

w a ll    and        I went       along        th is    wall        giving         advice        to      the     friends          of    some

of     those         injured and             placing          people         in the       recovery               pos iti on and

administering                  minor     first         aid      etc.

Many      of     the       sergeants           seemed         to    be     in a s t a t e        of      shock?        as    we all

were      and        I saw a Chief              Inspector             take      hold      of     one      sergeant           who       was

standing             ne x t    to me     and      say      to      him     ''Come on,          i t ’s up         to y o u        sergeants

not      heard        the      Chief     Inspector.

A Doctor             then      came     over      to me a n d            explained            he w o u l d       l ik e     to    help.

(I     found         out      late r    th is    was       lir. A s h t o n ) .          I directed              him      to a m a n         who

wa s     lyi ng       face       down    on the         ground           surrounded            by his           friends.           When

th e D o c t o r         knelt     down        next     to      the m a n       one      of    his       friends          said     ’W ha t

do y o u w a n t           you    bastard            fuck       off".

I told him               the     man    wa s    a Doctor            and. ha d       come       to     offer        assistance            and

he     replied           "Well     he    should         get m y m a t e            to    fucking          hospital’.               I told

him      to     c al m     down and          do w h a t e v e r       the      Doctor         told       h im    to.

I then          joined         another         man who          was      lying      on    the       floor        a n d wa s       having

difficulties                  breathing.             However          he    wa s    conscious             and was           talking.              I

told      his        friend       to m a k e      him more            comfortable.                  I then walk e d               over       to

where         fans       were     leaving         by G a t e        *B ’ .      Many      of     the      f an s      were       openly

crying and many were                         shouting           obscenities              at    myself           and    the       other

policemen with                   me.

I then walked                  over     to     the     opposite            side     of    the a l l e y w h e r e            a m a n was

entered          the       ground.           1 was      shocked            that     he was          still        lying       in the

position             because       it m u s t        h a ve     been 30 m i n u t e s            or      so     since       I had       first

Doctor          h ad    seen        his       uncle and           had       said    he m u s t         go    in the       next

available              ambulance.

At     this      t i me      1 s a w an a m b u l a n c e              coming       through            the    main       g a te    and

heading          towards            us.        1 went          ov er    and       spoke      with       the a m b u l a n c e          driver

and      wa s    then        joined           by a s e r g e a n t          who    was      busy       organising           the

transportation                     of    the     i nj u r e d .        I informed            hi m      of    the    situation and

then      returned             to       the    i n j u r e d man.

At     this      stage         a young          man       came       over     to me         and     t o l d me      he w a s       a

medical          student.                1 told       h im      to     go a l o n g      the wall            at    the    far      s i de     of

the      alleyway and                   examine       the       injured.

A    few m o r e        minutes           passed          before        I was       able      to       get    the       injured man

wh o     wa s    ly i n g      on       the    floor       into a n          ambulance.

yhils       all        th is       was    happening             I kept        coming         in     contact         with      some       of

the      officers            w ho       were     in my         serial.            Particularly               PC    297 Barnes            and

PC     1629 R o g a n .             However           I ha d lost           touch with            the        rest       of m y s er ia l .

At     this      stage         a    sergeant           came a l o n g         and     told        us    to    go    to    the      main

gate      and      I remained                 there       as    the     West       Stand      was       emptied          of L i v e r p o o l

fans.

The      atmosphere                at    this       time       was     very       tense      and       the    majority            of    the

fans were              very        hostile          and    .1 p e r s o n a l l y a l m o s t          'expected"           to     be

assaulted.

One      young         man     came       up a n d a s k e d           me    if    I knew where               a    particular            pub

was      and     I said            I did       not.        He     replied          5Y o u    bastards             you    d o n ’t k n o w

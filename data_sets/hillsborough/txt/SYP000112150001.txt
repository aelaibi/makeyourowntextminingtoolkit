to    the     ground.               I then         heard       a message                requesting              the       gate        be    opened

in o r d e r        to    prevent          serious          injury            or    d e a t h as         people           were        stil l

pushing         the       gate       and       it a p p e a r e d        likely          they would              fetch           t h at     g at e

and    the     wall           do wn.       I then went                off      at       Niagara.

At    about         3.SQ-3.30             pm     Ins p.     Phenix            carne      into         Niagara and                asked          all

those       on m ea l          to    turn        out     and    go       to    their          after        match          points           as    it

appeared            likely          the    game        would        be    ended          ea r ly .         Our       after         match         point

was    Middlewood                 Road,        Hawksley         Avenue.                 As    we. a r r i v e d          there        a message

came       o v er    for       all     dog       handlers           to    go       to    the       g r o u n d as         trouble           was

threatened               from       the    Nottingham               fans.           We       returned           to       the     ground,          to

the    Leppings               Lane     end,       b y jf before           we       got       inside        we    were          stopped           by

             What      was       very       noticeable              during            this       time       in L e p p i n g s         Lane    wa s      the

             fact      that amongst                 the      first         lot        of    people          to l e a v e         the    ground and

             presumably            those          who       had. b e e n         last       in a n d        at    the       back       were    a    lar ge :

             number         who    were          st i l l    the w o r s e            for       drink;.          They were             all

             understandably;, u p s e t                     but     their         behaviour                which       included           using       obscene

             language            shouting,             threatening                and       spitting             at    police          officers' w a s

             obviously            due       to    their        being          affected            by a l c o h o l .             Those       that     came

             out     later        after          the    game        had       been         officially             abandoned             were       totally

             different,            they          too    were        upset         and       angry          but    did       not    c a us e    the       scenes

             like      the       first       lot       had     done.             My    own       feelings             outside          the    ground were

             of    deep      shock          and also           a    f ea r       that       a    l a rg e    scale          public        order

             situation            could          arise       outside             the       ground          because          of    the     large       number

             of    those         still       affected              by    dr i nk .

              I have        worked          numerous           football               matches          at    this          ground       before        and       I

             did     in f a ct         work       the       same        g a me    last          year       when       it w a s     very       qu i e t .        It

             was     very        noticeable             however            th is       year       that       a    lot m o r e .drink wa s                    b e in g

             consumed and               also        being          carried.

             As. far        as    commmuni cations                      are      concerned             I had          no    trouble          with     the

             radio       and      it w o r k e d        okay        throughout.                   Whilst          the       incident          was     at      its

             height         however,             it w a s      obvious            that          the    control             ro om w a s       swamped          with

             messages            and    several             unavoidable                delays          in    responding                to m e s s a g e s       were

            .n o t i c e d , ■h o w e v e r ,       given          the     gravity              and    enormity             of    the     situation             and

             the     large        number          of    officers              calling            for       advice          and assistance                I

             thought         that       communications                     and        control          was       as    good       as    could       be

             expected.

             I di d      not      come       into       contact            with        any       ground          stewards          and       I did       not

             enter       the      ground          or    deal        with         any       dead       or    injured          pe op l e.        I finished

             duty      at    7.30       pm.

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 ~ Sheffield United Football Club and
 Sheffield Wednesday Football C l u b _________________________________ _

 I am writing to ask for your comments In writing as to the condition of the
 above two stadia under the 1975 Act from the Fire Service point of view.

 Khat I would like from you is written confirmation that as far as tbe Fire
  M t h o r i t y is concerned both stadia meet your requirements under tbe 1975
♦^legislation.

 If it should be that there are outstanding natters which require attention
 please detail these in your response; I think it would be helpful to all parties
 if any defects outstanding were fully detailed so that action could be taken to
 remedy them.

 Please be advised that I am aware of the south stand roof problem at Sheffield
 Wednesday and as you know I am taking steps to ascertain the Club's position on
 that problem.

  I hope you will be able to let me have your reply to this letter in the near
  future.

  Yours faithfully,




  Head of Department

^ ^ For the attention of Mr. D. M. Bownes


      Dear Sir,

      SAFETt OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

      Thank you for your letter dated 3rd November, 1986, in respect of the above
      Club.

      Please find below my observations in response to outstanding matters.

      An. inspection of the ground was carried out on 17th November, 1986.       The
      cefments appended below do not take into account the numbers of persons using
      individual areas, lateral and radial gangways or units of exit widths, as
      it is assumed that from previous correspondence and documentation that the
      various working parties and committees have adequately dealt with these items.

      MEANS OF ESCAPE IN CASE OF FIRE

      North Stand

      Timber framed and clad buildings are constructed and located under the stand.

      The only reference as to the acceptance is minuted in meeting dated 7 .8.85
      in which one large store for bulky items was agreed on a temporary basis.

      There is also no record to indicate whether these buildings have been treated
      with fire retardant paint or solutions. Confirmation is required as to treat­
      ment of these buildings.

      Spion Kop

      A.    Timber framed and clad unit    located on main central exit route has not
             received any approval, no approach has been made by the Club for its
             installation, this should be removed immediately.

      B.    It is understood that thegates in the pitch perimeter fencing form
             part of the emergency exits. The gates for reasons of security, fasten


                                  All communications to be .addressed to the Chief Fire Officer.
        with barrel bolts secured to the gate both top and bottom and open in
        a sideways direction.    It is doubtful that if it were necessary to
        evacuate the stand onto the pitch in an emergency that the gates would
        open if. pressure were generated by a crowd.     No record can be found
        in respect of discussion on gate fastenings.      It is recommended that
        a satisfactory security device easily openable from the pitch side should
        be found and fitted to all perimeter gates.

 C.     During the inspection it was observed that several concrete steps on
         the lower terracing were in need of repair and in one case the complete
        step had erroded away.     Every endeavour should be undertaken to ensure
         that all steps are kept in a good state of repair.

 D_     The wire mesh protecting the stanchions and bracing supports from being
         climbed is ineffective.   It has been observed that patrons visiting
         the Kop can, in large numbers from the back of the Kop, climb into the
         lower half of the roof.  The mesh should be extended to alleviate this
         situation.

 E.     It was observed that where the terracing is above 1 m higher than the
         lateral gangways wire mesh infill had not been located along the full
         lengths.   Where the mesh had been provided this had been spot welded
         but the mesh had not been given an additional vertical support.

 F.     Exit gates should be unlocked and keys held by stewards manning the
         gate before patrons enter the stands.

 West Stand

 A.     Timber framed and clad units located under this stand have been there
         for some considerable time. No record exists of:-

         (1 )      acceptance of these units or,

       ^ (2 ) that they have been treated with fire retardant paint or solutions,

v Bf*    Exit gates to the pitch perimeter as item B under Spion Kop above.
            »»-*

  South Stand

  The accommodation is divided into four areas

  A.     Ground floor       offices,   directors   suite,   players area,   function   suite,
         kitchen etc.

  B.     First floor, upper stand walkway, press lounge, players lounge,                paint
          stores, disused bar area.

  C.     Lower stand, uncovered stand seating.

  D.     Bear stand, covered seating.

  With respect to the four areas, the following observations are made:-

  A.     Ground Floor

                (i)   During normal working hours most doors from the office area
                      are kept locked shut.   All doors marked 'Fire Exit' should
                      be made readily available for use by any person within the area.
  (ii)   A number of rooms at this level i.e. kitchen, laundry, stores
         and directors' suite ventilate via openable windows and/or extract
         fans into the long corridor between areas A and C above.       It
         also appears that a number of the openable windows are protected
         by corrugated, lightweight plastic sheeting.

         The separation between the corridor and such ground floor areas
         should be to a minimum half hour fire resistance, any ventilation
         requirements being met by ducting to outside on the South Wall.

 (iii) All storage should be removed from stairway enclosures and these
       areas always maintained free from such storage.

First Floor:-

   (i) Again, a number of rooms i.e. players' lounge, press lounge,
        the store room previously used as a licensed bar and the paint
        store ventilate into this area.     Any ventilation requirements
        should be met by ducting to outside on the South wall.

  (ii) Valves should befitted to the gas    supply line to each of     the
        five refreshment positions in order that the supply can be     cut
        off should an emergency arise.

 (iii) All timber construction within this       area should be   suitably
        treated so as to be flame retardant.

  (iv) The paint stores contain a quantity of flammable paints and
       mixtures and present a hazard which it is considered should
        be removed from this area.     Proposals to relocate the stores
        should be discussed with the -Fire Authority before any work
        is commenced in order that suitable siting and any need for
        licensing under Petroleum legislation can be ascertained.

   (v) The timber constructed cupboard and the portable sales kiosks
    "*“ should be removed from this area.

  (vi)   In the cleaners'    cupboard to this area,   the fire resisting
          separation between the ground and first floor levels is breached
         by the passage of cables through a wall.     The area around the
         cables should be infilled with material to ensure a minimum
         fire resistance of thirty minutes.

 (vii)   All rooms onto the upper stand walkway should be separated from
         it by minimum half hour fire resisting construction, any doors
         being to the same standard and made self closing onto 25 mm
         rebates.

(viii)   Spaces above toilet accommodation are being used for storage
         purposes. Again, these areas must be maintained clear of storage.

Uncovered Seating Area:-

The means of escape from this area is along the corridor in front of
the rear part of the stand.   Should this route not be available then
evacuation onto the pitch is possible subject to persons having the
ability to climb over the front wall on to the pitch perimeter track.
This wall is approximately 1.5 m high at the Spion Kop end decreasing
to 1 m high at the West end.

   South Stand

   This stand appears to be well covered with regard to the provision and siting
   of call points.

   Indicator Control Panel

   The indicator/control panel is situated within the Police control centre
   between South and West Stand.    Whilst this is reasonable for match days it
   is not considered to be practical for the majority of the time.

   This panel should be duplicated with control at each location which should
   be:-

   1.      Police control box

   2.      Main office reception area

   FIRST AID AND FIRE-FIGHTING EQUIPMENT

^ ^ T h e current standard and displacement of First Aid fire-fighting equipment
     is considered satisfactory.

   GATES

   The sliding gates already in situ in the ground have been accepted by this
   Authority after due consideration and account being taken both of their location
   and the fact that they are of existing construction.     I would wish, however,
   to point out that it is the view of this Authority that doors required for
   means of escape should open outwards and it is recommended that notice be
   given to the Club to the effect that when any such sliding gates are to be
   replaced then their replacements must open outwards even if this involves
   structural work to recess the opening to avoid impinging over footpaths.
   WSile the sliding gates remain in use however, they must be immediately avail­
  able for use from the inside by any person should an emergency situation
   ’
   ‘
   arise. _^Any method of securing the gates against illegal entry from the outside
   must be by way of a simply operated device not requiring the use of a key,
   additional security being afforded by the presence of a steward who should
   be familiar with the emergency evacuation procedures for the ground.

   If there are any queries on these matters please do not hesitate to contact
   the Officer concerned.

   Yours faithfully,

       Dear Sir,

       Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

       In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
       condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
       have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
       received them as yet.

      The Police have indicated that they are quite satisfied with the stadius and
      have indicated that the degree of co*~operation which they receive is very
      satisfactory.

       The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
       information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. I think the letter
       is largely self-explanatory but I would particularly like to refer to the
       comments which are made in respect of final exit gates. As you can ses'from the
       letter the Fire Service are -or.cerr.ed about th* si-5ding gates and have indicated
       that as and when they reach the end of their useful life they must be replaced
       with outward opening doors. The Fire Service have also produced a drawing (a
      ^copy of which I enclose) to show a better arrangement for securing the sliding
     %ates against forced entry from the outside during the course of the ga^e. The
I   ^ ?ire ^erv*ce       that this hook type arrangement will be more easily used in
h
*      the event of an emergency than the current locks, about which they are very
       concerned.

      Would you please let me have your comments on the Fire Service letter as soon as
      possible.

      Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounda Act 1973 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to c o n e n t on the
condition of your stadias having regard to tbe provisions of the 1975 Act.       I
have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar c o n e a t i but I have not
received thea as yet.

The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
with the stadium and have indicated that tbe degree of co-operation which they
receive is very satisfactory.

The Fire Service have* however, made a nunber of concents and I attach for your
Information a copy of their letter to ae of 18th February.  Some points In the
letter have now been further clarified as follows

(a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
from the walkways.

(b) As far as tbe locked doors    in the south stand are concerned they              will be
dealt with by the Fire Service    under the Fire Certificate.

(c) Cates must be unlocked and stewarded at all tises, during matches: if this
cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be Insisted upon.

1 think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
particularly like to refer to the comments which are made in respect of final
exit gates. As you can see from tbe letter the Fire Service are concerned about
the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
their useful life they must be replaced with outward opening doors. Tbe Fire
Service have also produced a drawing (a copy of which I enclose) toshow  a
better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry from the
outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this hook
type arrangement will be more easily used in the event of an emergency than the
current locks, about which they are very concerned.

Encs.

  Dear Sir

  SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB
  AND SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

   I refer to your letter dated 13 November 1986.

  Both stadia, so far as the Police are concerned, meet our requirements
 lender the 1975 legislation.

 ■'Co-operation afforded by both clubs is very satisfactory with the
   exception of the lack of CCTV facilities at Bramall Lane. It is hoped
   that this can be remedied as soon as possible as it will be a valuable
   asset to us in effectively policing the ground.

   Yours faithfully

               I note your request for a report on the condition of the above
               Stadium.

               You will appreciate that to carry out a complete survey of all
               parts of this complex is a long and time consuming job which
               should not be approached in anything other than a thorough
               manner.

               I have therefore yet to find available diary time for my Officers
               to spend on this site.

               A report will be sent to you after a complete inspection has been
               undertaken.

              Annual Visit - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Hillborough, Sheffield

              During the annual visit of the above ground, the following observations
              were noted

        1.0   KOP

        1.1 The timber ticket hut adjacent to the refreshment bar on the main means of
            escape exit route from the KOP should be removed, since it is causing both
            a high risk and a narrowing of the escape width.

        1.2 A broken concrete post supporting the end of a crush barrier adjacent to the
            tunnel exit at the north end of the KOP to be removed, and the crush barrier
            be modified to join onto the end of the new steel supported barrier directly
            adjacent to it.

        1.3   A timber hut at ground level, under the KOP structure should be removed.

        I.k   An additional length of crush barrier is required to be installed adjacent
              to the base of the ramped stairway from the extended terracing. This was
              agreed on site by Dr. Eastwood.

        2.0   WEST STAND

        2.1   Signs over the front parapet wall at the upper level are to be -permanently
              s e c u re d a t the following positions?—



              a) between seats 1 and 1*f.
              b) between seats 20 and 28
              c) -"between seats 136 and 150

          ' Binding wire ties are not      considered   ±0    be satisfactory for this purpose.

              Additionally the sign brackets adjacexrt to seats 62 and 72 are to be
              correctly bent (or otherwise suitably checked) and secured.

        2.2   Rain water drainage holes through the agper level slab should have a gauze
              inserted so as to inhibit the dropping of missiles onto the crowbelow.

        2.3   It is felt that discussion should take place regarding the suitability of
              the gate fastening device at the base of the emergency exit stairway on the
              south end o^jthis stand.The fastening consisting of a    patent lockable
              barrel boHTrtcannot easily be unfastened in the direction of travel, and is
              impossible to be unfastened from the other side.

        3.0 NORTH STAND

        3.1   A broken glass panel in the west gable end should be replaced.

        3.2 The step between seats 12 and 13 on       t o w   ^3 is loose and should be correctly
            bedded down.                                                        '




                                                                                             Cont..

accommodation off the ground floor comdor and the terraced area in
terms of fire resistance and ventilation is to be considered further
at a future visit to the premises.

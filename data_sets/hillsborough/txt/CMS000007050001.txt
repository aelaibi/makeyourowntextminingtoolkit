Dear Mr. Eggar,
I refer to my letter to you dated 20th February regarding
all seater stadia and your holding response of 28th
February.
Whilst I accept that many First and Second Division Clubs
are presently up-grading their grounds for the forthcoming
1992/93 season; and replacing standing areas with seats
thus enabling them to comply with the requirements of Lord
Justice Taylor's Report,    I would still welcome     your
colleagues' comments.


Yours sincerely,
Tim Eggar, M.P.

                                        20th February 1992


Dear Mr. Eggar,
As you will see I live in your constituency and would
confirm that I have always supported the Conservative Party
and whilst residing in Enfield your goodself.

I am also a season ticket holder at Tottenham Hotspur and
am very worried that if all the requirements of the Taylor
Report   are implemented throughout the English League
Football grounds football itself will never, ever be the
same again.
Since the horrendous events at Hillsborough highlighted the
problems brought about by "caging" fans, the safety,
protection and control of those attending football matches
has become of paramount importance to the relevant agencies
involved   in ensuring trouble-free and      safe football
matches.   Gone are the restricting cages that were a
contributory factor to the disaster at Hillsborough,    and
gone too is the obligatory pitch invasion, which of course
was part of the reason for installing cages in the first
place.   Policing and stewardship is much tighter,   racist
and obscene chanting are actively discouraged.

I have only missed three or four 'away' games this season,
and obviously attend all home games.  I've visited Norwich,
Everton,   Leeds,   Sheffield   Wednesday, Notts    Forest,
Highbury, Selhurst Park, and many more grounds, and whilst
in the football ground not once felt that my safety was in
jeopardy, or threatened in any way.

Football is traditionally a working man's game - and
is supported most enthusiastically and vociforously by
those who stand, I would dispute with Lord Justice Taylor
that vocal support is the same whether fans stand or sit,
this is not my experience at all.        (Point 70 of the
Report).
If all seater stadia are introduced to the League Football
clubs we will lose:

a)   The standing capacity, the cameraderie     and   energy
     transmitted by these fans.

b)   Revenue by lessening capacity, the consequence would
     be higher entrance fees for fans, and less likelihood
     of 'away' fans gaining entrance to the match ground.

                          -   1   -
Mr. T. Eggar,                          20th February 1992




It would be extremely sad to see the traditional game of
football   'gentrified' with executive boxes, televised or
video screenings, you need to be at the ground - cheering
your team, showing encouragement, or dissatisfaction, and
all seater stadia will certainly curtail this, and lead to
attendance by those that can afford the seat; as has been
shown by the problems Arsenal and West Ham are facing over
their proposed Bond Schemes, which would seem to be one of
the only ways of raising revenue to pay for the all seater
legislation, and it is the fans who will have to pay. It
will change the face of football completely and somehow
 'plastify' it. At Ibrox Park you may be able to sit for £4
- £6 (Point 72) but I doubt you could anywhere else within
the first and second division now, let alone if the
legislation is finally implemented.

So many things today are taken over by big business,
'yuppified'  and I appreciate that football, with the
executive box, corporate hospitality, merchandising, share
options and debenture offers in some way has been taken
over, but football is still one facet of working class
culture that can be enjoyed by most of us at a price we can
afford.
I would ask you please take time to have a look at this
problem before we go too far down the road to all seater
stadia, our Clubs ARE safe, they have a high degree of
policing and stewardship, and the policing is strong and
forthright - the first sign of trouble, physical or verbal
abuse,  and the culprit is ejected from the ground, and yes
that's how it should be. Apart from that who wants to pay
£10 or £15 for a ticket to then be removed half way into
the game I
In writing this I hold Spurs in mind at all tiroes and the
comment of a colleague shown on one of the newspaper
clippings enclosed - "our days are numbered".    I paid £360
for the privilege of holding a Spurs season ticket.    In an
all seater stadium with a reduced capacity of approximately
25,866 would I be able to afford a season? I think not.

I would be grateful to receive your comments and advice, I
note that as a policy the Conservative Party wish to back
the Taylor Report 100%, and many of the measures recommeded
by Lord Justice Taylor have been implementedto the benefit
of the game, but I truly don't see how all seater stadia
will make local grounds any safer, and I would like to
think the Party I support could have enough vision to look
again and act positively      to preserve a    truly British
tradition.
                                         3/continued.
Mr. T. Eggar,                           20th February 1992




It is interesting that at Coventry City's ground, from all
seater they have reverted to accommodation for standing
areas within the ground (Point 74). The policing and
stewarding policy is extremely efficient and vigourously
enforced.
The F.A. and Football Supporters’ organisations are also in
favour of retaining standing areas (Point 66).

Who   bears the cost      of alterations with     restricted
admission,  and where   will the funding come from?      The
Football Trust yields   approximately 21% of turnover from
the three major Pools   Companies (statistics as at the time
Lord Justice Taylor’s   Report was prepared) per year = £9M,
the proposed cost of    converting say Millwall’s ground is
projected at £15M?
I appreciate that National stadia, such as Wembley, would
of necessity be all seater due to the wide variety of
events they stage, and that the European bias is toward
seating,  (various points under the  'Europe' heading page
14 of the Report), and appreciate that at a local level,
Clubs may well have to close their remaining standing
areas, when or if, they play European teams on the home
ground.
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. As you
will understand I do feel very strongly that to lose the
traditional standing fan would be a disaster to the game,
and to put it out of reach of the working person or family
would be a tragedy, and I look forward to your advice as to
how I can progress this matter further.

Yours sincerely,

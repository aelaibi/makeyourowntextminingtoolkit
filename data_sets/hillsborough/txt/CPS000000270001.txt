Dear Sirs

HILLSBOROUGH PROSECUTIONS

We are instructed in this matter on behalf o f the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire.

We attach a copy o f a letter received by the Chief Constable from solicitors acting for the
Hillsborough Family Support Group.

You will see that they request access to statements relating to the Hillsborough Disaster which are
currently held by the South Yorkshire Police.

This is a matter upon which the Chief Constable would appreciate guidance from the Director under
the terms o f Section 3 (2)(e) Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985.

By way o f background there are something over 3,700 statements many running to several pages,
and it is likely that a large number o f the statements have nothing to do with charges which have
been laid against M r Duckenfield and Mr Murray. We would appreciate guidance on the following
points:-

1.           Is it appropriate to provide the solicitors with access to the documentation?

2.           If documentation is to be copied is it appropriate to raise a charge for this service?

3.           Should original statements be allowed out o f Police possession as appears to be requested by
             the third paragraph o f the solicitors’ letter?

4.       Should any form o f undertaking be requested as to the return o f original or copy material
         when its purpose has been served?

There is another matter which is concerning the Chief Constable. This is the question of whether it is
appropriate for correspondence with the prosecuting solicitors to be disclosed to the solicitors acting
for M r Duckenfield and for M r Murray and if so whether they should be entitled also to access to
the statements or at least such o f them as are requested by and copied to the prosecuting solicitors.

Obviously the Chief Constable wishes to act fairly, but equally he would not wish this matter to be
dealt with on a different basis to that which might apply to a “normal” private prosection.

We look forward to hearing from you.


Yours fimhfully

Dear Sir

The Hillsborough Disaster 1989
Adlincton v Duckenfield & Murray

We write to inform you that we are instructed by The Hillsborough Family Support Group
who have taken out summonses against the above named who, as you will be aware, are
former South Yorkshire Police officers. We enclose copies o f the summonses for your
information.

You will appreciate that in a prosecution o f this nature, we have an obligation to the Court
and to the defendants to conduct the case fairly and efficiently. Of course we also wish to
have full information for the benefit o f the prosecution. We should be grateful, therefore, it
you would provide us with copies o f all witness statements in your possession. We realise that
it may take some time for you to comply with this request but at the very least we would ask
you to supply us, as a matter of urgency, with a com prehensive index showing the names and
addresses o f statement makers and the dates o f statements.

We would also request access to the original statements for the purposes o f serving the
relevant originals.

We are concerned that we do not have a complete set o f the statements as a consequence o f
the way the various investigations have been conducted up to now.

 We look forward to hearing from you.

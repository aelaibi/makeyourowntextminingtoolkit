              CRIME CORRESPONDENT

    SOUTH Yorkshire police officers m ay face
    legal action for the way they handled the
    Hillsborough football disaster following a
    report by the Police Complaints Authority
    being studied by Allan Green QC, the Director
    o f Public Prosecutions.
       The report, drawn up by officers from the
    West Midlands force, was sent to the D P P this
    week and follows seven complaints against
   seven officers, including C hief Superintendent
    David Duckenfield, the officer in com m and at
   the football ground on the day o f the disaster
   in April 1989 when 95 Liverpool supporters
   died. Mr Duckenfield has been suspended
   since the interim report by Lord Justicc Taylor
   last August.
      Apart from Mr Duckenfield the seven
   officers seen by the West Midlands team are
   understood to include the three superinten­
   dents on duty with him at the ground. These
   were Superintendent Roger Greenwood,
   S u p e rin te n d e n t B ern ard M urray an d
   Superintedent Roger Marshall. The team may
   not have made recommendations about all the
  seven and the DPP could decide no criminal
  charges are required.
      Yesterday neither South Yorkshire police
  nor the DPP’s office would co m m en t A
  spokesman for the D PP’s office said any
  decision on the report would take sojme time
  and staff had yet to consider the report in any
  depth.
     In his report on the disaster the judge
  severely criticised the police for their handling
 o f events at the FA Cup semi-final match
 between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
 The failure o f police control was held to be the
 main reason for the disaster.
     M r Duckenfield and Superintendent Mur­
 ray were accused o f misjudging the build-up at
 the Leppings Lane turnstiles, and did little
about it until they were given a request by
Superintendent Roger Marshall to open the
gates.
     Mr Duckenfield’s capacity to give orders
and take decisions collapsed. He also failed to
give an assistant chief constable a truthful
version o f events until some time later. Lord
Justice Taylor found many semorofficers were
defensive and evasive witnesses and he
accused the police o f unrealistically blaming
events on drunkenness among fans.

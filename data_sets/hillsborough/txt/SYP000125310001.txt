AND MAKE THREAT^ TO THE OCCUPANTS WHICH WERE MAINLY FOREST.

G53

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR QgBCFVAT IONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

THE POLICE APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SLOW IN REACTING BUT I THINK THAT WAS BECAUSE

THEY MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS HAPPENING BUT HAVING SAID THEY THEY COULD

HAVE STOPPED THE FEW SUPPORTERS FROM RUNNING OVER TO THE OTHER STANDS MAKING

<^pTURES, WHICH COULD HAVE CAUSED TROUBLE WITH THE FOREST SUPPORTERS      MAKING

THINGS WORSE.

G54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL    INQUIRY?

•1. THE AVAILABILITY OF ALCOHOL AND THE EFFECT IT HAD.

2.                          X
THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOME KIN& OF CHECKS BEFORE THEY GOT TO THE GATES AND

THOSE WITHOUT TICKETS COULD HAVE BE^N SENT BACK AND NOT ALLOWED TO MASS IN

SUCH NUMBERS.

3^ T H E R E SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE MOUNTED OFFICERS AND BETTER DEPLOYED AND FOQ1

OFFICERS.

HOLDERS.

 AT ABOUT 2.50PM (1450) IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,     IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT? (BRIEFLY)

 THERE WA S N’T A SINGLE SURGE, JUST A CONSTANT AND GRADUAL MOVE FORWARD. THIS

 WAS CAUSED BY FANS STILL POURING IN THROUGH THE TUNNEL.

 YES. THE GATES AT PENS 3 & 4 SHOULD HAVE BEEN OPENED A LOT QUICKER - AT LEAST

 FIVE MINUTES.     I’M SURE SOME PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF THE DELAY.

 NO IDEA.

 NONE AT ALL.

Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE HATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE EXTREMELY LONG DELAY IN GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THE PENS.    IT WAS ABOUT

TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE I GOT OUT, DURING WHICH TIME I FEARED FOR MY LIFE. IT

WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BREATHE.     IT SEEMED LIKE AT LEAST TEN MINUTES BEFORE

AN AMBULANCE ARRIVED.    I COULDN’T BELIEVE IT WHEN I SAW A LINE OF POLICE ACROSS

THE HALF WAY LINE WHEN PEOPLE WERE LYING DEAD OR INJURED. THEY OBVIOUSLY

EXPECTED THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS TO RUN AT THE FOREST END. THERE WERE INJURED

AND DYING PEOPLE LYING UNATTENDED. MANY OF THE POLICE OFFICERS MADE NO ATTEMPT

TO HELP. I STILL FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THE POLICE OFFICERS ON THE

TRACK JUST STOOD AND LOOKED AT PEOPLE WHO';:WERE HAVING THEIR FACES CRUSHED

AGAINST THE BARRIER



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I NOW REALISE THAT THERE WERE PENS NOT FILLED. THE SIGNPOSTING FROM THE

TURNSTILES WAS TOTALLY INADEQUATE.    IT SEEMED THAT THE TUNNEL WAS THE ONLY

ENTRY POINT TO THE STAND. WHY WAS THE MATCH KICK-OFF TIME NOT DELAYED,

B^ING    IN MIND THE SITUATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 THE POLICE AT THE WEST STAND WERE STANDING ON THE PITCH TALKING TO EACH OTHER

 AS IF THE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. THIS WAS AT ABOUT 3.30 PM (1530)

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THAT THE LATE ARRIVAL OF LIVERPOOL FANS AT THE GROUND WAS THE MAIN

REASON FOR THE DISASTER. PEOPLE WERE ARRIVING AT THE GROUND WITHOUT TICKETS

Atm GETTING INTO THE MATCH ALSO CAUSED THE DISASTER.

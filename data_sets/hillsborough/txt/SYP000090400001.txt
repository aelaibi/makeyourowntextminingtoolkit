             On the 15th A p r i l , 1989       <150489) my tele page bleep went off

             approximately 16.15 (1615).               I made my way to the Norther,

             Hospital       but because of traffic congestion did not arrive u

             approximately 16.50           (1650)      In theXintervening period my Senior

             Registrar Mr J L DUInICiC               aken the role of Surgical Controller,

             On my arrival         I liaise'd with him about the events to date and in

             conjunction with other members of the surgical                 staff,   saw all those

             who had been injured and admitted to hospital.                    I was not involved in

             the initial assessment of patients brought               into hospital who had died.

             Once all the casualties had been cleared from the Accident & Emergency

             Department and those in need of ventilatory support had been

             transferred to the Intensive Care U n i t , it was possible for us again

             to review all other           patients who had been admitted,         to ensure that all
                                                                        PAGE

         necessary investigations had been done and all necessary treatment

         i nst i tu t ed ,




         were admitted under m     ca      and we

         me and by my staff.

                   The Leader of Liverpool City Council Councillor Keva Coombes has announced
                   that all funeral bills arising from the Hillsborough soccer tragedy can be
                   sent to the City Council for payment.

                    Bills can be forwarded from anywhere in the                                 country thanks to the united '
                    action of local authorities-

                    Said Liverpool 's Director of Social Services Mr David-Mason whose department
                    is co ordinating services for the bereaved: "It is only right that families are
                    relieved of this burden at this time".

                    Meanwhile the Sheffield coroner is expected to hold brief hearings today (Tuesday)
                    though relatives are not required to attend. It is anticipated that the
                    coroner will be in a position to release bodies of victims and that no one
                    should have problems making funeral arrangements.

                    Anyone requiring assistance in making arrangements, no matter how small,
                    should contact the helpline on (051) 225 3413/3414.

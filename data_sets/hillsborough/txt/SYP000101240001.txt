although        it w a s       apparent                 t hat      they       had     been      drinking,            they were             w ell

behaved      and        in g o o d           spirits.

At    1345 C i a y w h e e l s          Lane        was          completely           f ull      of    s u p p o r t e r s ’ buses          and

and    two    mini       buses          at        this       location.

At    14H5    we w e r e        further             deployed             to     the    junction             of C i a y w h e e l s     Lane

w it h P e n i stone           Road North/Halifax                         Road.

We    positioned           ourselves                outside             the     public          house       situated          on    that

corner,       n a m e d The         Gate           Public          House.           Our     duties          were       defined        as

supervising             the     arriving                fans who          were        walking          down Halifax                Road

towards       us.

1 instructed             my        serial          to       form a filter              lane       of     officers           along      this

pavement        and      the        pavement                on    the    opposite           s ide      of     the      carriageway and

requested          them        to       inform          any       supporters           arriving             at    their       location

that       alcoholic           drinks             should          be    left     at    that       location.

As    I arrived, at                this       location ana                 took       up    this       point        I could         see     a

gooa       distance        up H a l i f a x             Road and           as    far a s         the     eye      could       see     I saw

that       there     was       a    cont inuous                  flow    of L i v e r p o o l         supporters            in g r o u p s

approx.       ten       abreast              on    both          sides     of    the       carriageway              coming         towards         u

The       majority        of       these          were       males        in the       lower age              bracket,         it was

very       apparent        to m e            that       a    large       amount        of       aiconoi          had    been       consumed

by    trie v a s t      majority              of    these          men.

A    large    number           of       them were                still     drinking             on t h eir        way    towards           the

grouna       and a        large          number             of    them were           halted ana asked                   to    leave

their       intoxicants                 at    t his         location.           Some       of    them       left- t h e i r        drinks,

others       insisted              on    consuming                t h e m at     this       location.               These      drinks

consisted          of    a variety                 of       cannea       Deers        and       lagers ,         bottles       of wine,

bottles       of     sherry.                 The    whole          of     the    wall       outside           The      Gate    public

house       became        heavily             littered with                   these        objects.

marshall        the      supporters.                The       passage            of    fans       had      now t h i n n e d     but

there     was      still       a number           of L i v e r p o o l           fans       still       making       the i r w a y          to

the    ground.

About     1508      1 was        w i t h PC       106 G o s s ,         I returned                to the        lounge      of      The

Gate    Public        House,          my    intention was                   to    speak          to the L a n d l o r d        to

request       him     to     arrange         tn e      removal          from          the w a i l       outside        of a l l       the

Upon    entering           the    publ i c        house          a    further          fight        commenced          between

rival     supporters             who were             in a d r u n k e n          state,          they were          separated              and

the    situation           remained          hostile             so    I summoned                the a s s i s t a n c e    of      further

officers.           We     then       ensured that                   this    public           house was            cleared       of all

these     persons.             1 was able              to     speak         to a n u m b e r          of t h e s e     persons          who

assured       me    that       they        had    tickets             and    intended             to a t t e n d     at    the      gam e.

About     1515      we     were       able       to    resume          from       these          premises,          the    street

outside       was     now      relatively              quiet          a n d we        liaised with our                 Commander,

Inspector          Townend.                                                                                                      ll

I can      recollect           during        this        period,            p r io r       to and w h i l s t        we    were                   ;

dealing       wixh       these        incidents             at       this    public           house,         listening         to      r adio

traffic       on m y       personal          radio,           the      messages             were      such      that      I felt        that

something          frightening              was       taking          place       at       the L e p p i n g s      Lane    end        of

tne    ground.           1 can        rec a l l       a request             being          made     to d e l a y     the    game

being     denied         and     an    officer           calling            on a       number         of     occasions         to

please       open     the      gate        ana    this        caller         was       obviously             in f e a r    that        if

tns    gate     remained           clo sed,           persons          would          be    injured.

we    then    proceeded           along          Penistone             Road       to       the    ground,          entering           via

tne    large       gates       adjacent           to t u r n s t i l e s          77-78.            It w a s       there    that        I

saw    two    ambulances              parked          in the          corner          close       to the        corner      of        the

Spion     K op.       There       were       two       persons           being         deposited             beside       these

ambulances          and      1 saw         that       an a t t e m p t       was       being made             at    chest

there        that       I was       approached                    by a n u m b e r              of    Notts,        Forest        supporters

who    offered            their      services.

With members                 of    our     serial,                I then went                   with       these         volunteers          to    the

passageway              between           the N o r t h               stand and             the       Spion Kop and               it w a s        there

where        1 saw        total      chaos,              a    number             of    bodies             were      being       carried up

that    passageway                 towards           the          gymnasium area                      by a n a s s o r t m e n t       of

supporters              and       emergency              personnel.

At    this,        i    instructed my                    officers                to    f o l l o w me          to    the    playing          are a ,

there        I was        confronted                by       the       sight          of    the w h o l e           of    the    playing          area

literally              covered with                 the       bodies             of    the       dead and            injured.           There

were     large          numbers           of     persons               also       present             on the         pitch who wer e

Shouts        from myself                 and       other        officers mer el y                resulted             in the        flow, of

I was      then          requested             to a s s i s t         in the       removal         of       all       deceased        from

this      location             into       the       gymnasium              itself.          Most       of    these          persons         were

This      area was             still        heavily             congested with grieving                           relatives

family.             A    lot    of       them were              not    helped        in t h eir         grief          by     them    being

drunk.          Th e      officers             on     this       line       were     placed        under          a    tremendous

strain        for        a number           of      hours,           having    to     cope w i t h           the       physical           ana

    cardan       to         search          for       their          loved ones.                We    explained             to     them       the

    position           that           to    allow         anyone            past       the     c o r d o n at      this       time       who       was

    not    there            for       the    purpose                of    saving        lives,        could        prevent          such       lives

    being      saved.

    This     gained              a mixed          reaction,                 some       persons        accepted              our    sound advice,

    but    others            physically                   fought          to     get    through           the    lines        and       had    to       be

    repelled.

    Throughout               my       period          on this             l i ne,      constant           comings           and    goings          took

    place      involving                   the    injured-                 Their        exit        was    severely           hampered             by    the

    selfish            attitudes             of       a    number           of    these        Liverpool           supporters.

    I was      s ho cke d as                the       day wore              on    by    th e    l ook      of    horror           and    revulsion

    upon     the        faces          of a       large             number        of    Police         officers             who    visited          this

    location.

    At    1730         I was          able       to a r r a n g e           a    short       break        from     the       cordon        tor

    myself         and       three          members             of m y          serial,        having        that       short       period          of

    time      out       of       tne       view       of       tne        public       g a z e , allowed           me       private

    thoughts.                I was          unable             to        understand          what      had      happened           and     for      a

    short       while            my    emotions                got        the    better        of me.

    At    1735         we    returned                 to b e i n g         P o l i c e m e n again,          our       personal          feelings

    were      put       aside,             and        we r e t u r n e d         to tne        line    and       continued           oar       duty.

    The    constant               barrage             from          grieving           relatives           continued,              arrangements

    were     made           for       them       to       be    transported              via        ous    to H a m m e r t o n         Roaa       Police

    Station,            this          seemed          to a s s i s t            the    situation,            relatives             were       at    l e ast

    able      to       find       someone             who       could           possibly        assist          them.

    However,            it       should          be       noted          that     prior        to     this,       an    Inspector             had       set

    up a      table          outside             our       line a n d            this    had        assisted           us    because          we    had

    been     able           to    direct          all          such        enquiries           to     him.        This       did    diffuse             the

    situation               to    a    certain              extent.

    We    remained               in s i t u           at t h i s          cordon until            being         r e l i e v e d at       about

    1615.       We      then          re-grouped                at C l a y w h e e l         Lane      Police          Garage       and       we    were

transported             back       to D o n c a s t e r      and    then Mexborough.

Between        16      and 21. 4. 89 ,( 16 04 8 9             and       210489)          with    PC T u r n e r ,       we    h av e

been     deputed          to c a r r y        out     Welfare       visits          to a n u m b e r         of o f f i c e r s     who

have     been       unable         to    f ac e     work     and    also       speak          with    officers          on duty.

They     have       all      suffered          no t    only       from       Saturday's          events          but    from      the

totally        biased         press          coverage.            Not    only       these       officfers         but       a number

of     their       wives      have       been       subjected           to v e r b a l        criticism.

My     thoughts         return          to    this     event,       I can recall                that       the    personal

Burndept           radio      I wa s         issued        with    was       totally          unsuitable          in a c r o w d

situation.

Turned        on    full      in n o r m a l        conditions           I wa s         unable       to h e a r       correctly

t he    radio       transmissions.

When     we    went       into      The       Gate     public       house,          I wa s      unable        to h e a r      any

radio     traffic.

Upon     entering            the    ground          then     the    radio          was    useless.

I can     also         now    recall          that     during       the       time       I spent        on    the      playing

area,     a Liverpool               supporter              coming       up    to me       and    saying          words       to   the

effect        t h at    we    had       fucked        up    their       chances          of    getting        back      i nt o    Europe

I can     also         now    recall          assisting           2 PCs       in    the       restraining             and    arrest

of     a Liverpool            supporter             who     was    trying          to    climb       the     fence      into      the

Spion     Kop       and      get    at       the    Notts     Forest          supporters.

DoE Briefing Material


1.   I attach a copy of DoE's draft briefing prepared in
readiness for their oral evidence to the Hillsborough Inquiry.

2.   The issues addressed are cross-referenced to evidence put to
the Inquiry jointly by the Football Association/Football League.
I think DoE would like our comments later this week, preferably
before Friday.  I am willing to do this if you wish although most
of the items seem to be hooligan/alcohol related rather than
safety.  I am not sure where the demarcation lies between F8 and
SARD on all this but I would have thought that DoE should stick
to Part I of the Football Spectators Bill.

3.   Home Office written evidence to  the Inquiry also covers some
of the points, including the sale of  tickets.  Are C4 content for
the DoE line proposed at item 6 of the draft briefing material?

4.   I think F8 and G2 also need to consider in readiness to
expand, if necessary, our line on pitch barrier fencing which
give^rise to differing views,-some strongly held as to their
value in relation to safety at football grounds.   I envisage
clearing any such line with DoE.

5.   Could you please let me have any comments by close of play
on Wednesday - telephone will do if this will save time.

HILLSBOROUGH - 15 APRIL 1989



I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police at present
stationed at Doncaster.


On Saturday 15 April,1989,         I was a member of Serial 26 which was Ps
2620 Cropley's Detail,and attended the Hillsborough Football Ground
for the match between Liverpool & Nottingham Forest.


On arrival at the Ground we were taken in to the North Stand where we
were Briefed by a senior Police Officer,            after which we were then
given refreshments,     after which we took up our positions on              Catch
Bar Lane and Parkside Road, having been instructed to patrol this
area with a view to controlling the arriving supporters.                   At this
time I was in company with Pc 184 Alan Geeson.


From around 2 30pm that date,           I was on duty at the junction with
Catch Bar Lane and Leppings Lane with other officers.                 About this
time   Ps   Cropley   left us     and   went in a Ford Transit       van with      a
prisoner.    The crowds     werebeginning to build up and it         was obvious
that many of them were the worse for drink and that a large number
did not have tickets.       Many of themwere drinking from litre           bottles
of   coke;wine   bottles    and   carrying   four   packs   and   Icould   smell
alcohol in the air.        Whilst I could not attribute the words to any
specific    individuals,    the   words   "ANY SPARES   WHACK?"    were    echoing
around me all the time.


As it got closer to Kick Off time, the crowds were getting denser in
front of the gates and at this point         we began to anticipate trouble
in the form of fighting outside the ground as irt was obvious so many
would not get in to the Ground, not because of the time element,but
because they had no tickets.
In the midst of the pressing crowds I could see a man whom I now know
to be Superintendent Marshall,              apparently hemmed in and unable to
move.   Directly       behind    him were    several       horseman,possibly         I    think
about   six,     who     from    earlier     talk     I    had    gathered      were       from
Liverpool,they also had different uniform and badges.                     These too were
unable to moved because of the crowd density - they were leaning over
on their horses         trying   to control        the crowd.      There was a further
senior officer standing on a wall to my right, holding on to a lamp
post,   and he     appeared      to be    trying to communicate on his                   radio.
Shortly afterwards         , I was joined by Inspector Humphries;                    Pc 1789
Flatman and Pc 184 Geeson and we were huddled round the Inspector's
radio trying to listen what was happening.                    I heard a voice on the
radio   saying     words    to    the    effect     that    the   match    could     not     be
postponed   as   the players       were on        the pitch.       The next message           I
recall was for all available officers to go on to the cinder track as
there was a pitch invasion.              In company with the other officers we
made our way down Leppings Lane,through some gates in to the Ground,
I think we went under the South Stand                and downa tunnel which              led on
to the pitch in front of the Liverpool               Supporters.


The first scenes I saw officers stood on the railings in front of the
Liverpool Supporters beckoning them to move back. At the same time
there were others        supporters      scrambling over          the   fence   on   to the
pitch and there were about between 50 and 100 already stood about
behind the goal.         At this time I 'still thought that it was a pitch
invasion and we made our way to the left hand side of the goal mouth.
From there it became'apparent that it was no ordinary pitch invasion
and that some of the people were injured. I began helping                          to carry
people from a gate, I believe this was Gate 3, on to the pitch. Some
of the injured appeared to be so badly injured I felt compelled to
adminster the 'kiss of life1 and this I commenced. The first person I
gave the kiss of life to came round and some other people then took
him away; I then helped to get another one from                         the gate,laidhimon
the pitch and again administered mouth               to mouthresusitation,               but it
became apparent that this person was not going'to respond. I looked
up at this moment and saw Pc Foster and Pc Geeson both trying to give
the kiss of life to other supporters.
I realised that the incident was now far more serious than perhaps
anyone could have imagined.              People were standing around shouting and
screaming at us to do something and I became aware that people were
ripping down the boardings and I assisted Pc Foster with the help of
other supporters to carry one of the injured to the far side of the
pitch. When we got there we did not know where to go; and we placed
the injured person in the rear of an Ambulance. I then went back to
the gate and assisted to move more on to the pitch. At this time I
remember there was a Sergeant at this gate,he was wearing a yellow
fluorscent      jacket    and I assumed he was           from Road Traffic.      He was
shouting at us to all work harder and faster and told me to get in to
the pen, which I did through the same Gate 3 I think.                          I made my
way up to a dividing fence with spikes on the top, through which I
could see lots of bodies laying on the floor , people were scrambling
on them and trying to get out themselves.                 Bodies were being passed
over this fence which had clothing placed on the top, both Police and
civilian   to        offer protection       from the spikes,      and I assisted to
carry them to the gate where they had to be lifted up and passed out
to waiting carriers.           I stayed there for some time, I am unable to
say how long.        This crowded area was almost clear when I found myself
standing on the sidelines,close to the point where I first entered
the Ground - "I have no recollection of leaving the pen area at all.
I can remember looking round and seeing a line of Police Officers in
the   centre    of    the    pitch   and    people   shouting,screaming        and       some
wanting    to    fight.        I   saw     the   Force   Scenes   of   Crime    Officer
attacked,punched and I think water thrown on him - he was wearing
civilian clothing.          ' I would like to add that during the time when I
was carrying the injured on the boards across the pitch we had to
queue in front of the Nottingham Forest supporters,and I remember one
of them pushed his way to the front of their pen, and spat on the
body on the stretcher; another Nottingham supporter ran up to him and
punched him, and two of them pulled the one who had spat on the body
to the back of the crowd and away from the fence.


Later in the day I remember sitting back in the North Stand where we
had first been briefed, and after that all I can recall is getting on
a ’bus to come back to Doncaster.                                                    /

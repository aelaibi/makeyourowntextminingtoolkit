then became           pressed agai n s t         the   barrier myself            and the       crowd    pressure

again     increased.           I could feel my           rib    cage against           the barrier and

began to        panic        even more     to the extent          that     1   thought        I was about          to

die.     I was       screaming and         shouting       for assistance.              I was    facing       the

pitch at        this    stage and         I saw slightly to my                 left hand side a Police

Officer        standing        by a gate w hich he opened a n d a s s i s t e d three                    or four

pieople out          onto the     pitch.     I saw a few more attempit to climb through

the    gate and         I saw the        same Officer          push the gate           closed.    Whether          what

I w i t n e s s e d at the gate           relieved the          pressure around me              I cannot       say,

but    I m a n a g e d to      push up off the           barrier     moving       the    pressure       from my

ribs to my waist.               There a p p e a r e d to be more           increase       in pressure which

left me        s u s pended from the         barrier       with my        legs    free off       the ground.

At    this     point     t    was aware     of something           soft    under my feet and             looking

shou t e d to everyone             behind me that          there was a dead person under my

feet.     At that        stage     the    pressure       relieved from behind me enough                       for me

to    place my feet            back   either      side of this         persons         leg.    I attempted          to

assist        him but        realised     it w ould      be futile        so    I continued to shout

that a person was               on the ground,           someone     behind me shouted back,                   “Weil

fucking        get    him up." At         this    stage    the     people       in front       of the    barrier

        stage apart            from fans           d i r ectly    in front      of me,         there was      no more

        crushing.           I remained         insitu for about 30 seconds                       and saw a young             lad

        from my ordeal,                my thoughts           returned to I                     and   I went     in search of

        her.       Prior     to finding my g i r l f r i e n d           I a s s i s t e d a youth of about              19/20

             d    the    tunnel,       whe r e I saw a f ew Po 1 i c e 0 f f ce r s as s i s t i ng t he

                        was among       either        the dead or        injured.         I later went          back    down

        the       tunnel     where      I was       conf r o n t e d by a Police           Officer who          told me       to

        go       back.    I e x p lained to him              I was a t t e m p t i n g    to    locate my g i r l f r i e n d

        an d he         let me through.             I stood       in disbelief at what                I was witnessing.

        I saw dead and              injured         people       everywhere.       As     I stood       pondering what             to

        were       both     relieved to have               found one another.              We both       left   the ground

        at a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1630 hours           (1630)     having     heard an a n n o u n c e m e n t      via

        the       loudspeaker          system       requesting        people     to      remain      in their     seats       etc

        until       all     the a m b u l a n c e s    had    left the stadium.

  Mr Bol ton
         A
  HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP

  I took this morning a telephone call from Mr Robert G Hughes MP.
  He had received Lord Ferrers' reply of 6 March to his letter of
  13 February to Mr Brandon-Bravo M P .

  Mr Hughes was very annoyed that a copy of Lord Ferrers' reply had
  been sent to Mr David Alton. He made the point that he was
  writing on behalf of his own constituent, and that this was no
  concern of Mr Alton. He said that the matter was particularly
  irritating as he had, in addressing his letter to
  Mr Brandon-Bravo, been using specifically party channels.

  I undertook to advise you of Mr Hughes' concerns, which should be
  borne in mind in future dealings with him and the Hillsborough
  Family Support Group.

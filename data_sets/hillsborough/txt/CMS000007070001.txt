            Following our most helpful meeting of 12 May I was pleased to
            receive your paper setting out in more detail your Authority's
            advice on the Taylor recommendations on all-seater stadia.

            I can assure you that I will give careful consideration to all
            your recommendations including both those of the divisional
            threshold above which you suggest all-seating should still be
            insisted upon and the legislative consequences of any revised
            policy.

            I have asked my officials to liaise closely with yours                      in
            carrying out any review, and I have no doubt that we will                   be
            seeking further advice from you.

            I am most grateful for the speed with which you have responded to
            my request.

As promised at our meeting on 12 May I attach the advice of the
Football Licensing Authority on the Taylor recommendations on
all-seater stadia.   We have condensed the arguments as far as
possible but would be happy to expand upon them if you so wished.
A short summary appears at the end of the paper.
SEATING OR STANDING?


A note by the Football Licensing Authority ("the FLA")



Background

In paragraph 61 of his Final Report on the Hillsborough Stadium
Disaster,       Lord Justice Taylor said:            "There is no panacea which
will achieve total safety and cure all problems of behaviour and
crowd control.          But I am satisfied that seating does more to
achieve      these      objectives     than       any   other    single    measure."
Accordingly       the     first     four     recommendations       in     the   Report
concerned the introduction of all-seated accommodation.                            There
were,    however,      72 further recommendations designed to promote
better and safer conditions at sports grounds.                    Those on seating
should, therefore, be assessed in the context of the report and
indeed of safety as a whole.


The arguments for a change of policy
2.      There    has    been   a    strong       campaign   in   recent    months     by
supporters'       groups and by some clubs against implementation of
the Taylor recommendations on seating.                  The main arguments have
been:


        a.   the removal of choice from spectators;


        b.   the cost to clubs and fans;


        c.   the safety improvements already introduced.


3.      Choice     The FLA recognises that the first argument is of
considerable       emotional       importance to many        football      fans.      It
submits,     however^ that, where safety is concerned - as with for
example car seat belts,             choice may need to be subordinated to
other factors.         In any event spectator resistance to seating is
sometimes exaggerated.             The concept of all seater stadia was not
invented by Lord Justice Taylor; despite the earlier unsuccessful


                                             2
*
    attempts at Coventry City and Queens Park Rangers, at a time when
    disorder was        still commonplace within grounds,               the trend was
    already towards all-seater stadia.                 The    FLA is aware of more
    recent cases,       for example at Bristol City where fans initially
    opposed the proposed replacement of a standing terrace by seating
    but subsequently readily accepted and used the new seating.                       In
    many cases the real complaint is about the likely increased cost
    to fans.         It is perhaps       significant that the most vociferous
    opposition        has    come     from   Arsenal   and    West    Ham     supporters
    aggrieved by the clubs' bond schemes.


    4.      Cost     The arguments about cost advanced by some clubs are
    largely self-interested.            Nor are they new.       In 1973 the Football
    Ler~ue begging bowl was brought out when it became clear that
    safety improvements would be needed under what was to become the
    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 ("the 1975 Act").                     There is no
    doubt     that    many    lower    division     clubs    have    severe    financial
    problems;        some    would    face   real   difficulty       converting    their
    grounds to all-seater even with support from public funds through
    the Football Trust.             Many such clubs could, however, do more to
    help themselves by better management and control of costs.                       The
    FLA has found instances of wages of up to £800 per week being
    paid to players at the bottom of the Fourth Division,                         to say
    nothing of exorbitant signing-on fees.


    5.      Furthermore, there is no automatic correlation between the
    progress being made on seating and the resources of the club
    concerned.        The first all-seater ground in the Football League
    is likely to be that of Ipswich Town, with Norwich City close
    behind.        Similarly the hardest cries on financial grounds are
    often not coming from the poorest clubs,                 nor indeed from those
    with most to do.


    6.   It is submitted that, while the financial position of clubs
    should clearly be taken into account, it would be unwise to base
    and announce any change of Government policy primarily on this
    point.     It would not sit comfortably with stories of extra


                                               3
*
    millions flowing into football (principally but not exclusively
    the Premier Division) from television.                      It would also be seen to
    reward the inefficient, the laggards and those prepared to invest
    in players but not in safety or facilities for spectators.                               There
    would be a real sense of grievance among clubs, including lower
    division     clubs        like   Walsall,       who   had    taken    on     considerable
    financial    commitments         to upgrade their grounds                  and now       found
    themselves       at   a    financial    disadvantage           compared         with    their
    competitors.


    V.      Safety     improvements             There      have     been         many       safety
    improvements at Football League grounds since the Hillsborough
    Disaster.        The picture is, however, patchy; much remains to be
    done.      During the season just ended,                the FLA Inspectors have
    uncovered numerous safety hazards (such as unstaffed locked exit
    gates).     There have also been a number of crushing incidents on
    terraces and in passageways where tragedy has only narrowly been
    avoided.     The FLA is seriously concerned about the condition and
    management of a handful of grounds and is looking for significant
    improvements before the start of the next season.                               While there
    is no automatic correlation, clubs with a low awareness and poor
    management of safety are often those who have made least progress
    towards making their grounds all-seater.


    8.      The FLA would, therefore, reject the argument that the all-
    seater requirement could now be abandoned because of improvements
    in safety standards and spectator behaviour.                              Indeed,   drawing
    upon the experience of its Inspectors, the FLA is convinced that
    properly designed and managed seating will always be safer than
    standing terraces.           While in their seats spectators do not face
    the dangers of surging and crushing which continue to result in
    injuries    to    those      standing   on       terraces.           It    is    also    more
    difficult for troublemakers to congregate                      in seated areas and
    potential trouble spots can more easily be identified.                                 In the
    ideal world,      therefore,       the FLA's preference on safety grounds
    would be for the Government to persist with implementation of the
    Taylor recommendations, subject perhaps to some extension of the
    deadlines.


                                                4
It




     9.      The    FLA     recognises,      however,         that the    ideal may not be
     attainable at least for some considerable period.                          While seating
     is to be preferred                on safety grounds,         it does not follow that
     standing is necessarily unsafe.                    It should be possible to provide
     reasonably safe standing conditions - though it should not be
     assumed that such conditions currently exist at many football
     grounds.


     10.     It is submitted that, should the Government be minded not
     to     enforce       all    the    Taylor    recommendations          on   seating,   its
     decision should be presented in terms of its concern to promote
     the highest standards of safety that were reasonably practicable
     given all the factors involved, including the size of particular
     grounds and the League status and financial health of the clubs
     concerned.       A decision not to proceed with some of the all-seater
     requirements could be justified on the pragmatic grounds that it
     would be inappropriate to single out and impose one requirement,
     however important,               in isolation.          Instead issues of safety and
     quality should be addressed                  in the round with priority being
     given to the most urgent.                   These might not necessarily in all
     cases        include       the    conversion       of    standing    accommodation     to
     seating.


     Consequences of a policy change
     11.     As    well     as seeming      to penalise         the    progressive   and   the
     safety conscious            (see paragraph 6 above)              a change of policy on
     all-seated grounds would have potentially adverse consequences
     for:


            a.      the Government's and the FLA's credibility;


            b.       safety on standing terraces;


            c.      the licensing system; and


            d.      public funding through the Football Trust.




                                                    5
t
    12.    Credibility         However carefully a change of policy on seating
    was presented, it would be seen as a Government climbdown in the
    face   of resistance            from the         football       industry     on top of         its
    previous withdrawal of the proposed membership scheme.                             While the
    effect of this would be much reduced if the change of policy was
    limited to lower division clubs, nevertheless the commitment of
    the Government and of the FLA as its executive arm to forcing
    through necessary improvements might be called into question.
    The    credibility         of    the      FLA    and      of   its   Inspectors        could   be
    damaged.      Since the Inspectors rely heavily on their credibility,
    rather      than    the    FLA's         powers,     to    persuade     clubs     to    improve
    safety,     any     loss    of credibility could                 seriously reduce their
    effectiveness.


    13.    In   the     event       of   a    further      disaster,       however    minor,       on
    standing terraces,              the Government would                 be vulnerable to the
    charge of having failed to take the necessary preventive action
    as identified by Lord Justice Taylor.                          The FLA has no wish to be
    alarmist.          However,      the risk of serious                 injury to spectators
    would undoubtedly be higher if standing terraces were retained,
    especially         in     the    higher         divisions.           Once    an   all-seater
    requirement         had     been       abandoned          it   would    be    difficult        to
    reinstate.


    14.    Safe terraces            It is widely accepted                (even by bodies such
    as the Football Supporters' Association) that, even if standing
    were to be retained, many existing terraces are of an inadequate
    standard.         The FLA has hitherto held back from tackling this
    problem only because standing areas have been due for phasing
    out.     It could         not maintain this               approach     in the event of a
    change of policy.           In many cases adequate standards of safety and
    amenity could only be achieved by rebuilding the terraces and
    covering them with a roof.                      This could cost almost as much as
    conversion to seating.




                                                     6
15.     It is, however, by no means certain that the FLA is equipped
with the necessary powers to require terracing of a sufficient
standard.       The    safety     of   terraces         is    covered     by    the     safety
certificate issued by the local authority under the 1975 Act,
though the FLA is empowered under section 13(2) of the Football
Spectators Act 1989 to require such terms and conditions as it
may    determine      to    be   included.             The    safety     certificate          is
essentially     a     certificate      of    the       safe    capacity        of   a   ground
provided     that     certain terms         and    conditions are met.                  If the
certifying authority (or the                FLA) identifies a safety hazard it
may reduce the capacity of the ground or area in question                                    (if
necessary to zero)          unless or until the necessary improvements
have been made.         These could         be so extensive that it made more
sense for the club to demolish and replace the existing terraces.


16.    Improvements cannot, however, be insisted upon.                          Clubs often
prefer to accept reduced capacities.                    Thus, for example, if crush
barriers are found to be defective,                    the club may merely remove
and not replace them.            Although the number of spectators may be
reduced, they will remain free to congregate in the same spots.
The barriers having been removed, they may be in greater danger
than before.


17.    It would appear that no condition relating to safety can be
attached to any licence to be issued under section 10 of the 1989
Act; nor can the FLA take account of safety when deciding whether
to grant a licence.         It could possibly attach conditions relating
to    the   control    of   spectators          and,    if     so     determined        by   the
Secretary of State, on amenity matters (such as the provision of
a roof).


18.    There are, furthermore, no criteria as to what constitutes
an    acceptable      quality     of    terracing             apart     from    the      basic
structural safety requirements set out in the Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds        (the Green Guide).           While considerable research
has been done on seating, the FLA is not aware of any that would
enable it to assess the overall quality and safety of terracing.


                                            7
♦
    It    would     be     necessary       for         such    research         to    be    conducted,
    preferably by or under the aegis of the Football Stadia Advisory
    Design Council - assuming that the football authorities continue
    to fund it.          But this will take time.


    19.     If standing accommodation were to be retained, the FLA would
    need     immediately          to    adopt      a       hypercritical            approach      to   all
    existing terracing with a view to tackling the great majority
    which fail to comply with the recommendations of the Green Guide.
    With a robust          approach the worst terracing could probably be
    improved,       though by how much                 is less certain until the local
    authorities          and/or    FLA have        been given            the    power      to require
    specific improvements.               Such an approach would bring the FLA far
    more into conflict with clubs and perhaps local authorities than
    enforcement of conversions to all seating where the requirements
    would     be    clear     and      well     understood.                  When    acting      against
    terracing, the FLA would risk having to operate initially without
    clear guidelines and to exercise greater discretion.                                   Clubs would
    face greater uncertainty.


    20.     Licensing        The purpose           and credibility of the                       licensing
    system could also be cast into doubt by a change of policy on
    seating.       With the abandonment of the proposed membership scheme,
    the     main    purpose       of    licensing            was    envisaged         as    being      the
    enforcement of the move towards and achievement of all-seating.
    (The Government announced last year that licences would be issued
    for the start of the 1992/93 football season but this is clearly
    no longer achievable.)               Were all the Taylor recommendations on
    seating    to     be    discarded         it       would       be    difficult         to    justify
    retaining      licensing,          especially as the Treasury is seeking to
    recover the full cost of the FLA through the licence fee from
    1994.     Yet    any requirements              on       seating      even       for the Premier
    Division alone would, under the existing legislation, require all
    Premier    and       Football       League     clubs       to       be    licensed.          Without
    licensing, it would be necessary to rely on voluntary compliance
    by the clubs as is the position in Scotland.                                    Given the recent
    campaign against the Taylor recommendations, this does not seem


                                                       8

    likely.           If    the   existing      policy     on   seating     is    changed,      the
    purpose          and    scope    of   the   licence      will    need    urgently     to     be
    reviewed.            Amending legislation may be required.


    21.    Public funding             The Government is already providing some
    £100 million over five years from the reduction in pool betting
    duty        to       clubs      for    implementation           of     all    the     Taylor
    recommendations.              An extension of this assistance for a further
    five years has been promised provided that the clubs show they
    are making good progress.               The Government would need to determine
    whether this additional funding should still be provided if clubs
    were no longer required to go all-seater and if so whether it
    should be tied to the                 installation of seating.                Without such
    funding many lower division clubs might not be able to upgrade
    their terraces to a sufficient standard.


    Dividing line
    22.    On strict safety grounds the FLA believes that there is no
    logical dividing line between clubs which should and clubs which
    should       not       go   all-seater.       Dangers       from     spectators     packing
    together and/or surging can arise on terraces of any size, though
    the longer and the deeper the enclosure the greater the number
    of people potentially affected.                       Any dividing line can only be
    pragmatic, as was that drawn by Lord Justice Taylor between the
    bottom of the Football League and top of the Vauxhall Conference
    (in    which         attendances      may   be       higher).        Should   a   different
    dividing line be sought,                the following would appear to be the
    realistic options:


           a.        a     line between the Premier League and the rest;


           b.        a     line between the top two divisions and the                   rest;


           c.        a     line based on ground capacity;


           d.        a     line based on attendances; and


           e.        a combination of b. and c.


                                                     9

    23.       The FLA would prefer a dividing line between divisions to
    one based on ground capacity or attendance.                                    While this could
    give rise to anomalies, because some Third Division clubs attract
    more support than some in the Second or even First Division, such
    a dividing line would be clear, unambiguous and easy to apply.
    It would reflect common practice in football whereby matters such
    as television fees, and indeed Football Trust grants, are linked
    to    a    club's       divisional             status.         Ambitious        clubs    in    lower
    divisions          would       be    encouraged               to    maximise      their       seated
    accommodation, especially if the period of grace for going all-
    seater after promotion was kept fairly short.


    24.       A dividing line based on ground capacity could be devised.
    But any figure chosen (whether 7,000 or 10,000 for example) would
    be arbitrary and more difficult to control.                                   It too would throw
    up anomalies: a ground's capacity may reflect the club's status
    of long ago and bear no relation to its present league position,
    crowd      size    or    financial             strength.           It    is   submitted       that    a
    dividing line based on capacity would only be worth considering
    in combination with                 one    based      on division,            and then    only       if
    Ministers wished to relax the all-seater requirement solely for
    the smallest clubs in the two lowest divisions.


    25.       A dividing       line based            on attendance            is not recommended.
    These can fluctuate greatly depending upon the club's current
    form and the identity of the opposition.


    26.       Assuming that the all-seater requirement is to be retained
    for   at     least      some    grounds,          the    FLA       considers     that    the       most
    appropriate dividing line should be between the top two divisions
    and the rest         (option b. above) .                 This would catch most of the
    largest and best supported clubs.                         The FLA would argue strongly
    against      any     limitation           of    the     all-seater        requirement         to    the
    Premier      Division       alone         because        of    the      continual   interchange
    between the two top divisions.                        Unless both were required to be
    all-seater, there would be a significant risk of clubs entering,
    playing and maybe even achieving success in the Premier Division


                                                       10
9
    and Europe without having gone all-seater.                   This would make a
    nonsense of any all-seater policy.                 Although the same objective
    could perhaps be achieved by restricting entry to the Premier
    Division to clubs with all-seated grounds,                   this could mean a
    club's league status being determined by Government policy rather
    than its performance on the field.                 This would be particularly
    controversial.


    Deadlines
    27.     The     FLA   recognises        that the 1994      and    1999     deadlines
    recommended by Lord Justice Taylor were tight.                     Some clubs may
    genuinely have difficulty meeting them because of circumstances,
    such as planning delays, over which they have no control.                           This
    applies        particularly     to     clubs who are      seriously       trying      to
    relocate.        Nevertheless, the FLA considers that tight deadlines
    are necessary to convince              clubs that the Government          is serious
    about all-seating.          Unless kept under pressure, many              clubs will
    continue to prevaricate.


    28.     The    FLA would    not      advocate    a general   relocation        of    the
    present deadlines for going all-seated.                   Clubs have been aware
    of them for a long term; last summer they were advised to keep
    the FLA informed of any problems.                 Those who are serious about
    going     all-seater      are   working    to    the   existing    deadlines.         A
    general relaxation now would favour the laggards.                   Nor would any
    revised deadline be regarded as final; some clubs would soon be
    seeking further concessions.             Were Ministers nevertheless minded
    to relax the deadlines,              the FLA would advocate a delay of one
    year to 1995,         but for the Second Division only.             This could be
    defended on the grounds of the uncertainties of the past three
    months.        Any further delay would be difficult to reconcile with
    the promise to provide a further five years'                     funding from the
    relaxation of the Pool Betting Duty (see paragraph 20).


    29.     The FLA would,      however,     support extensions for individual
    clubs     in    two   circumstances.           Clubs   promoted   to     the   Second
    Division should continue to be given three years plus the close


                                              11

    t   season to go all-seated;                in addition,       the FLA should have the
        discretion to grant a limited extension to a club in clearly
        defined circumstances.             Clubs would have to demonstrate that they
        had made genuine efforts to meet the deadline but would narrowly
        miss the target because of circumstances beyond their control.
        The   FLA would       need    to   be    satisfied       that    the    club was      fully
        committed to a realistic programme.                     Lack of funding could not
        be accepted as a justification for extending the deadline lest
        every club advanced this argument.


        Conclusion
        30.   The recommendations of the FLA may be summarised as follows:


              a.   Safe       seating      is     always       safer     than    and is    to     be
                     preferred to standing, however safe (paragraph 8).


              b.     Retention of some standing capacity could be justified
                     on   pragmatic butnot              financial       or   safety    grounds
                     (paragraphs 6, 8 and 10).


              c.     The credibility of the Government and FLA's commitment
                     to   safety      could      be    damaged     if   standing      areas     were
                     retained (paragraphs 12-13).


              d.   Much existing standing capacity is of an                           inadequate
                   standard;         the FLA       would need to be given additional
                   powers to require major improvements                         (paragraphs 14,
                   16 and 19).


              e.   The purpose and scope of the licence will need to be
                   reviewed          urgently         should    the     existing      policy     on
                   seating       be     changed;           amending     legislation       may    be
                   necessary (paragraph 20).


              f.   As     a   minimum the             all-seater      requirement should         be
                   retained for clubs in the top two divisions.                           The




                                                      12
          dividing   line   between   those   required   and those   not
          required to go all-seater should be divisional status
          not ground capacity or crowd size (paragraphs 23-26).


     g.   The existing deadlines should be retained, albeit with
          discretion for the FLA to grant limited extensions to
          individual clubs (paragraphs 28 and 29).

m in u te s after         kick-off.

The are a was            crowded and we had to queuhs^ fqfr a few minutes                            to get       into

the stand turnstiles.                   It was       not    clear w h ic h t urnstiles we              should

use?     I thought         the s i gn in g was           poor and not      terri bl y       clear.

Once     in the stand area,                 we    ran towards      our seats,           trying    to find

*T ’ Block.           I raced      past Block            "J ’ , only to be        called     back    by my

b e f o r e h a n d and    there were             many    people    on the    pitch.        There was

o b v i o u s l y m uch    c o nf us io n        and the    players were          beginning       to leave the

pitch.           It was    clearly obvious            to me that        there were          too m an y     people

in the       centre       se c*L4on of           the L ep pings Ln terraces.

After about 30 mi n u t e s \                    went for a walk towards                the Pen is to ne end       of

onto     the      grass    and saw m a n y P o n c e         wit h dogs.          Four of the dogs were

barking          loudly and were            clearly agitated.             One dog was           on his     hind

legs and the Police                hand le r was         having    great     d if fi c ul t y    in restraining

him from a t ta ck in g           spect at or s      on the field of           play.        In this      confined

                 n the    dogs were         somewhat       provocative.           The    remainder       of the

| Star reporter Donna Saul pays tribute on
I behalf of her fellow Liverpudlians to the
I people of Sheffield for their compassion in
I     the wake of the Hillsborough tragedy.
| NORTHERN Ireland is a place where tragedy is all too
  common, where death c u ts Its shadow over families so many
  times.                                                 U
     But the enormity o f the Hillsborough disaster was too
  awful even for the strife-torn Irish to take in. And It reduced
  me to tears.
     Scores o f people from my home city had died in my
  adopted city. And I could only watch helplessly as the disas­
  trous sequence of events was played and replayed on tele­
  vision, as fellow Scousers screamed before the life was
  squeezed out o f them.
     If only I had been able to transpose myself from my holi­
  day hundreds o f miles away across the Irish Sea to the centre
  of Sheffield, to stand at the roadside and direct people to
  hospitals.
     I wanted desperately to open up my home for those visiting
  their injured loved ones, or to go to the hospitals and hope my
  accent would be some comfort for the sad, shocked familes.
«    My boyfriend, whose home in Ireland we were visiting, was
  desperate to get back to work as a doctor at the Royal




I
  Hallamshire Hospital.




       When I heard the numbing news from Hillsborough, I
     panicked. My dad, a lifelong Liverpool fan, has been to
     several FA Cup Finals without a ticket and has obtained one
|    outside the ground.
*      He would have loved to have been at Hillsborough, as
>    would I, but a quick inquiry to Star Sports Editor Derek Fish
     revealed that tickets were rare.
        As the enormity o f the events unfolded, I had to get back
e    quickly to ring home — to find that my dad had already
     called, to check that I had not returned early to Sheffield and
r    gone to the match myself.
II      Next door to my parents, concern was growing for a
y    grandson who had gone to the match, but he returned un-
e    scathed — except emotionally.
^      Then, next door to us on the other side, the boy I grew op
     with discovered his best friend died in the crush.
'       Scanning the list o f the dead, I discovered the name o f a
3    brother o f one o f my schoolmates,
f       I am hoping to attend the memorial service in Liverpool a!
t    week on Sunday and am determined to take with me the deep
i    sympathy o f the people o f Sheffield which I am sure will be
i    gratefully reciprocated.
        Sheffield is the city where many Scousers lost their loved
 i   ones. But it is also the place where they found compassion.
     And they will never forget this._____________ ___________

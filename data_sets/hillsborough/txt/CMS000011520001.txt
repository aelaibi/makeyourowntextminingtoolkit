From the P rivate Secretary                                27 July 1992




              TICKET TOOTING IN RESPECT OF FOOTBALL MATCHES

     The Prime Minister has seen the Home Secretary's minute
of 26 June and the subsequent correspondence.

     Although the Prime Minister believes that additional
regulation is, in principal, unwelcome, he accepts that the
Taylor recommendations make it difficult not to take action.
However, he does not consider the Bill to be a priority and,
given the difficulties in finding Parliamentary time, believes
that a handout Bill seems a sensible way forward. He
understands that the Home Secretary is currently working on
such a Bill. He has commented that in drawing up the Bill,
care should be taken to ensure that the enforcement provisions
are not unwieldy and to minimise the risk of successful
amendments on touting outside other sporting occasions.

     I am copying this letter to Private Secretaries to
members of EDH and to Sonia Phippard (Cabinet Office).

Dea r Sir,


             May        I        h u mb ly       v e nt u re       to      speak           for       the     many         survivors          of
Saturday's                  tragic           events         at H i l l s b o r o u g h w h os e            views will             never      be
stmght           by         tribunals               but      who        we r e    not        on ly      w it hi n the            im me di at e
v i c i ni ty      of           events         at     the     Leppings            Lane        fend     but    who,         but     for      the
grace        of       God,         would         hav e      been         u na bl e      to      speak        of    the     afternoon's
happenings.


             On my " e t u r n               to C h e s h i r e      I was t e m pt ed to put                     my thou gh ts do w n
on      paper           in        a       letter          which
                            I     expressed               at that         time         a        delight           at the         sensitive
m anner          in wh ic h e v e n t s h ad been c o v e r e d in the press but al so a fear
that,        when        the          tears         had     been     staunched               and      conclusions            were        d ra wn
concerning                      the          c a us es         and            solutions               of          suc h          tragedies,
sensationalism                        w ou l d      rear     its        ug ly     head.          I    was     right.         After        just
th ree        days,              comments             are      being           mad e       concerning              the      conduct          of
Liverpool               supporters                  w h i c h are        no      less         in se ns i t i v e and             malicious
than t ho se of the f o o li sh Frenchman,                                       G e o r g e s Jacques.


             On behalf of the m a n y s u p p o r t e r s w ho do not                                        c o n s u m e barrels of
ale     before           they          make         their      way      to the ground,                  w ho d o       not       turn     into
anima l s the moment                         they pass t h r o u g h                  a t ur ns t i l e and who do appla ud
the     opposing                 s id e     when      the      occasion           demands,            may     I describe             co olly
and w i t h detachment,                          the e v en ts as I s a w them.


             I     am        a                                                                                                    ind,
t o gether         wi th my t we n ty - f o u r                year           old son,           left      h o m e at       11-00 a m to

o u t s ki rt s of Manchester,                            we did not             re ac h the g r o u n d until                   a quarter
to th r ee by                w h i c h ti me           c o n d i t i o n s at     the tu r ns t i l e s w e r e incredible.
I    t hink        at        this           point I       must      emphasise              the       fact    that          I h ad never
bee n    to H i l l s b o r o u g h              b e fo re     and w o u l d           hav e     e x p e ct ed      bo th a s s i s t a n c e
in    finding               the        correct            entrance         and        som e      guarantee            to     a    st ra ng er
that,        o n c e inside,                my path wo u ld lead to a sa fe v a n t a g e point.


             That       neith er of these was o f f er ed me I do not a t t r i b u t e to any
s i ng l e       factor.              But      th er e     are ma ny           observations                I can      make,       Firstly,
unlik e A n fi el d wh er e t u r n s t i l e s are in pairs and s p r e a d at in t er va ls
around            the           perimeter             of     th e       ground,            at        Sheffield            they      are      in

 policeman              at       Anfield            can       m arshall              t w en t y      yard           queue s           t h r ou gh         the

 s u pp o r t e r s         at    the        possibility                 of    not      seeing              the       start           of       play       and

 situation              which           a     handful           of       constables               on        foot        could          ne ve r          ha ve
 hoped        to    cop e         with.           No     wonder          a     s e ni or       offi ce r              feels       justified                in
 defending              his       undoubtedly                 incorrect              decision              to       open        the exit                gate.
 The c r isis was a l r ea dy in the making.


            Nor,            for        the         stranger              arriving              at          the        ground,               were          the
 e nt ra n c e s        log ic al ly              labelled.              Most        g r o un d s      label            their           turnstiles
 alphabetically;                       not      so      Hillsborough.                   Anyone             carrying              a     ' B'       ticket
 might        have          expected              it     to     be       somewhere                b e tw e en          'A'       and           'C ' .     Not
 here.        Amid          a    noisy         throng,          my       son      and      I gathered                   in       this          vi c in it y
 until        we    sj|w #             string           of    cursing            supporters                    t ur ne d        away           fr om     the

these         are           amongst           t ho se        r e p or te d        as       'not        having               a    ticket'?)                 On
asking         a    policeman,                    we    were         directed             to      the          ' B'     turnstiles                    which
wer e     o u ts id e            the        r a i l in g s      and       a r ou nd        a      blind           corner. It                was         her e
that we found the g a t e open.                                  It was n o w almost                           ten m i n ut es to three.


           May          I say          her e      that        the s u p p o r t e r s           making              their        way           into      the
unlit      p a s s a g e w a y under the s tands - no s t e w a r d s wer e their to a dv is e
otherwise               -       were        not        drunk,        not        aggressive,                    not      'crazed'                 as      one
t a bl oi d        has          suggested.              Som e     were          singing             their             partisan              c hants         -
a fter        all       th ey          wer e        t he re      to       support              their           team.            But        I     saw      no
i ns ta n c e s         of        unruly               behaviour,               no       bad-tempered                       melee.               Indeed,
probably            a       mit e       dramatically,                     I     ha ve      s in ce             l i ke ne d       them            to      the

because          my       son        is    agile           and      healthy              and      was       able      to     fight           h is    way

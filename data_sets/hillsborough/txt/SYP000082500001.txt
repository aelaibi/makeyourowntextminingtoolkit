           On Saturday 15 April                1989,     I was detailed to work at the Semi Final at

As the day progressed and the match kick off t ime/approached PS

Cropley formed the opinion our need was g r e a t e r/ a t         the Leppings Lane

end of the ground so for a great amount of the time we were                     in that

location.     Because of the density/6f the supporters entering Leppings

Lane from our direction it was jaecided by a Senior Officer to stop all

t raffic entering Leppings Lan;

At this point I must add that 1 was in possession of a personal                       radio

which was on issue to me from Doncaster.             I was monitoring all

relevant radio traffic.      PS Cropley had      I   radio issued by the ground.

Sometime before 2 pm myself and PC Fos/er were approached, by the

Manager of the local    supermarket    in Qatchbar Lane,           who had been

se l ling drink to the Liverpool    f an s/   We advised him to lock his door

and only admit his regular     customers.       We monitored the supermarket

and he appeared to take our advice.

As kick off approched    it was quite apparent that most of the adults

approaching the Leppings Lane end of the ground were under the

influcence of alcohol    to a varying degree.          Some were quite drunk.

Many were carrying    cans and bottles of drink.              The fans were streaming£

down to the ground and due to their numbers we were powerless to take

remedial action.     Sometime shortly before 3 pm PS Cropley a r r e s t ed a

pe rs on, and took him in a van to the ground.               This left ouj/ s e r i a l

without a supervisory officer,      and if it was not for my/radio,                 we

would have been out of contact with Police C on tr ol.Between 2. 30                      and 3

pm the flow of fans seemed to increase further and.

from the higher vantage     point I could see a large congregation outside

the ground at the Leppings Lane gate.

Roars were heard which indicated to me that the players had come onto

the pitch or play had started.        This    resulted       in the fans still

approaching    rushing down to the back of the crowd outside the groyrid.

At around this time X can remember        ^adio traffic          requesting     tFy^gates
                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                      S2676

to be opened.         Again shortly after this the area seetney to be

clear of fans.

Again I heard a ^ra^io mejs^igfe rec^jjpsting a s s i s t a n t on the cinder

tr ac k.P C’s Foster,     Geeson, / H a r r a P a n d m y s e l f , I can remember   ran to

the ground,        through the gate and made our way to the Cinder Track in

front of the Leppings Lane Stand.               (The West Stand).

We were amongst the first officers to arrive at this point.                          L can

remember a supervisory officer telling us to Link A r m s.                    I pci s re gar ded

this order because        I could see that people were            in need o/P urgent

ass i st a nc e.

I went to the gate marked 2 on the ground plan at the West Stand

terracing.         This gate was open and at the time police were not present

in great numbers and supporters were clawing their way out of the

gate.     These     people were    in a state of panic and making            little headway

as several were trying to get through the small gate at once.

 Together with some other officers,              several    people were pulled out

of the gate enabling myself and another                policeman to get into this

enclosure,     regulating the flow and allowing quicker escape.

By this time jrfead and seriously injured casualties were being                       passed

to the gate from ins ide the pen.y/With the assistance of one Liverpool

fan in particular,        the uninjured/slightly injured were

restrained to allow the more serious              casualties to be rescued.

Several    times I had to use force to restrain fit and able fans from

blocking the escape           route of seriously injured people.

Eventually after some period of time which I cannot recollect other

Police Officers        came    into this particular      pen and the remainder of the

dead/casualties were           removed.   I stayed in the pen until           no

further    casualties were        left.   I cannot say if any of the injured

people were from this           pen or if they had climbed over from adjoining

pens .

           It as only on leaving the pen and returning to the pitch that I became

           aware of the enormity of the catastrphe.     1 can remember seeing many

           people laid on the pitch but, due to my previous efforts,        was both

         I mentally and physically exhausted and   I was not able to assist greatly.

              Further to my recollection that I made                       concerning the Hillsborough

              disaster I would just like to add that today I have been shown variou;

              video tapes and photographs by WPC       of the West Midlands Police.

              On a video tape ref no MAP                 1 at a time 15.26.55.05 I can be seen

               inside gate 2 d i rectly to the right hand side this                    is a position I

              maintained throughout the rescue operation and I made sure that the

              gateway was kept clear so as when other officers brought over to the

              gate the dead and injured they were able to pass them straight out to

               people on the pitch.             I also assisted passing numerous bodies through

              but only came into contact with them for a few seconds and                         cannot

               identify any of them.

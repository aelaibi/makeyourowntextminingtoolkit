I was still         stuck a nd being               crushed.        Peopl e were now climbing            over

dead-         I saw in front of me a lot of                     people       in a c o ll a ps e d    condition.

I do not know             if they were dead or not-                    The     only one that I can

remember was a blond h a i r ed                    lad.     He was     about 20 y ea rs       of age.         He

was either a tall             lad or had been pushed up in the                         crowd.       He had

nonnal        length hair-          He was        clean shaven.         I can        not   remember what           his

          was    like-       He was         about 5 or 6 y ar ds a wa y from me              and     1 kept

looking at his face-                  I do not tt>ink that              he was       breathing.

was    pulled up into the s t a n d .                 I m o v e d back and        then     looked onto the

pitch-         I could see         people        being    given m o u t h to m o u t h and heart

realised that             people    had died.             In tne    pen I was        in 1 know that a

barrier had broken.                 At      the    time    I was    not aware        of this.       It was    only

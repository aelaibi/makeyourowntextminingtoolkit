                                        v,
that a short         time    prior      to this he had seen men               leave a car on his

forecourt and all            were      drunk.



At 2.15      pm    (1415)    whilst at the same              lo/ation y w e     we n r a p pr o a c h e d by

numerous youths were              sat on his                           one/foot     high),     urinating

                                                                                                                   S3467

          were sitting        on    it consuming             their     cans of beer and bottles               of beer

          lager?     cider,       even    and once f f n p j r g / t h e s e items were just
                                          champagne,

          left on the ground.   We spoke to PS 2 6 2 0 / C R G P L E Y who was passing and
                                                  'S-
          told him of this.   He spoke to                                 ind then went and

          spoke    to several        of the youths,              some     of who m      left the wall.



          At 2.4 0    pm,    (1440),          we were situa te d with other O ff icers at the Catch

          Bar Lane     end,       after       the general        a tm os p he r e    of steady     influx     of

          supporters        had    rapidly        changed      into a mass          of supporters walki ng            very

          fast    towards     the ground and Lappings Lane.                            It was    like Moses and

  #       fri.nd. . . i n n ,             a            - y o u T . not golng to 5top u. . „roup through

          the Red Sea.



          The arrival        of this          type   of supporter was               changing     the atmosphere,

          making     it electric.              They were shouting and obv io us ly had been

          drinking.



          I saw    individuals a ct ua l ly             being      sup po rt ed by one or two mates                 because

          of their     drunken state.                Their     language was            obscene at times.



          A man with a Liverpool                 accent       came to us and warned us that some Notts

          suppoters     had j o i ned thei r s t r e a m ^ nd/a fight was                       pendi ng .   As he

CAT       s poke a small          scuffle       broke a x f y l y g y u e e n   some youths and we a ss is t ed to

C^SOIBfe^-^part them.        They had no             injuries and they              rejoined the masses

          converging        on L e pp in gs Lane.            We a c co m p a n i e d    this mass     nearer       to the

          ground and the same                 stream    passed us wit h individual                 cases     of extreme

          d runkenness       but m ai n ly boisterousness.



          For    the first        time,       from 2 . 4 0    pm (1420),         I felt    that    there might well

          be trouble        in the form of fights,                   etc.

Part     o f this     time was       taken up in removing         bottles and      cans from the

 pavements and            placing    them in bins w hi ch were overflowing             with bottles

and     cans.       I feared they might well             be used as weapons        later.



A bout 3.0 0 pm,           (1500),      there was    some sort    of incident      taking     place at

 the ground,         as our      Inspector was       conversing with the S er ge an t about

 it,    but none of us knew what was                 happening    or if a ss is t an c e was    needed

 for a fight,         etc.       News    filtered    to me that     there was some sort of

 crushing       going     on.



       3 .05   pm   (1505)      we were     directed to the Leppi ng s Lane          entrance       to

prevent        persons     entering        the ground and turnstiles,         etc.     We a ct ua ll y

/tried to form a line across                  the front    of the gates      in the    forecourt

a rea a d joining         the    road.



An am b u l a n ce    had a r ri v ed and      I could see that a man was            carried to it

who a p p e a re d to have          lost    facial   colour.     Men with him were         screaming

at us words          like,      "Why the fucking       hell    d o n ’t you get   in there and

 help them.          People are dying."



An elderly man a p pr o a c h e d me and told me that many                   people    had been and

were     being      crui/hed in the ground at the West S tand nearest                     to us,     and

that  people d e r e dying.  An Officer known to me and in another serial,
  N ~~i © o { 2 > /
PC 469 S H A w / heard this and in view of the desperate nature of what we

 had heard and seen,              we went     together    to the ground entrance,            past the

ambulance.           We    could not       find our supervisors       to tell     them.



As we neared          the West S ta nd we saw          persons    being helped out,          some

 wa l k e d wit h a ssistance,           some were    carried on stretchers,          etc,    some

                                                                                                           S3467

             were a pp a re n tl y    dead or dying.          Persons were        still     shouting abuse at

             us an d were      ex tr em el y upset,       demanding      that Police        help those    in the

             stand.



             M yself and PC                        nto the     pitch where we were            shocked to see

             what was    takin                    We    ran to the entrance         behind the goal        area

             where    supporters,         Police and others were           trying to/p               pie out of

             on boards       to the are a      in front      of the gymnasi                 Doctor     told me to

       n A   assist    him to separate and              prioritise      casualty treatment.            We tried to

             keep the dead and            the dying apart,         but after a short while             he replace!

             us wit h a w o m an      I took    to be a nurse.



             We were    later     i nstructed by a Police              Inspector with the doctor           to

             prevent    persons       entering and        clogging      up the entrance are a to the

             gymnasium,       w h i ch we   did with several           other    officers.



             On occasion we were             confronted by d is tr e ss e d       p a re nt s/ re la ti ve s and we

             had no choice        to a l l ow some       to enter.



             At 4.45    pm    (1645),       I returned with PC SHA W to the main gate on

             Le ppings Lane where           numerous O ff icers were gathered.                   I rejoined my

Leaving      supporters were         subdued and we ail           felt that to arrest         or warn

the    odd few that shou te d abuse at us and blamed us for killing

supporters w ou l d have           caused more     trouble   than it w ould have

solved.       We felt at a very            low ebb.



We    told other O ff icers what            had taken    place and the estimate          of

deaths,      etc,   and they       could    not believe    it.



Some    of us feared a r ep er cussion and              riotous     behaviour w ou ld follow

then or a short time              later,    or more   probably that        night   in the     city,

but    looking      back most      supporters,     etc, were      deeply shoc ke d and        in

disbelief.



W hen the m ain body of supporters                had dis pe rs ed no one seemed to know

what    to do.      We f ol lo we d our      Inspector and Sergeant and wa lk ed

a i m l e s s l y towards   the    city,    in groups,    wit h    leaving s upporters        or

others      queueing    in cars a lo ngside        us as we wa lk ed along         the   pavements.



We    veered off      into the      park and     returned to the N orth S ta nd at

H i l l s b o r o u g h ground for a de-briefing.



At 6.1 5     pm   <1815),    we were       taken by bus to C l a y w h e e 1s Lane Road

Traffic      building where we had a hot meal.



At 6 .5 5    pm   (1855),    we set off for Doncaster              by b u s .



At 7.45      pm   (1945)    I ended duty at Don ca st er Police Station.

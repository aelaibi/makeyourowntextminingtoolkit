I enclose a copy of the transcript of the evidence which Mr Derek Bruder gave to Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith, which you have requested on behalf of Mrs Anne Williams.

I am sorry for the delay in forwarding this. Perhaps I can say that, following a conversation
with your office on 15 January, I was expecting a fax to confirm that you did in fact require it.
That did not arrive. There seems to have been a little confusion about this - in my own mind
at least - possibly stemming from the fact that your letter asking for the transcript arrived here
on 4 December, when I was on Scrutiny business elsewhere.

I confirm that we have Mr Bruder’s permission to let you and Mrs Williams have a copy of
the transcript.

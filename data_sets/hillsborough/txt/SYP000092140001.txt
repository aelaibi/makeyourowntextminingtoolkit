           On 15 April                  ( 150489)           I went to the FA Cup sjrtfti Final match

           between Liverpool and Notts Forest.                             I am a/tfiverpool supporter,              I

           got m y ticket from a f r i e n d .                  11 was a          standing ticl &tr for Leppings

                      We travelled by car.                     We arrived in                  j.d at ab          3.30

           h rs (13             We parked in a side road ab                          5-10 minutes w a 1k from the

           g ro und ,

           On the way to the ground I did not see any supporters drinking                                        in the

           streets,           I saw some Police-Officers on the corner of streets that

           were   cordoned off.              I              not see any fighting or anyone who was drunk,

           I arri ved at the jralind at about                      1340 hrs       (1340).        There were

           queues I just warn straight                        in to the ground.            There were

                                                                                    S3640

 Officers by the turnstiles but I did not see any stewards.                     I went in

 through a turnstile.            I did not see any one climbing over the walls to

 get into the ground and I did not see any of the big gates open.

 Once    inside the ground I did not see any signs directing me where                     I

 had to go.       All   I saw was tjj*l
                                      ''tunne 1 and I presumed I had to go

 that w a y .              <■^
                  1 went down^ffne t u n n e l , I had full    passage down

 there and w ent i n t j r pen 4.        I did not see any Police Officers at the

 entrance to the^tunnel           or any stewards I did not see any drunks or any

 disorder       inside the ground.When I first went           into the pen I was with

           the other two had gone into the stand           ne side.  The Pen
                                           CD,
 gradually filled up and at about 1400 hr^- < ^ 4 0 0 ? I felt quite squashed,

 It was a hot day and one or t w o p e o p C e ^ n e a r to me fainted and were

 passed over the heads of people and out of the pen.                  People were still_

 coming into the pen and I was getting even more crushed.                     Ats^3f£>out 14,

 30 hrs X J p t^ p r essure had become so bad I could not move at all

 thp*lght that I might pass out myself.                At one stage I saw one or

 people climb onto the f e^rce, at the front and they were pushed/'back in

 by the Police.         A 1 i j n , 1e while   later loads of people wereyCfl imbing

 out over the frojre fence.             People were also being p u l u p        into the

 stand behind^iTe.         Even then it seemed to be a 1ongjXtime before the

V pressurey^eemed to ease.            When the pressure did ease it was an

pincredible      feeling,     I knew I was going to be alright.         I could see

 people on the pitch being            carried away on make shift stretchers.              I

 could also see people being given mouth to mouth and heart massage on

 the pitch and I could see that some of these people were not

 responding and were obvipjdrSTy dead.               The pen was gradually clearing

 until   it got quite jKnpty and I could sit^kfwn and have a rest.                    I

 eventually 1ef L^about          1700 hrs      (170Q»^ with           we went baj         down

 the t u n n e l / a n d met the other t*,        back at the car.

         I would say that a factor      in the deaths and injuries caused was the

         fences dividing        terrace into small pens.        These fences stopped the

         c rowd spreading out and avoiding        injuries.           ^

        After the m^tch was stopped there was a lack of announcern^ffts about

         what was b&ppening.     I think that the Police were s l o y r t o   react.       It

         seemed a long time before they realised what was happening.                Once they

         had realised what was happeni ng,, some Police officers got stuck            in

         and worked hard while ol             just stood aboi

         There was a lack of           rds at the grounc        1' think that the

         Liverpool   fans sh«mld have had a bigger/al location of tickets and

         should have bsren given the larger end/of the ground,

                        INFORMATION
           LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB PRESS STATEMENT



Following the Home Secretary’s statement to the House of Commons this afternoon, Liverpool
Football Club issued the following press statement:-

“Our sympathies are with the families of the deceased who are bitterly disappointed with the
outcome of Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s report.

They were the innocent victims of this terrible disaster and have been forced to suffer so much
over the last eight and three quarter years.

We know they will not accept the findings and the Home Secretary’s response to them and it is
absolutely clear that they have much support from the general public and sections of the media.

We hope to meet with Trevor Hicks and his fellow Committee Members of the Hillsborough
Family Support Group in the near future and will not comment further until we have had the
opportunity to discuss the matter with them”.

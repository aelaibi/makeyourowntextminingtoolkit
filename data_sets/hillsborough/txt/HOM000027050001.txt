  Dear Mr.JjJfralley,

  When we had a discussion with Lord Taylor over dinner
  here in Glasgow recently, he mentioned that he would                                      RH)J

  like to see a copy of the feasibility study which I
  put together in connection with the proposition that
  the Scottish F.A. and the Scottish League might be more                                      ^    lA

  Executive.

  I am happy to enclose a copy of this document and I
  hope that Lord Taylor will find it of interest.

  Yours sincerely,

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

Thank you very much for your letter of 3 November with a copy of
your feasibility study.  I will bring this to Lord Justice
Taylor’s attention, and I am sure he will be very grateful to you
for it.

We all enjoyed our visit to Scotland very much, and found our
dinner with you and your colleagues both hospitable and helpful.

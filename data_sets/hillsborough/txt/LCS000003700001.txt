Dear Howard,

     Please find attached, as promised, a copy of the letter I have sent
to the Vice Chancellor expressing our thanks for your work and opened up,
hopefully, a route for further work.

     Can I say personally how much I have appreciated, not only your work on
the Planning Group, but your personal support and advice.   During the last
couple of weeks I have been less than brimming with equanimity and your wise
counsel was most welcome.

       Sincere thanks.
                                        Yours sincerely,




                                        Director of Social Services
                                                                       225 3800


                                                                    9th May, 1989.

Dear Sir

     During your absence I received great assistance from your staff in arranging
for Professor        bo assist us with some planning work related to Hillsborough
and the development of services within the North Vest.   Can I thank you for this
support and I am sure you will be interested to know that the work was successfully
completed on schedule and presented to a meeting of nine Local Authorities on
Saturday» the 29th April which Professor        attended*   The nine Authorities
endorsed the report and everyone recognised that a very valuable piece of work had
been done in record time.

     You will be aware that Professor        is held in very high regard by
colleagues here in Liverpool and within the participating authorities and it was
particularly helpful to have a neutral Chair for that Planning Group. He was able,
as ever, to bring together a group of very disparate staff with a range of ideas
and produced a polished document very quickly.

     I hope that you may feel able to offer us some assistance in the future as we
still have ouch to accomplish in terms of the planning of services and their
quality control and assurance.   I hope that Professor Parker may be persuaded to
engage with us again if you felt able to agree to release him.



                                                          /continued

/continued,




     At this time I am sure that the University itself is under tremendous
pressure and has to very carefully manage its resources.   Ve are, therefore,
particularly grateful for your assistance in releasing Professor         ‘or
the 2% days*    I hope this did not have a disruptive effect on his work in the
University and 1 am sure that he did it with the support of his colleagues.

Dear Sir

                    Re: Hillsborough1.

     You will obviously be aware of the dramatic affect of the tragedy
in Sheffield on Saturday. As a consequence of this Social Services
Departments in 9 Local Authorities are mounting a co-ordinated service
to people who were involved. This includes many thousands of people
and has dimensions which crosses all administrative boundaries.

     We have very quickly established ad hoc working arrangements and
developed emergency response services, some of which have received publicity.
We now need to very quickly organise our structures to ensure a coherent
and comprehensive response from 9 very different Local Authorities,
the Regional Health Authority and the Probation Service.

     Our existing management resources are grossly over-committed and I
would like to seek from you the assistance of Professor
who has a long connection with all of the Authorities involved    Initially
I would be most grateful if you could grant Mr.         leave of absence
for 2)£ days, including Friday next 21st, during the morning and Monday and
Wednesday of next week. His skill and expertise would be greatly welcome
by all Authorities in co-ordinating our planning work for the next stage of
the service development.

     I wosuld appreciate your early response to this request as we are
working on extremely tight time-scales.



                                   Yours sincerely,

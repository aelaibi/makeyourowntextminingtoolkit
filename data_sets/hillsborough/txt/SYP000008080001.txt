           Upon    looking around                  the       ground        I could           see      that          he    ko p      end       of    the

           A short       time          lat e r     I saw a man who was                                   wearing        what        appeared          to    be

           red,    the       t o p hat w a s            grey          with a                 red b a n d       round        it,     he wa s      also

           carrying          what       appeared             to a          puppett                 in his        hand.

           This    man approached                   the           police              officer            and     put    his a r m a r o u n d          his

           did.

           By    this    time          it wa s      about             2.45pm and                               and     I ha d a r r a n g e d         seating

           could also             see     that      although                       the m i d d l e         sections          of     the L e p p i n g s         Lane

           police       do    not       normally allow                             this,       and       I c o u l d at        this       stage       see       any

to    him and        he     j u st     pointed           into      the     crowd.         My    p o s i t i o n at       t h is     point

would       have     been        somewhere              in fr o n t      of     pen 4 but             not    as    far       as    the       gate,

1 looked          into      the       crowd and my a t t e n t i o n                  was      drawn        to    the    front          of    the

crowd       by the        fence        where        I could         see        a youngish             woman who was                wearing

glasses        I could           see     that       her      face       wa s    blue      and was           so    badly       pushed          up

against        the m e s h        fe n c e,        t h at    I thought           t h at     it w a s        going       to    be    pushed

through,          I could         not       describe             this    woman        and      I wa s       under       the

impression           she     was       dead        standing         next        to    her w a s        another          w o m a n who

again       I cannot         describe              but      w h o ’s f a c e     wa s     also        blue and          a g a i n was

pressed        up against              the      fence        she a l s o        appeared          to    be       dead.

A    short     distance           from        these         2 women        to    there         right        I could          see    a

large       m a n wh o      was       about        25/30 years             of a ge        and     I think          he w as

wearing        wh i t e ,    he       didn't        appear         to    be as        s q u a s h e d as         the    women       up

against        the      fence         and     he    said,         "Theres        a little             lad    down       he re      can y o u

help    him,"        but     all       I could           see      was    the     head       of a y o u n g         person          j u st

above       the    wall.          All       I c o u l d do w a s           reassure            the m a n         that    if he          could

move    back,        the     police           would         get    them o u t , I could                 not       see    if the

young       p e r s o n was       dead        or    not.

I then moved              towards           the     g a t e as      I knew           that      if a n y o n e      who       needed          my

help would           have        to    come        out      of    it.

Upon    reaching            the       gate      I could           see a        tangled mass             of       bodies       blocking

the    gateway          one m a n        in     particular              w h o ’s b o d y w a s         in the          gateway,           but

who's       a r m was       pi n n e d      between          the    fence        and      the     mass       of    people          wa s

attempting           to     get       his     arm       f r ee    but    to     no a v a i l .

It w a s     then       that      with        the       help      of a     police         officer           who    was       pulling

him    from       the     other        s i de      we    managed         to     pull      him     free.          I then       took        him

to    the    centre         of    th e      pitch where             1 sat        him      d o w n a n d as         he said,             he

was    alright          I left         him.

Whilst       returning            to     the       fence         I was     approached             by a n a s t h m a t i c          young

                     b o y wh o    was        having       difficulty                 breathing,             he    said     that        he     had     left       his

                     inhaler        on a coach,                 so    1 sat        him down and               reassured            him        1 stayed        with

                     him    for    a while,             until         his     breathing            had       slowed       down.

                     I then       directed           him        to    the     first         aid    room.

                     I then       saw an        elderly              gentleman             who    I would          describe          as       being     white,

                     about       60 years           of a g e , I can * t r e m e m b e r                 much       else       about          h i m , he w a s

                     pitch.       I put m y a r m               around        hi m a n d         walked       with       him    towards           the       middle

                     of    the    pitch w h i c h was                 less      congested.              He    said       he w a s       alright.            I then

                     went    b a ck      to    the       fence        where        I could         see       spectators            and Police

                     a heart       attack.               I went        to     the m a n w h o w a s               sitting       on the           pitch       to

                     the    left        of    the    goal        a r e a . He         t o l d me       that       although         he     had some           pain

                     reassured           him and          left.

I. t h e n    noticed          that       there        were         a lot       of     su p po r t e r s who         had torn         down

the    advertisidng                 hoardings           andwho           were       using       them         as m a k e s h i f t

stretchers.

During        all       this     time      I was        aware            of     lots    of    people climbing                  over       the

fencing        and       onto       the    pitch and                    Isa w   one     p o l i c e m a n in       particular             who

was    standing            on s o m e      steps        against            the      fence       lifting           people       over.

I then met              up w i t h                                  a    cad e t     and     as      she w a s       so     upset     I

took    her        to    the     first         aid     room.

Upon    my arrival               at    the      first         aid       room     I went         to     the m o b i l e       police

cells        where       I knew my             cadets         were,        I saw       that       they were             airight.

I then went              to    the     first          aid     room,        in the         doorway           of    the     room.      I saw

It w a s      then       that                                                        asked        me    to       try a n d     arrange

should be grateful if you would bring this to the attention of Mr Cadbury.

                                                Advice



    1      We have now received the skeleton arguments from the defence as to the renewed
           abuse of process argument which is to take place before Mr Justice Hooper for four
           days starting on 4th January 2000.

    2      I advise that copy tapes or transcripts of Ann Adlington’s evidence at the abuse of
            process in July 1999 be obtained. It is essential that the judge can see what her
            evidence was and how she was cross-examined. At present the court lias o n l y the
            witness statement she made and adopted as part of her evidence in chief. Her
            evidence will serve for the abuse of process the same function that a "deposition"
            serves for the purposes of th e trial itself.

    3      The new skeleton arguments are in many ways identical to the last, and raise many of
           the same issues. One of these is that the prosecution fails to accept the result of
           previous inquiries. For this reason, it is important, in my view, that the court has a
           tape of the first two days of the abuse hearing. The extent to which prosecution and
           defence "accepted" the previous inquiries was the subject of discussion.

    4      On tlie openi ng morning of the hearing, 4th July, there was a discussi on as to whether
           the abuse of process application or committal should go first. A tape of these
           exchanges ought also to be obtained. I recall that Mr Harrison, for Murray, argued
           that it would be unsatisfactory for the public to hear that there was a case to answer,
           but that the trial of that case would be an abuse of process.

    5      Both, defendants are now arguing that public confidence in the integrity of the trial
           would be undermined, by the trial of this case. Harrison’s remarks are obviously
           relevant to that issue.

    6      Those instructing me have a record of when these con versations occurred, bu t my
           imperfect recollection is that the relevant submissions and discussions were on 4,Jl
           July, and the evidence of Ann Adlington on 7th July.

             I .was a p p o i n t e d a Constable! of the Sjief f ield -and "RlS'XTierham

             C o n s t a b u l a r y on 19 J a n u a r y   1973,    and after    initial    training      I was

             posted to A t t e r c l i f f e Division.              I remained there       until    October    1974

             during w hich         time    I worked man y times          at Hillsborough.           One   of the

             occasions was a semi               final      when    I wo r k e d on Penistone Roa d with the

             New c a s t l e   supporters.         Even though they had a bad              reputation      it was a

             family day out and              I spent       the whole    of the match sat w ith the

             supporters         in the N o r t h Stand.

             In October         1974,     I was    t r a n s ferred to the Hac k e n t h o r p e Sub D i v ision

             of the South Y o r k s h i r e Police and               I remained there       until    April    1989.

             Throughout         this    period     I have w o r k e d    in uniform at all         the fo.otbai J.

             grounds       in the S o u t h Yorkshire Police area,                  but mainly at Srama!!

             Lane    and Hillsborough.               I would       imagine   that    throughout my service, .i,

             have     performed duties at a 100 plus                    football    matches.       I have worked

             a b ou t 3 or 4 s e m i f i n a 1s a t H i 11s b o rou g h .        T h e 1as t b ei n g in April

             1988 between L i v erpool             and N ot t i n g h a m Forest.       I wo r k e d on a static

             point     on P e nistone Road and              I did not     encounter any trouble.

             I wo r k e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h on one occasion,           which    I think was a semi

             final     a number        of years ago when a part of the wall                   in front     of the
                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                               R373

Spion Hop       collapsed,            I do not know why                .i.t did    collapse      but    together

wit h other       officers         the situation was                  contained and the           crowd was

m oved away       from the wall               and we then            formed a cordon across              the

damaged area.           We worked on the Spion Hop                         side     of the wall         s andwiched

between      the damage and the                    crowd.       At no time was           there any violence

towards me or my fellow officers                            on this      occasion.         As    I ’ve said I

think that        it was a semi               final       but   it    could have        been another major

f a o t b a 11 ma t c h „

When    I have wo r k e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h            I have     usually worked          on the Spion

Kop or the Pen i s t o n e Road side of the ground,                               but    I have wor k e d on

turnstiles.

.1 think that        during my service                    I have wo r k e d every duty a uniformed

Police C o n s t a b l e would work at a Football                         match.

I commenced duty at Hac k e n t h o r p e Police Stat i o n at 8.30 am Saturday,

II April       1989,    and      I was        immediately            contacted by PS Payne w ho

•j.n f o rm e d m e t h a t I was       to wo r k u n d e r h im o n s sriali 16^ern the L e p p i n g s

Lane    turnstile.          He     informed me             bas i c a l l y my duties and we were then

conveyed to the             ground      in a rented double                 decker       bus.     When    I

commenced my duties                I was          not    issued wit h a personal               radio,    nor was      1

g iven one      later       that      day,,

W h e n we a r r i v e d at      the    ground we went               to the N orth Stand,              on the

n umbered seats a s s i g n e d our                 serial    a w a i t i n g a briefing w h i c h was
                                                             N iv.
conducted on the mai n by Ch.                           Supt. Duckenfieid, but with a s sistance

o f o t h e r o f f i ce rs .                 ,

After     this,     briefly        Ins p. Purdy spoke                 to me about        the    duties while we

'consumed breakfast              on the N orth Stand.                   We also      spoke about         our

personal       lives as we have known each other                            for a number          of years and

have    in fact wo r k e d at football                     matches      together.

After     this we went           to    the Leppings             Lane    side      of the   ground where all
                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                         R373

our duties?            f       ' e full       match were         exp l a i n e d to us.      I was    present

there when            Ir           ykes     gave us a brief           outline     of the overall        duties

at that       side         of the g r o u n d .

I. knew what my duties were for the                            full m a t c h and      prior    to my taking

position outside                the turnstiles           I went       into    the West S tand to        look at

the    lay out as             I was    to go there and              perform duties after          the kick         of

Having      done this           I returned to behind                 the    stand where      I joined my

col l e a g u e s .

P rior to us taking                 our     duties     up,    I went       together wit h PC 620 Yates

to the sweet shop situated on Leppings Lane                                   between the entrances

a nd Vere Road-                After       purchasing        some    sweets    1 had a very short

c o n v e rsation w ith a girl                behind the         counter who         told me    that some      of

the Liverpool               fans    had arrived outside               the ground a b o u t - 7.45 am that

morning and some                of them had been              consuming       cans    of alcohol.       She    did

say that they had not                      caused any trouble.

Upon    returning            to turnstiles A to G I took                     up my    position outside

turnstiles D a n d E.

Obviously        I was aware               that we were        searching       supporters       for offensive

weapons and also                enforcing        the    law relating          to alcohol       in particular

persons a t t e m p t i n g         to gain entry with drink or if they were                          drunk.

There was a dribble                   of    people     coming       through the t u rnstiles          about

12    noon and         it was       possible       to search         nearly    everyone      coming    through.

The major i t y            of these        early supporters were              families,     fathers,     sons

and the       like.

I noticed on one                o c c asion that a. Liverpool                supporter,     a white male

probably about               18/19 went         to one       of the other       turnstiles A t C.             As

he a p p r o a c h e d      the entrance         he was a c c om p a n i e d    bv a small       group of

Liverpool        s u pporters          of a similar           de s c r i p t i o n as he,   but as they got

nearer      they stood             still     and. he w a l k e d     through on his own.             He was

challenged         by another Police Officer                        and    consented    to be searched.
                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                              R373

Because          there were          very few       people    coming        through     he was     s u b jected      to

a thorough search.                    On    completion of this            he did       not atte m p t    to go

through          the    turnstiles          but    returned    to his       friends and they all               then

left    the entrance and stood on the bridge                              over    the Don and began

drinking alcohol                from       cans,    w hich they       placed on        the bridge w a l l ,          I

informed my fellow officers                         of what    had occurred           and to be       vigilant

if they all             tried to enter again.

N e a r l y all        the    supporters who          came    through       in this      time were       orderly

and    did not appear                to have       been drinking.           Shor t l y after      starting          to

search them             I s u stained S cuts to my fingers,                      w hich were more            of a

result       of my hard          skin and then 1 went               to the First Aid             room below

the    north stand where                   I obtained some          plasters      from a St.        Johns

ambulance          nurse and          1 then       returned    to my      position.         1 was away from

my    post       for about 5 minutes.

In body searching                the supporters a t t e m p t i n g          to enter       the g round        I

realised that                to search them          correctly      I would be able            to smell       their

breath for alcoho 1 / i n t o x i c a n t s .               As a result        I performed a thorough

search on them and always                         smelled their       breath.        I believe       that      I

entered          into a friendly attitude                   towards    the supporters            to such a

degree       that      I would make a fuss              over any       child who        I w ould     perform a

cursory          body se a r c h to the            laughter    of   the     person a c c o m p a n y i n g   them. ,

In fact          in performing            this     kind of searching           I got my      right      trouser

knee    dirty and was                light    h e artedly     told to       clean    it by either Sgt.

Payne       or    Ins p. Purdy.

As    the    crowds          built   up    it was     not    possible       to search the         supporters

in the same manner,                  but     I did endeavour          to search as many as               I could.

In this          period       I noticed       that WPC H u c k s t e p p was a d v i s i n g a supporter

not    to enter         the     ground as he was             the worse       for drink,        and appeared

to have          fallen       in something wet          because       his    trouser      legs were wet.

supporters        had been drinking            intoxicants           of some form as          not     only

could    I smell       it on their       breath        but    it was    in the air as well.                  I

did not stop anyone             entering       the ground           because    they were drunk,              but

having       said this a lot of them a p p e a r e d                to have    been drinking.

About    1.40 pm I was aware             that PS Payne              had detained a man for-

a t tempting     to enter       the ground with 2 cans                 of H e i n e k e n and    I a s s isted

him to the Police             room under       the north stand.               I then    returned to my

post.

I continued          to body search       people        entering       turnstiles D and E'«

I knew that          there    had been a problem with the a l l o c a t i o n                 of tickets

to the Liverpool             supporters       in that        some    had been given tickets                 for

the S pion Hop and they were                  coming       to the Leppings Lane           to try and

get    in.     I was    told by a uniformed                Inspector      (he had a full            beard but

I do not know his             name)    who was       behind the        turnstiles       that a small

amount       of them    could be       let through.            But    having   said this         I did not

personally       let anyone       through and           in fact after a short             time        the

permission had been w i t h d r a w n and the supporters were                           informed to

I think       that at this       time    I was working wit h PC 620 and about 2.25                                pm

he told me that          he was       going    to    leave me as together              with another

officer       he had d e t ained someone             for     possession of a c ontrolled drug

and that       they were       taking    the    person to the N orth Stand Police Room.

At this       time   I was aware        that PC Duffy was working                 t u rnstiles F and G

on his       own and that       there were          two other        officers working           turnstiles

A to C.        I cannot       recall    who these officers were.

Just    prior    to PC Yaates          leaving me the           crowd had begun to start

building       up.     It was a friendly             crowd but        obviously a lot of them had

been drinking as             I could smell          it on their        breath and       in the air.               I

was    still    able    to by this       time       5f r i s k " people    entering      the     ground.
                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                      R373

I then became aware             of another    problem,       this of people             trying    to

enter    the ground without a ticket and a t t e m p t i n g                   to    pay an entrnace

fee to the turnstile             operators.        I did not       personally see an y of the

turnstile       o fperators      D and E take any m oney            or    let anyone          through

without a ticket,             they just    refused them entry and this                   caused a

problem     in that      I had to pull       the    person back out of the                   turnstiles

a gainst   the queue™           I cannot    recall    how many times                I did this    but       it

w ould have 3 or 4.             Because    of this    I then began asking                the    fans    if

they had tickets and             refused those without             to a c t ually       enter    the

entrance       of the    turnstiles.        On another       occasion an old man got                   stuck

in turnstile D because at first                he    could not find his ticket and then

he had d i f f i c u l t y getting    it out       of his    clothing.              A lot of the       fans

told me that       they had tickets          but were       not    showing          them to me,       they

just    produced them to the          turnstile       operator,          and    I formed the

opinion that       this was       because    they were       f r ightened of the              tickets

being stolen.

W hen PC Yates      left me       (at this time 4 of the             serial          were absent)       1

was able       to move    to a position between the two                   turnstiles          entrances

w i t h my back agai n s t a piece of wood             running from ground to                   ceiling

dividing       the two    entrances.        I think    that       it was ar o u n d      this    time

that    I saw    Insp.    Purdy to my       left,    stood on something and he asked me

how    I was    to w hich      I replied    I was alright.            Initially         I was    not

being    crushed and          I held my arms       out across       the    entrances          still

attempting       to stop supporters          blocking       the    turnstiles          up.     It was at

this    time    I decided that       it was    impossible          to search anyone             coming

through so       I still       monitored    people    entering        the turnstiles.

AT one     stage   I was aware       that an officer          from behind the turnstiles

told me that a man atte m p t i n g          to enter       had    in fact          been thrown out

of the ground.           My    immediate    feelings    were       that    he w ould attempt            to

jump over the       turnstile       into the       ground    so    I physically          pulled him

                                                                                                      R373

back away from the entrance.                   I think    that this         occur r e d shortly

after    I re;turned from the Police              room when          1 a s s i s t e d PS Payne,       but       1

cannot    be sure.

The    next thing      that    h a p pened was    there was a pushing                of the        crowd

towards       the   turnstiles     and 1 was      crushed against            my     chest,         I thought

that    it was      someone 'at the rear         pushing as the          crowd,      shortly

afterwards,         backed away       from me.

I was then aware           that a moun t e d Police           Officer       (from another           force)

rods up to me,         bas i c a l l y between the queues             for t u rnstiles D and E

and F and G         and told me to move          out    of the way.           I i mmediately moved

against       the   wall    between turnstile E and F which                  was a small            clear

area.     I was a gain aware           that    Insp.    Purdy asked about rny safety.                        1

a gain told him         I ws alright,         in fact     I was      joking and         laughing      with

the supporters as            by this time       I was     getting      extremely w arm and hot

and sweat was          pouring    down my face.          Obviously          I was    face     to    face with

them and       I a gain     could smell       intoxicants       on their          breaths,     not

everyone       but a lot      of them.

I could see the            same moun t e d officer who          spoke       to me,      he was about

4 yards away         from me and he kept          pointing        to the      crowd that was

adjacent to him telling               them to stop pushing.                 The    crush then became

worse and together with DC Duffy                  I deci d e d to try             and get out.          I

also    think at some         stage    I was    told to        get    out   by Insp,       Purdy.       We

tried to follow            the moun t e d officer        in the      " w a k e ’ that    he   left as he

made    his    horse    go backwards      but PC Duffy          fell     to the floor.              He was

jeered    by the       crowd but none a t t e m p t e d        to hurt      him.        He got      to his

feet    and    I told him that we would                have    to get out another way.                  He

suggested trying            to go through the           queue   to T u r nstile F and G and

under    the metal         barrier.     I told him that           it was      impossible           because

of the number          of supporters      there.         The y were all           packed      in like

sardines.           People were    shouting      because        they were         getting      crushed.

                                                                                                     R373

(There wre        only a few shouting)                PC Duffy mana g e d to get through

t urnstile E.           I   could not follow          him     I was    being    crushed against           the

wall    between E and F I could not move,                          I could not move my arms.

Then a man        in front         of me started shouting              "My wife's       pregnant,        stop

pushing."         He    said this a number            of times and the           crowd a p p e a r e d    to

pull    back s l i g h t l y allowing            the couple    slight     breathing       space.     I saw

my    chance     to help this         girl and also          get out of this           situation, so           I

pushed myself           behind      this girl       and shouted for the           crowd to stop

pushing     I held my arms against                  the   entrance      to the turnstiles while

her    husband     pushed          his foot against         the wall,     therefore        pushing

against     the    crowd.           In this way the         girl    got through the turnstile

and    I followed.            Her husband got         stuck       on the outside        of the

turnstiles.            When    I got to the         inside    of the turnstile           I cold not see

any of my serial.                 I was    out of breath and extremely                 hot.    Before      I

could do a n y thing           I heard the sound of               raised voices        from wi t h i n

turnstile E and             I immediately went            there where         1 saw a white male

about 35 arguing w ith the turnstile                        operatorbasically              he was

demanding        to be      let    in as    he had given his ticket              to the operator and

he w a s n ’t being a l l o w e d         entry.     I spoke with the           turnstile      operator

and he said the man had not given                         him a ticket and he was             lying.       I

got    hold of this man and noticed                   that his        breath smelt       of alcohol        arid

I pulled him from the turnstile and together with another                                     officer      I

ejected him out of a gate                   situated      on the G side of the             turnstile

(the    one given entry to                lane    running    behind     the    south stand).         I then

went    back to behind the turnstiles.                       On    looking through         them,    towards

the queues        I could see         that       the supporters were           being    crushed against

the    entrance        to the turnstiles.             They were all           shouting and screaming

and    it a p p e a r e d to me that         they were only           coming    through the

turnstiles        very      slowly.        .1 then saw a supporter wi t h i n the              turnstile

attempt     to    pay m oney to enter              the ground.         This was a g a i n     refused by
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                           R373

the operator and           I ejected         him*     At    this time the supporters                  outside

were    screaming       that    someone was          going to be crushed             to death unless

something was         done.       The      next    thing    I recall       was a man      entering          one

of the turnstiles and he had a child on his shoulders.                                     The man was

very    red in the       face and was             shouting    for     someone     to take       his       child

and    I saw a u n i f o r m e d Sergeant           (identity unknown)            take    the    child from

the man and        then the man            came through       the turnstiles.             It was about

this    time   that whe n the supporters m a n a g e d to come                      through the

turns tiles      that    some     of them were            falling     to their      knees,      they were

o bviously      in a d i s t r e s s e d    condi t i o                                               .     Some

of them were        shouting at us that               s             ...                               , as          the

feared someone w ou l d be killed.,

At this     point     I decided to find my serial                     on the outside         of the

turnstiles       to see      if I could help get the                  people away from the

turnstiles.         I went      through the          large    concertina gate a d j a c e n t              to

turnstile G „         The gate was           shut    behind me.           Just   outside     the gate               I

saw a group of un i f o r m e d officers                  talking     to a group of about & men

in civilian        clothes.        One      of the    group of these men were                showing            the

offi                                                           rd.        I am sure      that    the
                                        ✓
officers were         telling      them that         they    could not       let them      in.        I only

heard a small         part     of this       c o n v ersation but         I formed the opinion that

the group of 6 men were Police O f f icers                      from Merse y s i d e       wanting          entry

into the ground.

At this time        there were a lot of s u pporters around this                           gate,          they

were    pleading w i t h the officers                that    something       had got to be done as

people were        being     crushed and they feared for their                       lives.

I told them that           I could not            let them through the gate.

A few seconds         later     I saw       Insp.    Purdy    coming through the             crowd of

supporters       from Lepping s Lane.                He was    pointing towards            the gate             I

had just       come through and was                saying something          like    “Open the gates,

    have    trouble      inside,”           The    Inspector           said that they had got              to be

    opened     to save       life outside           the turnstiles,,                The                              idt? I

    time    Insp.     P urdy gave        the      order     to close          them.       I cannot     say how many

    people entered           through this           gate     but       it was opened         for about 20 to 30

    seconds.        It was        not opened fully,               probably between 6 to                10 feet.           It

    was    impossible       to stop the supporters                      running       through       but having       said

    this when       the order was            given     to    close       the gates         I could not        see any

    I n rny previous a11end a n c e s              at the footba 11 matches                   I have    neve r known

    a gate     opened to          let supporters            enter       in    this manner.          F rom my

    e x p e r i e n c e s , when gates       have     been broken             down by fans it is

    impossible        in the       initial        stages     to stop the flow                into the ground             due

    to the numbers           trying      to enter,,          I     have      e x p e r ienced a gate      being

    broken down at Bramall                  Lane and        it     does a llow a lot of              people    to

    enter    quickly.

    There was only a small                  crowd of s upporters                 outside     the     gate when       it

    was    closed but within a matter                     of seconds           they were       coming     to us,

    pleading wit h us to do something a gain as the                                   situation had not             been

    solved directly           outside        the    entrance           to the       turnstiles.        Some    of tnem

    were    showing me their             tickets and saying                   let me through the gates.

    I've got, a ticket.              Again        I did not want              to open this gate and tel

    we would not be able               to    contain the           situation.

    At    some stage       shortly after            this     Insp.       P urdy told me that            he would

get the m o u n t e d section to form a barrier                       against      the entry       to the

gate and filter          through those wi th tickets.                      Within seconds          the re

were a number          of moun t e d officers          outside        this    gate and      the order was

ag a i n given for       it to be open from              inside.          It was    opened and there

was a steady       stream of supporters                moving        through.       I . p e r s o n a l l y did

not take any tickets             from those         entering.

All    those    entering       at this    time a p p e a r e d       to be orderly and d istressed

from being       crushed.        A short       time after          the gates were         opened       I

noticed that       the    crowd still a p p e a r e d          to be entering          through       the

gates of Leppings             Lane.     I shouted        to    Insp.      Purdy    that the gates               had

to be shut       to stop       people    coming       into     the    bottleneck.         I am not             sure

if the    Inspector       heard me.           I wal k e d , t o    the gates and         it a p p eared

that    there were a number             of officers,           including m o u n t e d officers

a l l owing    supporters to enter            by showing          their      tickets.       I noticed at

this    time    there was        still a crush against                 the entrance       to the

turnstiles,       but    there was a           large are a behind the              queues     that     was

free    of supporters.            I then noticed that                some supporters were

climbing       onto a metal       dividing wall           between our turnstile and those

turnstiles adjacent             to ours.         I shouted at          them to get down.               They

appeared       to be    climbing       onto    the wall        and over the top of the

turnstiles.        These youths were              climbing         from the other         side     of the

wall    from me.        They didn't appear             to take any notice              of me and then a

Policewoman       (identity not known)               said to me that              there was an

Inspector       on top of the          turnstiles        letting them gain entry                 into the

ground over the          top of the turnstiles.                    I looked to the          top of the

turnstiles      and saw        Insp.    Bennett      stood        there.     Because      of this          I

allo w e d them to       continue.        I then saw a supporter walking                       towards me

with a can of pop and             I told him not              to take      it in and then          I heard

the sound of another             gate    being      opened.          I do not know what            time        this

was.     I think       that    it was Gate B adjacent                to Turnstile A.             The    crowd

                       then entered the              ground through             this    gate.        A very short          time    later           3.

                       can     recall       hearing       over a personal          radio,       that all Police Officers

                       were    to go to the           playing area.

                        I ran through to behind the West Stand.                                I did not go through the

                       turnstiles           but    I cannot       for    the    life of me       remember w h i c h gate               I ran

                       through.            As   1 ran to the enclosure                 I remember       running       behind       Insp.

                       Purdy.         We    ran along       the back of the West Stand u n d e r n e a t h the Police

                       I could see a lot              of officers          on the       ptich and some fans                climbing
           I

 [Hy                   thought were             that the        fans were       invading       the    pitch.
      rf        a
                        I then recalled             Insp.       Purdy saying       something          like    "F-orm a line across
0 £ {K
               iff*    the     pitch"       to face       the    crowd.        Before    I could do a n y t h i n g a uniformed

                       S e r geant     (Unknown but he had a full                      beard and       I think       he works          or has

                       w orked at H a m m e r t o n Road Police Station)                       told me to a c c o m p a n y        him

                       from the standing area,                     I could see          that    there were          sufficient

                       officers        on the       pitch so 1 ran with                this Sergeant and a group of other

                       officers.            I did not       inform       Insp.    Purdy what          I was    doing.       I saw that

                        it was    important          to get       the    people away from the                rear.        I ran along

                       the same        route       that    I had taken to get             to'the       pitch.        I was       the    last

                       officer        of this       group and         I ran along        the tunnel          giving       entry    to the

                       terraces.            This    tunnel      was     empty.     There were          no injured          persons at

       C.              the     rear of the stand when                   I ran    into the       tunnel,
                r
                       As    1 got to the           exit    of the tunnel          (onto the terrace)                I saw that          the

                       began     pulling          people    back off the          terraces and telling                them to go

                       along     the tunnel          to the       rear of the          stand.        I was    doing       this    for a

                       matter     of minutes.              Some    of the youths          I spoke       to in this manner

The    next thi ng     I c:an reca 1 1 was a supportsr               faacki ng through the e k i t

from the terraces          shouting       " T h e r e ’s people dead down there."                      .1.

couldn't     believe what         I heard so        I wal k e d through the             crowd stood at

the    exit and      looked towards        the    perimeter       fence*       I could see a

po 1 i cewornan on top of thie f ence t ry i ng to pull a 1 1 f e 1 ess                        body over

the    fence.       I formed    the opinion that           this     person was          dead.         1 moved

forward to help but             in doing     this    I could see that there was a large

number    of Police      Officers at the material                 point so       I decided to                pull

the    crowd away      from the        terraces.      I remained         pulling        people away

from the     centre     stand     enclosure.         By this      time some of the                  crowd had

been volatile and were             swearing at me          calling me a murderer.                      1

continued to pull          people away and some of them had arg u m e n t s wit h me

a bout   the dead and dying             people.      In the most         diplomatic            terms

possible      I. urged them to go through the                   tunnel.      The m a j o r i t y that

ar g u e d with me,     face     to face     smelt    of   intoxicants,          then Police

Officers     began to bring            injured    people       through the       terraces and along

the tunnel         I tried to keep the entrances                 and exits       free      in order            that

they     could get through.

Whe n all     the m o v ement     began to stop from Police Officers and

supporters         bringing     injured through          the    crowd a p p e a r e d     to turn on the

Police.       They    personally        started a c c using me of murder                 and        likening

it to the Heysel          S t a d i u m disaster.                                       I^Jj

1 still      kept    the exit     free and then          I was     told b y ^ ^ n j ^ ^ W a ^ k e r          to go

to the      rear    of the tunnel        and stop the          fans a ttempting           to get       bacr,

into the terraces.              When    1 got    there     there was a number              ot .officers

         two doctors        through.     Eventually       it a p p e a r e d that the supporters

         began to leave        the   stadium and whe n they did 1 went, back onto                 the

         playing area where          I reported to PS Payne.             We were then     instructed

         by a Chief       Inspector     (identity not known)          to go onto      the terraces and

         th«N4.he names       of supporters       still    there.     But   by this time    they had

         all     gone and    I d i d n ’t get any names.

         I did not handle any of the              bodies,

          I must    say that whe n the people were            being     crushed against     the

         turnstiles       I did fear for the safety of them and                 I have   formed the

DAVID EVANS

Detective Constable 963

Sexual/Child Abmse Unit ,   Heeley Police Station.


I was appointed a Constable of the Sheffield and Rotherham Constabulary on
the 19th of January 1973 and after initial training I was posted to Attercliffe
Division. I remained there until October 197^ during which time I worked
many times At Hillsborough. One of the occassions was a semi final when
I worked on Penistone Road with the Newcastle supporters. Even though they
had a bad reputation it was a family day out and I spent the whole of the match
sat with the supporters in the North Stand.

In October 197*+ I was transfered to the ^ackenthorge Sub division of the
South Yorkshire Police and I remained there until eiafeeE April3 1989*
Throughout this period I have worked, in uniform at all the football grounds
im the South Yorkshire Police area, but mainly at ^ramall Lane and Hillsborough.
I would imagine that throughout my service I have performed duties at a 100 plus
football matches.    I have worked , about 3 or ^ semi finals at Hillsborough.
The last being in April 1988 between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. I worked
on a static point on Penistoj§e Hoad and fekBU£«XB*BXB«ziEHTaibKz I didaot encouner
any trouble.

I worked at Hillsborou^i on one occassion, which I think was a semi final auumber
of years ago when a part of the wall in fromt of the Spion K@p collapsed. I d©
not know wl^y it did collapse but together with other affKZKaxax officers the
situation was contained and the crowA was moved away from the wall and we then
formed a corden across the damgge area. W* worked on the spion kop side of the
wall sandwicked between the damage and the crowd* At no time was there any violence
towards me or my fellow officers on this occassion.    As I ’ve said I think
that it was a semi final but it could have been another major football match.

When^I have worked at Hillsborough I have usually worked on the Spion Kop or
the enistone Road side of the ground, but I have worked on leppings Ian© and the
surrounding area, but not at leppings lane turnstiles.

I think that during my service I have worked every duty a unifsinned Police Constable
would work at a Football match.

I commenced duty at Hgckenthorpe Police Station at 8 .30am Saturday 11 April 1989
and I was immediatly contacted by PS Payne wha informed me that I was to work
under him on serial 16 on the leppings lane turnstile. He informed me basically
my duties and we were then conveyed to the ground in a rented double decker bug.
When I commenced my duties I was not issued with a personal radio, nor was I give*
one later that day.

When we arrived at the ground we w u t to the North stand, on the numbered seat®
assi     our serial, awaiting a briaflA g which was conduct«d on tha main by
C/SUPT Duckenfield, but with assistance of other officers.

After this briefly Insp Purdy spoke to me about the duties while we consumed
breakfast on the North stand. We also spoke about our personal lives as we have
known each other for a number of years and have infact worked at football matches
together.

After this we wnet to the Leppings lane side of the ground where all our duties,
for the full match were explained to us.   I was present there when Insp Sykes
gave us a brief outline of the overkll duties at that side of the ground.
                                                                           M   l   2



I knew what my duties were Par the full match and prior to my taking
position outsdie the turatiles I went into the 'iist Stand to look at the
lay out as I was to go there and perform duties after the kick off.
 aving done this I returned to behind the stand where I joined my collegues.

Prior to us taking jwajakiamzz our duties I west together with PC 620 V t e s to
the sweet shop situated on Leppings lane between the entrance® and ^ere Road
After purchasing some sweets I had a very short convereation with a girl behind the
counter who told me that some of the Liverpool fans had arrived outside the ground
aoout 7.^5affl that morning and some of them had been consuming cans of alcohol
She did say that thyy had not caused any trouble.

Upon returning to turnstiles a to g I took up my position outside turnstiles
D and E.
n                                          supporters
 bviously I was aware that we we searching/f#B offensive weapons and also
enforcing the law relating to alcohol SMXf^Sg&zxzfcBKptifitgxtBzsafceKzwlHpc
in particular person attempting to gain entry with drink or if they were drunk.

There was a dribble of pe©j>le coming through the turnstiles about 12 n»«n and
it was possible to search nearly everyone coming through.    The majority of these
early supporters were families,father/sons and the like.

I noticed on 1 occassion that a Liverpool supporter, a white male probalbly
about 18/19 went to one of the other turnstiles A to C. As he approached the
entrance he was accompanied by a snail group of Liverpool supportes af a similar
discription as he, but as they got nearer hfeey stood still and he walked through
on his own.   He was challenged by another Police Officer and consented to be searched,
^ecause they were very few people coming through he was subjected to a thonough
search. On completion of this he didnot attempt t© go through the turnstiles
but returned to his frei da and they all then left the entrance and stood ©n the
bridge over the Don and began drinking alcohol from cans, which they placed on the
bridge wall.   I informed my fwllow officers of what had occured and to be
vigilant if they all tried to enter again.

         Jtearly all fcbe^z the pupportes who came through in this ti«« were orderly
and rinjink not appear to have been drinking.    Shorlly after statting to search
them I sustained 2 cuts to my fingers, which were more of a result of my hard skin
and then I went to the ^rist aid past room below the north stand wh»e« I
obtained some plasters from a ST Johns Ambulance bbisbb nurse and I then returned
to my poation.     I was away from my post foo about 5 minutes.

In body searching the supportes attempting to enter the ground I realsied that
to search them correctly I would be able to snell their breath for alcohol
/into&icants. As a result I performed a thorough search on them and alsways smelt then
breath        I believe that I entered into a freindly attitude towards the
supporters to such a degree that I would make a fuss over afvphild who I
would perform a cursory body search to the laughter of the person accompanying them.
Infact in perfomxng this kind of searching I got my right trouser knee dirty
and was light heartedly told to clean it by qje either SGT Payne of Insp Purdy.

As the crowds built up it was not possible to search thesupportess inthe same
manner, but I did endevour to search as many as I could.

In this period I noticed that BSzBz WPC Huckstepp was advising a supporter not
.to enter jthe ground as fcke he^ was the worse for drink* appe«rid tohave fallen
m something wet because his trousers legs we wet.
Around this point   it appeared to me that the majority of male supporters
had been drinking   intoxicants of some form as not only could I smell it on their
breath but it was   in the air aswell. I didnot stop anyone entereing the ground
because they were   drunk, but having said this alot of them appeared to have been
drinking^
About 1•^-OpiB I was aware that PS Payne had Setained a man for attempting to
anter the ground with 2 cans of Hiinaken and I assisted him tothe Police room
under the north stand. I then returned to my post.

I continued to body search people entering tunrstiles D and   E.

I know that there had been a problem^ith the allocatjon^of tickets t®
the Liverpool supporters in that tffey had been given      for the Spion Kop
and they were coming to the Leppings Lane to try and get in.    I was told
by a uniformed inspector(he had a full beard but I do not know his name)
who was behind the turnstiles that a small amount of them could be let through
But having said this I didnot personally let anyone through and infact
after a short time the permission hadj been withdrawn and the supporters were
informed to enter a swojll enclosure ©n the Spion Kep specifically for the Liverpool
fans.
I think that at this time I was pxEfceaexect working with PC 620 and about 2.25pm
he told me that he was ging to leave me as together with anohter officer he had
detained some one for possession of a controlled drug and that they were taking
the person to the North Stand Police Room.                                             '

At this time I gas aware that FC Duffy was working turnstiles F and G on his own
and that there were 2 other officers working turnstiles A to c. I cannot recall
who these officers were.

Just prior to PC Yates leaving me the crowd had begun to strat building up.
It was a friimdly crowd but abviously alot of them had been drinking as I could
s u l l it on their breath and in the air. I was still able to by this time ’frisk'
people entering the ground.

I then became aware of another problem, this of people trying to enter the
ground without a ticket and attempting to pay an entrance fee to the turnstile
operators.   I didnot personally see any of the turnstile operators D and E
take any money or let anyone through without a ticket, they just refused them
entry sad this caned a problem in that I had to pull the person back out of the
turnstiles, against the queue. I cannot recall how ma#y times I did this
but it would have been 3 or k »   Beacuse of this I then began asking the fans
if they had tickets and refused tbeae without t© actually enter the
entrance of the turnsitles. On another ©ccassion an old man got stuck in turnstile
D because at first he could not find his ticket and then he had difficulty
getting it out of hia clothing.    Alot of the fans told me that they had tickets
but were not showing them to me, they just produced them to the turnsilte
operator, and I formed the opinion that this was because they were frightened
of the tickets being stolen.

When Pc Yates left me    ( at this time k of the serial was absent) Iwas able to move
to a position betweenthe 2 turnstiles entrances with my back against
a piece of wood running from ground to ceiling dividing the 2 entaaaaess.
I think that it was around this time        that I s    w      INSP purdy, to    my left,
stood on tkazaekaizgaatEotz something and he asked me how I was to which i replied
I was alright. Initially I was not being crushed and I held my arms out
acroos the entrances still attempting to stop supporters blocking the turnstiles
up.   It was a t this    time I decided that it was impossible to search anyone coming t
through so I still                 moinitered people entering the turnstiles.

AT 1 stage I was awaaa that an officer from behind the turnstiles told me that
a man attemtping to enter had infact been thrown aot of the ground . My immediate
feels&gs were that he would attemtp to jump over the ferunstile inot the ground so I
physically pulled him back -.way from the entrance.  I think that this occured
shortly after I returned from the Police room when £Sz£ayze I assisted
PS Payne, but I cannot be shre.

The next thing that happened was there was a pushing of the crowd towards the
turnstiles, and I was crushed against my chest. I thought that it was someone
at the rear pushing as the crowd , shortly afterwards, backed away from me.
                                                                              R I'll

I was then aware that a mounted Police ©fficer (from another force) rode up t©
me, basicall between the queues ®or turnstiles D and E      and F and G and told
me to move out of the way. I immedialty moved against the wall between turnstile
E and F, which was a small clear area. I was again aware that Insp asked about my
safety. I again told him I was alright, infact     was poking and laughing with
the supporters as by this time I was getting extremely warm and hot and
BKBsfcx swet was pouring down my face. Obviously I was face to face with them
and I again could saell intossicants on their breaths, not everyone but alot @f them.

I could see the same mounted officer who spoke to me, he was about k yeards away
 from me and he kept pointing to the crowd that was adjacent to him telling them
 to stop pushing .     The crush then became worse and together with PC Duffy I decided
 to try and get out, I also thin}g at some stage I was told to get out by INSP FUrdy.
 We tried to follow the mounted officer in the 'wake'that he left as he made his
 horse go backyards but PC Duffy fell to the floor. He was jeered by the crowd but
 none attempted to hurt him. He got to his feet and I told him that we would have t©
 get out another way. He suggested trying to go though the queue to Turnstile
 F an G and under the metal barrier. I told him that it was impossible because
 of the number of supposrted there.     They were all packed in like sardines.
 ■^eople were shouting because they were getting srushed. (There were only a few
 shouting) PC Duffy managed to get through turnstile 1      I couldnot follow him
 I was being crushed against the wall between E and F I could not move , I couldnot
 move my arms.    Then a man infornt of me started shouting 'My wifes pregantn
 stop pushing1 he said this a number of times and the crowd appeared to pull back slightl
 allowing the couple slight breathing space. I saw my chance to help this girl
 and also get out of this situation , so I pushed myself behind this girl and shouted for 1
   the crowd to stop pushing I held my arms against the entrance to the turnstiles
while her husband pushed his foot against the wall, therefore pushing against
the crowd. In this way the girl got through the turnstile and I followed, ker husband
got stuck on the outside of the turnstiles. When I got to the inside of the turnstile
I couldnot see any of my serial. I was out of breath and extremely hot.
Before I could do anything I heard the sound of raised voices from £kehz within
turnstile 8 E and I immediatly went there where I saw a white male about 35 ®?6guinS with
the turnstile operator, basicaly he was demanding to be let in as he had given his
ticket to the operator and he wasn't being allowed entry. I spoke with the
turnstile operator and he said the man had not given him a ticket and he was lieing.
I got hold of this man and noticed that bKzk«5ixfaJEBZ his breath smelt of alocohol
and I pulled him from the turnstile and together with another ©fficer I ejected him
out of a gate situated on the g side of the turnstile(the one giving entjry to
lane runnign behind the south stand.      I then went back to behind the turnstiles.
(Dn looking through them, towards the queues I could see that the supporters were
being crushed against the entrance to the turnstiles. They were all shouting and
screaming and it appeaired to me that they were only coming through the turnstiles
very slowly.     I then saw a supporter within the turnstiles attempt to pay money
to enter the ground, This was agian refused by the operator and I ejected him.
At this time the supporters outside were screaming that someone was gffiimg to be crushed
to death unless something was done. The next thing I recall was a man entereing
one of the turnstiles and he had a child on his shoulders. Ss z x b b the man was very
red in his face and was shouting for someone to take his child and I saw a uniformed
SGT(identity not knonw(take the child from the manand the» - the man came through
 the turnstiles. It was about this time that when the supporter managed to come through
 the turnstile® that some of them were falling to their knees, they were obvioisly
 in a distressed condition most were gasping for air.     Some of them were shouting
 at us that something had got to be dome, as they feared iomeone would be killed.

At this point I decided to find my seri.il on the outside of the turnstiles to see
if I could help get the people away from the turnstiles.    I went throught the
large consetina gate adjacent to tuu*stile G. The gate was shut behind me.
Just outside the gate I saw a group of vnifromed officers talking to a group of
about 6 men in civilian clothes. One ^of the group of thise men were showing the
officers a ^erseysifie Police arrant ^ard. I am skre that the officers were telling them
that they couldnot let them in...I only heard a small part of this conversation
but I formed the opinion that the group of 6 men were Police officers from Merseyside
wanting entry into the ground
At this time there was alot of supporters around this gate, they were pleading
with the officers that something had got to be dsone as people were being crushed
and they feared for their lives.

I told them that I couldnot let them through the gate.

A few seconds later I saw Insp Purdy coming through the crowd of suuporters from
Leppings Lane. He was painting towards the gate I had just come through and was
saying something liks 'Opea the gates, Open the gates' This was not directly
said to me but appeared to be said th the officers in general that were stood
outside the gate.   I can recall saying to the officer. ' We earn't ©pea the gate#
we'll have trouble in side'   The insp said that they had got to be opened to save
life outsidethe turnstiles.     The gates were opened, I do not know what time it was
they were opened and unlocked from within after u i an officer had shouted from the
outsida. After a short time Insp Purdy gave the order to slose them.    I cajuaot
say how many people entered throught this fate but it was opened for about 20 tto30
seconds, ^t was not opened fully, probably between 6 to 10 fait .    It was impossible
to stope the supporters running through but having said this when the order wqs given to
close the gates I couldnot see any problems and they were immedialty closed.

In my previous a tendances at the football matches I have never known a gate opeaed
t© let su porters enter in this manner.    *.rom my experiances, when gates have been
broken down by fans it is impossible in the initial stages to stop the flow into
the ground due to the aukbers trying to enter.     I have experianced a gate being
broken down at ^ramall 1‘ane and it doe® allow alot of people to enter quickly.

•^here was only a small crowd of supporters outside the gate when it was closed but
within a matter of seconds they were coming to us, pleading with us to do something
again as the situation had not been solved directly outside the entrance to the
turnstiles.    Some of them were showing me their ticks and say let me through the
 gates, I've got a ticket.    Again I didiot want to open this gate and list those with
tickets enter as I felt that because of the numbers of the crowd that a surge by
them would force the gates compltely open and we would not be able to contain the
situattaa.
At some stags shorlty after this Insp Purdy told me that he would get the mounted
section to from a barrier agains the entry to the gate and filter through those with
tickets.    Within seconds there were anumber of mounted officers outside this gate
and the order was again given for it to be open from inside. It was open ed
and there was a steady stream of supporters moving through. I personally didnot
take any tickets from those entering.

All tho e entering at this time appeared to be orderly and distressed from being
crushed. A short time after the gates were opened I noticed that the crowd still
appeared to be entering £xaaz through the gates of leppings lane. I shouted to
Insp Purdy that the gates had to be shut to stop people coming into the bottlenedc
I am not sure If the Insp heard me. I walked to the gates and It appeared that there
were a number of officers, including a±£kzmzxzmzz mounted officers allowing supporters
to enter by showing their tickets. I noticed at this time there was still a crush
against the entrance to the turnstiles, but there was an large area behind the
queues that was free o£ supporters. I then noticed that some supporters were
climbing onto a metal dividing wall befcaefem our tunastile and those turnstiles
ajagent to ours.   I shouted at them to get down., ^hey appeared to be climbing
onto the wall and over the top of theturnstiles.     These youths were climbing
from the other side of the wll from me. They didN't appear to take any notice of me ihd
then a Police woman (identity not know) said to me that there was an insp onto of the
turnstiles letting them gain entry into the ground ower the top of the turnstiles.
I looked to the top ®f the turnstiles and saw Insp Bennet stood axzikazi there.
^ecaase of this I allowed them to continue. I then saw a suuporter walking towards me
with a can of pop and I told him not to take it in and then I heard the sound
of another gater being opened   I do not know what time this was.     I think that
it was gate B ajacent to Turmsile A.    The crowd then entered the ground through this
gate.   A very short time later I can recall hearing over a personal radio,
That all Police Officers were to go to the playing area.
                                                                                   {Ill
I ran through to behind the West Stand. I didnot go through the turnstiles but I cannot
for the life of me remember which gate I ran through.   As I ran to the enclosure
I remeber running behind Insp Purdy. We ran along the back of the West sta^d,
underneath the Police Control Box, infront of the south stand and onto the pitch*

I could see alot of officers on the pitch and some fans climbing over the perimeter
fence infront of the west stand.   My i mediate thoughts were that the fans were
invading the pitch.

I then recalled I^sp Purdy saying something like 'Form a line across the pitch'
to face the crwod. Before I could do anything a uniformed sgt(unkown but he had
a full beard and I think that he works or has worked at ^ammerton Road Police Station,
told me to accompany him with other offieers to behind the terraces and pull
the fans away from the standing area. I could see jthat there were aifficent officers
on the pitch sm I ran with this sgt and a group of other officers. I didnot inform
Insp Purdy what I was doing.   I saw that it was important to get the people away from the
rear.   I ran along the the same route that I had taken to get to the pitsk.
I was the last officer of this groups and I ran along the tunnel giving entry to the
terraces.   This tunnel was empty. There were h o injured persons at the rear of
the stand when I ran into the tunnel.

As I got to the exit of the tunnel (onto   the terrace) I saw that the other officers ran dowi
into the   crod so I stopped at the exit   andbegan pulling people back of the terraces
and telling them to go along the tunnel    to the rear of the stand. I was doing this for a
matter of minutes. Some of the youths I    spoke to in this manner smelt of drink

The neat  thing I can recall was a supporter backing through the exit from the terraces
shouting   'Theres people dead down there. I couldn't beleive what I heard so I
walked through the corwd stood at the exit and looked, towards the perimeter fence.
I could see a police woman onto of the fence trying to pull a lifeless body
over the fence.    I formed the opinion that this person was dead. I movea forward to hepi
but in doing this I could see that there was a lrage number of Police Officers
at the material point so I decided to pull the crowd away f©@m the terraces.
I remained pulling people awjcgt from the centre stand enclosure.   By this time
some of the crowd had been volatile and were swearing at me calling me a murderer
I continued to pull people away and smoe of them had arguments with me about
the dead and dieing people. In the most diplomatic terms possible I urged them to
go through the tunnel. The majority that argued with me, face to face smelt of
intoxicants, Then police officers began to bring injured people through the
terrace* and along the tunnell I tried to kepp the entrances and exits free in order
that they could get through.

When all the movement began to stop from p lice officers and supporters bringing
injured through the crowd appeared to turn on the Police. They personaly started
accusing me of murder and likening it to the Hysel stadium zzmdzz disaster.

I stllkept the   exit free and then I was told by Insp ^alker to g© to the rear of the
tunnel   andstop the fans attempting to get back into the tearaces.   When I got there
there was a nemeber of officers stopping the* supporters from re entering the terrace.
Some of the Youths /mens were obviously drunk and aere arguing with officers to be
allowedback becasue they had been parted from their friends. I stopped in this
postiion for a considerable period.... I then accompanied docters through the tnnel
to the pitch . I think I took 2 doctrs through. Eventullly it appeared that the
supporters began to leave the stadium and when they did I went back ont the playing
area were I reported to PS payne.    We were then instructed by a Ch/Insp (Identity)
not Known) to go ont the terraces and get the names of supporters still there.
But by this time they had all gone and I didn't get any names.

I didnot handle any of the bodies.

I must saythat when the people were being crushed against the turnstiles t at
I did fear for the safetly of them and I have formed theopinion that had the gates
not been opened then life would have been lost outside the turnstiles.

I then retunred to the North ^taka and after being sttod down I retunred to E 1
and went off duty at 7 pin.

Later that night I examined ray body and found that my legs were covered in bruises
there was a lerge one on my right knee . I had also got some brui ing to my lower half of my
body.   I cannot explain where or why I sustained these injuries.

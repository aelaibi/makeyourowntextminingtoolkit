                 On      Saturday          15th      April          1989       (150489)         I. h a d       arranged       to    meet       a    friend

                 of      the    ground.

                 I    left      home       at     1.45     pm       (1345       hrs)     and        parked       my    car    in Mi d d l e w o o d          Rd

                 at      2.10    pm    (1410         hrs).           I then       walked            to    the    grounds          and    got       to     t he

                 grounds         at    about         2.20       pm    (1420       hrs).

                 I did         not    witness          anything            at    that       time         that    was       different          to    any

         the     sweet             shop,       wai. t i n g      for       Mr

         I saw        2    policemen                 outside          each       turnstile             frisking             people           before            they

         went         into         the     grounds.              Whilst          I was          reassured             to    see        the      couple          of

         dozen         policemen               searching              people,             I did       think       that          if     they      were          going

         to    do     that          to     everyone,             it    would             take     some      time       for       everyone             to       get     in,

         Although              a    lot       of     people           were       protesting                to    the       pressure             of    the       crowd

         and    I heard                 people          shouting           stop          pushing.           People          in       the     main      were

         accepting                 it.        I did       n ot    witness                anything          untoward             at     that      time.

         By    this        time          now,        I had       got       separated              from                               and     I was         now

         heading           fo r         the    turnstile.                  I could             see    some       of    the       supporters

         attempting                 to     climb         over     the          wall       into       the    grounds             bu t      they       did       not

         succeed.

         As    I got           to       the    turnstile              I saw          2    policemen             either          side       of    the       stile,

         who    by        then          had    stopped           the       frisking             and    by       then       under          very       difficult

         I went           in       as    usual,          handed        my       ticket          to    the       turnstile              operator,               he

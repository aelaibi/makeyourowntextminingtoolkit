                   At 9.4 5 a.m.         on S a t ur d ay         15 April       1989,       I came   on duty at H i l l s b o r o u g h

                    Football      Ground       in Sheffield.               I then joined my allo te d Serial                 Number

                    18,    in the North S tand where                    I was      responsible        to Police S er ge an t 758

            V       Morgan,     who was        m     charge        of the serial.



                    About    10.00 a.m.           we were         briefed R egarding            the semi-final        football

                    m a t c h about     to take        place       between Liverpool             F.C.    and N o t ti n gh i m Forest
                                                                                                    PAGE

F.C.     by Chief S up er in t en d en t D u c k e nf i el d and     Inspector Sewell.

Immediately after          this      briefing we had a          packed meal     provided.



About      11.00 a.m.    the      same    day my Serial        a tt en d ed at the      rear of the

West     Stand where we        received a further           briefing       by Inspect^fr^^Tykes

before      being    deployed to our         positions      on the turnstiles at L ep pinqs

j-ans side     of the ground.            Myself and Police C onstable 3342 Blount were

                                         tmbers 9 and      10 respectively which gives

ac ce ss    to the North Stan



At this      location there are            16 turnstiles        entrances     set up       in pairs        for

access      to the North and West Stand.                 There are gates a ll ow in g             entry

from Leppings Lane            into   the area      in front      of the turnstiles.               The area

w i t hi n the gates was          p artitioned by a steel,           interlocked tem po ra ry

barrier      to split    the N orth S tand entrance              t urnstiles    from the West

St an d entrance       turnstiles.         The    turnstile/ n u m b e r    10 was at the side of

this     barrier and numbers             11-16 gave access         to the West Stand.



We were      responsible       for the      searching      of fans to ensure            that

p rohibited articles were                not taken      into the    ground and that fans

entering      behaved    in an orderly fashion.                 Initially there were              only a

small      number of fans         in the area of L ep pings Lane who were                    behaving       in

a peaceable         manner while waiting           for the turnstiles          to be opened.



Aibout     1 2 0 0 mid- da y the same day,         some of the ^ u r n s t i l e s      were      opened

and fans      started to enter            the ground.       A short while       later all           of the

turnstiles were         opened.          Fans entering were         searched where           this was

appropriate,         as they entered the ground.                 G r ad ua ll y the number          of fans

entering      increased,       but    there was still          only a relatively small               number

entering and         it was    notic eable       that   some    fans were     bringing alcohol
                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                   S10S1

w it h them w hich       they    were then d isposing          of    in the

bins    provided.        Man y    fans were mill i ng a ro un d on the             pavement    outside

the    gates    before    finally       coming      into the turnstiles.             The   number       of

people entering          the    ground gradually            increased until about ,2.QQ                p.m.

w hen the entire         area    f rom the f ront       of the      turnstiles      up to the metal

entrance       gates was       filled wit h fans,        but at this stage           there was         only

a little       pushing and everyone was behaving                    in an orderly fashion as

best    I could see.



It was     noticeable       that many fans were             confused by the          coloured ticket

s ystem    in use and that            they were      trying   to gain entry to the wrong

s ect i o n of the ground.             At this      stage   it was    possible for         them to be

let    back out    of the turnst iles and then to gain entry through the

correct     turnstiles         into    the    correct    section of the ground.



At 2 .40    p.m.   the same       day,       the   pressure   of    people had       increased such

that    psopie were       being       pushed forward        into the turnstiles            by the

pressure       of the    peo pie behi nd and they were               four or mo re dee p trying

to gain access          into two       turnstile       entrances.         This    resulted    in people

pushing     to gain entry to the turnstiles                   as well.           At this   time    I

noticed that        there      seemed to be a large            number      of fans,    who   had

o b v io u s l y been

drinking        who were       pushing       forward    regardless        of the    people    in front

of them,       causing    distress       to many       people.      Also    these    fans were

argu i n g with whoever          they    could,      but no violence was            possible      due    to

the    tightly     packed      crowd.        When these     fans went       down the wrong

turnstile       they were       ext re me ly abusive and often              refused to back            out of

the turnstile,          forcing       their way through.



Others who       had    come to the wrong            turnstile      did    push back against            the
                                                                                                     PAGE

crowds and try to gain entry through the                           correct     turnstile.       However,

sometimes          during    this    period this also           became    impossible and they

could not make             their way back against              the flow of the       crowd behind

them.        This    resulted       in their      having      to be   let through the          turnstile

into the wrong             section of the ground,              a l t ho u gh they were    being      let

into    the N orth stand w hich was all                     seats and not      into the West S tand

which their          tickets we re for.



At    several       times    during       this   period elderly and young            children were

pushed down the side                of barrier        towards me and as best as            I was able            I

forced the          crowd back       (and     in most       cases was a s si se d by those        in the

crowd)       to    let them thro ug h         into the turnstile.            It was also       n ec essary

to    leta    pregnant woman through.                  I noticed that        some fans who were

intoxi c a t e d didn't           care    for this and w ou ld not         let these      people

through and          I received a great              deal    of a buse   from them.



Eventually          I pushed back againyx              the wall. beside the turnstil e and up

against       the    partitioning           barrier    by the    pressure      of the    crowd and

was unable          to move.        Man y    people were       complaining      regarding      the

pushing       of the       crowd,    but     in view of my       position and the fact            that      I

had    lost       contact w i th the         other members       of my serial,       I was     unable       to

help    them.        At    this    time     it seemed to me that          things were getting              out

of hand and          it was       quite     f rightening      to be   penned    into this       corner

and unable          to move.        I was     very    releived whe n the numbers           of people

drop p e d off and          I was agai n able          to move about       freely.       The    crowd

e ve n t u a l l y dwindled away as all               the fans     gained access        to the ground.



About 3.05p.m.             the same       day,   there was a report          that Liverpool          fans

were    on the       pitch and       I therefore went           through the turnstile and made

my way onto          the    pitch with my serial,              by going    down the south side of
                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                      S-1031

the West Stand.



On arrival       at the       pitch     1 could see that         the    crowd in the          central

north t e r r a c e were      pushing         forward and that         the    people at the front              of

the    terrace were        being      forced up against          the front          fencing    to the
                                                                                              /
terrace.        It was a pp arent         that those at the              front were be^i/tg crushed

by the    pressure        of the      crowd behind them and                  that some of     the    people

against    that       fencing were at           least unconscious,            and    possibly that       they

were    dying    if not alre ad y         dead.          I could see Police          officers       climbing

the    fencing    shouting at the              crowd to move         back.      It was    obvious      that

the fans     to the       rear    of the       crowd were      unaware       initially of what was

occuring at the front               of the terrace.



I saw that the gate              into    the    central      m outh terraae was open that

officers were          inside     lifting       people over the

seperates       the    central      N o rt h and South terraces.               These     people were

then being       ca/ried onto           the    terrace and th^y             were brought out through

Gate    nurnhe^ k      nntn   the     pitch.       I immediately            went over to      this    gate

and a s s i s t e d out    several       people who were         either afraid           to   remain or

injured.        These     people then went               over onto    the    pitch where       they sat or

laid down and were a tt en d e d to by first aiders                          or other Police

Officers.        It a pp eared        to me that man y of these               people were         in shock.



Next    I saw Police Co ns ta bl e             159 M arsh wno was           carrying f young          boy who

I know to be                             ut of the         central    south terrace.           I a ss is te d

At this     point we were           joined by two           people who       identified themselves

the doctors.          F i na ll y a stretcher a skived an d N i p l                  was    taken awa y to

1 then went         back    to the terraces where               I saw that gate myfiber 4 was

I   went   over     to this       gate and a s s is t ed a Police Sergeant                  in taking a

youth out      of this terrace.                We then took this youth onto the                     pitch and
                                                                /
betw ee n us      placed him in the              recovery     position and then             I covered him

with my anorak,             I then       remained w i % ly this y outh to ensure                  that   he

continued      breathing as             it was difficult,             Whilst    I was      looking after

this youth        I was     joined by two other             officers      who      I do not know,             One

was a Woman Police Co ns ta bl e and she was                         e xtremely distr es se d and             in

tears.     She      told me that          someone had just            died who she was            trying      to

resuscitate.          The       other    officer     squatted down watching                this y outh with

me and just         could not beleive            it.     Whilst       sat there we         counted

over   ten bodies          just    laid on the         pitch a ro u nd us,



A short time         later an a mbulance was about                    to leave the ground and this

was    taken away to be X-Rayed.

                two positions at w hi ch                I first       saw and su bs qu en tl y took           hold of Lee

               On this         plan      (Ref P H J / 1 ) (Exh             ) I indicated that            1 first       saw Lee

                in pen 3,           being     carried by PC MARSH,                 and took him out of          pen 3 by

                gate 3 .


                1 have today viewed two photographic                               prints

              now know that           it was   in A $ e n 2 that       I first    saw Lee N ICOL and that                 I

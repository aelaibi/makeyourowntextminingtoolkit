2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from

3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                          Re

     C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death

     C.D. was killed unlawfully.
  d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not

       Dear Sirs,

       Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


       If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
       of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
       on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
       due course.

       I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
       evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
       coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
       inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

       Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
       under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
       •witnesses who wish to give evidence. I am at present engaged in considering
       this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

       ■Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter,I am writing  to you
       to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
       appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
       consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

        May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
        attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

        I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
        names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that thedecision as
        to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

        I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
        heard from you by the end of Septenjiie-r I will assume you have no names to
        submit.

        Yours faithfully,

  ^        Sirs,
  Res tfpwa w w           P. COPOC (deceased) So«71.

  As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
  Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed* You may also
  be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
  on the 15th of January 1990.

  I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
  has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
  behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
  Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

  I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
  Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
  he may wish to undertake.

  I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
  or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
  matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
  a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
  on this matter further.

  I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
  is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
  fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

  Yours faithfully,



   S.L.Popper,
   H.M.Coroner.

      Dear Sir

      RE:   HILLSBOROUGH

      Many thanks for your letter of the 27th July enclosing copies of the Post-Mortem
      Reports.

      I will certainly make clear to my clients the conditions under which these
      Reports have been released.

      A cheque for £26.95 to cover your copying charges is attached, might I trouble
      you for a receipt for accounting purposes.

      Since I gave you my list of deceased a further one has been added, he is
■T*
      John McBrien The Old Vicarage, Well Street, Holywell, Clwyd, might I please
      have a copy of his Report to complete the set.

      Yours faithfully

Dear Sirs,

You will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
in fact put in as evidence.

However, in view of the numerous requests v/hich I have received,
and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
report of your client(s).

The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-'

       a.      They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
               subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
               they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

       b.      They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
               conselling of the deceased's relatives or for proper
               legitimate purposes in connection with any legal proceedings
               in which solicitors may be engaged.

       c.      Subject to th£';a-b§ve1 they are to be kept confidential until
               they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is        per sheet (total                            }
Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

Yours faithfully,




S.L.Popper,

Dear Mr Popper

I write following my very helpful conversation this afternoon with Mr Thompson
from your office to confirm a number of points.

Firstly, I understand that you are favourably inclined towards the requests
that you have recieved from a number of Solicitors to release copies of
the Post-Mortem Reports on the victims of the Hillsborough Disaster in advance
of resumed Inquest Hearings and in this regard might I ask you to let me
have copies of the Reports on the deceased named in the attached list the
families of whom I respresent.

There is a strong feeling from many of the families that early receipt of copies
of the P.M. Reports would be beneficial both in terms of answering some
hiterto unanswered questions and also in perhaps reducing the anguish which
might be suffered when full details of the cause of death become known at a
public hearing perhaps some weeks   or months hence.

If payment is required for copies                        of any of the Reports then needless to say
I will be happy to deal with this.

I understand that the relative positions of approximately 50 of those who
suffered fatal injuries has been established at or immediately prior to the
estimated time of death, this information is being generally discussed and
although I am not asking you at this stage to release the names of the 50
involved I would be very greatful if you would confirm that this information
is correct, perhaps the number has increased from 50? Would it be your intention
to release this information prior   to reopening of the inquests?

Finally, I confirm that I will speak to my fellow committee memberstomorrow
(Wednesday) about the issue of 'block representation' of the bereaved families at the

 I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
 Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
 the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
 following the adjournment of the inquest.

 After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
 to this course of action.

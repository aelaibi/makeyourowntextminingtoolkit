     HILLSBOROUGH : VIDEO REQUIREMENTS

     I thank you for your minute of 19 October and confirm that I have
     today discussed the position with Ken Ashken and also passed
     copies of your minute to Graham Duff and Gordon Etherington.

     For the purposes of record, in the period between the demise of
     the Regional Directors and the emergence of the Field Directors
     (Operations) and (Resources), David Connor in Ken Ashken s
     Division is directly concerned with the development of policy.




     DAVID S GANDY

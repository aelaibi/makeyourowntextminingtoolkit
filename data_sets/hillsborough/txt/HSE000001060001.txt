     Dr Buchanan

     I understand that                advises that should there be any
     further media interest in what video material HSL holds,enquirers
     should be referred to the West Midlands Police as all material that is
     relevant to the matter has been made available to us by them.I agree,
     and have advised press officers accordingly.

                     HTLLSBOROUGH INOIJTRY - RENEWED INTEREST

On 1st April 1997,1 received a phone call from a _________________ who said she worked
for the BBC 2 programme ’Newsnight’. She had been given my name by Professor
Maunder, an assessor on Sir Peter Taylor's Inquiry, and asked if I had seen the report in the
’Mirror’ that the ’Hillsborough Families’ were to ask for a new inquiry to be held following
the ’discovery’ of a video recording said not to have been seen by Taylor's inquiry or the
subsequent Coroners Court. She also asked if I was aware of any video recordings from the
event which had not been made available. I replied that I had not seen the Mirror report
and was not aware of any such video recording. I added that all the videos used by HSE had
been supplied via Mr Mervyen Jones, then of the West Midlands Police, in response to our
requests for any photographic evidence which we could use to answer specific technical
questions put to us by the Court of Inquiry.

I subsequently watched ’Newsnight’ that evening and although there was an article on
Hillsborough, no reference was made to HSE or my conversation with

HSL still has all the videos we analysed kept under lock and key together with copies of the
reports produced and some of the physical evidence collected from the ground. Dr Buchanan
raised the question as to who owns the videos and what our reaction should be to requests to
view any of them. I think that they are technically still the property of the West Midlands
Police and that therefore any request would have to be channelled through them. They
certainly controlled the issue of our reports to all those legally represented at the Inquiry and
also to those represented at the Coroners Court.

I would welcome advice as to how to deal with any subsequent approaches by the press or
legal representations should this matter develop any further. It should be noted that very few
of the original team, both from HSL and FOD are still employed by HSE. I am only aware of
myself and five other co-authors from HSL.

            At    8.00       a m S a t u r d a y r 15th,         April         1989,       I reported          for    duty     at

            Midland          Street       Railway         Station,,        in S h e f f i e l d      City Centre.              I    was

            issued with             a   personal          radio.

            About       10.15 am          the      same    d a te    we    arrived          at    the    Railway       Station        our

            supporters,             the      Senior       Officer         in    charge       of    the    station        duties, I

            for       transport         to    the    ground.           Nottingham            Forest       supporters           were

            directed          to    the      exit    near      Pond       Street,          Liverpool          through      the      station

            car       park    to    the      transport.

            Numerous          supporters            attempted          to a v o i d        catching       the    awaiting

            Most       of    the    supporters            were      in g o o d       spirit       of m i n d a n d a g r e e d       to    our

            direction,             although         many    slipped            through

On    numerous           occasions            when       supporters             were       questioned             about         tickets

they    stated           they      h a d n ’t g ot        any and           were         collecting          them         from         friends

On©    fan       1 can       describe          as    being       in hi s          late       twenties,            wearing              a

denim       jacket        and      jeans,          managed       to     p a ss       through         the     public            e x it,          I

attached          to     hi s    shirt,        believing             he w a s        a    football          supporter              I

approached             him      I saw     he       h a d all     the        characteristics                  of a d r u n k ,               on

stopping          him      I asked        if       he w a s     going        to      th e m a t c h ,       t h is     he      denied,

his    attitude            being        quite       aggressive.                 I pulled             back    his       jacket              and

saw a L i v e r p o o l          supporters              badge.         I    then         escorted          him      to a n a w a i t i n g

bus    with       the      aid     of a n o t h e r       officer.

A further             5--6 y o u t h s    passed          through           the      public          exit,     I stopped                   them.

PC Packer             joined       me    as    I asked          them where                they were          go i n g ,        they

replied          that      they     were       collecting             tickets             from S he ffield                City

Centre.           I told         them     no       one    was    go     go      into        the      centre       if      going            to       the

one    of    the       youths,          about       S O - 2 2 yrs,          with         dark     brown      short            hair

produced          a Merseyside                Police       Warrant           card.           I then         believed             their

claim       to    be     true      and allowed             them        to    pass,,

I heard          on a n urn be r of            occasions             over       my       personal       r a d io       calls           about

boarded          an    empty       bus    and       began       the     journey             to H i l l s b o r o u g h         vi a

I saw       on    Infirmary             Road,       l a rg e    numbers           of      supporters           mostly           Liverpool

from     cans     of    intoxicants,                    the       route       being        littered            with     empty     cans.

Once     on L a n g s e t t       Road,           crowds          of    supporters             increased           dramatically

and     vehicle        traffic          was        very         heavy        causing           slow       p r o g r e s s . At    its

junction         with Holme              Lane              I sa w a         chip        shop completely                full of

supporters.             Travelling                    from Middlewood                   Road,       into        Leppings       Lane

crowds        of L i v e r p o o l       supporters                merged          into       one mas s ,         many    drinking

from     cans.

On    drawing         l e vel      with       the L e p p i n g             Lane    entrances             to     the    West     Stand,

the     bus    driver         stopped             I        was    seated           on    th e n e a r s i d e     of    the bus a w a y

from     the     offside           looking                 at    the    offside           at the         turnstiles,          th e road

was     completely            clogged with                   pedestrian             supporter             traffic.            I saw a

number        of P o l i c e       horses             in a t t e n d a n c e ,      but       due    to     the    sheer         volume          of

the     crowd,        I could           not       see       any    f oo t      officers.             I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y

f ive    supporters               c 1 imbing           over       the       per i m e t e r    fence        to    gain     ent r y .

Other      supporters              were       standing             on       the    gates       on    the        pavement.

Most     of     the     crowd were                in a n a g g r e s s i v e            and a gitated mood                 and        the

atmosphere            was     electric.                    A supporter             banged          on the        front     offside           of

the     bus     just        behind       the          driver,          by    the    stairs.              Th e    driver       asked         if

we w i s h e d     to       get    off       the       bus      here,        but    suggested             that     we w o u l d        have

trouble         getting           in.        The       time       was       about       2.53       pm.      Someone        suggested

that     we m o v e         round       to    the          Penistone           Road      N o r t h End,          this    the      driver

did,     on     rounding           the       roundabout                Penistone           R o a d North,          it was

completely            different,              very          few    supporters              walking          towards        the        ground

to    the N o t t i n g h a m       Forest             turnstiles.                 Our      bus     stopped        a n d we       made       our

way     into     the        ground       via          the M a i n P o l i c e           access,

Sergeant         Swift        asked          us       to    remain          in the        Gymnasium             prior    to      getting

our     meal     as     a    precaution                of    being          needed.           I had       just     sat     down,        there

Police        traffic         on    the       radio          and       heard       from       an    officer        at    th e     Lepping

Sergeant          Swift         then        came       over       and    s a i d we          were         going.          Once        outside

and    our      serial          was     together             he    directed             us       onto      the     track         around          the

pitch        entering           vi a    the       field       entrance           of      the N o r t h S t a n d               and Spion Hop

c o r n er .      We        were       to     take      up a        position             on the t r a c k             by the f i e l d          front

of    the W e s t           Stand.            I was      aware           that     the            kick off         had     taken        p l ac e      but

did    not      see     any      football              being       played.              On       reaching          the        corner

adjacent          to    the N o r t h W e s t            enclosure             at       the W e s t S t a n d ,               Sergeant

Swift        directed           us     to    spread          out    along        the         tra c k .          I walked            down        to

gate     3 and         stopped with                the       officer          covering               the       g a te.        I. r e m e m b e r

PC T a t t e r s h a l 1 a l s o            stopping,             I looked          at       the C e n t r e          South         enclosure

of    the W e s t       Stand,          and       saw    that        the      crowd was                very       den s e ,      only       being

able     to     see     supporters                heads       and       not    their             shoulders.

I passed          on m y        regards           to    the       gate     officer,                wh o    wa s    standing            back

from     the      gate      by       the     billboards,                but    watching                   the     crowd        at    his

section,          he        acknowledged                me,        in d o i n g         so       g at e 3 o p e n e d         a n d five

youths         ran out          onto        the    track          the    gate       officer               and     1 ran f o r w a r d            and.

pushed         the     supporters             back       into       the       centre             South         enclosure            and     pushed

gate    3      c l o sed.

We    stepped          b ac k    to     our       original           position,               I     believed           this       incident

was    the      start       of a        pitch          invasion,.             I l o o k e d at             the     enclosure               again

and    st ill        believed           nothing          wa s      wrong.           I saw            supporters               climbing           over

the    partition            fence           between          the C e n t r e        South           enclosure             and       South

enclosure            and    being           pulled       up       from     the      centre South                   enclosure               to    the

West    Stand          s e a t e d area.               Supporters             around             the      centre         of    the     Centre

South        stand      began          spitting          and       throwing             things            at    us,      abuse       and

gestures.              Again         I thought           it was          just       a    rowdy            crowd.          Still        I

believed          the      enclosure              (Centre          South)        w as        crowded            bufo s a f e        a n d ____

comfortable.              Th e        g at e    officer            began          to    speak       onto     his      personal

radio,        I couldn't              hear      what        was       being        said       due    to    th e      volume         of        the

crowd.         I placed my                radio        to my          ear,        radio       traffic        was      intense,                non

stop.         I heard a transmission                             that        one       gate    was    breaking             under          the

weight        of   the    crowd           but     do      not      know       to w h i c h a r e a         of     the      ground             it

referred.

Then Gate          3 burst           open again               1 dr o p p e d my           rad io      to m y         che s t      and went

to    stop     three      supporters                 along         with       the       gate    officer.              I took          hold          of

one y o u n g      man and            began       to      push him            back       to    the    open        gate,         there          was

a solid        line      of       standing           people           in the           gate.        I sa w      people          pushed

flat    up a g a i n s t          the     fences,           two       to    three        yards       back       into       the      cen t r e

south       enclosure             peoples         heads          were       j us t      disappearing              udner         the m a s s

of th e       crowd.          I    saw a man              in his           twenties           scrabble          onto       the      top of

people       and     began         to     run on          peoples           heads        and    shoulders             towards             the

pitch       perimeter             f e nc e .      I let          go    of     the       supporter          and       began       to       pull

supporters           from         the     gate,        other          officers           joined       in,       we    c o u l d n ’t pull

people       out     fast         enough.            Th e     gate         wa s    so    n a rrow,     with          the     gate

opening        outwards            onto        the     field          it    prevented assistance                          from      the

right       and a     lean         too     support            on      the     left       gate       pillar        prevented

assistance           from         the     left       of     the       gate.          Three      officers             or    supporters

could only           enter         the     g a t e w a y at           one     time       to    pull       because          of    the          t i ght

space.         The    step         up f r o m        the     centre          south        enclosure             caused          pe o p l e       to

trip    over       falling           to    the       ground           then        on t o p     of    each       ot h e r ?      the       gate

became       eight       deep        in f a l l e n         p e o p l e,     so      tightly         packed          that       they          could

not    be    pulled       free.            As    one        supporter              was    pulled       free          your       momentum

followed        the      supporter              b a ck      onto      the         field       other    supporters                and

officers        then      took          your     p l a c e at         the         gate    pulling.              I climbed             onto

know      what     w as    happening.               People          were       reaching            up to me           but       I c o u l d n ’t

reach them           the      spikes         on the       overhang             digging           into m y arms.

I climbed          down and went                  back    to    the       gate,            I pulled            further

supporters           free       and     in d o i n g      so,       I saw a gap              between            the     legs      and

bodies       of    people        at     step       level.           There       I sa w a m a n ’s face,                     about

40-45 years             1 tried         to    reach       him       but     c o u l d n ’t,         I could           hear       him

shouting          " H e l p me H e l p        m e ” and        as    1 watched              the     crowd         fell      back        over

him and         I never         sa w    him again.              I began             pulling         at     people          in a h u r r y

to    free      him-       Eiach time             someone       came       from        the       crush         I fell       back        with

them.        I again          lost      my    p lace      the       gate       wa s    too       narrow,             I moved        to

             were       not     to    pack        or    position           supporters             into      the    ground,           but     to    leave

              this       to    the    Stewards,

             After        the     briefing             my Serial           went       to    the    Spion       Kop,         where       after      a

             further           short       briefing           relevant           to    the      Kop    by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

             GREENWOOD,              we    took        up    our    positions              at    the   Northern             end    of    the      Kop,
near       to a n a r e a        allocated             to a n y L i v e r p o o l         supporters who                   may    h av e

tickets          for      the    Kop,       which          should      be    only        for    Notts          Forest          supporters.

It w a s        anticipated            that       there          could      be    friction           between          the       two

fact io n s .

I r e m a i n e d at         that      point          until       2 . 12pm       < 1412),       when with             other       officers

1 took          part      in the       arrest          <                                             for       drunkeness,             and

t o ok     my    prisoner                                                                            Room       beneath          the    North

S t a n d , accompanied                by PC S'                                                     essary          procedures          I

went       to    the      nearby       gymnasium             to     complete            my arrest           report         and    Court

f il e .        Shortly         before          kick-off          time,      I became           aware          of    officers          being

gathered           together          to     go    to       the    Leppings            Ln end        of    the       ground       where

there       was     s om e      form       of    trouble          outside         the     grounds.              I saw          that

officers           having        meals          were       leaving         them,        and    Serials          were       being

quickly assembled                    to a t t e n d .            Together         with        the    officers             from my

serial          taking       part      in       the    earlier        arrests            I was       directed             to    return       to

the      Hop,     a n d we       re-entered                the K o p at          th e    lower       South          end,       next    to    the

South       Stand.           I saw         immediately             t ha t    the        match       had     started,            that    the

Kop was          very      full,       and       looking          o v er    to    the     West       Stand          I saw       that    the

standing          areas         were       very       full       i n deed.        At     that       point       a Liverpool             shot

struck          the N o t t s       goal        crossbar,          I looked             back    to       the L e p p i n g s      Ln    end,

and      saw     t ha t    f a ns    were        on the          perimeter            track     at       the L i v e r p o o l        end,

and      I thought           that      a    pitch          invesion was               imminent.             This      fact wa s

noticed          by N o t t s       fans        around       us,     and     their        mood       changed          to       anger    at

the      Liverpool           fans      behaviour.                 After      a short           time       the       play       stopped,

and      I saw a          single       male       fan       run d o w n      the        pitch       from       the    Liverpool             end

right       up    to      the N o t t s         Penalty          area,      and       shout     and       wave       his       fists    at

t he     Kop.       He w a s        chased        back       towards         the        Liverpool           en d     by    several

officers          and      eventually             tackled          and      floored           by a n      officer          in a y e l l o w

jacket,          who      I believe             was    a Nottinghamshire                      officer.We             were       directed

by     Inspector           CALVERT          to    the       North      end       of     the    Kop,       to
protect       the       s m a ll    segregated              area       containing              about       200      to 3 0 0

Liverpool          fans,       anticipating                 trouble          due       to    the     Liverpool            pitch

invasion.            We a r r i v e d      at     the       segregated                area     with      some       difficulty,                the

Kop    being       very       f u l l , and       formed          a double             cordon        between         the        Notts         and

Liverpool          supporters,                I looked            onto       the       ptich       and     saw      that        play      ha d

been    suspended,             with      no      players          on    the       pi tc h ,     at    the L e p p i n g s          Ln     en d

there     were       many      fans      now      onythe          perimeter             track        and      on    the       pitch.

Since     returning            to    the      K « p , I had            great          difficulty           due      to    crowd          noise

in h e a r i n g     my      personj»4        r a d i o , despite                the    use     of    an ear-pi ec e,               due        to

th e   immense          crowd       no i s e ,    every       t im e        an    officer          attempted             to     pass      a

message       his       microphone            picked         up the          crowed          noise       drowned          out      his

message.        I did         however         picked         up s o m e          conversation about                      opening

gates,       and     permission            being        sought          to       do    so,     and    being         granted,             the

name    of    the       officer        giving          aermission                was    sought        and      identified                as

Superintendent                MARSHALLf

I was     aware         that/ thep'e w a s             some       sort       of       incident        at      the    Leppings             Ln

end,    there        had      obviously           been an          invasion             onto       the     pit c h,       but      th e

attention          of     those      doing        t hi s    was        not       on    the     Notts       fans,         nor     did      there

seem    to    be a n y        violence           of    fighting             going       on.        The     centre         of a c t i v i t y

appeared        to      be    behind       the        Liverpool             goal,       but      I could           not    tell,          due     to

the    distance,             nor    from      the      r a d io    what          was    happening.

The    Notts       fans       around       us w e r e        increasingly                   a n g r y at      the    suspension                  of

play,     and      there       was     much       jeering          and       cat-calling              towards            th e    Liverpool

end;    we    had       to w a r n     some       Notts       fans          making          aggressive             remarks         towards

th e L i v e r p o o 1 f a n s       behind           us,

There     were       now      increasing              numbers          of    officers           heading            towards         the

Liverpool          end,       and    1 saw        some      Liverpool                 fans     come      down       the       pitch

towards       the       Notts       fan s ,      and    h a ve     to       be    restrained             or    directed            back        by

officers        at      our    end.

I believe          t ha t     somewhere           at    this       point          I heard          v i a my        radio        t h at
                                                                                                                                   PAGE              4

people       were       trapped       at    th e      L e p p i ngs L a n e          end,    and       the      officer,           who        ha d

a Southern            accent      urgently            requested             that      bolt-croppers                  or     cutting

equipment          to    be    sent    for.           It w a s at           t hi s    point       t ha t     I realised                t h at

t he     incident        was    serious,             and    that       people         must       be    i n ju r e d.

The     scene      on    the    pitch was             increasingly               chaotic,             with Liverpool                   fans

trying       to    reach       the N o t t s         end w i th a p p a r e n t l y          aggressive                intentions.

I could        see      that    injured          people          were       being      laid       out      on       the     p i t c h at

the     Liverpool         end,       some       of    these       were       carried         down       to      our       end     of    the

pitch      on s t r e t c h e r s ,    a n d St.           John's       s ta f f ,     Police          Officers             and    other

were      tryuing        to    revive       them without                success.             I saw         one       fan,       clad      only

in u n d e r p a n t s    given       up as          de ad,      with       other      being          worked         on n e a r b y ,

none      appeared        to    be    responding.

The     Forest        fans     had all          t h is     time       continued         their          jeering,             even

cheering          when a       body was          carried          down       towards         us,       a n d we        were

inundated with                requests          for      information            as     to w h e n       or      if     the      match

would      restart.

I saw an a m b u l a n c e           enter       the       pitch,       siren         sounding,            increasing              numbers

of     bodies      and    casualties             are       being       carried         down       the      pitch          on

stretchers,             advertisement                boards       and       even      between          several            fans,        most

of     t h e m ar e     not    moving.           I saw          one    officer         carrying            a motionless                 child

out     in his        arms.      L o o k i ng        towards          the W e s t      Stand          people         ar e      being

passed       over       the    heads       of    th e      crowd       in th e        standing          area,          others          ar e

being      pulled        up    into    the       seated          a r ea.       Down     at       the    foot         of     the    Kop

officers          are    having       to    restrain angry                   Liverpool            fans,         a    large        cordon

of     officers         has    now    formed across                   the    centre         of    the      pitch          to    prevent

any     further         aggression,             after       a while          Police         dogs       are      spaced          out

across       the      front     of    the       Kop.        The       Nottingham            fans       had      no w      generally

gone      quieter,        but we       are       s t i ll       inundated            with    requests               for

    From      our       position             on th e      Northern wing                    of       the K o p      I could          clearly           see

    the      numbers          of     casaulties             being        carried            out,          as    the     pitch       exit      passes

    immediately               below          that    wing,         this           was      also        obvious          to    the L i v e r p o o l

    fans      with       us,       and many          were         extremely             u p se t ,        with women           c r y in g .

    Inspector            CALVERT             arranges          for      some       to      be       escorted           through        t he N o t t s

    supporters,               but       it    becomes          obvious            that      th e N o t t s         fans       are     not     any

    threat,          having          realised            th a t    a serious               incident             had     taken       place.

    There         has    been        no m e s s a g e       over        the       public            address        s y s t e m as y e t , I

    hear      a    radio        message         asking            for    the       public            to    be     informed          that      the

    match         is a b a n d o n e d ,       the       caller         is    informed               by    the C o n t r o l        Room,        I

    believe          this was            Chief       Superintendent                     NESBIT,                that     this will           be       d o ne

    only      w h e n all          casualties             have       beeen         evatutated.

    The      first       message             passed       over       the      pg^l i c a d d r e s s              is    unintelligible, I

    am     told      t h is     is K e n n y        DALGL)- I S H , yx he L i v e r p o o l                    manager .           Shor t l y ,

    the      crowd       through a             loud-hailer,                  I was         unable          to     tell       what     he    said.

    Eventually                an a n n o u n c m e n t         is m a d e         t ha t    th e      match        is a b a n d o n e d ,        and

    I am      di r e c t e d       by    Inspector             BURNS         to    take         a    nearby Trans i t , and                   go      to

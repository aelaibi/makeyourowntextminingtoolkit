c o ngestion was           not    helped       by the       heat      of the       day.     I think       it was

stupid that          there were          no gates          rfc^at could be opened to a llow ac c e s s

an d no one seemed to know what was                            going      on at that          stage.

I looked through the fencing                         into     pen three and             it was     still       packed

with    people.        There       were a lot of              people      lying motio n l e s s          on the

floor and          I think       some    of them may have               been       dead,

I cannot       describe          them,    but       1 think      they were all men w e a r i n g                things

similar       to jeans and           t~shirts.             Right      in front        of me      1 saw    lain at

the foot       of the       fence       in pen, three,           at    the      point     I had    climbed        over,

a young white          lad of        1/-18 y e a r s , and            1 was almost          certain       that      he

was    dead.

                a mass of them,                lying      on the floor,             some      of    w hich     1 presume were              dead,

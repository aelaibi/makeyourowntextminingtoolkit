Dear Doctor Popper

Thank you for your letter of 15 May 1990 which concerns the Hillsborough
Disaster.

I saw it as a necessary and important part of my duty as Investigating
Officer to spend asmuch time as possible at the         inquests and I am
extremely grateful for the way you received me in Sheffield.

You are quite correct when you say that I am the Investigating Officer in
respect of criminal    and disciplinary matters which arise      out of the
disaster.   I am under the supervision of the Police Complaints Authority
and I replaced Mr Geoffrey Dear, who has retired from the Police Service to
become an    Inspector of Constabulary.    Mr Jones remains as Coroner's
Officer for you in respect of the 95 deaths which arose          out of the
disaster.    He is presently attached to the Police Staff        College at
Bramshill in Hampshire as part of the directing staff there.        He will
remain available to you for all coronal matters in connection with those 95
deaths.

The last act of Geoffrey Dear before his retirement was to send an interim
report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.   Since then I have received
the Director's advice on that report and I am progressing the necessary
actions which arise from that advice.      Very soon we will conduct the
required interviews but at this stage there is no way that I can estimate
how long that process will take. All I can say is that I am fully awar eof
the need to proceed without delay.      I shall keep you informed as to
progress from time to time.    When all of the interviews are complete it
should not take too long to report to the DPP with my recommendations, but
after that the matter is out of my control as to how long it will take to
make the decisions necessary in respect of prosecutions.

I agree with you that we should meet again in the near future and my staff
will be in touch with your office to find a mutually convenient date.

Insofar as the police report and recommendations are concerned,   I shall
discuss the matter with the PCA and let you know the outcome.

You may care to note that my base for the time being is at Nechell's Green
Police Station in West Midlands, and it is there that I can most easily be
contacted through Detective Chief Superintendent Michael Foster.

Yours sincerely




Chief Constable

HILLSBOROUGH MEMORIAL SERVICE:   15 APRIL

If the Home Secretary attends the memorial service at Anfield on
15 April, he may find it helpful to have sight of the attached
brief notes to remind him on the state of play on the main
current issues.

2.   I understand that this is not an occasion on which there
will be any pre-arranged press call, but there may well be
questions in the course of conversation.

3.   The Home Secretary will remember that he was unable to be
present at the meeting which was requested by the Football
Association and the Football League (Mr Millichip is Chairman of
the Association; Mr Fox of the League) .      The meeting with
Lord Ferrers was successful but the Home Secretary may wish to
apologise, if the occasion presents itself, for his inability to
be present.

                 s ta r te d to leave        the st ad iu m w it h my brother,                              and
                                                                                                                                     3
                 We    left Pen      1 and     by the S o ut h S t a n d           towards    the    rear     of the West

                Stand.



                 Near    to the      t urnst ile s a nd gate C I saw a P ol ic e O f fi ce r who was with

                 a L i ve rpo ol     fan who was           shouting at him.             The     fan was       stand in g      in

                 front of him and was              hysterical           and     calling      him    'a m u r d e r e r 5 and

                 ’m u r d er i ng   bastard'.         He    repeated this a number                  of times.



                 At first       the officer        did not say anyth in g,                he just        shook     his head.

                 A fter a short         time    the     lad star te d         pointing at him and shou ti ng and

                 the officer         then tried to calm him down.                       W he n the fan kept                going   on,
                                                                                                                    P AGh
                                                                                                                    S35S8

               the O ff ic er         s ta rt ed to    raise his voice and            1 think he         lost his temper

               a bit.         T hey then s tarted to move             together as thou gh they were going

               to scuffle           or the officer         was   going       to a rr e st the fan.



               My brother           inte rv en ed and      pulled the         fan a wa y and     tried to calm him

               down.        I think an ot he r         person also      tried to        calm him down a nd my

               brother and            that    person    led him away.           The P o l i c e m a n   then backed off.



               At    this     time     there were a lot of           people a bo ut a nd there was a line of

               P o l i c e m e n s hielding a line of bodies.



               The Officer            was    in un if or m w ea r in g a helmet.           He was a bout 6 ’ tall,

               stocky build.                I c a n ’t describe    him further          but he did seem to be          in

               charge of the s it u a t i o n so I d o n ’t think                  he was a Cons ta bl e.



               I remember           the fan saying         the officer was           laughing at         him but   I

               d i d n ’t see that w hen            I saw the offi ce r         he had a sorrowful look on             his

               face.



                                                                                                                   SIGNED

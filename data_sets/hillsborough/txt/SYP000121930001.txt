                 On the     date       s hown above,         I was     enga g e d     on duties inc o n n e c t i o n with

                 the FA Cup Semi              final,      Liverpool        v Notts Forest.

                 On that       date      I was     in a serial         of men,       mostly        comprising       the

                 R o t h e r h a m A rea C on st a b l e s    led by PS 2171            Pat Keenan.           Our       duties

                 consisted          of P o l i c in g    the outside       area of the T u r n s t i l e s at               the

                 e n t rance       to the     ’L e p p i n g s Lane*    stand.         The area       concerned was a

                 rough triangle,              being widest at the              road and n a rrowing            down towards

                 the actual          turnstiles.           We u n d e r s t o o d that      suppo r t e r s   of Liverpool            PC

                w ould     be using         'our*       turnstiles.

                Prior      to taking         up our       duties we        had a briefing, g iven              by Chief           Sup't

                Mole.

                We took        up our       duties       at the turns t i l e s        aro u n d   ISnoort and at that

                 time    it was        very quiet.

                PS K e e n e n had split            us    into    pairs,      each     pair    covering       one       turnstile

                entrance.

v   g en er a l l y jovial          an d    "tongue        in cheeked'         and      I re-call         that we had

     built      up a fine           pile    of beer and           lager    Cans       (all    full)       at    the side of

     the      entrances,          t a k en from fans         entering          the ground.

    Liver pu d d l i a n s a rr i v e d and w i t h i n m i n u t e s a crush s i t u a t i o n developed.

    The       g e o g r aphical      lay out       of these        t u r n s t i l e s was    not    conducive       to

     large       numbers       of    people       trying     to get       through them,             and very shortly,

     all      of the       offic e r s     in our serial           had    been       pushed back firmly             onto

     the wall         where       the actual        t u rnstiles         gaps are.           We were fairly

     helpless         to    re-act       to any s it ua t i o n         but, we were         fortunate          in that,

     a lt h o u g h the a tm os p h e r e was          boist e r o u s and           reeking     of alcohol,         the

     general       moo d of those            people        remained       happy.

     A    large     part of that            crush was        caused by people                trying to use the

     turnstiles            who's     number was        shown on their                ticket,     w hen        in fact all

     of the t ur n s t i l e s         led to the          same    standing area w i t h i n the                 ground.

     The      stewards       on the        t urnstiles       were       told    to    let    people       thro u g h just

    as       long as       they had a ticket               for the       e n closure and once we were able

     to      communicate          this     to the     crowds,       they quic k l y and safely entered

     the .ground.

    At       no time did we            operate any type of                cordon system             to    relieve    the

     crush.        Such a system w ou ld have                     been tota l l y        impracticable            in such a

     dense       crush,      one     just    gets     swept along wit h the                  crowd until          one hits

    a w a 11.

    At       no time were an y of the mai n gates                         opened.           I do not know whether

     there were            other    o f f icers     inside        the    ground       directing          fans    to various

     enclosures,            but     later    on    I saw the entire              crowd       in the L e p p i n g s Lane

            I have ''visited 82 football                         league        grounds      in England.         I have always

            conlri dered H i l l s b o r o u g h          one of the            safest an d best.             I know the

            ground very well                  an d the only det remental                    aspect    of the entrance

            fa c i li ty        is the       nar r o w i n g    tria n g u l a r     f o recourt    leading     to the

  ^ .       On 9 April             1988,      my feelings              after    the      crush   I had e x p e r i e n c e d were

            of     relief        it was       over.        It was        hot,      breathless,       s w e a t y , painful    and

            smelly,           i n g r e dients      one quite           r e a dilly accepts        on semi      final     days,

            (viz        if    it were        not    crowded and jostly                   it w ould be strange)          and as

            such        I do believe            that     no one from my serial                   made any

            r ep re se nt a t i o n s        about     the      crush situation.

            After        the m at ch had finished,                      we were       delegated      public     order     duties

            a r o un d       the ground.            I did not witn e s s any trouble.                      I made    nd

            a r r e s t s , the m o o d of the                 crowd     remaining         carnival     like.

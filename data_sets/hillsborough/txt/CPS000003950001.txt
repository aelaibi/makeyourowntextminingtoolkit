           HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - RELEASE OF CRUSH BARRIER 124A

           Further to our telephone call of this afternoon, you will recall some
           weeks ago we discussed release of crush barrier 124A for the purpose of
           tests to be carried out by parties to the civil proceedings. Although
           these civil proceedings, set for 19 June 1990, are unlikely to go ahead
           there is still considerable interest in access to the barrier for the
           purpose of tests.

           I have since written to Lord Justice Taylor, the Health and Safety
           Executive, HM Coroner in Sheffield and Forensic Science Service. You
           will see attached replies from each of these parties indicating that
           they are quite happy for the barrier to be released for such tests.

            Accordingly I have now written to each of the parties, including of
            course the owners, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, indicating that
            the barrier is available. I have arranged for all enquiries about
            access to be made to me so that I can ensure that our representive is
            available to monitor the tests, take any photographs and receive early
            copy of their results. This is in accordance with your original letter
            on this subject.

            I have choosen as our representative Mr P B Wilson, Principal Scientific
            Officer at the Home Office Forensic Science Service Laboratory at
            Wetherby (see attached letter). Mr Wilson has been particularly helpful
            to us and would seem to be the ideal choice from a technical point of
            view. I will also arrange for one of my senior officers to be present.




       PLEASE REPLY T O T H E OFFICE A T          Lloyd House,. Birmingham,
                                  -   2   -




Whilst I would recommend to you that we release the barrier for tests,
we would not want to release total custody of the barrier until such
time that a decision has been reached by the Director of Public
Prosecutions and the Coroner has concluded his inquests. In other words,
the release of the barrier for testing will only be on a temporary and
supervised basis.

    Dear MrJt>nes

    HLLLSBORCOGH INQUIRY - BARRIER 124A

    In your letter of 26 October 1989 you wrote concerning various matters which we
    had previously discussed on the telephone. Hie one outstanding item concerns
    barrier 124A. We have completed our studies on this barrier and have no
    further use for it. I have discussed this matter with Professor Maunder and he
    too agrees that no further work is required of HSE.

    As you know, your colleague from the Forensic Science Service has examined the
    barrier at our laboratories and will shortly receive a draft copy of our
    metallurgical report. He will then be able to give his view on the need for
    any further work.

    As far as HSE are concerned, I am ready to release the barrier upon your
    instruction following your communications with Lord Justice Taylor, HM Coroner
    and the Director of Public Prosecutions as outlined in your letter.

    Two sets of the IKE photographs are enclosed as requested.                                 An invoice will be
    sent to you in due course.

    Yours sincerely

    Dear Mervyn,

    Ret HILLSBOROUGH - RELEASE OF CRUSH BARRIER 124A.

    Thank you for your letter of the 24th of November. I refer
    to my letter to you on this subject of the 2nd of November
    1989.
    I note that you seem to have consents from all parties apart
    from the Forensic Science Service who have not yet indicated
    to you what their wishes are.

    I can confirm that if they have no objection to the release
    of the barrier, I can see no reason why I should stand in anybody*s
    way with regard to this and you may take this letter as confirmation
    that the barrier may be released to the rightful owner.

    However, you will no doubt, when writing to the parties, remind them
    that copies of reports and data obtained by further tests should

Dear Mr. Jones,

                Hillsborough Inquiry, crush Barrier 124A

     I have read the draft report on the examination of barrier
124A prepared by P.F. Heyes and J.G. Tattersall of the Health and
Safety Executive, Research and Laboratory Services Division,
Sheffield.  On the 29th November 1989 I visited the laboratory,
inspected the barrier and discussed the findings with Dr. Heyes and
Mr. Tattersall.

     I understand that plans are in hand for the laboratory to carry
out a bend test on a length of tube similar to one in 124A.
However, this will not require the presence of 124A at the
laboratory.

     The draft report is detailed and comprehensive, and I do not
think that it is necessary for the laboratory to carry out any
further metallurgical work on 124A.

     I can therefore see no objection should you decide to recommend
that 124A now be released from the custody of the Health and Safety
Executive laboratory.

                              Yours sincerely,




                              P.B. Wilson

I ha d       been         to H i l l s b o r o u g h       on    three       previous             occassions             and     I was          not

Myself         and                                   got to          the    e n d of        the    tunnel          at    a t im e     I     would

estimate             to    be     a short           time a f t e r         2.52    pm       (1452).           At    the       end         of the

tunnel         I could            see        that    the p l a y e r s       were       out       on    the    pitch          for t h e i r

kick       a bou t .         I    can        remember seeing                Alan HANSON.

As     s o o n as we             got    to    the     end       of    the    tunnel          I found          that       I was        suddenly

pushed         from        behind        forwards           and       to m y      left       into       pen n u m b e r        four,        at

I was        gradually             pushed       forwards              down       the    terracing             and       over     to       the

to     go a l o n g        with        the    movement           of    the       crowd       in th is         gradual          pushing

forwards             and     down       the    terracing.                  It w a s     difficult             to    keep yourself

By a tim /t' I would                    say was        about          2.57pm       ( 1457)         1 had       been        pushed

forwards             to a        position       I have           m a r k e d as        number          one    (1)       on the        separate

Th e       first      time        I realised           that          the    game       had       kicked       off w a s        about        3 or

4 minutes             after        arriving           at    position             one    (1).           I could          see    a fe w

           four,      these       supporters                were       hanging        down        into        the    front        of    the    pen

           trying      to     pull        people        up out          of    the     crowd,            a n d as     this     was       occurring

           The      first     time        in     position          number           one    <1)       that      I could        see       anything

           occurring          on the           pitch was           when       I saw N o tt i n g h a m Forest                     playing        the

           ball      towards         Leppings           Ln and          then        they^tfre            awarded        a    co rner.

           people      passing            him     over       their          heads     were        struggling            because          he w a s        a

           off as      the       people          struggled             to    pass     him       over      head.

           I cannot         remember             much about             t his m a n        but       I think         he w a s      fair       hai r e d .

w ^ o te   I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r          anything           about       his     clothing,               the    only     thing          I can say

           is t hat        his    f ac e       was     purple          and    I formed            the     opinion           that       the m a n     had

           obviously          stopped            breathing.

           It w a s    at a b o u t         the      time     that          I saw     this        man     t hat      I found           that    the

           pressure         a r o u n d me        had       eased       slightly           and       I started          pushing          my way

           over      towards         my     left       hand       side       and     towards            the    dividing           fence       between

           what      I now know             to    be    pens       numbers           f o ur     and      five.

           I concentrated my                     efforts          on    getting           to    t hi s    dividing           fence.           I could

           see      that a       lot      of     people       were          climbing           o ve r    this       fence     into       pen n u m b e r

           f ive     a n d as     they         did     so    this       made        things        easier         for me as             the    pressure

           a r o u n d me     decreased.

           It t oo k       me a b o u t        two     minutes          to    get     to       the      dividing        f en c e ,      two m i n u t e s

body    of    the m a n        b e ing     passed           over       the      heads    of the        supporters.                I did

not    see    if the          body was           passed          o ve r    the    perimeter          f en c e ,     I lost        sight

of    it as     s o o n as         I started           to m o v e         from    position          number         one    (1).

I a r r i v e d at a          position adjacent                     to     the    dividing          fence        in a n    exhausted

state    because             of m y      previous           breathing            difficulties.                I have m a rk ed

this    p osi ti on as             number        two    (2)       o n the        separate        grid        plan.

On arriving             at    position           number          two      <2)    I stood       directly            in f r o n t       of a

crush barrier                with my       back        to    the       pitch,      so    I am unable               to    sa y    if the

game was        s t ill       in    play     or    ha d      been         staffed.

I stood       in    position             number        two       (2l/tor         about     two      minutes         to    ge t    my

breath       back       and    then       I cl imbejj/onto                 the    crush       barrier         and with           h e lp

from    people          in    pen n u m b e r y f v e ,            I climbed           over    the     dividing           fence        into

pen n u m b e r     five .          As    I >fot o v e r          the      dividing        fence,         I walked          straight

down    the     pen      towards          the     pitch and               1 could       see    th at      the      game     had       been

stopped,           I think          the    players           had       left      the    pitch.

On    getting       onto       the       pitch,        I immediately               lay d o w n       on      the    pitch        in an

area    by the N o r t h S t a n d               corner          f lag.         I lay    in t hi s        position          for

between       five and             ten m i n u t e s        to     compose        myself.           I fel t        like     I h ad        run

a marathon.              During          t his    t im e     I was         not    taking       any     particular               notice

of w h a t    was       going       on a r o u n d me.

At    a t ime      I would          estimate           to    be a b o u t       3.13pm     (1515),           I     had    composed

myself       and    I go t         up f r o m     the       pitch.           I could       see      t ha t    at    this        time

there    were       a    lot       of    people        on    the       pitch walking             around          in the         area      of

the L e p p i n g s      Lane       end     goa l .         I immediatelywalked                     across         the     pitch

towards       the       goal,       as     I did       so,        Is a w a bo y          lying      on the pitch,                he

was    l ying      on his          back    in a n a r e a           around        by    the N o r t h S t a n d          side     post

area    in w h i c h he w a s             lying.

There    were about                three     or    four          people         kneeling       on    the      pitch a ro u nd

                 mouth       to m o u t h .         I think          another          supporter             was    kneeling          down       by the

                 boys    legs.           I placed myself                   in a       position            beside     the       boy    from where                 I

                 could admin ist er                 external           cardiac          massage.             I identified myself                       to       the

                 people        by the       boy and            I think        I told          t he m a n who         was       giving        the       b oy

                 mouth       to m o u t h      to    continue,             I gave          cardiac          massage.

                 On    first      seeing         t h is     boy      I formed           the      o p i n i o h e                was     dead,          he was

                 very    pale a n d         had      stopped           breathing.                We^&ttempted             to    r e s u s c i t a te        this

                 After       about       four       minutes          of    resuscitation,                   a man    came       ov er      to    us,        he

             pi to h e l p this           b oy      did     not      know     him.

                 I c an n o t     remember           much about              t hi s     boy,      I can o n l y          describe          h i m as         a

                 tall    and      very      slim,         he    h ad      short       dark       h ai r              remember           he      ha d    d a rk

                 After       leaving        the      position where                   t his      boy was          lying,       I walked          towards

                 the S o u t h       st an d.        I think           I walked            behind         the     goal.     I c a n ’t say

                 exactly        how      far,       only a few             feet.           And    ly ing        on the      edge      of     the       pitch

I saw     the     body        of a n o t h e r        male       l y i ng        on his      back.        There        was    a St.

Johns     Ambulance            man      by the         head an d another                     couple       of    supporters

kneeling         around        the man.               I saw        t h at        someone,        I presume          the      St.      Johns

man,     ha d    inserted a             brookes           airway           into      the m a n s       mouth.          I also         saw

t hat    the     flange        had      been      pushed           into          the m o u t h    instead         of    sealing            the

lips.       I again           introduced myself                       and        commenced        cardiac        massage,             the

S t . Johns       Ambulance             man was           giving           the     sub^jjrC't m o u t h        to m o u t h .

When     I first         approached              this       man       I                  recall        him     looking        as      bad as

the     young     boy,        although           I have          to       sa y    I c a n ’t recall            much about             him &

his     condition.             I think           we    ha d      been a tte mp ti ng              to    revive         this       man      for

about     two m i n u t e s       when        a man approached                       us,     I c a n ’t rec all            what       he

looked     like,         he    said       he was          a Doctor.                 I sa w    him      feel     for     a femeral

artery,         after        doing      th is     the m a n           just        said     there       .is n o t h i n g     you      can do

for     him.

After     we     ha d    stopped a group                    of     supporters              put    the m a n ’s b o d y            on a n

advertising             hoarding          and     carried             him        off.

I cannot         say m u c h a b o u t           t h is     man       other        than      he wa s      a white          m a l e.        I

never     got m u c h         of a      look      at      his      face          because      the St.          Johns       m a n was

over     his     head.         I cannot           say       h ow      old        he was,      he w a s       about      5'9       tall         and

of m e d i u m    buil d.          I cannot            remember             anything          about       what      clothes           he was

wearing,




I can o n l y       estimate            t ha t    it w o u l d            have     been about           3.20pm         (1520)         when          I

first     saw     this        man,      all      I can s a y a b o u t               his     c o n d i t i o n at      that       time         is

that     he was         not    breathing.

After     t hi s m a n was             t oo k a w a y       on     the       hoarding,           I had a v e r y           quick

look     around,         all     of     those         people          lying        on the        pitch a p p e a r e d        to      be

attended,         also        by t his        time        there           was     a St.      Johns      Ambulance            on    the

pitch.

In    relation          to    t im e    I can         say     t ha t       about        three     minutes         after       we

               stopped working                       on       the m a n         previously mentioned,                                                                   I saw a S o u t h

               I eventually                    found                       wandering                  around                                 on the                     pitch       in a n a r e a

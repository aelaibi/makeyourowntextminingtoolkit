   Dear Sir

   HILLSBOROUGH PROSECUTIONS

   Thank you for your helpful letter of 15 July 1998.

   Our instructions are to follow your advice and take no action until such time as you have completed
   your own deliberations as regards the private prosecution.

   We should be most grateful if you could contact us once again once your review has been completed
   letting us know what the outcome of that review is.

   Thank you for your assistance.

   Yours faithfully

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Scrutiny

At our meeting on 25 November 1997, I undertook to look into two topics and to furnish you
with further information.

The first issue is my apology for the errors of South Yorkshire Police. I enclose a folder of
press cuttings from March 1991 and January 1992, a press release of December 1996 and
press cuttings from December 1996. These cuttings record only a small number of the
times I have apologised for the Force’s errors; there have been many others but we do not
appear to have records of them.

The second issue is our response to the requests for material held in our archives. I attach
a schedule of requests received between June 1997 (the announcement of the Scrutiny)
and 3 December 1997 (the date of preparing the schedule). The nature of the requests
varied from a single item to complete body files containing many statements, photographs
or plans.

If I can be of further assistance on these or other issues, please do not hesitate to contact
me.

       Dear Sr

       th e desire for retribution in those who have experienced sudden and unexpected loss w | be
       understood by many who have experienced suffering as part of the process of negotiating wth Pate
       and of healing. To lose loved ones is to intensify that process unimaginably and we can only guess
       at the sense of outrage and the strength of the desire to punish which such feelings engender.

       The intensity and irrationality of that retributive urge is why a civilised society entrusts its need for
       revenge to a legal process, however imperfect, tempering those raw emotions with intellectual rigour
       and a respect for the rights of everyone involved, not merely those who demand a scapegoat, but
       the rights of the potential scapegoat as well.

       I can understand therefore why some of those who tost their loved ones at the Hillsborough disaster
       st31fed the need for revenge. I find it harder to understand the motives of a leading article which
       bemoans the lack of an individual policeman to blame, and which deliberately chooses to ignore the
       known facts of the case.

       Nothing I say can after events; nothing that I say will hejp to heal the hut of those who suffered by
       the disaster.

       Nevertheless it is right that I should attempt to correct the misunderstandings of the truth
       represented in your columns. The truth is that Lord Justice Taylor described the failure of the police
       to order the closure of the tunnel leading to the terracing as a "blunder of the first magnitude1.
       South Yorkshire Police have consistently and unequivocally accepted the truth of this finding. I
       repeat ft now. How can anyone fairly describe this acceptance of responsibility as evasion?

       Not only the police were to blame. You will recall that Lord Justice Taylor concluded that there were
       many factors that contributed to the disaster - the layout of the crush barriers, the dangerous
       congestion arising at the turnstiles, inadequate signing - were some.

       The Director of Public Prosecutions made a judgment on consideration of the evidence relating to
       criminal charges and decided that no criminal proceedings are to be brought against any person.

       A veidict of accidental death was decided by the jury who considered and tested the evidence over
       the longest Coroner's Inquests ever held.

       The Police Complaints Authority in discharging its responsibility made a judgment that no disciplinary
       proceedings should be brought against Superintendent Murray.

   “W e feel that the knowledge of our opposition and the expectation of our scrutiny has
   probably helped to encourage that.


  “Our third point of concern a year ago was that a drama-documentary was unlikely to
  succeed,    w here    extensive judicial    process   had failed,   in   producing   conclusive
  agreem ent on all the facts and theories about that day. I still feel that now: there was no
  new eviden ce in the programme. Claims about missing tapes and changed statements
  w ere all, in fact, issues that were known about and dealt with in an above-board fashion
  in the e a rlie r hearings.   There is nothing here to suggest the need for new official
  scrutiny.


 “W h at is new, however, is the full telling of a story o f human suffering through the eyes
 of the b ereaved fam ilies.    W e will all draw something from that, but I think the future
 must be about reconciliation rather than retribution."


 M r W ells said that much good had followed on from the disaster: redesign of stadia,
 growing change in the behaviour of football supporters, new policing methods for
 planning, training and briefing and better technology for monitoring safety.


“I am on public record as saying sorry to the bereaved families for the police’s part in the
tragedy and I repeat that every time I have the opportunity. W e were found wanting and
have faced up to our responsibility for our role, but we were not the only ones who
played a part in it and it is time for others, including the fans, to do the same and for the
fam ilies to try to start building bridges,” said M r Wells.

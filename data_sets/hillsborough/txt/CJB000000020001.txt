        My Dear Lord Mayor,

              It is impossible to find words at this moment which adequately
        express our deepest sympathy, extended to the families and friends
        of all those who lost their lives at Hillsborough last Saturday after­
        noon.

             Our local community has been deeply saddened by this tragedy and
        our thoughts and prayers are with all concerned as we attempt to share
        their grief.

             I enclose a cheque for £1,000 from my City Council as a donation
        towards the Appeal and we hope that this will assist in some small way
        towards relieving distress.

             I am also writing to the Chairman of the Liverpool' City Council
        (Councillor (Mrs) Dorothy Gavin) with similar sentiments being expressed
        to Mr. John Smith, Chairman of the Liverpool Football Club and Mr. H. E.
        McGee, Chairman of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

                                    Yours sincerely,

                     Dear Mr. Pens am,

                     Hillsborough Disaster Appeal

                     I understand, from AMA Finance Circular 44/89, that your Department is
                     currently administering the Appeal Fund established by the Lord Mayors of
                     Liverpool, Sheffield and Nottingham to assist the injury victims of the
                     Hillsborough tragedy, together with the relatives and dependants of those
                     who lost their lives.

                     In response to that Appeal, my Council have decided to make a contribution
                     to the Fund and I enclose herewith a cheque in the sum of £5,000.

                     My members are aware that direct material assistance can only go so far in
                     meeting the immediate physical needs of those bereaved and they especially
                     hope that vital spiritual comfort will be derived from the less-publicised
                     counselling which officers of the Social Services Department of this Council
                     (among others) have hastened to provide.

                     Yours sincerely,

Dear Messier Longuemar

I wish to thank you most sincerely for the kind letter of sympathy Which you
sent to us    following the tragic events at Hillsborough and for your very
generous contribution to the Disaster Fund.

As you will appreciate, I and my colleagues have been overwhelmed with
messages of condolence, support and assistance since the tragedy occurred and
it has taken some time to get round to acknowledging all the many messages
which we received.

It was, nevertheless, very heartening that so many people took the trouble to
write to us to express their feelings and to know that so many people were
thinking about the people of Sheffield at that time.


I do want to express, most warmly, my thanks for the letter which you sent.
It was extremely helpful to have so many letters from friends and colleagues
at that time of difficulty for us all.

Yours sincerely,




C. J. C. BETTS

  Dear Councillor Betts

                                                           Disaster Fund

  My colleagues and I were deeply shocked to see the distressing events at
  Hillsborough.

  We would like to send our deepest sympathies to the relatives and friends
  of the deceased and our condolences to the cities of Liverpool, Nottingham
  and Sheffield.  We feel particularly saddened because so many lost their
  lives at a sporting event and our sympathies are all the more heart-felt
  because only so recently before, we had committed ourselves closely to
  Sheffield's sporting future for the city and the World Student Games.

  We would like to mark our respect for the dead and solidarity with the
  mourners in contributing to the Disaster Fund.  Accordingly, I would be
  grateful if you would pass on the enclosed cheque to the appropriate
  trustees.

  With our deepest condolences.

                                                     Yours sincerely

Ms Helen Aspey,
Hon. Secretary,
Lambeth Pensioners* Action Group,

SHEFFIELD.




Dear Ms. Aspey,

I wish to thank you most sincerely for the kind letter of sympathy which     you
sent to us following the tragic events at Hillsborough.

As    you   will appreciate,   I and my colleagues have    been overwhelmed with
messages    of condolence, support and assistance since the tragedy occurred and
it    has   taken  some time to get round to acknowledging all the many messages
which we    received.

It was, nevertheless, very heartening that so many people took the trouble to
write  to us   to express their feelings and to know that so many people were
thinking about the people of Sheffield at that time.


I do want to express, most warmly, my thanks for the letter which you     sent.
It    was extremely helpful to have so many letters from friends and colleagues
at   that time of difficulty for us all.

Yours sincerely,




C. J. C. BETTS

            Dear
            HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM TRAGEDY : FINANCING OF WEST MIDLANDS POLICE ENQUIRY
            Further to yesterday's telephone conversation I confirm that a meeting has
            been arranged with Lord Ferrers to discuss the financing of the inquiry by
            the Chief Constable of West Midlands into the Hillsborough Stadium Tragedy,
            for 10.30 am on Tuesday, 20 June, in the Home Office. I will send you a
            briefing note nearer the time to take account of any developments between now
            and then. In the meantime I enclose a note of an officer level meeting on
            this subject last week.
            I suggest we travel down on the inter city train which leaves Doncaster at
            0750 and arrives at Kings Cross at 0940. Unless I hear from you to the
            contrary I will send the rail ticket together with the briefing note.
            Yours sincerely

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM TRAGEDY

FINANCING OF WEST MIDLANDS POLICE INQUIRY

Notes of a meeting at the Home Office on Thursday. 18 May 1989

Present:   Messrs J Addison, N Nagler, E Soden, F Archer, S Waghorn and
           Ms P Ransford - Home Office
           Messrs R C Johnston and T Watson - South Yorkshire Police Authority

1     The purpose of the meeting was    to discuss the financing of the inquiry
       into the Hillsborough Disaster   being carried out by the West Midlands
       Police following a letter from   the Police Authority to the Home Secretary
       seeking his assurance that the   cost would be met by central government.
2     The Home Office starting point was set out by Mr Addison as follows.
2.1   The inquiry was started at the initiative of the Chief Constable of South
       Yorkshire who had invited the Chief Constable of West Midlands to carry
       out an investigation into the happenings at Hillsborough Stadium on
       Saturday, 15 April 1989. While the Home Secretary had made it clear that
       the work to be carried out would be "at the service of Lord Justice
       Taylor"its principle focus was connected with policing in South Yorkshire
       and the actions of some of the members of the South Yorkshire Force would
       be central to the inquiry. Consequently the financing of the
       investigation should be met, at least in the first instance, by South
       Yorkshire Police Authority.
2.2   It was important that the discussion should concentrate on the principle
      of the issue rather than the financial detail.
3     The South Yorkshire position was as follows.
3.1   The last point of the Home Office statement was agreed.
3.2   While the first steps to set up the West Midlands investigation had been
       taken by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, this initiative had quite
       properly been overtaken within 48 hours by the announcement of an inquiry
       to be headed by Lord Justice Taylor. The choice of West Midlands as the
       appropriate Force had been made by the Home Office and it was to Lord
       Justice Taylor that the Chief Constable of the West Midlands was reporting
       exclusively. The scope of Lord Taylor’s inquiry went far beyond policing
       of South Yorkshire in to questions at a national level of "the needs of
       crowd control and safety at sports grounds".
3.3   The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire was himself devoting substantial
      resources in to carrying out an investigation in to the events of 15 April
      for the purpose of briefing his own Counsel for the public enquiry.
3.3   In view of the national nature of the inquiry and the fact that West
      Midlands Chief Constable was reporting to Lord Justice Taylor, the full
      cost of his work should be met by central government.
4     After this initial statement of positions a number of further points were
      made including:
4.1   Agreed that the West Midlands inquiry probably did not fall under Section
      14 of the Police Act 1964.
4.2   Nonetheless Mr Addison proposed that mutual aid was a reasonable basis for
       sharing the cost between South Yorkshire and central government (for
       example the miners’ strike had seen a limit placed on local expenditure of
       the equivalent of a p rate - approximately Elm).
4.3   Considerable discussion as to the notional scale of the West Midlands
       investigation if no national inquiry had been established.
4.4   Relevance of West Midlands investigation to national aspects of Lord
       Taylor’s inquiry.
4.5   Financial resources of South Yorkshire Police Authority and degree of
       insurance against claims.
4.6   Urgent need for decision as West Midlands were incurring substantial
       expenditure and seeking reimbursement.
5     South Yorkshire stated that it might accept a proportion of the total cost
       of police inquiries (including those of its own force) on the basis
       originally set out in the Home Office letter of 8 May 1989. This would
       take in to account the relative relevance of the work to policing in South
       Yorkshire as against the national question of safety at sports grounds.
       It was important that the government should accept that its contribution
       reflected the national importance of the inquiry rather than the financial
       inability of South Yorkshire Police Authority to meet the total cost.
6     The Home Office could not accept this last principle.
7     It was agreed that the difference in approach between the two sides
       demanded an urgent meeting at political level.

Dear

I was very grateful to receive your letter and the suggestion of
a comprehensive, computerised list of those with particular skills.
I think it is an excellent idea.

I am writing to the Fire and Civil Defence Authority and to Neil
Kay as Director of Social Services, to suggest that they investigate
your proposal further.

O nce again, my thanks for being so constructive and helpful.

Wit h all good wishes

    Mr D Blunkett MP
    House of Commons
    LONDON
    SW1A OAA

     Dear Mr Blunkett

     Thank you       for       your   letter of   24 May      1989 enclosing a   letter         you received      from


    Please do not think I am being bureaucratic or over cautious in saying   it would
    be inappropriate (impossible, actually) for me to investigate their suggestion
    because the FCDA does not have the statutory powers or responsibilities possessed
    by Sheffield City Council, other Met and shire Districts/London Boroughs and
    County Councils in relation to planning for and mitigating major peacetime
    disasters.  This discretionary power (Section 138, Local Government Act 19 72) was
    specifically taken away from the new joint boards by the Abolition Act.     It has
    been a bone of contention between the AMA and the Home Office ever since and I
    regret that the Home Office show no sign of moderating their intransigence.     So,
    having set out the limits of the competence and authority we operate under, let
    me try to be more helpful and offer some observations and suggestions based on
    what this Unit has come across in the limited amount of peacetime disaster
    research it does.

    On call-out lists of particular skills and expertise, at one end it was only
    because six plastic surgeons were at a Leicester Conference during Piper Alpha
    that they were able to charter a plane and fly to Aberdeen.     At the other end,
    there are    properly organised call-out lists of staff on standby who are being
    paid to be available during the standby period.    Shift based occupations in the
    public and private sectors seem by and large to have got their act together but
    the sudden impact of a disaster tends to destroy even the most efficient of
    schemes because of its demands on people and resources.   It is self evident that
    in the immediate aftermath there is always a mis-match between skills/resources
    and needs.  After Kings Cross, University College Hospital used the system where
    as hospital staff arrived (I do not know whether they were called in or whether
    they saw it their duty to come in), they picked up a pre-positioned task
    notification and went away and did it.      This obviously did not apply to eg
    anaesthetists     who went to their own specialist work stations.    This sort of
    system comes near to what Judie and Andy Wood are suggesting with their Red
    skills etc.   However, I would be sceptical about the operational utility of over
    sophisticated lists of people and skills because they quickly get out of date and
    may actually impede effective disaster response rather than aid it.
There is also some evidence to show that recovery operations whether in a
Hospital or at the site of the disaster itself can be impeded by too many people
trying to do too much.   In that sense                     Idid exactly the right
thing by telephoning in and saying where they were in case they were needed.

Medium and long term victim support for people who were at Hillsborough and their
families and those of the dead is an open ended commitment by Social Services,
the  Churches,  and voluntary   organisations.    The allocation    of  individual
Counsellors to people obviously has to take continuity into account and is
therefore a more measured response than coping with the immediate aftermath.   The
organisation and processes of victim support are comparatively recent phenomena
(Bradford in particular) and I expect that Hillsborough will produce further
lessons for the next major disaster - whenever and wherever it occurs.

I would like to end with the apology I started with but it really is difficult
for a Unit with very limited direct responsibilities for peacetime disasters to
offer much more than a commentary.     In i                  case, the hospitals
themselves are responsible for implementing their Major Incident Procedures with
the  DHA and Trent RHA having complementary co-ordinating responsibilities.
Equally, I am sure Mr Kay in Family and Community Services would let you know how
his department and staff responded.

Finally, I understand that the Trent RHA report on Kegworth was due out on 6
June.  We have not seen it yet but if you would like a copy, please let me know.

I hope this helps.

Yours sincerely

              Dear Member
              HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM TRAGEDY : FINANCING OF WEST MIDLANDS POLICE INQUIRY
              Following the meeting of the Finance and General Purposes Committee I wrote to
              the Secretary of State to seek his confirmation that the full cost of the West
              Midlands inquiry (and we are talking of several million £s) would be borne by
              central government. I attach a note of an officer level meeting held in
              consequence from which you will see that the Home Office is taking the view that
              the costs are chargeable, at least in the first instance, to the Police
              Authority.
              It was agreed at the meeting that a meeting at political level should be                                           heldas
              a matter of urgency to resolve this disagreement and Sir Jack has agreed                                           that
              this is the appropriate way forward.
              I will write to you again when it has been decided when the meeting should take
              place and in what form. In the meantime please let me know if you have any
              comments.
              Yours sincerely

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM TRAGEDY

FINANCING OF WEST MIDLANDS POLICE INQUIRY

Notes of a meeting at the Home Office on Thursday, 18 May 1989

Present:   Messrs J Addison, N Nagler, E Soden, F Archer, S Waghorn and
           Ms P Ransford - Home Office
           Messrs R C Johnston and T Watson - South Yorkshire Police Authority

1     The purpose of the meeting was    to discuss the financing of the inquiry
       into the Hillsborough Disaster   being carried out by the West Midlands
       Police following a letter from   the Police Authority to the Home Secretary
       seeking his assurance that the   cost would be met by central government.
2     The Home Office starting point was set out by Mr Addison as follows.
2.1   The inquiry was started at the initiative of the Chief Constable of South
       Yorkshire who had invited the Chief Constable of West Midlands to carry
       out an investigation into the happenings at Hillsborough Stadium on
       Saturday, 15 April 1989. While the Home Secretary had made it clear that
       the work to be carried out would be "at the service of Lord Justice
       Taylor"its principle focus was connected with policing in South Yorkshire
       and the actions of some of the members of the South Yorkshire Force would
       be central to the inquiry. Consequently the financing of the
       investigation should be met, at least in the first instance, by South
       Yorkshire Police Authority.
2.2   It was important that the discussion should concentrate on the principle
      of the issue rather than the financial detail.
3     The South Yorkshire position was as follows.
3.1   The last point of the Home Office statement was agreed.
3.2   While the first steps to set up the West Midlands investigation had been
       taken by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, this initiative had quite
       properly been overtaken within 48 hours by the announcement of an inquiry
       to be headed by Lord Justice Taylor. The choice of West Midlands as the
       appropriate Force had been made by the Home Office and it was to Lord
       Justice Taylor that the Chief Constable of the West Midlands was reporting
       exclusively. The scope of Lord Taylor’s inquiry went far beyond policing
       of South Yorkshire in to questions at a national level of "the needs of
       crowd control and safety at sports grounds".
3.3   The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire was himself devoting substantial
      resources in to carrying out an investigation in to the events of 15 April
      for the purpose of briefing his own Counsel for the public enquiry.
3.3   In view of the national nature of the inquiry and the fact that West
      Midlands Chief Constable was reporting to Lord Justice Taylor, the full
      cost of his work should be met by central government.
4     After this initial statement of positions a number of further points were
       made including:
4.1   Agreed that the West Midlands inquiry probably did not fall under Section
       14 of the Police Act 1964.
4.2   Nonetheless Mr Addison proposed that mutual aid was a reasonable basis for
       sharing the cost between South Yorkshire and central government (for
       example the miners’ strike had seen a limit placed on local expenditure of
       the equivalent of a^-p rate - approximately Elm).
4.3   Considerable discussion as to the notional scale of the West Midlands
       investigation if no national inquiry had been established.
4.4   Relevance of West Midlands investigation to national aspects of Lord
      Taylor’s inquiry.
4.5   Financial resources of South Yorkshire Police Authority and degree of
       insurance against claims.
4.6   Urgent need for decision as West Midlands were incurring substantial
       expenditure and seeking reimbursement.
5     South Yorkshire stated that it might accept a proportion of the total cost
       of police inquiries (including those of its own force) on the basis
       originally set out in the Home Office letter of 8 May 1989. This would
       take in to account the relative relevance of the work to policing in South
       Yorkshire as against the national question of safety at sports grounds.
       It was important that the government should accept that its contribution
       reflected the national importance of the inquiry rather than the financial
       inability of South Yorkshire Police Authority to meet the total cost.
6     The Home Office could not accept this last principle.
7     It was agreed that the difference in approach between the two sides
       demanded an urgent meeting at political level.

            HILLSBOROUGH: TRUSTEES VISIT - MONDAY 22nd MAY


            I attach a press release concerning the above.  This has been sent out

             1.00 pm     Lunch at Sheffield Insulations.     Attendance will be:

                         4 Trustees:   Derek Morris (Chairman) - Liverpool
                                       Michael Blankstone - Liverpool
                                       Michael Hammond - Nottingham
                                       Norman Adsetts - Sheffield

                                       Councillor Tony Damms, Lord Mayor,
                                       Shirley Lanstone, Chief Publicity Officer
                                       Neil Kay, Director of Social Services
                                       Brian Lock, Manager of Co-op Bank, West Street
                                       Don Ferguson, Appeal Office'in Liverpool

             2.30 pm     Trustees will make a private visit to Hillsborough, accompanied
                         by myself.

             3.30/3.45   Trustees will arrive in the Town Hall and meet some of the
                         staff in the Publicity Department who have been helping
                         with the A p pe a l . Tea and biscuits will be provided in the Lord Mayors
                         Parlour. The press are invited and there will be a photo
                         opportunity.

            I think it would be appropriate for you to join the Trustees when they
            meet the staff, at around 3.30/3.45.  If you would like to talk to
            them privately afterwards, perhaps you could meet in your office.

        Dear Mayor,

        I was so deeply distressed when I learned of th e Hillsborough
        tragedy that fateful Saturday.     It is especially sad when a
        disaster like this occurs with so many innocent people - som e
        in their prime - losing their lives so unnecessarily when a visit
        to watch a football match turned into such a tragedy leaving
        people injured and so many fam ilies bereaved.

        Please accept the enclosed cheque for £10,000, along with the
        heartfelt sympathy of my fellow Councillors and th e people of
        Renfrew D istrict.


        Yours most sincerely,




        Provost

      The Chairman of the Council has learned with dismay and sorrow of the
      recent disaster at the football stadium in your City and understands
      that with the Civic Leaders of the other authorities concerned you
      have set up a Disaster Appeal Fund.

      The Chairman, with the approval of the appropriate members of this
      Council, has instructed me to forward the enclosed cheque as a
      donation from the people of this District to your Fund.

     Yours sincerely,




      Chief Executive

            Cllr. Clive 3etts,
            L e a d e r,
            Sheffield City Coi-




            Dear Clive,

            I am getting concerned about the proposed visit by our Working Party to
            Sheffield which has been planned and is due to take place on Friday, As you
            are aware some members of the Working Party have been already but this was
            to be the first o f f i c i a l visit by th& Working Party, both to the Town Hall
            and to the ground.

            I can understand the pressures on you and your officers but it is important
            that the visit takes place as planned.   I suspect that you may be getting
            advice about potential legal minefields but can I give you iny assurance that
            no information obtained by the Working Party will be used for any improper
            purpose or contrary to the interests of your Authority without your consent.
            I can think of no other reason why the visit should not take place and I
            Ifould-b^ grateful if you could confirm it will go ahead.  I will try to ri
                 today to see whether there are any other areas to be considered.

                                                de-briefing.  As far as
O                                               Saturday's plan is concerned,

                                                but the Chief Constable would see
                                                no objection to this.

    8.    Can Members have copies?              It will be presented to the
                                                Inquiry; there is nothing to hide

              res MEETING WITH LIVERPOOL DELEGATION

              I write to confirm the discussion which took place today between
              myself, Councillors Skinner and Betts, regarding the above visit
              and the advice which I tendered.

              Basically,  both Leading Counsel and Junior Counsel instructed on
              behalf of the City at the Inquiry felt it was not appropriate to
              have a meeting of this sort at the present time, although there was
              nothing to prevent the City undertaking to pass on a copy of its
              statement to the Inquiry as soon as it is available, together with
              copies of other documents which it receives as part of the Inquiry
              workings which may be appropriate to Liverpool, subject of course
              to the not inconsiderable costs which this may engender.

              Accordingly, therefore, the arrangements for the meeting on Friday
              are now cancelled and I confirm that I will be contacting my opposite
              number at Liverpool (Mr Bill Murray) to discuss the situation with
              him and that in all probability I will inform him that the logistics
              are such that it is not appropriate, in light of everything else
              going on, to have the meeting at this stage from an officer viewpoint.

Hillsborough Disaster - Coroner's Inquest

From my experience w i t h the Kings Cross fire, I thought I m i g h t warn you
of problems w h ich can arise from Coroners' Inquests into deaths in a
disaster.

You may recall that the Coroner's Inquest into the sinking of the Herald
of Free Enterprise took place after the publication of the Report of the
Inquiry into the s i n k i n g . So the information from the Inquiry was
available at the Inquest. This was probably a contributory factor to
the jury's decision (against the advice of the Coroner) to find a
verdict of unlawful killing.         That v e r dict is still being considered by
the Director of Public Prosecutions.            As far as I a m aware, the
survivors and the .bereaved found the 'Herald' Inquest satisfactory.

This was not the case w i t h the Kings Cross Inquest.   At Kings Cross the
Inquest was held after the Fennell Inquiry had completed taking
evidence, but before the report was published.      Indeed, the press were
told that publication of the Fennell Report was being h e l d back so it
w o u l d not interfere with the Inquest.  The survivors a n d bereaved were
most upset by the Kings Cross Inquest.      Initially, London Transport
refused to pay the legal costs of relatives, but later relented.        The
Lord Chief Justice told the Coroner to rule that a verdict of unlawful
k illing was not acceptable because it could only be based on the acts of
an individual and not corporate negligence.      The Coroner's summing up
contained errors of fact and his decision to write to London Transport
that such a fire should never happen again was difficult to reconcile
w ith the verdict of 'accidental death'.     There was also confusion about
the identity of the bodies.      The relatives were very angry and upset -
one of them described the Inquest as "a farce about a tragedy"!
Clearly, what happened at Hillsborough was not on all fours with what
happened at Kincs Cross, but there are lessons to be learned.  It seems
to me that the Inquiry and the Inquest should at best -

     (a)   find out the facts;

     (b)   satisfy the relatives that things have been properly
           looked into;

     (c)   treat the w hole affair with dignity;

     (d)   help in the cathartic process of easing the minds of
           the relatives.

I personally don't think that these objectives can be achieved unless
the Inquiry and the publication of its Report precedes the substantive
part of the Inquest.  The initial Inquest hearing to cover iden t i f i c a ­
tion of the victims is rightly n o w going ahead, but the m a i n part should
follow publication of the Taylor Report.

I hope you find this note helpful.

Yours sincerely,

Dear M r . Turney

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND TRAGEDY

I am enclosing copies of letters which I have received
following the tragic events of 15th April.

I thought you may find them useful in considering
the aftermath and planning for the future.

I am also passing copies to Councillor Clive Betts,
Leader of Sheffield City Council.

Yours sincerely




DAVID BLUNKETT
MP FOR SHEFFIELD BRIGHTSIDE

 SOLICITORS represeating
 around 500 of the bereaved
 and injured from the Hillsbor­
 ough stadium disaster are to
 seek out of court damages
 from insurance com panies
 within two weeks of the start
 of evidence to th e public
 inquiry which begins in Shef*
 field today.
    A consortium of lawyers rep*
  resenting Liverpool fans have
  lodged claims against Sheffield
 Wednesday Football Club*
 South Yorkshire Police, tbe
  Football Association and Shef*
 field city council, which
 licensed the ground, after 95
 people died during the FA Cup
 sem i'fiaal with Nottingham
  Forest a month ago.
    Negotiations with insurance
 companies are not, however,
 expected to be com pleted
 within the six weeks set aside as
 the preliminary time scale for
 the inquiry into the tragedy.
    Lord Justice Taylor will bear
 evidence in Sheffield City Hall
 at 10.30 this morning.- It is
 expected that the first people,
 who will appear before him will
 be supporters who escaped the
 crush at the Leppings Lane end
 of the neutral ground.
    A group of more than 100
 firms of Liverpool solicitors
 banded together within 10 days
 of the disaster to co-ordinate
 legal action on behalf of those
 who lost relatives or who were
 themselves injured.
' Mr Douglas Fraser,amember
 of the consortium’s steering
 committee, announced yester­
 day that discussions over dam­
 ages would begin quickly in the
 hope that early out of court
 settlements could be readied.
    "We are urging solicitors not
 to issue proceedings at this
 stage, We are going to meet the
 insurers in a fortnight and say
 that we think payments ought to
 be made from a common fund/*
 he said.
    "Who bears what proportion;
 of that can be argued later. The
 alternative is to issue 95 writs
 and have 500-odd legal claims.
    “The inquiry is not being held
 to find liability, it is not a c ou rt,

 clear.              • ' v • ■ # ••

              Dear Clive,

              I have just been informed that Mr. R. M. Whalley is to be Secretary, to
              the Taylor Inquiry on the Hillsborough Disaster.

              Mr. Whalley has been seconded from his post of Assistant Secretary, F6 Emergency
              Planning Division (Civil Defence).

              He will obviously play a key part in the Inquiry drawing up witness lists,
              order of appearance and has a major say in the final drafting of the report.
                                         ■


              Given how close he has been to the emergency services in his normal post
             fit may be worth having a think through how objective he might be in terms
              of any analysis of the emergency services role historically and probably
              more importantly role in future.

              I have asked for Simon to make any relevant information available going
              into greater detail that is appropriate in this memorandum.

              If you have any further interest in following it up could you do so either
              directly with Simon or with myself.

              Yours fraternally;:

              HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - UPDATE

              With regard to the above matter I attach, for your information and
              attention, copies of various communications received from Mr Whalley
              at the Home Office on behalf of Lord Justice Taylor confirming first
              of all that the Home Office will meet the Council's costs in terms
              of the Inquiry and secondly      thanking staff for the arrangements so
              far made and finally thanking the Members for moving the Annual Council
              Meeting.

              In addition on a different     tack, I also enclose a copy of a note
              of the opening day of the     Inquiry prepared by Liz Bashforth which
              I believe gives a flavour of the events on that morning.

              In addition, I also enclose copies of correspondence passing between
              the Police, Sheffield Wednesday and South Yorkshire County Council
              regarding the semi-final incident in April 1981 which apparently
              resulted from large numbers of fans entering the ground at the last
              moment.

              Finally, I also enclose a copy of a letter from the Treasury Solicitors
              setting out what they suggest will be the main criticisms so far
              as this Authority is concerned, most if not all of which it is felt,
              at this moment in time, can be answered.    Obviously one of the first
              steps in response to the letter would be to go back to the Treasury
              Solicitors and ask them for details of the evidence they are using
              to base their criticisms upon.

              An outstanding issue is the matter of a formal report into the
              Committee Structure concerning Hillsborough and in this regard I
              have asked David Purchon to draft a factual document which I think-
              is the only report which is appropriate at this stage but there does
              then remain the issue of how the Authority is going to deal with
              the payment of overtime, etc, to staff who were involved in dealing
              with the aftermath of Hillsborough and I would welcome the opportunity
              of discussing this with you as my own opinion, expressed to the other
              members of the Hillsborough Working Group is that probably it would
              be better to deal with this administratively, if at all possible,
              rather than include it as part of such a document, although clearly
              the individuals concerned do need to be paid without delay.

Thank you for your fax of 4 May, received this morning, about
which I spoke to Mr Webster's secretary when I received it.   I
think’that your fax has crossed with mine of the same date, which
I hope gives you the answer you were seeking about the Home
Office meeting the costs of the Inquiry in principle.  The next
stage is, I think, for us to start to look at the details.  You
very reasonably make the point that you cannot enter into
commitments for not inconsiderable sums on the strength of verbal
assurances alone.  I hope that that position is now clarified.

In your letter of 4 May you also say that the members have agreed
to move the Annual General Meeting of the Council (scheduled for
17 May) from the Town Hall into other premises.  I mentioned this
to Lord Justice Taylor today.  He has asked me to express his
gratitude to the members for their generous understanding in this
respect.  He realises that this will involve disruption and
disappointment to some, but is glad that the momentum of the
Inquiry can be maintained in its first week.  I would therefore
be grateful if you could pass on to the members Lord Justice
Taylor's appreciation of their decision about the Annual General
Meeting.                                     \/

                                     HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR
               On 15th April there was an horrendous disaster at Hillsborough.
         95 people died, many were injured.   I have been appointed by the Home
         Secretary to conduct an Inquiry into the disaster.

               May I convey my deepest sympathy to the bereaved and injured and
         the same from the Inquiry Staff.

               The terms of reference of the Inquiry are to investigate the events
         at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on 15th April and make
         recommendations in relation to crowd control and safety of sports grounds

               I am solely responsible for the Inquiry, representation and
         recommendations.

               I am assisted by two assessors; Brian Johnson, Chief Constable of
         Leicestershire and Professor Maunder, a professor in Mechanical
         Engineering at Newcastle University.

               This is a preliminary hearing to set out the nature of the Inquiry,
         procedures and to hear applications from parties wishing to be
         represented.

               This is not a law suit where it is a case of winning or losing, it
         is not akin to a criminal trial.  No one is on trial.

               The Inquiry will look at:-

               (1)   What happened
               (2)   Why it happened
               (3)   The lessons to be learned and recommenations.

               If allegations are made I will consider them and if appropriate mak
         a finding.

               The object is to find the facts with all speed.  I do not want this
         constructive purpose spoilt by accusation and counter-accusation .

               Regarding the scope and length of the Inquiry, because the people
         involved as witnesses run into the 1,000's, West Midlands Police are
         carrying out the exercise of gathering evidence.  I welcome letters.  AH
         relevant evidence should be available but I want the Inquiry to be quick
         and thorough.

               I want to keep oral evidence within bounds.  I will not allow oral
         evidence which does not add to that already given but written statements
         will be considered.

               The Inquiry will have three Counsels, Andrew Collins Q . C . , Alan •
         Goldsack and Bernard Phillips.  All witnesses who give oral evidence are
         called on my behalf.

               That witness may also be called by their advisors.




HB3AAB/PGT/1
      Before any witness is called they have to have first given a written
statement.  The witness may be cross-examined but I will limit
cross-examinations as I think fit.

      If an allegation is made against a body or an individual, that body
or individual must be informed and can call evidence in answer to the
allegation.

      The oral hearing will commence on the 15th Mayat 10.30 a.m., and
will   concentrate on the events of the     15th April   andwhy it happened.The
Inquiry will be public.

      The second   part of the Inquiry - relating to the future- I will give
directions later   on how this will beconducted.

      I would like to receive written submissions on recommendations for
crowd control and safety at sports grounds as soon as possible.

      The press- will be given proper assistance and save in exceptional
circumstances copies of statements made by a witness will be available to
the press shortly before that winess is called.

      There will be no photography or filming or sound recording during
the Inquiry.  I can and will enforce that rule.

      I request the press not to interview any witness before they have
completed their evidence to the Inquiry. I believe that will only impede
a difficult task.

      I expect parties to be represented by lawyers. Any person or body
wishing to be represented must show good cause.  They must have a direct
interest and it must be fair to be represented.

      If there are several parties covered by the same interest they
should join together.

      Any decision today on representation is not final.

      If a party does not wish to be represented they can offer to make
evidence available through a statement as soon as possible.

      In relation to costs, there are no statutory provisions.  The
Secretary of State is able to meet costs and I make recommendations to the
Secretary of State.

      I will consider that at the end.   Costs would be on a common fund
basis.

      I intend to make recommendations to pay the reasonable costs of
anyone who ought to be represented who may not know if they can afford it.
Certainly the families of the injured and deceased.

      I will be sympathetic to football supporters, in particular
Liverpool supporters.  I will be recommending that Liverpool supporters
costs are paid.

                                           Counsel very busy.   I represent so many interests

                        Lord Justice Taylor - I don't see any difficulty.  If for good
                        reason, separate representation is needed, I will consider it, but
                        it will have to be quite extraordinary.

                        Costs - I will probably recommend are paid by the Secretary of
                        State.

               N.B. If anyone wastes the time of the Inquiry I will consider the matter

                                       (1) unlike most disasters - particularly affects
                                       Merseyside.  Local Authorities can justifiably
                                       represent the wider people.

                                       (2) Authorities believe by granting
                                       representation can demonstrate awareness of need
                                       for fairness, openness and thoroughness.

                                       Degree of sensitivity and suspician of
                                       communities represented.

                    Lord Justice Taylor - country aware of loss/grief Liverpool.   For
                    the Inquirty representation to contribute to what happened and why.
                    Can't see what representation will add.   Want views of football
                    supporters.   Don't think need representations from the local
                    authorities to impress on me or the public the need for impartiality
                    and openness.   I reject the application - not through a lack of
                    sensitivity but from a sensitivity of the need to get on quickly. 'I
                    respect your reason but am not persuaded.

                                       reserving our position.

                  Dear Sir,
)
                  SEMI-FINAL - 11TH APRIL 1981                   "
                                              t-j   ..•   ..............

                  On the occasion of the above match, there was an incident
                  at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, in the standing
                  enclosure, which resulted in injuries to spectators
                  because of crushing.

                  From our enquiries it appears the.crushing was caused
                  through Tottenham supporters arriving late, due to
                  problems on the Motorway, and rushing to their places
                  after the game had commenced, thereby causing problems
                  to spectators at the front of the terracing who had
                  been in the ground a considerable length of time.

                 According to our turnstile readings there were 335 in
                 excess of the stipulated capacity for that particular
                 area; this was the result of Tottenham fans having
                 purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival
                 at Turnstile »N’, Penistone Road, which was the
                 Wolverhampton standing area, were directed by the
                 police to the other end of the ground where the
                 Tottenham fans were standing.

                 I give below details of injuries reported to me:-
                       30 spectators treated by St. John*s Ambulance
                                    Brigade for minor ailments, etc.
                       Treated at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital:—
                                   I                1                      Age 30 years
                                                                               ^

                                   Foot injury - two stitches.



                                                                                          cont.

                              with stomach upset.

As the hospital refuse to co-operate with names, addresses,
1 can only tell you that according to the police, i n j u n
received w e r e :—
                    2 - Broken axms
                      1 - Broken leg
                      1 - Head graze
                      1 - Not known

The overall report of crowd behaviour, both inside and
outside the stadium, was very good indeed..

              Copy to Chief Executive
              Dear Sir

              FA CUP SEMI-FINAL                                 -         11 APRIL 1981

 m            I would refer to the FA. Cup Semi-Final match between Wolverhampton
              Wanderers Football Cluband Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, held at
              Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
              Saturday 11 April 1981.

             As you will no doubt be aware many similar Semi-Final matches have been
             held at this ground without previous problems. The stadium is issued with
             a certificate under the provisions of the Safety in Sports Grounds Act 1975.
             This limits the total capacity of the ground to 50,174. The area of the
             Leppings Lane enclosure has a capacity of 10,100.

             Prior to the match itself, difficulties were envisaged because both sets
             of supporters were obliged to use the Ml Motorway. This problem was added
             to when a major road accident occurred on the Ml near to its junction with
             the A38. The problem was exacerbated by a coach breaking down further along
             the motorway, and by extensive road works. This set of circumstances
             caused a large number of spectators, predominantly Tottenham Hotspur fans,
             to be held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes. As you will appreciate
 • )         traffic jams built up and resulted in a sudden influx of large numbers of
             football supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the
             start of the match when a fairly steady build up of support throughout the
             afternoon could have been anticipated.

t.
I-
             I now wish to outline an aspect of the problem which could have been avoided
             and which should be anticipated for future similar occasions.

              Cn the day before the Wolverhampton ticket allocation was put on sale to
              the public, Tottenham Hotspur played Coventry City Football Club at Coventry
;            in a league match. Many Tottenham Hotspur supporters stayed overnight in
;            Coventry and travelled the short distance to Wolverhampton to obtain tickets
,            which were at a premium in London. Others also made the journey from London
]            to Wolverhampton on the Sunday. This completely defeated the spectator
•            policy which is put into effect at these matches and which places the largest
j            groups of standing supporters at opposite ends of the ground. Neither of



i
    -the two participating Semi-Final clubs saw fit to inform the South
    Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club or the Football
    Association about this situation and in that event the mixing of supporters
    was not oroperly catered for. The result of this was that some 400
    Tottenham fans had to be removed from the Spion Xop, in the interests
    of general safety and public order, and were accommodated in the Leppings
    Lane end of the ground,-, which had been designated for use by Spurs
    supporters.

    The capacity at the Leppings Lane end is 10,100 and this obviously contains
    a safety factor. At a previous match some 400 holders of forged tickets
    gained entry into this part of the ground and were absorbed without any
    aDparent difficulty. However, on this date turnstile readings showed
    that 10,435 people were admitted to this part of the ground.

    A policy of packing spectators occurs at most football grounds where
    large crowds are in attendance so that all the available space is utilised.
    On this occasion the Tottenham Hotspur fans, who had arrived early in the
    day and taken up advantageous viewing points, refused to move into the
    centre of this enclosure,’
                             -thereby creating a jamming effect at the
    extremeties of it. The late arrivals caused an immediate problem upon
    gaining access to the Leppings Lane area because of rushing forward
    immediately upon entering after Tottenham Hotspur had scored a goal soon
    after kick off. This resulted in a number of crushing injuries on this
    terrace including broken arms, legs and crushed ribs. In all, some 38
    fans received treatment either at hospital or from the St John.Ambulance
    representatives present at the game.

    As a result or tins tne sarety gates at uhe zront oz tris j-iepcings
    enclosure were opened and spectators at the front were allowed to go
    onto the playing area perimeter track to relieve the pressure within the
    terrace. Due to the problems being created by crushing, my officers also
    refused access to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to
    get in. In my view no other course of action could have been adopted in
    the interest of public safety.

>   During the half time interval my officers attempted to move the spectators
    who were standing or seated within the tracks around onto the normal
    spectator areas. During this manoeuvre some rather foolish youngsters
    did run onto the pitch but the situation was quickly brought under control
    by officers within the ground.

    In conclusion I would add that there were no other incidents either
    inside or outside the ground other than those caused by the circumstances
    I have described. The circumstances I have outlined have been discussed
    at length and will be borne in mind in the planning of future similar
    events. Discussions are to take place with my officers and officials
    of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding suggestions for obviating
    the problems caused within the Leppings Lane terrace on this occasion.

    Yours faithfully

    HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL


    You will recall th a t a t the pre-inquiry meeting on 28th April Lord Justice Taylor

    informed of it and the substance of the evidence supporting it

You will appreciate th at the task of assembling the evidence for the Inquiry is a
formidable one and statem ents are still being taken. However, it seemed right to let
you have what must be a preliminary indication of criticisms which may be levelled at
the City Council, as the local authority responsible for the safety certificates under
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, as soon as possible before the commencement
of the Inquiry.

The following are the main criticisms which so far appear from the evidence available:-

    1.    The pens on the terraces at the Leppings Lane end of the ground constituted a
          potential danger If ciowtlcJ. The med-iis ol egress onto tne pitcn were
          inadequate and you should have insisted that there were more gates, th at they
          were properly signed, th at there were means of access laterally between the
          pens, again properly marked, and th at all gangways were properly marked.

2.        The directional signs were inadequate, so that those entering were necessarily
          channelled to the tunnel leading to the central two pens.

3.        The crush barriers within the pens were not properly positioned and one a t least
          was of insufficient strength.

          The tunnel giving access to the terrace was not of a constant gradient but
          sloped steeply a t the terrace end: this was potentially hazardous if a large
          crowd cam e down the tunnel.

                                                                1.

    5.    The wall a t the turnstiles was not adequate to prevent persons climbing into the
          ground.

    6.    Access by ambulances or fire engines to the playing area and the surround was
          not adequately provided for. Furthermore, the provision of first-aid equipment
          was insufficient.

    Should any further matters deserving of criticism come to our attention, we will of
    course let you know of them.

                                     Hillsborough Investigation

             Liverpool City Council have requested a further presentation on this
             matter for the benefit of their Leader, Keva Coombes, and the Working
             Party they have set up. David Purchon has suggested that Friday, 19th May
             would be suitable from his point of view and we would expect to start
             around 11.00 a.m. (more precise details later) I would be glad if you or a
             representative could be in attendance.

             Although we have met some Liverpool Councillors once, immediately after
             the disaster, the City Council now wish to take a more considered and
             detailed look at what happened and my understanding is that there is
             nothing to stop us giving them a presentation of what we know, although at
             the present time I have jaatie it clear that no documents or the video can
             be handed over to t£*efn. Please confirm whether you can attend with my

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER/INVOLVEMENT OF F. & C.S. STAFF/PROPOSALS FOR FUTURE
ACTION


1. INVOLVEMENT OF F. & C.S. STAFF

     In the afternoon and evening of Saturday, 15th April and on Sunday, 16th
     April over 150 F. & C.S. staff were active in giving support and
     assistance to victims and relatives of the Hillsborough Disaster.

     Help given during this period included:-

     - Counselling relatives and friends of bereaved and injured people.

     - Assisting Police in organising reception and support of relatives
       coming to Sheffield to identify people in hospital or who had died.

     - provision of transport and food in support of the above.


     Since the weekend of the-disaster there has also been substantial ongoing
     involvements-

             Support and counselling to people in Sheffield who have been severely
             shocked by their experience of the disaster, including people who were
             close witnesses of the events or involved in helping.

     -       Support and counselling to people from Merseyside and other Local
             Authorities coming to Sheffield to visit relatives or friends in
             hospital or visit the football ground again.

     - _Follow up work and liaison with other Local Authorities over continued
        help to people who had been in Sheffield and who had been helped by or
        in contact with Sheffield F. & C.S.

    This ongoing staff work has been co-ordinated by a task team set up and
    based in the Hillsborough F. & C.S. Divisional Office. A review of the
    Department’s contribution to emergency services in major disasters has
    also been initiated and reports consequent on this review will be
    presented in due course.

2. PROPOSALS FOR FUTURE ACTION

    From their experience over the past three weeks it is the recommendation
    of the temporary task team that a task team needs to operate for a longer
    period; some months, and if necessary up to a year_

    This recommendation takes account of the advice we have received from the
    Kent Staff involved in the Zeebrugge Ferry disaster and Bradford Staff
    involved in Bradford City Football Club fire.
The prime focus of such a team would be ongoing work with people from
Sheffield. There is a secondary focus of work, which is to support
Liverpool Social Services Department in anyway possible in their work
with bereaved families, or families of those injured (physically or
emotionally). The only possible exceptions to this would be families
from outside Liverpool whose choice it was to work directly with
Sheffield.

We know that there will be key times in the future when support to
Liverpool Social Services Department will be more intense:- e.g. when the
enquiry findings are made public; at the Coroner’s Inquest or on
Anniversaries. To some extent this work can be planned for in advance
because dates will be known.

All such work is as a support to Liverpool and secondary to the primary
focus.

The Task Team are of the opinion that the primary focus needs to
concentrate on Sheffield residents. There are considerable numbers
involved:-

«*   Sheffield Wednesday F. C. Staff - 600

-    Sheffield Wednesday supporters at the game - 1000

-    Local Residents who offered help;     cannot be estimated at   this moment.

-    Red Cross staff - not known as yet.

     St. John’s Ambulance Staff - 3 5 + 2 ambulances.

-    South Yorkshire Police - 1111 (257 inside the ground) and unspecified
     number of special constables.

-    Staff from F. & C.S. and other helping professions,including clergy
     estimated conservatively at 300 plus environmental health/mortuary
     staff.
     (Some of these'agencies will probably prefer to provide counselling
      within their own organisations)

The impact on such numbers, because of the sudden violent way in which it
happened, will have an effect on the Mental Health of the Community.

The Task Team believed that the on-going work following the disaster
should beseen in Mental Health Prevention terms. If this does not
happen it   seems certain that some of the people in the groups above will
go into crisis at some future date. We are informed that research shows
that some people can become chronic depressives if not helped in a
pro-active way.

One of the impressive features since the disaster is the amount of work
being done by Voluntary Organisations, the Churches, Area Health Staff,
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the Local Authority. There is so
much being done that one of the problems is co-ordinating, because
sometimes   it is being done by individual organisations or sometimes in
pairs.
         The temporary Task Teaift are convinced that there is a need to consider
         the setting up of a longer term Task Team initially for six months, to be
         extended as required if proved to be necessary, to establish a Mental
         Health Prevention Service to Sheffield residents affected by the
         Hillsborough Disaster, and to act as a support service to Liverpool
         Social services Department and other Local Authority Social Services
         Departments affected by the events at Hillsborough on the 15th April 1989

         However the Temporary Task Team would want to ensure the ongoing
         commitment of Voluntary Organisations, the Churches, Area Health and
         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

         The following is therefore proposed:-

         1.   The setting up of a Steering/Advisory Group with representatives of
              Voluntary Organisations; the Churches; A.H.A; Sheffield Wednesday
              Football Club; The Local Authority and the South Yorkshire Police if
              they wish to participate.

              This Group’s remit would be:-

              "To advise the Manager and Task Team Leader about important issues in
              order to co-ordinate the range of services needed*.


         2.   The setting up of a permanent Task Team for one initial period of six
              months comprising of:-

              1 Team Leader (preferably with Mental Health
              Training) POld/e                                      £17,267)
                                                                           )
              3 - Level 3 Social Workers equivalent but able to                 )
              offer group work and community work skills            £45,349).
                                                                            )
              1 Admin Officer scale 6                               £12,852)
                                                                            )
              3 Clerks Scale 2/3                                    £27,000)
                                                                            )
              Printing, stationery, postages and telephones          £5,000)
                                                                            )
              Computer costs                                         £3,000)

                                        TOTAL including on-costs    £110.468 full
                                                                             year
                                                                             costs

                                               six months costs      £55.234



         It is also proposed that- the District Health Authority should be asked to
         second a psychologist to work with the team. Where possible existing
         staff would be seconded to these posts and replaced by temporary
         appointments

         A further sum of money needs to be identified for running costs and some
         initial training in Stress De-briefing Techniques.




RPTABP
          A review of the work, remit and composition of the Task Team should be
         conducted at quarterly intervals so that the Staffing levels and suppport
         costs can be adjusted as necessary.




         3.   This team should be based in Hillsborough (possibly at the Library in
              the rooms currently occupied by Helpline) and accountable to the
              Divisional Officer, Division 2, through to Assistant Director
              (Operations).



         RECOMMENDATION

         That approval in principle is given to establish a task team and that
         the Director of Social Services be asked to bring forward detailed
         proposals at the earliest opportunity and to initiate discussions with
         the City Treasurer to advise on appropriate means of financing these
         proposals.

Following the tragedy at Hillsborough Football Ground in which 95 people
were killed and many more were injured there was an urgent need for
Council Departments to work in a concerted effort to assist those who
had been involved.  To this end this Department approached Family and
Community Services with the offer of running a telephone service as a
way of coping with the many demands being put upon it for information
related to the tragedy.  Family and Community Services accepted this
offer, and this Department's Information Projects Co-ordinator was
requested to bring it into operation as soon as possible.  This report
provides a brief review of this service after two weeks of operation.

On Tuesday, 18th April - three days after the tragedy - a meeting took
place between officers from the F & CS Divisional Office and from
Libraries Department.  This decided what form the telephone information
line should take and it drew up a list of key telephone contact numbers
between the two Departments.  It was agreed that the service would be
based at Hillsborough Library and that it would be called the
"Hillsborough Helpline".

Publicity for the Helpline was of paramount importance so this
Department circulated a news release to the two local radio stations,
"The Star" and other newspapers, and the two regional television
services.  Posters and leaflets were produced and sited in shops in the
Hillsborough area and throughout the Libraries service.  Besides the
initial publicity "The Star" agreed to carry a daily free advert
inviting readers to call the Helpline.

For the first three days the Helpline was in operation it was extremely
busy.  Requests for help fell into the following categories:

(a) People wanting to find out if relatives or friends had been involved
    in the tragedy;

(b) Survivors wanting to re-establish contact with people who had helped
    them in the aftermath of the tragedy;

(c) Requests for counselling services from people who had.suffered
    trauma from the event;

(d) Enquiries from bereaved relatives in relation to the Disaster Fund;

(e) Many calls from all over the country asking about methods of making
    payments into the Disaster Fund;

(f) Many offers of assistance - people offering free transport between
    Sheffield and Liverpool for survivors and bereaved families, offers
    of accommodation.

The Helpline was staf-fed by volunteer helpers who usually staff the
Department's annual Winter Hotline and by staff at Hillsborough Library.

To ensure that as much information as possible was provided to callers
close liaison between this Department and other agencies was maintained.
The co-ordinator attended the daily F & CS Task Team meetings which
     consisted of Hillsborough F & S staff, hospital social workers and a
     representative of South Yorkshire Police.  The co-ordinator also met
     with voluntary agencies in the city which were providing counselling
     services for those who had been deeply affected by the tragedy.

6.   After two weeks of operation the Helpline is now much quieter, dealing
     mainly with requests for information concerning donations to the
     Disaster Fund.  The Helpline will be kept open for the next couple of
     weeks, and the decision to close it down will be made in consultation
     with F & CS and with relevant voluntary groups.

Conclusions

The experience described above demonstrates that the City Council does have
the ability to set up and operate a Helpline Service very quickly and
effectively.  With foresight the "Helpline" could have been operating from
the evening of the tragedy.  This suggests that arrangements for setting up
an emergency Helpline should be specifically written in to the Planning for
Peacetime Emergencies.

Recommendations

1.   To note the arrangements made by Sheffield Libraries and Information
     Services to operate the Hillsborough Helpline.

2.   To investigate the potential for developing arrangements for
     establishing a "Helpline" as part of the Plan for Peacetime Emergencies.

                re: JUDICIAL INQUIRY - FRIDAY 28 APRIL and MONDAY 15 MAY

                I thought it important that I write and pass on the compliments
                received, primarily from the Treasury Solicitor but also from others
                involved in the initial day of the Inquiry the 28th April, regarding
                the    administrative arrangements made for that day as can be seen
                from the attached copy letter from Mr Whalley of the Home Office.

                In particular, I would like to express my thanks to all those who
                worked so hard to ensure that the arrangements went off smoothly
                and efficiently and to thank them for their initial effort and their
                continued help in the future.

                Clearly, in a communication of this sort, it is perhaps wrong to
                single out individuals in view of the team effort that went on but
                nevertheless I feel that the work of the Administration Group and
                the Building Survey Group in the Estates Division of Land and Planning
                deserve attention, as do the efforts of the Licensing Section within
                the    Administration and Legal Department, Mr Creasey of the same
                Department, Ms Sainty and Tony Flannagan of Cleansing and of course
                the efforts of Pat O'Neill and Hazel Smith in terms of overall co­
                ordination and liaison.

                Whilst quite obviously we would all have hoped that the arrangements
                would have been required for a happier purpose, I nevertheless repeat
                my thanks and appreciation and those of the Leader for the efforts
                put in so far and in the future.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUIRY


I write in confirmation of our telephone conversation on 19 April
and my visit to Sheffield on 20 April to discuss with your staff
arrangements for the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry.

Lord Justice Taylor is extremely grateful to the City Council for
making the facilities of the Town Hall available to him for his
Inquiry, and has asked me to write to you to express his
gratitude.  He was particularly grateful for all the excellent
arrangements made for the preliminary hearing on 28 April.

May I add my personal thanks for the assistance of Mr Pat
O'Neill, Mrs Hazel Smith and their colleagues, who have been
quite outstanding in the help and support they have already given
to me and my staff.

       AP        15 Apr 89 FA Cup semi-final turns to disaster as 93 soccer fans are
                           crushed to death at Sheffield's Hillsborough stadium (738)


       SHEFFIELD, England

In the bright sunshine of early spring, the cheers of English soccer fans
turned to screams and then shock as a surging crowd crushed dozens to death
in the stands Saturday.

Some were taken away on advertising billboards used as makeshift stretchers.
Others lay motionless on the field as emergency medical teams tried
desperately to save their lives as the English FA Cup semifinal turned into
Britain's worst sporting disaster.

Peter Wright, chief constable of the South Yorkshire Police said 93 people
were killed and at least 200 injured.

One fan who survived sat in a corner of the stadium, numbed with shock, head
in hands.

All around him, police gathered up clothing and belongings as ambulances
sped across the green turf picking up bodies and ferrying the dead and
injured to hospitals.

One doctor told of 'sheer mayhem' when he ran to help the dying at
Hillsborough stadium, Sheffield.

'There was one chap I went to who was clinically dead,' Dr. Glyn Phillips
said. 'He had no heartbeat.'

Phillips said he managed to resuscitate the fan but added: 'I don't know
what the state of his cerebral function is going to be.'

The disaster occurred six minutes into the semifinal between Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest when hundreds of Liverpool fans who had no tickets surged
through an open turnstile gate behind one of the goals to swell an already
crowded section of the ground, soccer officials said.

Scores of fans were crushed or suffocated and within minutes, a crush
barrier collapsed under the sheer weight of the crowd, sending hundreds of
fans tumbling onto the concrete terracing and pouring on to the field.

The referee quickly took the players to the dressing rooms and 90 minutes

 later, the game was abandoned.

For a while, there was sporadic fighting between rival sets of fans, news
reports said. Then, as the extent of the injuries became clear, the fighting
stopped as officials and fans realized that what had happened had nothing to
do with crowd violence, they said.

Supporters who survived accused game officials for allowing the unauthorized
spectators into the stadium.

'It was ridiculous. They just opened the gates and waved them in,' said one
Liverpool fan who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'I have two friends but I
don't know what's happened to them. I was crushed up to one of the railings
and got cuts to my arm but I was lucky to get out alive.'

Another fan, 20-year-old Gary Stanley, said crowd control outside the ground
was 'crazy.'

'There was complete madness and somehow the doors were opened,' he said.
'There were too.many people in the section and I saw some people crushed
against barriers. The arrangements were dreadful and I've still got a full
ticket. I didn't even have to show it to get in.'

As police cleared the ground, fans wandered around aimlessly, their
red-and-white scarves draped around their necks. Huge sections of the
toughened steel barrier had been ripped away. Another part was bent out of
shape like a pipe cleaner.

'Anybody whose chest was against that barrier would have been lucky to
survive,' said Dr. Bill Eastwood, consultant safety engineer for the
Sheffield Wednesday club, which regularly plays at Hillsborough.

' It was a steel tube bent like a banana and assuming the person was 18
inches wide, there would have been 600 pounds of pressure on his chest.'

Roger Taylor, chairman of Britain's Football Association, said fans without
tickets were allowed to approach turnstiles freely.

'When that happens at matches like this where demand for tickets far exceeds
supply, you're going to get a severe crushing at the turnstiles. That
appears to have happened but no gates were broken down. They were opened.
But I don't know what took that decision.'

As a full investigation was launched into one of Europe's worst sporting
tragedies, one of Britain's top soccer bosses summed up the feelings of a

       By ANDREW WARSHAW

       LONDON

The crush that killed 93 people at Hillsborough stadium Saturday was
Britain's worst sports disaster and the latest in a catalogue of calamities
that have hit the world's most popular spectator sport.

The biggest loss of life at a soccer game took place May 24, 1964, when
rioting left nearly 300 dead and 500 injured after Argentina beat Peru on a
last-minute goal in Lima.

Just over a year ago, on March 12, 1988, at least 93 people died when fans
fleeing a violent hailstorm stampeded into locked stadium exits in Katmandu,
Nepal. More than 100 others were injured.

In 1969, soccer even caused a military conflict when El Salvador and
Honduras suffered thousands of casualties in the so-called 'Soccer War,'
which began after a disputed soccer game between the two nations.

The worst single-incident sports disaster anywhere in the world in recent
history occurred when an estimated 604 people were killed after stands at
the Hong Kong Jockey Club racecourse collapsed and caught fire in February
1918.

But soccer, the sport watched by millions of spectators from Scandinavia to
South America, has born the brunt of most sports disasters.

On March 10, 1987, as many as 20 people were killed when panicky soccer fans
in Tripoli, Libya, fled knife-wielding ruffians and triggered the collapse
of a w a 11.

Before Saturday's shocking scenes at Sheffield, Britain's worst sports
disaster was at Ibrox stadium in Glasgow in Jan. 2, 1971 when 66 fans died
and 170 were injured after crush barriers collapsed.

Fire caused another disaster in May 11, 1985, when 53 people were killed at
Bradford. On the day the Bradford City celebrated its promotion to the
English second division, the main stand's rickety wooden terracing caught
fire and was engulfed in flames, ignited by a cigarette stub.

That was the worst year in the history of soccer's tarnished image. Eighteen
days later, on May 29, 1985, 39 people, most of them Italians, were killed
in a stampede by Liverpool fans at the European Champions Cup final at the
Heysel stadium in Brussels.

As a result, English soccer clubs were banned indefinitely by UEFA (Union of
European Football Associations), Europe's governing body. Last week, UEFA
announced it would lift the ban for the 1990-91 season, pending a review
next Apr i1.

Saturday's disaster again involved Liverpool backers. This time, crowd riots
did not appear to be an element.

                           Hillsborough stadium crush 93 soccer fans to death at FA
                           Cup semi-final (1013)


       By ROBERT BARR

       SHEFFIELD, England

 Crowds surging against a steel anti-riot fence in a packed soccer stadium
 crushed 93 fans to death and injured at least 200 Saturday in Britain's
 worst sports disaster, police said.

 Most of the dead were teen-agers and children, ambulance control officer
 Michael Boyce said.

 'It seemed as if it was four deep in dead bodies with                                                                    people climbing over
 them,' said a survivor, 22-year-old Stuart McGeagh.

  Records showed the death toll was the second-highest ever among crowds
  watching soccer, the world's favorite spectator sport and one that often
. sparks fatal actions among its followers.

 The disaster, on a sunny spring day, also added to the deadly image that has
 attached, itself in recent years to soccer in Britain, which invented the
 modern game more than a century ago.

 The disaster happened at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, 150 miles (240
 kms) north of London, in the opening minutes of the English FA Cup semifinal
 between leading English league teams Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

 With the 54,000-capacity stadium already near full, police opened the gate
 to admit some 4,000 last-minute arrivals, fearing that otherwise there would
 be trouble outside, South Yorkshire Chief Constable Peter Wright said.

 Inside the stadium, five minutes after kickoff, a massive surge of people
 pushed hundreds of spectators against a steel mesh anti-riot fence that soon
 col lapsed.

 'The purpose of opening the gate,' Wright said, 'was to save people's lives
 and to relieve the crush outside.' He said he was not aware of any
 connection between the gates opening and the surge inside.

 Police and soccer authorities immediately announced investigations into the

cause of the disaster.

Wright said he believed the tickets of the last-minute arrivals were
checked, but fans said they weren't.

'It was crazy outside the ground before the kickoff,' said Gary Stanley, a
computer operator. 'There was complete madness. .. I've still got a full
ticket. I didn't even have time to show it to get into the ground.'

A gateman who requested anonymity was quoted by Press Association, the
British news agency, as saying he saw the police open the stadium gate.

'It was a free-for-all. There were thousands coming in. I said to the police
'What are you doing that for?' and a policeman said 'Someone is going to die
if we don't' the gateman said. 'It's my opinion that opening those gates
caused the tragedy.'

The 10-foot-high (3m) fence has metal curved spikes facing the standing-room
section to prevent people climbing over, and a stadium official said those
who were pressed against it would have been lucky to survive.

For about 30 minutes, pressure had been mounting as people poured into the
section reserved for Liverpool fans.

The barrier behind the goalposts collapsed minutes after the 3 pm (1400GMT)
kickoff and more spectators were trampled as the throng burst onto the
field.


Many sprawled on the grass gasping for air. Police and first aid workers
pounded on the chests of suspected heart attack victims and gave
mouth-to-mouth respiration. Weeping parents and children hunted for each
other amid the carnage.

A policeman ran onto the field and asked the referee to halt the game. Play
stopped at 3.06 pm (1406GMT) and hours later soccer officials said the match
would be postponed until an unsepcified date.

BBC-TV carried the scenes of pandemonium nationwide, breaking into regular
programming, The match, begun under bright skies before a good-natured
capacity crowd of 54,000, was transformed into a bizarre spectacle as an
ambulance threaded its way through the crowd, siren wailing, and police
raced to form a cordon and prevent rival fans clashing.

However, there was none of the hooliganism that has bedeviled English soccer
in recent years.

'People were just crushing in. There was a lad and his girlfriend and they
were just screaming. His words were 'please God, help me,' and I believe the
girl died. Her face was just blue,' an unidentified fan told Yorkshire
Televi s ion.

'There was a gentleman on my arm and he said, 'You're choking me, you're
choking me,' and he just fell, and that was the last of him,' said another
youth, close to tears.

Witness McGeagh said: 'Everything seemed to be all right until about two
minutes before the kickoff, when there was a big crush foward.

'I was at the front and stuck up against the fence. There were railings down
either side. It was like being in a cage.

'I thought I was going to die. I was getting short of breath, I couldn't
breathe. The weight on me was tremendous.'

Some spectators escaped by climbing up to an overhead balcony. Others risked
impaling themselves as they scrambled over the spiked fence.

Fans and rescue workers ripped up advertising boards and used them as
makeshift stretchers.

Some of the first-aid attendants were 12-year-old volunteers who themselves
needed treatment for shock.

Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressed their
sh o c k .

The 93 dead equaled the death toll in March last year in Katmandu, Nepal,
when soccer fans stampeded trying to escape a violent hailstorm.

The worst loss of life at a soccer match happened in May 1964 when rioting
at an Argentina-Peru match in Lima left nearly 300 dead.

Fours years ago, 56 people died when fire swept a grandstand at a soccer
field in Bradford, England. That tragedy came just 18 days before 39 people,
most of them Italians, were crushed to death in fighting between supporters
of Liverpool and Juventus of Turin, Italy, at the European Champions Cup
final in Brussels, Belgium.

The previous high death toll at a British sports event was 66 people killed
in a crush of fans at a soccer match between Glasgow rivals Rangers and

       AP        16 Apr 89 Major investigation begins into why 94 people were crushed
                           to death in Britain's worst football disaster (1476)


       By ROBERT BARR

       SHEFFIELD, England

A major investigation began Sunday to determine why 94 soccer fans were
crushed to death in Britain's worst sports disaster, and lawmakers called
for a ban on the anti-riot fences that kept the crowds from escaping.

Police in Sheffield, conceding that decisions by officers on the scene will
be closely scrutinized in any inquiry, handed over the investigation to the
neighboring West Midlands police force.

In Liverpool, home of the team whose fans were killed, people of     all
denominations gathered at the   Roman Catholic cathedral for a requiem Mass,
and thousands overflowed into the surrounding grounds.

At the team's home ground, thousands of fans walked hand in hand around the
playing field to lay hundreds of wreaths and red and white team scarves on
the terrace standing areas as a Salvation Army band played.

More scarves were tied all along the iron entrance gate, along with blue and
white scarves of the local rival Everton team, and bunches of flowers
covered the pavement below.

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Hillsborough stadium, where a sunny
Saturday afternoon soccer cup   semi-final turned into a nightmare  of crushed
bodies and fans climbing over them gasping for air.

Then, obviously shocked, she listened to the horror stories of some of the
injured survivors who escaped including John Davis, 33, a machine operator
who got pinned in a crush near the fence when the boy in front of him fell.

'We were shouting out to (the police) to get us out and they just couldn't
move us,' he told the prime minister. 'It was just sheer bedlam. It was
every man for himself. There were people screaming and screaming.'

Announcing a public inquiry into the disaster, Mrs. Thatcher pledged:
'Whatever decisions we have to take will be taken, because we cannot go
through this a g a i n . 1

The disaster was the third major soccer tragedy in four years involving
English teams, which have been barred from European competition since May
1985 because of rioting by Liverpool fans.

'We have been trying to do our level best to stop the hooliganism,' Mrs.
Thatcher said, 'and I think we will have to look at the future of terraces.'

It was on one of Hillsborough stadium's terraces - the cheap
standing-room-only areas favored by many young British soccer fans - that 93
people died in a crush of late-arriving Liverpool supporters.

South Yorkshire Police Supt. Tony Pratt late Sunday revised the casualty
toll to 94 dead and 170 injured. Seventy-one people were still hospitalized
including 17 in intensive care, many in extremely critical condition.
Hospital officials said it was too soon to say whether they would suffer
serious brain damage if they survive.

Pratt said police had identified 89 of the 94 dead and he released a list of
the first 24 to be named, all Britons, ranging in age from 10 to 62.

Prayers     for the victims - many of them children and teen-agers - were said
in many     churches. Outside the stadium, people came to lay flowers and team
scarves     in memory of the dead, and some left weeping. One bouquet said:
'Soccer     lovers of the world unite. Live in peace.'

Government inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive were examining
the fences and crush barriers at the Sheffield stadium, which on Saturday
trapped the fans and kept them from reaching the green playing field.

After touring the terraces and looking at the barriers, a solemn Mrs.
Thatcher said: 'It is a disaster of immense proportions, coming on top of
previous disasters, coming on the top of many precautions which have already
been taken which clearly were not enough.'

Roy Hattersley, deputy leader of the Labor Party, predicted on British
Broadcasting Corp. television that the disaster would mark the end of
perimeter fencing at Britain's soccer grounds.

'We have talked far too much about soccer hooliganism this year when we
ought to be talking about safety and improving the grounds,' he said.
'Perimeter fencing has been the product of an obsession with hooliganism as
distinct from concern with safety.'

Police refused to elaborate on why 16-foot-wide (4.8-metei— wide) steel gates
were opened just as the match between leading English league teams Liverpool

and Nottingham Forest began the English Football Association Cup semi-final,
allowing hundreds, and perhaps thousands of last-minute arrivals into the
stad ium.

South Yorkshire's chief constable Peter Wright, who earlier Sunday had taken
personal command of the disaster investigation, said Saturday night that a
senior officer had made the decision to open the gates 'to save people's
lives and to relieve the crush o u t s i d e . 1

Wright agreed that this coincided with the crush on the stadium's goal-line
terrace. But he added: 1 I am not aware of any connection between the surge
on the terrace and the gate being opened.'

Asked at a police briefing Sunday about the decision to open the gates,
Pratt replied: 'Whatever happened there yesterday, there was a demand for
police action arid action was taken.'

He added: 'The demand for police action in opening gates is something that
happens on any number of occasions. Everything that was done at Hillsborough
was in accordance with well-tested methods of policing an FA Cup final.'

Responding to charge from fans that police had bungled in handling the
crowds, Pratt said: 'We can understand people criticizing any aspect and
every aspect of a major tragedy.'

Survivor Stephen Dooling, 34, defended the police action in opening the door
to the soccer ground because of the intense crush outside the turnstiles.

IThe police had to open the door because the lads at the front were
screaming. They would have died there at the turnstiles instead of in the
ground,' Dooling said from his hospital bed.

But lawmakers and survivors said there was no organization to cope with a
disaster and demanded changes in stadium designs and elimination of
anti-riot fences.

Many said changes instituted after the May 11, 1985 fire at Bradford
stadium, which killed 53 soccer fans, and the stampede by Liverpool fans at
Heysel stadium in Brussels 18 days later, which killed 39 people, obviously
weren't enough.

'People were caged in yesterday - people who should have been able to escape
off those terraces, who were killed needlessly,' said Liverpool Liberal
lawmaker David Alton.

He said the fences should come down immediately, a demand echoed by
Sheffield Labor lawmaker Joe Ashton, and Denis Howell, a former Labor sports
minister.

Howell said on British Broadcasting Corp. television that he has for years
advocated dry moats to keep fans from invading the field, similar to those
used in some stadiums on the Continent.

Bert Millichip, Football Association president, said regulations required
fences. 'Nevertheless, in light of the appalling tragedy yesterday, quite
clearly we now have to look at the fences and it has to be a very serious
consideration whether or not they have to be pulled d o w n . 1

Dr. John Ashton, a Liverpool University professor of medicine and a
Liverpool fan who was at the game with his children, said there was 'total
chaos' and he ended up sorting victims to decide who was dead and who needed
to get to hospital first.

'The whole thing from beginning to end had incompetence running right
through it,' he said. 'They treat our people here like animals and it
results in their deaths and I am absolutely outraged.'

The investigation is expected to focus on the 10-foot-high (3m) anti-riot
fence with curved metal spikes at the front of the middle terrace where most
of the victims died.

It is also expected to focus on whether fans were getting in without
tickets, or with forged tickets, and why so many were still outside as the
match began. Liverpool supporters complained they had been given the smaller
part of the 54,000-seat stadium when they have far more fans than Nottingham
Forest.

Survivors broke down in tears Sunday as they told of fathers helplessly
watching their young children trampled in the crush, young men battling to
save their girlfriends, and people hitting each other in their frenzied
attempts to escape.

Messages of condolence from around the world included sympathy from US
President George Bush, Pope John Paul II, King Juan Carlos of Spain, Italian
President Francesco Cossiga, and Turkish President Kenan Evren.

A disaster fund has been set up for the families of the victims and the
injured. Mrs. Thatcher announced the government would contribute 500,000
pounds (850,000 dollars) and Millichip said he would ask the Football
Association to contribute 250,000 pounds (425,000 dollars).

       AP        16 Apr 89 Liverpool cathedral holds mass for 94 victims of Britain's
                           worst football disaster (410)


       By ROBERT BARR

       LIVERPOOL, England

The rarely rung Great George bell of Liverpool's Anglican cathedral tolled
94 times Sunday afternoon, once for each of the soccer fans killed in the
crush at British sport's worst disaster.

Thousands of fans of the Liverpool team walked hand in hand around their
home stadium at Anfield Road to honor their friends killed Saturday in
Sheffield's Hillsborough stadium. The Liverpool fans were crushed to death
in the terraces, the standing-room area of the stadium, minutes after the
start of a semifinal cup game.

Liverpudlians of all denominations filled the Roman Catholic cathedral for a
requiem Mass for the victims, and thousands overflowed into the surrounding
grounds.

At the Anglican cathedral, bell ringers took turns pulling the rope of the
church's master bell, Great George, which is rung for the deaths of monarchs
and tolled for the May 29, 1985 Heysel soccer riots in Belgium when a
stampede by Liverpool fans killed 39 fans.

Red and white Liverpool scarves were tied all along the iron entrance gate
at Anfield Road, along with blue and white scarves of the local rival
Everton team, and bunches of flowers covered the pavement below.

inside, a Salvation Army band played as the procession of fans carried
hundreds more wreaths and scarves to place on the terraces behind the team's
goal .

Everton fans joined their Liverpool rivals and, standing side by side, wept.

The Liverpool team, four times European champion and a record 17 times
English League winner, inspires lifelong devotion from its fans and the
rivalry with Everton is respectful and friendly.

Everton qualified Saturday for the final of the premier FA (Football
Association) Cup final. Soccer authorities will decide this week when to
replay Liverpool's semifinal game.

In many families, children grow up with split loyalties to Liverpool and
Everton.

At every home match, the 'kop' -              the bank of thousands of fiercely loyal
fans who stand behind one of the              goals at Anfield Road stadium - is one of
the most intimidating sights and              sounds in English soccer and the most
famous group of standing fans in              the country.

On Sunday, the kop was in mourning and the painful deaths of 94 of its
people were deeply felt in the city whose name is synonymous with soccer.

       TWP 16 Apr 89 93 Soccer Fans Die fn Stampede In England (880)


       By JONATHAN C. RANDAL Washington Post Foreign Service

       LONDON, APRIL 15

 (Key terms) Great Britain. Soccer. Fans. Construction Accidents.


At least 93 people died today and 200 were injured when thousands of fans
were crushed against a steel safety fence in a packed stadium in Sheffield
in northern England.

Hours after the worst disaster in British sports history, preliminary
investigations indicated that the disaster was caused when fans lost their
footing in what became a stampede at a semifinal championship game between
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in Hillsborough Stadium.

Other fans died when the safety barrier collapsed and spectators were
trampled, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.

Most of the dead were young men who had been either crushed or asphyxiated,
but hospital sources said some of the victims were children. Late this
evening, more than 20 fans were reported in intensive care.

Earlier, investigators had speculated that Liverpool fans without tickets
had forced their way into the stadium, causing the crush against special
barriers set up to protect the playing field.

Police and soccer officials had said the fans without tickets either
forcibly knocked down outside gates or were allowed in by stadium officials
unaware of the consequences of letting more people into the packed,
54,000-capacity stadium.

Late tonight, the BBC showed television footage of policemen opening the
stadium gate to relieve the pressure of late-arriving fans trying to enter
the stadium. Police and fans speculated that the unexpected arrival of the
latecomers probably caused confusion and set off what amounted to a human
stampede.

South Yorkshire Chief Constable Peter Wright told the Associated Press that
4,000 last-minute arrivals were let in because police feared that, if they
remained outside, there might be trouble.

                                                                                                    (ITEM    24   CONTINUES)

BBC television footage showed fans climbing over fences and bodies to
escape, and some even scaled concrete walls to balcony seats above them.
Youngsters were hoisted over the railings to police. The arms of fans pinned
to the ground could be seen waving frantically. People screamed as they lost
their footing.

'People were just crushing in. There was a lad and his girlfriend and they
were just screaming. His words were, 'Please, God, help me,' and I believe
the girl died. Her face was just blue,' the AP quoted a fan as saying.

'There was a gentleman on my arm and he said, 'You're choking me, you're
choking me,' and he just f e l 1 f and that was the last of him,' another young
fan told the AP.

Apparently unaware of the unfolding tragedy, the teams played for six
minutes before the authorities realized what was happening and stopped the
game.

Stadium engineer Bill Eastwood told reporters that a section of the barrier
was 'bent like a pipe cleaner' and that whole sections of the steel fence
had given way under the crush. Security specialists suggested that the
safety fence, built to withstand 400 pounds of pressure per foot, gave way
under 2 1/2 times that amount.

About 40 ambulances from all over South Yorkshire rushed to the stadium,
where the injured received heart massage and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
before being taken to hospitals.

Liverpool fans tore down advertising billboards to use as makeshift
stretchers. Shirts and jackets covered the crumpled bodies of the dead.

'We had six minutes of football,' as soccer is called outside the United
States, said Graham Kelly, chairman of the English Football Association,
'and an hour and a half of absolute bedlam.'

Queen Elizabeth II said she was 'shocked and saddened' by the disaster and
expressed her 'deepest sympathy' to the families of the dead, as did
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, head of the Church of England.

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she shared everyone's 'disbelief' and
called for an urgent report.

The BBC said pressure had been building at the stadium hours before the game
began.

Dear Supporter,

Thank you for buying this programme. I do hope that you enjoy the football
on show. The importance of this event is clear for all to see, as it will benefit
both the Hillsborough Appeal, and a hard working local charity.

It is fitting at this time that the links between our two footballing towns,
Wolverhampton and Sheffield, are strengthened by raising money for such
worthy causes.

I      mention the very generous donations that have been made by the
local Companies listed overleaf. Their sponsorship of this event, and that of
many, many local people, is much appreciated.

                              Norman Davies
                  Leader, Wolverhampton Borough Council.



The tragedy of Hillsborough has deeply shocked the whole of Sheffield
but, particularly, those with a love for and an attachment to the game.
Those people who died also loved their football; and we should
therefore continue to enjoy our game while, at the same time,
remembering them. They lived for football, so let us ensure that
football continues to live in memory of them.

Dear Sir

At a recent meeting of my Council Members expressed their deep concern and
sympathy over the tragic events at the football match between Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest on Saturday 15th April       1989 andfelt sufficiently
concerned that they wished to make a donation onbehalf of the citizens of
Selby District in the sum of £1,000.

I have pleasure in enclosing their donation, which I am       sure your
organisation will be able to put to good use of the bereaved and injured
survivors.

Yours faithfully,

At the Special Police Authority meeting on 21 April 1989 you asked whether
or not I was able to release to the Sheffield City Council, as licensing
authority under the Safety of Sports Ground legislation, a copy of the
Police Operational Order for the ill fated semi-final at Hillsborough,
together with a breakdown of police resources deployed both inside and
outside the football ground.  At the meeting I informed you that I would
need to consult the legal officers for the Public Inquiry in respect of
the evidential status of that information.

 I have now been advised by the Treasury Solicitor that it would be
 inappropriate to release that information prior to it being introduced
 into the public domain during the course of the Public Inquiry.  I regret
 therefore that I am unable to assist.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


Thank you for your fax of 4 May, received this morning, about
which I spoke to Mr Webster's secretary when I received it.     I
think-that your fax has crossed with mine of the same date, which               ;
I hope gives you the answer you were seeking about the Home                     j
Office mee ti n g the costs of the Inquiry in principle.  The next              ,
stage is, I think, for us to start to look at the details.     You
very reasonably make the point that you cannot enter into
cosanitaents for not isconsidsrsbls sums on the strength of v*jrb*l             !
assurances alone.     I hope that that position is now clarified.

In your letter of 4 May you also say that the members have agreed               ;
to move the Annual General Meeting of the Council (scheduled for
17 May) from the Town Hall into other premises.    I mentioned this             !
to Lord Justice Taylor today.  He has asked me to express his                   |
gratitude to the members for their generous understanding in this               |
respect.  He realises that this will involve disruption and
disappointment to some, but is glad that the m o mentum of the
Inquiry can be maintained in its first week.   I would therefore
be grateful if you could pass on to the members Lord Justice
Taylor's appreciation of their decision about the Annual General
Meeting.

 Dear Mr Murray

 r e : HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

 With regard to your FAXed communication of 3 May, I have now had
 the opportunity of discussing the contents of the proposed draft
 letter to the Secretary of State for Social Services with both the
 Leader of the Council and the Director of Social Services, Neil Kay,
 and the position is    that we would wish to support the bid for the
 Merseyside Regional Unit for the sum of £350,000 on the basis that
 such bid is distinct from and over and above individual authorities
 cost.  Accordingly, to this end, I append hereto a copy of Councillor
 Betts' signature, together with details of his role.                                                                                  ^

 However, I am asked to point out that there does, in the view of
 Sheffield, need to be an amendment to the sentence in the penultimate
 paragraph on the first page of the letter which it is suggested should
 read:-

                    spread across the North-West, Sheffield and Nottingham."

 So far as Sheffield's costs are concerned, as can be seen from the
 enclosed report, these are estimated as up to £110,000 merely for
 the Social Services, and in addition there is obviously also the
 Coroner's costs and other related staff costs which the Council has
 incurred and it is felt therefore that you may wish to consider
 amending the £1 million figure if this is only an estimate of the
 cost to be incurred by the north-west authorities.

 If you require any further information                                    or clarification                 then       please
 do not hesitate to contact me.

 Yours sincerely




                                                                                          734018

would begin hearing evi­

   “This is an inquiry to dis­
cover first what happened,
secondly why it happened
and thirdly, what lessons
can be learned and recom­

                  HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

                  I attach a note proposing a say in which we might deal with the extra
                  work generated by the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal and the Public
                  Inquiry.

                  Over 3 m o n t h s, the cost of the post at SOI level should not exceed
                  £5000 including running costs.        This would need to be an additional
                  sum, outside the Department's cash limit.

                  I would be grateful for a speedy response, as there are a number of
                  tasks in relation to the Appeal which are simply not being done, but
                  which require urgent attention.




 o
HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Background


1.    Since 15th April, the Publicity Department has been heavily involved
       in launching and running the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal,
       dealing with the media and making arrangements for the Public
       Inquiry.   Ten staff have been involved either full-time or virtually
       full-time, thousands of letters have been received, a 7-day-a-week
       media service has operated, over £1% million has been banked in
       Sheffield, and a Book of Remembrance has been opened and supervised.

2.    Following a visit to Liverpool on 17th April, the Trust was set up
       and has now been properly constituted.   The Trustees already have
       over £4 million and the final figure could be in excess of £8 million.
      Most of the fundraising activity has centred on Sheffield in these
       first two weeks.   However, on Friday 28th April, Liverpool City
       Council opened a city centre Appeal 'shop', with a bank of free
       telephones, 4 staff, and merchandise on sale.   in addition it has
       seconded an officer, Steve McGriskin, to run the Appeal in Liverpool;
       he has a consultant from Bradford working with him for two w e e k s , an
       assistant, and six project officers from Liverpool's Promotions
       and News U n i t .

3.    A further visit was made to Liverpool on Tuesday 2nd May.   From this
       it was clear that the resources made available by Liverpool City
       Council would make Liverpool the focus for further work on the
       Appeal and that they should co-ordinate local, national and
       international events.  Mindful of the scope for further fundraising
       in the Sheffield area, however, it was thought useful to maintain
       a Sheffield resource.

Proposal


4.    There are a number of iobs that need to be done in Sheffield in
       relation to the Aooeal.  These include dealing with letters
       already received, some of which may be evidence for the Inquiry;
       continuing to collect cash and cheques from the public; arrangements
       for collecting tins etc., co-ordination of local events (raffles,
       entertainment, sponsored events) and identifying opportunities for
      good PR.

5.    Advice from Nigel Grizzard (now a consultant, but previously in
       charge of the Bradford City Fire Disaster Appeal) is that Sheffield
      City Council should employ on a full-time, temporary basis, one
      person to perform the roles described in 4.    S/he would need a desk
      and phone, word processor etc and a small display area for PR
      purposes (display of letters/telemessages, reception for donors
       suitable for photographic purposes e tc). The post should
       continue until all the backlog of material is dealt with and probably
      until the end of the Public Inquiry, as there will be opportunities
       for positive PR during the course of the Inquiry.  Also, there are
      a number of organisations who are making their own collections for the
      Appeal over a lengthy period, the proceeds of which will need to be
      properly processed.

         6.     The proposal is that a person be appointed as Appeal Co-ordinator,
                to begin work as soon as possible, on a temporary contract of 3 months,
                with the possibility of extension for a further 3 months.   A draft
                job description is being prepared.


         7.     In addition, a number of staff in the Publicity Department would need
                to keep some involvement.  It is proposed that this should be on an
                agreed 1-day-a-week basis, so that it is clear to all concerned
                when work is being done for the Appeal or the Inquiry.

    Dear Secretary of State,

                                 Hillsborough Tragedy

         Since Hillsborough seven Local Authorities in Merseyside, plus Cheshire
    and Lancashire, together with Mersey Regional Health Authority, Merseyside
    Probation Service and numerous voluntary organisations have been providing a co­
    ordinated response.   On Saturday last, the 29th April, the Leaders of these «ew n
    local authorities and the Leaders of Nottinghamshire and Sheffield Councils met to
    consider a joint approach to the provision of services which will continue to be
    necessary for several yeara to come.

         The attached report, prepared under the independent Chairmanship of the
    Professor of Social Work at Manchester University, was agreed in principle. 33k
    report recommends the establishment of a Regional Unit to provide a core of c o h o q
    services, including:-

          1)       A Helpline to receive calls from anywhere day and night;

          ii)      The Co-ordination of counselling services both within and nctaidr
                   the nine local authorities provided by voluntary as well as
                   statutory agencies;

          iii)     A Database capable of dealing with all requests for assistance «nd
                   offers of help;

          iv)      A continuing training and staff support programme in thie -previously
                   unfamiliar area of work;

         v)        The management of media contacts and publicity.


        It was agreed to reconvene the meeting following exploration of all jwiMiliie
   sources of funding.   Recognizing that services will need to extend beyond '"these
^^nine local authorities and be available nationally on a scale not previously
   experienced by an authority or group of authorities, our first but not only tgy r w i h
   for funding is addressed to Government.   Further work is being undertaken "to approach
  private industry, charitable bodies and E.E.C.    Already the local social services
   authorities in the North Vest have agreed to jointly sponsor an additional training
   officer.

         The Department, we anticipate, would wish to be associated with this
    initiative and through Government may be able to make finance available to ibnd the
    Regional Unit at a cost of (£350,000 per year) for a period of t h r e e years, -ifithin
    all the participating local authority areas it will also be necessary to take urgent
    action to strengthen staffing in order to directly help individuals and their ~faailieB,
    according to the scale of the problems which they are facing. As yet these costa
    have not been fully assessed but when aggregated are unlikely to be less than H mil lion
    per year, spread across the North west.   The Government we hope would wish to beaware
    of this and may consider making resources available to assist in direct service
    provision as well as the establishment of the Regional Unit.

         It is, of course, appreciated that Government has already donated £500,000 -towards
    the National,Disaster Hand.   This fund has quite properly focussed its attention on
    the relief of individual hardahip.and will provide financial help directly to victims,
    but will not do away with the need for other help of a non-finaneial kind to be
    provided.

               Mr. D. Dooley,
               Managing Director,
               S.U.F.C.,
               Bramall Lane,
               Sheffield,
               S2 4SU.

               Dear Sir,

               Annual Inspection of Sheffield United Football Club

                  I am writing to you about the annual inspection of the Stadium and to a
                  discusion which took place in the Directors Suite of the Football Club which
                  is summarised on the attached note.

                  I regret the necessity of writing to you on this issue but particularly in
                  the current circumstances I find that the Club's current attitude as
                  expounded by Dr. Eastwood to be unhelpful and obstructive.  Also in my
                  opinion it almost certainly leaves the Club and its Officers open to
                  prosecution.

                  For your information the Council's Officers who inspect designated sports
                  grounds do so under Section 11 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                  which states

                         "A person authorised by (a) the Local Authority; .... may, on
                         production if so required of his authority, enter a sports ground at
                         any reasonable time, and make such inspection of it and such enquiries
                         relating to it as he considers necessary for the purpose of this Act,
                         and in particular may examine records of attendance at the ground and
                         records relating to the maintenance of safety at the ground, and take
                         copies of such records."

                  It is an offence under Section 12(6) of the same Act in respect of:-

                         "Any person who .... (d) intentionally obstructs any person in the
                         exercise of powers under Section 11 above, or without reasonable excuse
                         refuses, neglects or otherwise fails to answer any question asked by
                         any person in the exercise of such powers, shall be guilty of an,
                         offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level
                         5 on the standard scale."




                                                                                                                                 734005 - Mr. Bownes
R7503/1                               For te le p h o n e e n q u irie s on th is m a tte r please ring                             (S TD C od e 0 7 42)
The Council has, throughout its relationship with the Club under the Safety
of Sports Grounds legislation tried as far as possible to comply with the
Club's reasonable requests.  The inspection which was to take place on 27th
April was fixed in consultation with Mr. Capper and no problems were evident
in advance of the inspection date.

The Council has no objection to the Club's representatives being present
whilst Officers are around the Stadium and this has happened in the past
with no difficulty.  Dr. Eastwood apparently feels that the Inspecting Team
of Officers should operate as a single unit and inspect the Stadium on that
basis with a Club representative present.  In fact owing to the size and
different interests of the various members of the Inspecting Team this is
completely impractical and certainly recent inspections have been carried
out by Officers acting largely independently but maintaining contact between
themselves and Club representatives.  Neither Eastwoods nor representatives
of Stadia inspected in this way have objected to this procedure.

You can see from the legislation which I have quoted that the Club has no
right to "lay down ground rules" in relation to the inspections as suggested
by Dr. Eastwood and the Council will not accept any attempt to do so.  I
take particular exception to Dr. Eastwood's views as to which Officers
should carry out inspections.  This obviously is a matter for sole
consideration by the Council and the other Authorities involved in
inspections.

Owing to the Clubs attitude on 27th April the full annual inspection was not
carried out.  I will therefore have to go to considerable trouble to
re-organise the inspection and I will notify you in writing of it as soon as
possible.

In order to make the situation absolutely clear I wish to say that if any
person obstructs an Officer or without reasonable excuse refuses, neglects
or otherwise fails to answer any question asked by an Officer in the
exercise of his powers under the 1975 Act then a report will be submitted
and a prosecution of the Club or individual representatives may follow.    In
addition to the person who actually causes the obstruction or fails to
supply the information any other Director, Secretary of- representative of
the Club may also be prosecuted individually.

I recommend that if you have any concerns about your and/or the Clubs legal
position you should contact a Solicitor.

The role of Messrs. Eastwood and Partners requires clarification at this
point. Would you please confirm their exact role in relation to safety of
sports grounds.

I sincerely trust that the Council need not resort to its Statutory Powers
in this circumstance.  I feel quite sure that the inspection can proceed
without any difficulties being experienced by any of the parties involved in
it.

Yours faithfully,_______________




Acting Head of Department.

Notes of Dr. Eastwood's Comment at Sheffield United Football Club
Director Suite at approximately 10.00 a.m. on Thursday, 27th April


A discussion took place in the Directors Suite in the presence of the
Council's Inspection Team, Fire Officers and Police Officers between Dr.
Eastwood, Mr. Bownes of the Administration and Legal Department and Mr.
Henley of the Health and Consumer Services Department.  There were also
present representatives from the Club, namely Mr. Dooley and Mr. Capper.

The discussion commenced with Dr. Eastwood commenting on the visit by
Officers of the Health and Consumer Services Department to the Stadium
which took place on the 24th April.  Mr. Bownes asked that these comments
be put in writing and this was agreed although the matter was referred to
a number of times subsequent to this agreement.

There then followed a number of statements by Dr. Eastwood about the Club
"laying down ground rules" for the annual inspection of the Stadium.
These "ground rules" seem to involve the requirement that all Inspecting
Officers be accompanied by Club representatives during the whole of the
time that they were in the Stadium and that the inspection should be
carried out by Officers acting together in a group.  Dr. Eastwood
intimated that inspections would not be allowed by the Club unless Club
representatives were allowed to accompany Officers.

Dr. Eastwood also said that he wished Club representatives to accompany
Officers so that discussions could take place at any time.    He  went on to
say that this system had worked well under the   South Yorkshire  County
Council Administrative system.  Dr.  Eastwood also said that he wanted
Inspecting Officers to be experienced in dealing with inspections of this
nature and be of Senior rank.

Mr. Henley felt that the inspection from his Department's point of view
could not carry on in these circumstances as it seemed clear that the
inspection would only be allowed to proceed on 27th April by the whole
Inspection Team going round the ground together.   The Health and Consumer
Services representatives then left the Stadium   along with Mr. Bownes who
entirely supported the stance he had taken.

Note for Councillor Clive Betts
On 25th April 1989,                  was requested by your Secretary to see two
representatives from Legal and General.

They introduced them selves as Mr                and Mr Terry Harrison.

They explained that they are members of an over 35s football team with close
connections with Hallam Football Club and Hallam Veterans.

They wish to ask you if you will support them in an idea to raise money for the
Hillsborough Appeal and the Hallam Football Club.

Apparently 22 of their members would pay at least £250 to play at Wembley.

Their idea is to play them selves for the first half and auction 22 places for the
second half. They are also considering sponsorship for each place.

When they contacted Wembley and suggested the possibility, the management said
they couldn't use the stadium and in any event the Football Association wduldn’t
allow it.

They therefore came to see you, to see if you could lend your support to their
schem e. They are also contacting David Blunkett, apparently.

They asked that you be given details o f their idea and also indicated that they were
open to any other suggestions.

    Dear Clive

    I was deeply shocked to learn of the tragedy that occurred on Saturday at Sheffield
    Wednesday Football Club.

    I know that our Mayor has expressed condolences to your Mayor, but I too, would also
    like to express my deepest sympathy to the people of your City.

    Yourfl sincerely________

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

I thought I had better put down my memory of a conversation which I had
with David Bownes with regard to licensing of sports grounds. The
conversation took place on the 14 April; one day before the Hillsborough
disaster.

I was speaking to David Bownes with regard to some work he was doing in
trying to collate the various features of football grounds which we
license, together with the requirements that we make under the various
Codes of Practice and, also, the procedures and manuals which the Police
and the Football Club use to control crowds. The idea was that we would
put together a detailed Code of Practice which could be used on a national
basis as a counterproposal to the Government’s Membership Scheme.

During the course of the conversation I said to Mr. Bownes that it was, of
course, important that I understood what relationships had been like with
the clubs in the past. I asked whether Sheffield Wednesday had ever shown
any unwillingness to carry out any requests we had made under the safety of
sports ground legislation and Mr. Bownes replied that they had always co­
operated with everything that we had requested of them and, indeed, that
they were generally only too willing to do extra work to ensure that the
ground met the requirements.

With regard to Sheffield United, Mr. Bownes indicated that there were a
number of items where we had had problems persuading United that money
should be spent. Indeed, on some matters, we had given them extra leeway
and further time to make improvements.        I suggested that we had to be
absolutely certain about matters with regard to safety under the Act and,
on this years inspection we should make it clear to United that there was
no room for leeway and that they had to ensure that all matters were
brought up to an adequate and acceptable standard before the next season.
I suggested we ought to take a very firm line with United on such matters.

Mr. Bownes agreed and indicated that the time might have come when we might
have to refuse a certificate unless United were prepared to comply in every
way with the appropriate requirements.

I thought it might be appropriate for me to put down my recollection of
this conversation.    You may like to check it with Mr. Bownes to get his
confirmation of it.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER;   TASK TEAM


In the seven days since the disaster happened certain things have become
clearer in trying to assess the on-going work needed.

Working on the experiences of staff from Bradford and Kent (Zeebrugge), but
recognising that no two disasters are the same, it is emerging that there is
a lot of work to do with a substantial number of Sheffield citizens who have
been traumatised or affected by the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club ground on 15 April 1989.

After one week’s work the Task Group is now more of the opinion that the
primary focus of any on-going work is with people from Sheffield. There is
a secondary focus of work, which is to support Liverpool Social Services
Department in anyway possible in their work with bereaved families, or
families of those injured (physically or emotionally).

The only possible exceptions to this would be families fromoutside
Liverpool whose choice it was to work directly with Sheffield.

We know that there will be key times in the future when support to Liverpool
Social Services Department will be more intense:- eg. When the Enquiry
findings are made public: at the Coroner’s Inquest or on Anniversaries. To
some extent this work can be planned for in advance because dates will be
known.

All such work is as a support to Liverpool and secondary to the Primary
Focus.

The Task Team are of the opinion that the Primary Focus needs to concentrate
on Sheffield residents. There are considerable numbers involved:-

    Sheffield Wednesday FC Staff -      600

    Sheffield Wednesday supporters at the game         -   1000

    Local Residents who offered help:         cannot be estimated at this moment.

    Red Cross Staff   - not known as yet

    St John’s Ambulance Staff -      3 5 + 2 ambulances

    South Yorks Police - 1111 (257 inside the ground) and unspecified
    number of special constables.

    Staff from F+CS and other helping professions, including clergy
    estimated conservatively at 300 plus environmental health/mortuary
    staff.


The impact on such numbers, because of the sudden violent way in which it
happened, will have an effect on the Mental Health of the Community.

The Task Team believe that the on-going work following the disaster should
be seen in Mental Health Prevention terms. If this does not happen it seems
certain that some of the people in the groups above will go into crisis at
some future date. We are informed that research shows that some people can
become chronic depressives if not helped in a pro-active way.
         2


         One of the impressive features since the disaster is the amount of work
         being done by Voluntary Organisations, the Churches, Area Health Staff,
         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the Local Authority. There is so much
         being done that one of the problems is co-ordinating, because sometimes it
         is being done by individual organisations or sometimes in pairs.

         The temporary Task Team are convinced that there is a need to consider the
         setting up of a permanent Task Team initially for 6 months to be extended as
         required if proved to be necessary to establish a Mental Health Prevention
         Service to Sheffield residents affected by the Hillsborough Disaster, and to
         act as a support service to Liverpool Social Services Department and other
         Local Authority Social Services Departments affected by the events at
         Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.

         However the Temporary Task Team would want to ensure the ongoing commitment
         of Voluntary Organisations, the Churches, Area Health and Sheffield
         Wednesday Football Club.

         The following is therefore proposed:-

         1.   The setting up of a Steering/Advisory Group with representatives of
              Voluntary Organisations; the Churches; AHA; Sheffield Wednesday Football
              Club; The Local Authority (F+CS taking the lead role).

              This Group’s remit would be :-

              "To advise the Manager and Task Team Leader about important issues in
              order to co-ordinate the range of services needed".

         2.   The setting up of a permanent Task Team for a minimum of 6 months
              comprising of:-

              1 Team Leader (preferably with M Health training)
              POld/e                                                       £17,267

              3 Level 3 Social Workers equivalent but able to
              offer group work and community work skills                   £45,349       FullA
                                                                                         year^^
              1 Admin Officer Scale 6                                      £12,852       costs



              3 Clerks Scale 2/3                                           £27,000

              Printing, stationery, postages and telephones                 £5,000

              Computer Costs                                                £3,000


                                         Total (including on-costs)       £13.0, 468


              A psychologist should also be seconded to the team from the District
              Health Authority.

              A further sum of money needs to be identified for running costs and some
              initial training in Stress De-briefing Techniques.




REPAAD
         3.   This team should be    based in Hillsborough (possibly at the Library in
               the rooms currently   occupied by Helpline) and accountable to the
              Divisional Officer,    Division 2, through to Assistant Director,
              Operations.


         Because the team is being set up primarily to work with Sheffield citizens,
         other sources of funding from within the city might be approached.

The tragedy of Hillsborough has deeply shocked the whole of Sheffield but,
particularly, those with a love for and an attachment to the game. Those
people who died also loved their football; and we should therefore continue
to enjoy our game while, at the same time, remembering them. They lived for
football, so let us ensure that football continues to live in memory of them.

L e a d e r ,Sheffield
City Council.

Dear Sir,
First,my condolence to the people of Sheffield over Kill'borough.
I spent three happy years in your city years ago, a very musical
and gifted people.
I enclose a copy of my letter to Eric Heffer.As you see I ’m not
impressed by policemen being scattered like locusts through the
inquiry.Millions d o n ’t trust the police enough you know, and they've
themselves to blame.But of course I blame HHG for giving them
such power.TTo group can be trusted that much.
I wish to complain of remarks made by Sir Jack layden as quoted
by the Guardian of April the 22nd, in which he insists on
continuing confidence in the Chief Constable and his officers.Is
he -peaking for just Roth^ham or Sheffield as well*?
You know when ninety-five people are in their coffins Sir Jack
should bide his time on this one.Somebody has blundered badly and
this sounds like a failure to recognise  that.It could be taken
as a vindication     of police behaviour on that dreadful Saturday.
The cause of the t^gedy is well known, and the matlerJ^g&t^Bver
quickly and people not kept tormented by the wider aspects and
problems of sport.That problem is as wide as society itself, and at
the end of the day it means HMG has to spend money on the people
(the people have earned the money!) and  not shut them up in barns and
cages.
The trouble is these wider matters are being used to mask the
simple but lethal decisions which caused Hillborough.The people are
being asked to wait till England sorts itself out,-at least nine
months for the theories to emerge, and doubtless acrimonious decades
to follow.
The people want action NOW.In any other country the people responsible
for safety would have been suspended from duty.vi/hy ha n't this been
done?That is the very least gesture to the bereaved, because it
acknowledges that the civic authorities care.Why hasn't    the
police authority requested this?
Instead we have the Chief Constable of South Yo r k s h i r e ,Peter
Wright praising the actions of his men(thus pre-judging the
results of what is truly a police inquiry, having doubtless some
knowledge of what is intended) while refusing in the same breath to
answer important QuestionsJ
         ~                                    n
(NOTE:The Chief is quoted as saying that the umbers of police
on duty at the Xiepping lane end was "the same as at last year's
PA Cup semi-xinal"He significantly does not reveal the figure,the
relative size of the crowds, noi? the tactics adopted on both
occasions)
After the experience of the Yorkshire miners I'd have thought the
whole counts is on guard.If the truth is blocked then drums will
beat along xhe Mersey for sure.There is anger ready for release
on this one for which even a wrongly constituted inquiry must take
notice.It's my one hope.             ---------------- ~—
Y urs faithfully,    ,,-------------

Dear E r ^ c ,
Please accept my condolence for the brave people of Merseyside during
this   time of their lossol'm surepeople round   the world were deeply
muved by the   silent crowds.I address this  toyourself as one close
to the people of Liverpool.
KMG have set up a POLICE inquiry into the Hillborough tragedy,not
a public one.T-e presence of Lord Justice Taylox* leaves me un'ovsd.
He may breath in the "atmosphere on the terraces" but the police
are all round iiimoHis presence is to give an odour of respectability
to the stale old game of having policemen judge their own
c ulpability.Besides, English judges aren't everybody's cup of tea.
I haven't got over tnat shocking Stephen Waldorf affairJ
Hark this Eric.Two senior policemen are sitting with the judge,one
apparently as an assessor,the other I believe, presents-and dcubiless
selects-evidence as it arrives from various police bodies.Meanwhile
policemen are getting their hands on all videos, films, and other
^roofs of events at Hillborough.They are even(at this time) keeping
possession of the personal belongings of victims.This Theatre of
the Grotesque(as I call it) is being dished up as a public inquiiy.
The omens are already bad.The Chief Co.isto.ble of South Yorkshire,
M" reter ’."/right brushes aside questions relating to certain
police actiuns(or lack of action)on the grounds that answering
such questions will prejudice the inquiry, and in tne same breath
supports all the action his men took on that fatal Saturday, thus
sug^estingCin spite of his reverence for sub judice)that all his men
ought to be got off.' Did it not enter his mind that there are a
long row of coffinj to be accountcd for? Apparantly not.'Is this then
an omen of the direction this inquiry is going to take, that having
eventually #o account for theae deaths, tne supporters will be
blamed for tn^m?
The people at Hillborough well knew what happened.The failure to
police crowds arriving late(due to traffic congestion) at lepping
Lane led to pressure through sheer numbers(not rowdy behaviour)
which caused a police officer either through panic,or miscalculation,
or misinformation,to open a sliding door.Millions have seen on
television the clear evidence that only a handful of police were
on duty among the thronging thousands of Lamping L a n e , and that
there was no effort made to "filter" the crowd..Where Chief Constable .
Taylor's estimated 854 policemen(outside the stadium) were remains
a mystery.The allocation of the smallest space to the largest
number of supporters is another police matter,,
As Mr Hattersley has said, the buck stops with the p o l i c e „T h a t 's
perfectly right.HMG have given the police absolute responsibili^
for the public safety.If the police haven't the resources, that's
a fair poi-it.But it's the police duty to take that up with HMG.
If the police have, and been ignored, then that should be exposed
and the buck stop with HMG and some heads roll. M e a n w h i l e , the people
and their dead and maimed should not be mocked and insulted.They
can form their own public inquiry(a real one) and demand the
immediate suspension from duty of the policeman responsible for
the public safety.Perhaps Hillborough is a turning point, and the
people who rule by putting others in cages are heading for their
d e m i s e .'
Best wishes ^                ^

        COPING WITH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF DISASTERS
    Government help for follow-up and counselling Working Group

    David Mellor, Minister for Health, today welcomed the formation
    of a Joint Working Group on disaster follow-up and counselling.
    It will be considering what recent tragedies can teach social
    services departments and other local agencies involved in coping
    with the social and psychological effects of major disasters on
    victims and their relations.

    The Department of Health has already provided £25,000 in 1988/89
    for CRUSE Bereavement Care, the national voluntary organisation,
    to administer the group, and hopes to provide up to a further
    £61,000 over the next two years. The group is chaired by Mr Tony
    Allen, chief executive of Berkshire County Council.

    Mr Mellor said: "In the wake of so many recent and appalling
    tragedies, we want to pool all the available expertise, so that
    local agencies can learn from shared experiences how best to
    provide social and psychological support for those affected.

    "We hope that the work of the joint group will help local
    agencies to be prepared for an immediate and effective response
    to such events."

    Social services departments have played a key part in supporting
    and co-ordinating the roles of local authorities and voluntary
    organisations. The group expects to report within the next
    12 - 18 months, and its terms of reference are to consider the
    following points, taking account of the resources likely to be
    available:

    what steps should be taken to prepare for the provision of
    social and psychological support in the aftermath of such
    disasters;

-   how best to achieve coordination among agencies in the
    arrangement of the necessary support;

                                [MORE]
                                -   2   -




how the lessons learned from recent experiences might best be
dis seminated;

setting up an information service.

Search and Rescue Operations co-ordinated by HM Coastguard,                                           and
11,132 people received                         assistance       from the Maritime            Search   and
Rescue authorities.


Lord Brabazon, Minister for Shipping, commented:


            "1988 was a busy year for the Coastguard,                                  in fact
            the       busiest            ever.          Incidents       ranged        from   co­
            ordinating the massive search and rescue operation
            following              the     Piper        Alpha    disaster        to    holiday
            makers            in     trouble        on     the      coastline          and    to
            sailboarders             unable        to    cope    with    the     conditions.
            Once again, however, the main customer has been the
            recreational boat owner who accounted                              for a large
            majority of all calls for help from vessels.


            "With           the    holiday       season    approaching,          I urge      all
            who use the sea and coastline for pleasure or work
            to use           common       sense,    to be properly             equipped      and
            always to make use of the practical advice offered
            by     HM       Coastguard.            In     particular,      it     cannot      be
            emphasised too strongly that weather and tides can
            cause much trouble if not properly understood."

                   Goodwill Trip to Sheffield ^ Childrens Hospital#


       Tniit and flower traders at Liverpool City Council’s Sdge lane fruit
    market have said a special thank you to the people of Sheffield, for their
    kindness during the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster*

              This morning: two Liverpool Councillors, Harry Chase and Steve Ledwich,
    who were both at the match, travelled to the Bujral Sheffield Childrens Hospital
     with a van load of toys, fruits, flowers and sweets for the sick youngsters*

             Councillor Ledwich said* ,fThe fruit traders donated £1,000 worth of
    fruit and each of the $00 porters donated sweets* Along with flowers from the
    traders and toys from Liverpool City Council the market staff have asked us
    to give their thanks and best wishes to the people of Sheffield*

    it appropriate to send gifts to the children of Sheffield***

INTRODUCTION


INTROIT:

    ‘Almighty and everlasting God, mercifully look upon our
    infirmities, and in all our dangers and necessities stretch forth
    thy right hand to help and defend us; through Jesus Christ our Lord.    Amen
                                                      Gibbons (1583-1625)

    THE HYMN:

               Guide me, O thou great Redeemer,
                  Pilgrim through this barren land;
               I am weak, but thou art mighty,
                  Hold me with thy powerful hand:
                    Bread of heaven,
               Feed me till I want no more.

               Open now the crystal fountain,
                 Whence the healing stream doth flow;
               Let the fire and cloudy pillar
                 Lead me all my journey through:
                    Strong Deliverer,
               Be thou still my strength and shield.

               When I tread the verge of Jordan,
                 Bid my anxious fears subside;
               Death of death, and hell’s Destruction,
                 Land me safe on Canaan’s side:
                   Songs of praises
               I will ever give to thee.
I      COMMEMORATION OF THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES


       Wreaths, symbols of our remembrance, will be laid.


      The Easter Candle, symbol of the Resurrection, will be lit by
            the Bishop of Sheffield.

PRAYERS AND THE LORD’S PRAYER


CHOIR:

      Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts;
      shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer: but
      spare us, Lord most Holy, O God most mighty,
      O holy and merciful Saviour, thou most worthy
      Judge eternal, suffer us not, at our last
      hour, for any pains of death, to fall from thee.
                                       Purcell (1658-1695)


THE HYMN:

1 Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;          3 I need thy presence every passing hour;
  The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!         What but thy grace can foil the tem pter’s power?
  When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,        Who like thyself my guide and stay can be?
  Help of the helpless, O abide with me.             Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with m e.

2 Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;   4 I fear no foe with thee at hand to bless;
  E arth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;     Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
  Change and decay in all around I see;              Where is death’s sting? where, grave, thy v'"~>y
  O thou who changest not, abide with me.            I triumph still, if thou abide with me.       ^

                     5 Hold thou they Cross before my closing eyes;
                       Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies:
                       Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;
                       In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!

PRAYERS

THE HYMN:

1 The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want;           3 Yea, though I walk through death’s dark vale,
     he makes me down to lie                           yet will I fear none ill;
  In pastures green; he leadeth me                   For thou art with me, and thy rod
     the quiet waters by.                              and staff me comfort still.

2 My soul he doth restore again,                   4 My table thou hast furnished
 /"N and me to walk doth make                         in presence of my foes;
  w ithin the paths of righteousness,                My head thou dost with oil anoint,
     e’en for his own nam e’s sake.                   and my cup overflows.

                               5 Goodness and mercy all my life
                                  shall surely follow m e;
                                 And in G od’s house for everymore
                                  my dwelling-place shall be.
THE ADDRESS:      The Most Reverend John S. Habgood, D.D.
                  Archbishop of York, Primate of England and Metropolitan.



THE HYMN:

        God is Love : let heav’n adore him;
          God is Love : let earth rejoice;
        Let creation sing before him,
          and exalt him with one voice.
        He who laid the earth’s foundation,
          he who spread the heav’n above.
        He who breathes through all creation,
          he is Love, eternal Love.

        God is Love : and he enfoldeth
          all the world in one embrace;
        With unfailing grasp he holdeth
          every child of every race.
        And when human hearts are breaking
          under sorrow’s iron rod,
        Then they find that selfsame aching
          deep within the heart of God.

        God is Love : and though with blindness
          sin afflicts the souls of men,
        G od’s eternal loving-kindness
          holds and guides them even then.
        Sin and death and hell shall never
          o ’er us final triumph gain;
        God is Love, so Love for ever
          o’er the universe must reign.

                                               disaster report.
                                                   Mr Heseltine said yesterday: “Mrs

                                               asked her what the Government would do
                                               if the judge (Lord Justice Taylor) found

                                              A TOP lawyer yesterday called on football

                                              oTuj) to £5m to the Hillsborough disaster
                                                   Sir Harry Livermore, who is represent­
                                                 ing the families of 15 of the Hillsborough
                                               . dead and injured, said a huge donation
                                                 from the pools companies would end the
                                                 battle for legal compensation
                                                   He said: “No mention has been made of
                                                 any contribution at all by the Football
                                                 Pool Promoters Association. They have
                                                 made billions of pounds out of football
                                                    “ They sh o u ld give such a large
                                                 donation—perhaps £5m—to the disaster
                                                 fund, that harassed families and injured
                                                 survivors can at least be secure in the
                                                 knowledge that they will be properly
                                                 looked after.”
                                                 LIVERPOOL will play their first football
                                                 match since the Hillsborough disaster
                                                 next Sunday. The Merseyside club have
                                                 accepted an invitation from Glasgow
                                                 Celtic to play in a challenge match to raise
                                                 money for the Hillsborough fund.

Denial by
club in
perimeter
fence row
Br BRIANKAYind FIONAMAUON
OFFICIALS of lx*eds Uniled last night
angrily denied that tliey had failed to
agree wiih council officials over new
safety measures for F.lland Road In the
wake of the Hillsborough disaster.
  The council's Labour leader. Coun Jon
Trlckett, alleged yesterday that club
officials had refused to take down all
perimeter fencing nt the ground In tine
with the council’s wishes.
   Ife said the club's claim that the
Football Association needed to be con*
suited was spurious since the FA had told
councit officials that fencing was solely a
matter between thecluband the licensing
authority, l-eeds City Connell.
   Rut last night cluo officials said they
were shocked and amazed by Coun
Trickett’s remarks.
   They insisted they had reached agree*
menl with council officials and were on
the verge of Issuing an agreed Press
s ta t e m e n t w h en C o un T r l c k e t t
Intervened.
   The club secretary. Mr David Dowse,
said there had been two meetings of
the ground safety committee which
included fire and police representatives,
club officials and representatives of Ihree
city council departments.
   Me said the committee agreed after
detailed discussion that the fencing in
front of the West Stand should be
removed along with the spikes from
feucinz in other areas of the ground but
that the rest of the fcticlng should
remain.
   Safety committee members agreed that
no further action should be taken until
the inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor had
been made puhilc.
   The committee had been planning the
removal of fencing at Ihe West Stand for
some 12 months but in the light of
Hillsborough it had agTecd the process
should be accelerated.
   Mr Douse said work to remove the West
Stand fencing and the spikes had already
begun but stressed that the ground was
safe with or without fencing.
   He said: “We arc not aware of any clash
at ail. We feit nil the representatives of the
factions involved including three deport-
m e n ts o f th e c o u n c i l w e r e In
agreement.
   ‘The safety team agreed a Press release
which Coun Trickett overruled. Coun
Trlckett didn’t attend the meeting and
hasn't spoken to tis. 1 find i( wrong that
someone can take an arbitrary decision to
take these fences down when It flies in the
face of what everyone else was saying.
   “Wc are quite prepared to stand our
corner."
   But Coun Trlckett insisted yesterday
that all perimeter fences nt the ground
would have to come down, or the council
would have to review the number of fans
allowed on the terraces.
   He said: "The Leeds United Kop
contains about t3.000 people and you
can imagine the weight of the crush
which would occur if that number of
people started moving forward against a
fence. It fills me with alarm and
horror."
   Coun Trickctt said crowd safety must
have priority over crowd control, and
Elland Road's crash barriers, "moat” and
perimeter wall were sufficient to prevent
pitch invasions without the security
  He confirmed that the council, as
owners of Ellnnd Hoad, would pay to
remove all the perimeter fencing but
acknowledged that the chib could face
increased policing costs once (he fence
was removed.


Call for ambulance
staff at matches
 MORE lives could have been saved at
 Hillsborough if professional ambulance
 officers had been on duty, it was claimed
 yesterday.
    They shouid be present nt all major
 football matches and other similar large
 public events, possibly In police com­
 mand posts, according to the Scottish
 region of the Association of Chief
 Ambulance Officers.
    In a letter to the Scottish FA and
 Scottish Football League, ihe association
 said: "U this had taken place nt Hills­
 borough. anti am b u lan ce s ta ff had
 directed the resuscitation, we are left
 wondering if the death toll would have
 been as high."
    The ambulance chiefs said voluntary
 first-aid societies, often supported bv a
 doctor, attended foolball matches, but
.they stressed lhal NHS ambulancemen
 were (rained and equipped to make sure
 casualties could be resuscitated before
 being taken to hospiUI.

Briefing note for RCJ


This is a special meeting of the Police Authority which is to say that it is
called for a special purpose but otherwise subject to all the normal procedural
rules and conventions.


Therefore no opportunity in the meeting for media questions.   I should also
comment on the effect of the appointment of Lord Justice Taylor to carry out an
independent judicial enquiry and the fact that a writ has been served on the
Chief Constable.    When the hearings have been arranged the provisions of
Contempt of Court Act 1981 will have full effect.


In this context and in the light of the general desirability not to add to the
speculation which   has taken place over the last week I would advise members to
observe the general guidance that while it is in order for discussion totake
place of a matter of general public interest there is a line that needs to be
drawn between legitimate discussion and any comments or questions which would
unduly anticipate and might indeed prejudice the enquiry and any other legal
proceedings.


I know that the Chief Constable is fully aware of these contraints and I would
advise that members frame their questions accordingly.

The public are informed that Superintendent Roger Marshall who was
in control of the Police and crowd control.on Saturday at Sheffield,
was a very experience Police Officer with over 30 years experience.

Therefore, when he realized he had a tragery on hia hands involing
many casu.a3.tys why he did not send for the HOSPITAL ACCIDENT
EMERGENCY SERVICES?,    They are standing bye 24 hours a day^ready t£
turn out with fully experienced doctors, nurses and full equipment,

We know that the Fire Brigade carries HEAVY CUTTING GEAR which is use d
to cut into cars etc to release peopled   When t-he crews arrived, at
the gpsrund WHY THEY DID NOT USE THE CUTTING GEAR TO CU£ INTO THE
STEEL FENCING so that people could get onto the pitch?.

Many mistakes have been made and a lot to learn.   On all these large
gathering of people be it football or Pop Concerts there should be a
very experienced TOP RANKING OFFICER on duty who wfculd have the power
to call out what services he needed and hav.^ power over all Police
Officers of any rank and all rescue workers.

      Dear Mr. Bownes,

      Sheffield United Football Club Police Operation Order

      As promised, please find enclosed, the standing instructions and Operation
      Order used to effect the policing arrangements at the Bramall Lane ground.

      The blue booklet containing the standing instructions is issued to each Ser­
      geant and officers of above that rank who are on duty at the ground, toge­
      ther with the duties of the particular officers they are responsible for.

      A master copy is prepared for the use of the senior officers and officers in
      the Control Room.

      The Order needs to be flexible to take into account the size of the crowd,
      the previous history of the supporters of the visiting team, and the import­
      ance of the match.     The papers I have supplied to you are those which we
      prepare for a game at Bramall Lane which is not expected to attract a crowd
      of more than 1 5 ,000.

      The Order is fairly easy to follow, but having said that, I am looking at it
      from the viewpoint of an individual who is conversant with these Orders, and
      realise that you may have some questions to ask.  If that is the case,
      please do not hesitate to contact me.

   Dear Councillor Betts,

   HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY


   I am writing to you on behalf of the whole of our Council and its
   residents to express our deepest grief and sympathy at the tragic
   events of last Saturday, which I feel sure I hardly need remind
   you of.

   I am also able to inform you that at yesterday's Finance & Administration
   Committee, it was unanimously agreed that we should donate £5,000
   to the disaster fund and our Director of Finance will be processing
   this matter in the near future.

   Our hearts go out to all those who have suffered or lost loved ones
   and hope that it comes as some confort to know that colleagues are
   thinking of you at this time.


   Yours sincerely,

                         Dear CovgjciiiarTjetEs

                         I am writing to express the Council's shock and sorrow about the tragedy
                         which occurred at Hillsborough on Saturday.

                         tty borough, as you knew, is the home of another of Britain's great teams -
                         Arsenal Football Club. As a result we experience the enthusiasm which
                         exists for the game locally and the loyal following it attracts every week.
                         We share fully your sorrow at this difficult time when people are still
                         coning to terms with the scale of the tragedy. The grief and disbelief of
                         those who have lost family or friends is uppermost in our minds at this
                         time.

                         Over time, as people cone to terms with their loss, I hope that any inquiry
                         will mean that events of this kind will never happen again.

                         Best wishes

       Me are a middle aged couple with two teenage daughters* We were
       both in the stand above where all the Liverpool Supporters were
       killed*

       We left our house at 11.00 a.m. and got into the ground at 2.10 p.m.
       At 2.20 p.m. we went into our seats and then walked forward to look
       over the balcony at the fans below. It was obvious to us that there
       were too many fans in the area behind the goal and indeed many looked
       distressed and many of them were chanting "no more room no more room"
       "don't let anyone else in here".   Surely the Police must have had
       their surveillance cameras focused oh that area and surely if we
       could see it was overcrowded at 2.20 p.m. they must have been able
       to see it.   Why didn't they tell the Stewards not to let anyone
       else into that area and to direct people to the two side areas
       where there was room?   Why did they allow people to keep coining
       into that area in a steady stream from 2.20 p.m. to 2.50 p.m. WHY ?

       My husband went to the toilet at 2.40 p.m. and said there were
       thousands outside and he could see s group of about 100 to 200
       being allowed to run down the street as fast as they could towards
       the crowds that were already there.

       Then of course the event which if you wanted to be kind you would call
       "gross incompetence and bad management" but if you were being really
       truthful and honest you would call wicked, was allowed to happen.
       The Police opened a 16 foot gate and let the crowd rush in as if this
       was not bad enough, nobody had their ticket checked to see if they
       had a correct ticket or in fact any ticket at all, this was at a
       match that was supposed to be all ticket, I myself was frisked when
       we went in and my bag was searched sind my husband was also searched.
       Then to make matters even worse the Police and Stewards allowed the
       crowd to rush towards the first entrance they saw which was of course
       the tunnel leading directly into the already overcrowded area.

       Why was the gate opened to let everyone in irrespective of whether
       they had a correct ticket or not ?    Why were they allowed to rush
       towards the most crowded area of the ground ?Why were they not
       directed towards areas with more empty spaces ?

       Now we have heard the Police opened the gate to alleviate pressure outside
       which we just cannot comprehend was a valid reason knowing the
       state of the ground inside.   Why was there so much pressure outside ?
       Why couldn't the Police control it ? Isn't that what they are there for?
       Why weren't there more Police outside ? Why were 100 to 200 fans allowed
       to run down the road towards the rest of the crowd trying to get in
       to the ground ?   Why did Police on horseback not make the croud queue in
       an orderly fashion as the Police atAnfield do weak in and week out in
       far worse conditions i.e. the alleways to the bop and the main road
       outside the ground ? Why were the Police outside the ground if not to
       control the fans ?    Why didn't the police inside communicate the position
       to the Police outside ?
Lastly of course there is why were Liverpool allocated less tickets
than Nottingham Forest*    We have tuice as many regular supporters as
N0ttingham Forest and were given 4,000 or whatever less tickets than
them*    In fact people who got into the ground when the gate was
opened by the Police had tickets which they had bought from Nottingham
Forest fans*    The Police say it was easier to control us and the
traffic^ if we were given the Lickers Lane End.    This has been proved
to be totally untrue as there was no crowd control outside and most of
the people arrived late because of traffic problems, not to mention
Police holding up coaches and checking for alcohol, and being made
to walk niles from their coaches to the ground.   This has happened
many times to us, most recently at Coventry and prior to that at
Aston Villa when Liverpool played Arsenal in the Littleuoods Cup.
So there is no way giving us fewer tickets can be justified.

We will never forget the scenes we saw and people being dragged out
of the paddock below us and thrown on to the pitch and left to die.
People trying to get out through totally inadequate gates and being
pushed back by the Police at first.   People being carried auay on
hoarding by the Fans not ambulance men, policemen or stewards.
Why weren't the stretchers there where were they ? Where were the
ambulances ? Why ueren1t wire cutters used in the fence more quickly ?
Why didn't the Police react quicker to this terrible situation ?
Why were there no announcements over the loudspeaker made to inform
everyone who didn't know of the problem ?

WHY was this terrible thing allowed to happen ?

We will never be able to forget it anyone who was there and especially
those who have loet loved ones and friends until we get some answers
to the above questions.

We are enclosing an article which we think answers those questions
but we hope and pray that some one can show us some other reason
to keep us sane.

           HILLSBOROUGH   "DON’T TAKE YOUR PAIN OUT ON OTHERS" CALL


Sheffield's Director of Social Services, Neil Kay, has joined those calling

for an    end to Public expressions of accusation and blame of the

Hillsborough disaster.




Many people in the city are suffering from severe emotional shock, he says,

and one    of the common reactions to this condition is bitterness and an

overwhelming sense of anger.



Mr Kay adds:     "Such anger is often targeted on some individual or group and

is even more likely if people themselves feel unfairly criticised.




"Unfortunately, when people are in shock they may target people who don't

deserve their blame and anger, making judgements on rumour and partial

information."



His advice is:    "Don't bottle it up.   Byall means share your   anger with

family and friends, if they can take it, or seek counselling.But please        stop

the public accusations    and wait for the public enquiry to establish the facts.




"People as shocked and distressed as you are getting hurt."

  PIPER ALPHA WIDOW DONATES TO HILLSBOROUGH VICTIMS'



  Less than a week after the tragic events at Hillsborough Stadium, over
  £660,000 has cleared through the accounts in Liverpool, Sheffield and
  Nottingham for the Hilssborough Disaster Appeal. Over £1 million more has
  been pledged.

  Sheffield's Lord Mayor , Councillor Phyllis Smith, who has been deeply moved
  by the tragedy and the sincere expressions of sympathy received with donations,
  has cancelled her planned visit to Sheffield's twin town of Bochum in West
  Germany next week. Instead, the Deputy Mayor of Bochum will be bringing a
  cheque for £16,000 to present to the Lord Mayor in Sheffield next'Saturday
  (29 April). He is expected to accompany a civic party from Sheffield to the
  memorial service at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral at 11.00 the same day.

  The Appeal continues to receive donations attached to heart-rending letters
  such as

  "This is just a token payment towards the fund, hoping it will help
  somebody, (from Piper Alpha Widow and children)."

  A'!Liverpool fan who> was at Heysel has sent half his dole money and    tw0 inmates

                 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - SPECIAL MEETING OF POLICE AUTHORITY
                 ON 21ST APRIL, 1989

                 I write in response to your request for some urgent notes in relation to
                 the special meeting of the Police Authority to be held at 10.30 a.m. on
                 the 21st April 1989, at the Conference Centre, Barnsley, where the only
                 item of business is for the chief constable to report on the Hillsborough
                 Stadium Tragedy. You asked for advice in two areas, namely the rights
                 of attendance at meetings of the Police Authority and rights and obligations
                 in relation to questions addressed by members of the Police Authority to
                 the chief constable. I am sensitive that Fran Homewood, our Police Liaison
                 Officer, is much involved in giving support and advice to our members
                 serving on the Police Authority and that she invariably participates in a
                 briefing session for members in preparation for meetings. I have held hurried
                 informal discussions with Fran and her colleagues to make them aware
                 of the issues raised and no doubt you may wish to pass on my comments
                 which I readily acknowledge are the product of some very hurried research.

                 Attendance at Meetings of Police Committees

                 1.     The Police Authority is a metropolitan county police authority and
                        one of the joint authorities constituted under Part IV of the Local
                        Government Act 1985.

                 2.   The provisions of the Local Government (Access to Information) Act
                      1985 expressly apply to joint authorities.

                 3.   Accordingly, meetings of joint authorities are open to the public
                      except to the extent that they may be excluded in relation to
                      confidential or exempt information.

                 4.   The agenda of the meeting to be held on the 21st April is plainly
                       intended to be open to the public and there is no indication that the
                      item of business is to be treated as an exempt item, and the public,
                      press and local authority officers may all attend in accordance with
                      the provisions of the Local Government (Access to Information) Act.

                 5.   The situation would only change in the event of a resolution being
                      approved during the course of the item being discussed to exclude
                      the public from the meeting by reference to the likelihood of disclosure
                      of exempt information as defined in the list of statutory exemptions
                      scheduled to the Act. In that event which appears unlikely the public
                      and press would have to leave the meeting and any officers of the
                      constituent authorities would also be required to leave unless the
                      Police Committee at its discretion determined that particular parties
                      should be allowed to remain in the meeting.

                 Questions at the Meeting of the Police Authority

                 1.   A consideration of questions and reports at a meeting of the Police
                      Authority needs to be considered against the background of the
                      tripartite structure of the police service under the provisions of the
                      Police Act 1964 whereby responsibilities are shared between the
                      Home Secretary, the Police Authority and the Chief Constable. This
                      provides a statutory framework although many areas remain undefined
                      and unclear.
The only reference in the 1964 Act to questions on police matters
is in Section 11 and relates to a different situation. It is provided
that arrangements shall be made for enabling questions on the discharge
of the functions of the Police Authority to be put in the course of
the proceedings of a constituent Council by members of that Council
for answer by a member of the Council who is also a member of the
Police Authority. This of course is the reverse situation where the
representatives on the Police Authority are required to answer
questions rather than enabled to ask them.

Section 12 of the Act deals with the related matter of reports by
chief constables and in addition to the annual report it is provided
that the chief constable shall whenever so required by the Police
Authority submit to that Authority a report in writing on such matters
as may be specified in the requirement being matters connected with
the policing of the area. However, if it appears to the chief constable
that a report in compliance with any such requirement of the Police
Authority would contain information which in the public interest
ought not to be disclosed, or is not needed for the discharge of the
functions of the Police Authority, he may request that Authority
to refer the requirement to the Secretary of State; and in any such
case the requirement shall be of no effect unless it is confirmed by
the Secretary of State.

Questions and reports therefore need to be considered in the context
of the matters to which they relate and the chief constable, in answering
questions is likely to confine himself to issues which are related to
the functions of the Police Authority and not functions which are
assigned to chief constables. This leads to a consideration of those
respective functions.

Police Authority functions are set out in Section 4 of the 1964 Act
and begin with a general duty of the Police Authority "to secure the
maintenance of an adequate and efficient police force for the area,
and to exercise for that purpose the powers conferred on a Police
Authority by this Act". There follows a list of various more specific
duties relating to such matters as the appointment of the chief
constable and buildings, structures and premises, vehicles, apparatus,
clothing and other equipment. The general broad duty in relation
to an adequate and efficient force is not further defined and is not
sufficiently specific to lend itself to legal enforcement. It is noted
from a publication by the National Council for Civic Liberties entitled
"Called to Account" that the following statement is made in relation
to reports submitted by chief constables:-

     "if the police authority receives a report from its chief constable
     with which it is dissatisfied, it is given no powers to instruct
     him to change any of his operational policing policies or
     practices."

The conflict arises when we turn to the functions of chief constables
under Section 5 of the Act. This provides that the police force
maintained for a police area shall be "under the direction and control
of the chief constable". In furtherance of this provision and related-
case law Halsbury’s Laws of England describes the general functions
of chief constables in the following terms:-

     "it is the duty of a chief officer of police to secure the
     preservation of the Queen’s peace and the enforcement of the
     law in his area, and he is responsible for the disposition and
     control of his force. As respect such operational matters he
                               -   3   -




           acts on his own responsibility and may not be given instructions
          by either his police authority or a minister of the Crown".

7.   The following extract from the NCCL publication offers some further
     insight into these functional arrangements:-
          "The government believed that it was possible to draw a
          distinction between administrative/financial decisions, which
          could be made by the police authority, and 'operational' decisions,
          which should be made by the chief constable. It wrote this
          distinction into the Act as responsibility for 'efficiency* and
          'direction and control’ respectively. It was accepted that locally
          and nationally elected representatives should make financial
          decisions because of their responsibility to the rate/tax payers
          to spend their money wisely. But there was no recognition
          in the Act that many other police decisions are political and
          therefore ought also to be made by elected representatives.

          The government's stated intention was to leave it to the chief
          constable's discretion how he enforced the law. It was hoped
          that police authorities would give their chief constables advice
          but they were given no authority to tell them what to do. This
          relationship is, as the Royal Commission on the Police had
          recommended it should be, the reverse of that between other
          local government committees and their chief officers. The
          Royal Commission devised a unique formula to place chief
          officers 'under a degree of external supervision' while .'preserving
          their impartiality': this was to give them the power to decide
          how to enforce the law but to make them liable to give an account
          of (some of) their actions afterwards to their police authority
          and the Home Secretary. The formula was embodied in the
          Act and, as the Home Office sees it:

                the system which now exists for controlling the police
                thus involves the inter-relationship of three authorities
                - the Home Secretary, the local police authorities and
                the chief officers of police - in a complex relationship
                which ensures that except in respect of day-to-day
                operations, no one of the three has absolute control".

8.   An added dimension in the current context is that of the judicial
     inquiry which has been called for by the Home Secretary. In addition
     to any reservations the chief constable may have in answering questions
     which he sees as relating to operational matters he may argue with
     some force that it is not in the public interest to touch upon any
     matters which are within the broad scope of the judicial inquiry.
     I am not clear about the precise terms or statutory context of the
     judicial inquiry and therefore am in some doubt as to what would
     be seen as prejudicial to those proceedings. There is nevertheless
     some strength in the argument that nothing should be said which
     would in any way prejudice the conduct of the proceedings of the
     judicial inquiry. In the context of the 1964 Act it may be useful to
     draw attention to Section 32 which makes provision for local inquiries
     and allows the Secretary of State to cause a local inquiry to be held
     by a person appointed by him into any matter connected with the
     policing of any area. This provision is in the broader context of the
     Secretary of State's central supervision and direction of the police
     service and accordingly the com m ents made by the Secretary of State
     may have some weight in that regard in constraining the chief constable
     from answering questions on matters within the purview of the judicial
     inquiry.
The above notes are very much an initial summary of points arising from
the questions raised and do not purport to be exhaustive as it is recognised
that there are delicate finely balanced arguments in relation to such issues
as any directions which the police authority may give in a policy context
extending beyond financial and administrative directions. I have intentionally
concentrated - my focus on the essence of the statutory provisions. Given
the areas which may be regarded as touching upon operational matters
and the arrangements for a judicial inquiry in broad terms I would expect
chief constable to confine himself. largely to a prepared statement and
to be restrictively cautious in answering questions particularly when they
are raised in a public arena.

   Dear Mr Capper,

   Pitch Perimeter Arrangements - Sheffield United Football Club

   With reference to the meeting which took place at Sheffield United Football
   Club on Wednesday 19th April 1989, pursuant to Derek Dooley’s verbal request
   to David Bownes on the morning of Tuesday 18th April 1989. You will recall
   that Mr Dooley wished to ask the Council for its views on the Club's perimeter
   fencing arrangements.

   You will recall from the meeting that in accordance with comments made by
   your Professional Advisor, Mr Strange, the Officers present felt that it would
   be appropriate for the pitch perimeter gates to be removed. It will be necessary
   for the resulting gaps to be policed and Chief Superintendent Broomhead agreed
   that this would happen.

   The gaps in the perimeter fencing which arise as a result of the removal of the
   gates must be free from any dangerous projections or other obstructions.

   As I have said, the removal of the gates is an interim measure and is subject
   to further consideration of the pitch perimeter arrangements.

   You will also recall from the meeting that the pitch perimeter fencing could
   not be removed at this juncture as it would need to be replaced by a crush barrier
   standard installation. The existing white fence would not fulfil this function.
   Again this view was endorsed by your Advisor, Mr Strange.

   I will be in touch with you again in due course.

PERIMETER FENCES, GATES TO BE REMOVED AT BRAMALL LANE


Following       a    meeting         yesterday        (Wednesday       19     April)         at    Sheffield
United's       Bramall         Lane     Ground        between        Club     Officials           and     their
professional         advisers,        Officers of the South Yorkshire Fire Service,
the    South     Yorkshire           Police     and    the      City       Council,       the      following
statement has been issued.


After discussions with                the Club and        inspection of the Ground it was
agreed by all            parties      that the gates in the perimeter fencing would
be    removed       as    an   interim measure          forthwith          and,     as   a    consequence,
additional       policing        will    be     provided.            The     City    Council        will     be

    NOTES ON THE MEETING WITH BRADFORD AND KENT SOCIAL SERVICES HELD ON 20.A.89

                    Bryan Craig                  David Wilkinson, Kent SS

    1    Discussion centred o n .coramoh problems and issues relevant to events
          at Hillsborough that the visitors had experience. As a result of the
         Bradford Stadium fire and the "Herald" sinking.

    2    David Wilkinson described how trauma experienced by individuals
          puts stress on marital and family relationships, and triggers other
          previous negative experiences and effects of other problems or
          losses.                                    *■

    3    The visitors had adopted a pro-active stance in the provision of
          support and felt this was necessary. Kent informed individuals or
*        families that they would be visiting unless told otherwise. Some
          workers had misgivings about this, and senior staff had to show
          positive commitment and give support to the workers involved.

         There was also a problem, for staff at all levels, in juggling
         with other duties, particularly urgent ones such as child care
         cases etc.

    k    Target groups had been established and work planned accordingly.

         It was suggested that some work with ground staff, on a group basis,
         for example, may be appropriate and imput into schools.

    5    Experience in Kent had shown that established methods of bereavement
         counselling were inappropriate for survivors, in their case crew
         members etc. He passed on a paper "Critical- Incident Stress De­
         briefings" for further information.

    6-   Individuals who were not members of target groups, bereaved,
         injured, workers etc would come forward for assistance.   In
         Sheffield there would be many witnesses experiencing problems
         with"survivor guilt" . David Whitham has been identified as a
         co-ordinator for work with Nottingham people (helpline).

7        It was felt that many people would need .to actually return to the
         scene for support and as part of the grieving process.

8        All the visitors emphasised the length of time that support would
         be necessary; Bradford had a steady stream for 2 years. Some
         people needed time before being able to ask for help. Bradford
         families had told staff that they appreciated that help was there,
         for example social workers being on hand in hospitals, even if
         they had not initially approached them.

         A "Kent Helpline" was run on a round the clock basis for one year.
Events such as inquests and inquiries obviously needed imput,
and anniversaries of the event, as well as personal anniversaries
resulted in many people seeking help.


It was suggested that a well known contact point on a long term
basis would be needed and a designated co-ordinator for keeping
activities going.

Bradford staff had requested that a base with a co-ordinator,
counsellors and clerical support be established. This had not
been forthcoming and subsequently just a co-ordinator had been
appointed "too late".

The co-ordination of activities between the various agencies
and organisations was a key issue and early planning was essential.

In the Kent disaster, people were affected from all over the
country.  "Home and away teams" were established there, and the
away team carried out visits in outside areas before referring
them on to local services.

David Wilkinson recommended full discussion and a gradual break
of support, where appropriate, for the well-being of the supporter
and supported.

Kent had held a get together termed "the wake" three months after
the sinking which helped people involved to "make the break".

With regard to longer term support, the visitors thought
that this could possibly be provided by the voluntary sector,
perhaps giving the public a more acceptable face as contact
point.

It was suggested that discussion with front line staff from the
other authorities would be helpful for social workers here, and
this will be followed up.

The transfer of information is important. Kent had a Newsletter,
and the council paper could be used to reach a wide audience, and
give information on events here and in Liverpool.

The Bradford workers recommended the formation of a data base and
designated staff with the express role of collecting and collating
information.

Action of the media had previously caused problems such as
harassment of relatives at inquests etc but it could also be a
useful mouthpiece. After initial problems, the Bradford local
press had been helpful, with the transfer of information etc.

There is a pattern of blanket coverage at the time of the
disaster, at inquests, anniversaries etc, otherwise the event
is soon forgotten by the National media but it is worth
cultivating the local media. ■
The inquiries in Bradford and Kent had not had sc much impact
as the inquests.  It was thought that this may not be the case here.

The inquest into the Herald disaster was held 9 months afterwards
and lasted 3J weeks.  Counsellors were available throughout and
where possible continuity of involvement was maintained.

The families had grouped together in their search for "guilty
parties" both groups - the company and individuals - certain crew
members.  Support workers had to deal with this anger and distress
on behalf of all the parties involved.

A particular issue was that graphic descriptions and details of
the deaths, some previously unknown to the families had emerged,
although in Kent there had been prior meetings with the Coroner's
staff. It is important that information is sought prior to the
inquest so that families may be more adequately prepared.
                                           <.


In Bradford, a doctor was available to give medical details of
deaths. Some relatives requested this a considerable time after­
wards.



In Bradford there had been difficulties when support workers had
become involved with financial compensation claims, and it was
recommended that the counselling role of workers be kept separate
from the one of advocacy.




David Wilkinson described how compensation was sometimes a final
part of the mourning process, but it did raise its own problems.

Families may be aggrieved at how funds are allocated and within
the family unit there may be disputes as to how the grant be
divided.

With regard to the removal of tributes at the ground, it was
agreed that a link with Anfield be looked into.

The three visitors offered to return to Sheffield for further
discussion, and are also willing to be contacted by phone.

           EMOTIONAL SHOCK - REACTIONS TO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

           Attached is a copy of a leaflet produced by Bradford Social Services
           after the fire at Bradford City Football Ground.

           I have changed only the date and have distributed it widely among F&CS
           staff who have been involved in working with relatives and other people
           who have been bereaved or directly involved in the events of Saturday
           afternoon.  I decided to distribute it as soon as I became aware that
           many F&CS staff were experiencing and showing similar reactions.

           Having seen some of the reactions of members of the Council I wonder
           whether you think it would be useful to let Councillors have a copy of
           it? or staff of                                    been involved?  If so
           F&CS can supply

A new survey method which can help you identify what people
really want and what their priorities are.



What are its uses?

       It can be used by a Council service to help them sort
       out what their customer's priorities are.

       It can be used in a local community, or with specific
       sections of the population to help them identify what
       their needs really are.

       It can be used to find out the views of people who don't
       normally get listened to - whether inside the Council or
       in the Community.

*       It can be used within a Council department to help staff
       focus on ways of being more effective in their work.

*       It can be used to help staff focus on ways of tackling
       issues that cross departmental boundaries.

*      .It can be used in any .organisation* large or small, to
       help them prioritise the use of scarce resources




What makes it different to other survey methods?

*      It avoids leading questions.

*      It encourages people to think positively.

*       It helps people to find solutions to their problems.

*       It gives people the power to identify what their   needs
       really are.

*      It ensures that everyone has their say and guarantees that
       minority opinions are not overlooked.

*       It produces questionnaires that are easy   to understand and
       quick to fill in.

*      It avoids jargon and can be conducted in the everyday
       language of the people being surveyed.

*       It provides people with information they   can make sense
       of.

*      It uses computer technology to make the survey part of
       the process quick and uncomplicated.
How does it work?

Let's say a school wants to find out the views of their parents
on how to improve the school.

More traditional market research survey would use questions
phrased beforehand either by   the school or    by   marketresearch
professionals. These questions may or may not be the ones that
parents actually want to be asked.   For example they might ask
them to tick boxes indicating their satisfaction (or not) with an
existing facility - eg the teaching of languages, sporting
facilities or school meals. While such methods can be good for
building up a picture of what people think about how an existing
service is provided, they do not provide many concrete ideas on
how to improve it in the future.

Priority Search approaches the problem in quite a different
manner.

   Firstly the client commissioning the survey (in this case a
   school) decides on Just one 'open question' which they want
   to ask of their customers   (in this case parents).

   Such a question would be:

                                 How can we improve our school?
   In stage two a cross-section grouping of about 20 parents are
   brought together for a couple of hours.  During this time they
   are taken through a process which helps them to focus on
   'solutions' to the open question. The way the session is run
   ensures that everyone has their say. Those with more power or
   confidence aren't allowed to dominate.

   In the third stage the group's 'solutions' are entered into
   the computer.  A questionnaire is produced minutes later.   All
   the 'solutions' are listed several times down either side of
   each page. The person being surveyed is asked to balance each
   'solution' in turn with the one opposite.

   The illustration below shows a completed questionnaire.    The
   position of the dot on each line indicates the balance of
   preference that person feels about each pair of solutions in
   turn.   I-------- -- -------- --------------------- — t— i

In practice this method is easy to follow and quick to complete.
No knowledge of computers, statistics or any other specialism is
necessary. Anything up to 300 people can be surveyed with the
same questionnaire.                            :_ • •-
                  What does it produce?

                 Once all the questionnaires have been completed they are 'scored',
                 by the computer.  In a complex mathematical equation every
                 preference from every line on every questionnaire is weighted
                 against every other one. What comes out is the 'solutions' in
                 the order of priority felt to be important by all the people
                 surveyed.  The system can further break this information down to
                 show the priorities of different categories. The illustration
                 below shows what the 'top ten' priorities of parents, broken down
                 year by year could be:
                                                                                   Parent* of   Parents of   Parents of   Parents of   Parents of   Parents or

Dear Lord Justice Taylor

I am sorry you are having to come to Sheffield in such tragic circumstances.

I do, however, want to offer the full co-operation      of   all   officers   of
Sheffield City Council to help in your investigation.

I am sure you will be contacting the appropriate officers directly to engage
their assistance, but if there is anything I personally can do, please do not
hesitate to let me know.


Yours sincerely




CLIVE BETTS
Leader of the Council

Dear Graham

Please let me know if there is anything at all extra that I personally or the
Council can do to help at this time.

I do appreciate the tremendous pressure that you personally must be under and
I know from talking to council officers the enormous respect they    have for
the way you have acted on behalf of Sheffield and the Club during thelast
two or three traumatic days.

Please, however, do not try and take on all the responsibility without asking
for help or assistance.  If you want to talk about anything, please give me a
ring.

We are all thinking about you at this very difficult   time and are   trying   to
appreciate the pressures and the strains you must be   under.

Yours sincerely

Dear Bert

I am trying to understand the enormous suffering and grief you personally
must be going through at this time. I know what Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club means to you and how this disaster must have hit you personally.  Please
let me know if there is anything at all that either myself or the Council can
do to be of further assistance.

Is there    any way our social work staff can help? I know they were already
at    the Club trying to support the ground staff and other people who lived
through the traumatic happenings of Saturday. We are all thinking about you
at   thispoint in time and appreciate the way you have represented the Club
andthe City, while at the same time going through your own personal trauma.

Please let me know if there is anything we can do to help.

Yours sincerely

  Dear Councillor Betts

  On behalf of Derbyshire County Council m a y I express to you our
  deepest sympathy at the tragic events that took place at
  Hillsborough Football ground last Saturday.

  We share with you the numbness and shock that the people of
  Sheffield, Nottingham and Liverpool must be feeling at this
  time.  I like so man y others am stunned by the scale of this
  disaster and feel heartbroken that the loss of so m any young
  lives who travelled to see what should have been a happy
  sporting occasion.

  Our condolences go to all those families touched by this
  tragedy, and sadly the deaths include two young people from
  Derbyshire.

  Whilst there is little anyone can say to help the suffering of
  those affected I am sure we all pray that this dreadful event
  is never repeated.

   I know that all the local authorities are co-operating to give
   all the help and assistance they can and I know the County
   Council has sent an incident team of special social workers to
   Sheffield to offer counselling and support services.

  The County Council has also contributed £25,000 to the
  Hillsborough Disaster Appeal that has been established and  I
  am also launching a special appeal to the people of Derbyshire
  to collect contributions to the Disaster Fund.

   I hope that our efforts can go some way to ease the pain and
   suffering of those affected by this most tragic event.

  Yours sincerely

               Dear Member

               SPECIAL MEETING OF THE POLICE AUTHORITY

               The A u th o rity ’ s Meeting on Friday has been called to give the Chief Constable
               the opportunity of ta lk in g to, and answering the questions of members, about the
               tr a g ic events at Hillsborough la s t Saturday.

               The media have been informed of the Meeting in the usual way and therefore
               members can, I think, express a very large Press contingent in attendance on
               Friday.  I think members can also expect the Press to exert considerable
               pressure fo r comments and statements and I wish to take th is opportunity to warn
               members of the need fo r circumspection in the responses they make.

               The independent Enquiry to be carried out by Lord Justice Taylor does place
               c e rta in constraints on members as well as the Chief Constable. There is a very
               fin e dividing lin e between legitim ate discussion of a matter of great public
               in te re s t and the ris k of prejudicing that independent Enquiry and I would ask
               members to have th is very much in mind when responding to the Press about the
               events of la s t Saturday.

Dear Member

I have no doubt that you w i ll have been as shocked as I was by the tragedy at
Hillsborough on Saturday. I enclose a copy of the press statement I have made
available on behalf of the Authority expressing our sorrow and concern.

The role of the Police Authority at th is juncture is of course extremely
lim ite d . Nonetheless the Chief Constable has expressed a wish to make a formal
report to the f u l l Authority and I have therefore agreed tha t a special meeting
should be held before the s t a r t of th is Friday’ s Finance and General Purposes
Committee meeting. A copy of a formal notice is enclosed.

You w i ll appreciate tha t the Chief Constable’ s report can only be of a very
r e s tr ic te d nature because of the establishment of the public enquiry which was
announced th is afternoon by the Home Secretary.

Yours sincerely


      JACK

     RESOLVED -

     1. That the Minutes of the meeting of the       Committee held on     20 January1989
        be signed by the Chairman as a correct       record.

     2. That, whilst recognising the d i f f i c u l t i e s in reporting to the Committee
        at the present time on the anticipated costs of policing the World
        Student Games, the officers be authorised to have discussions with the
        officers of the Sheffield City Council in an e f f o r t to avoid duplication

        Financial O ffic e r, in consultation with the Chairman and Vice-Chairman,
        be authorised to take such action as may be considered to be
        appropriate.

3.   REVENUE MONITORING

     A j o i n t report of the Clerk and Financial O fficer and the Chief  Constable
     was submitted showing the budget position as at 16 February       and giving
     details of the major causes of variation from the anticipated level of
     spending.

     The single s ig n ific a n t variation related to overtime payments fo r, and
     recovery of costs in respect o f, the Prison Officers' Dispute. Provision
     had not been made within the Revised Estimates fo r 1988/89 as, at that
     time, there had not been any clear indication of the lik e l y costs nor of
     the claim which would be acceptable to the Home Office.

     Supplemental to and considered in conjunction with the Revenue Monitoring
     Report was a report of the Clerk and Financial O fficer on a d ra ft code of
     practice for the control of expenditure against approved budgets and
     expenditure decisions on future years' budgets, following concern expressed
     by the South Yorkshire Joint Consultative Committee as part of th e ir
     consideration of Joint Authority Budgets for 1989/90.
RESOLVED:

1. That the contents of the Revenue Monitoring report now submitted be
   noted.

2. That the contents of the supplemental report on Budgets and Budgetary
   Control be noted a t the present time.

CAPITAL MONITORING

A j o i n t report of the Clerk and Financial O ffice r and the Chief Constable
was submitted on a ll capital schemes where payments had been made or were
anticipated during the current financial year.

The report showed the total costs and current year payments as included in
the approved Capital Programme and as now submitted. Variations between
these figures were shown.

The total forecast underspending of £1,489,000 was accounted fo r by
slippage from 1987/88 into 1988/89 and also by slippage into 1989/90 and
future years in respect of Major Schemes.

RESOLVED - That the contents of the Capital Monitoring report now submitted
be noted.

PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

The Clerk and Financial O ffice r submitted a report on the progress being
made on the A uthority's Capital Programme on a scheme by scheme basis.

Attached to the report was a copy of the l e t t e r dated 16 February, 1989
from the Home Office giving Forward Planning approval to the following
Major Schemes:-

Hackenthorpe Sub-Divisional Headquarters        £ 2 .2m

Rotherham Court Link                            £0.2m

RESOLVED - That the contents of the Project Progress report now submitted
be noted.

GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS TO SPECIFY THE MINIMUM ANNUAL CHARGE TO REVENUE FOR
FINANCING- CAPITAL EXPENDITURE

As requested by Minute 8.3 of 20 January 1989, the Clerk and Financial
O ffic e r submitted a report on the Government's proposals to specify the
minimum sums to be set aside in an Authority's annual revenue account to
provide for repayment of c re d it l i a b i l i t i e s .

This was j u s t one of the capital finance provisions of the Local Government
and Housing B i l l . The main one, so f a r as the Police Authority was
concerned, was the proposal to bring Police expenditure within the overall
control system, whereas to date i t had been controlled separately by the
Home O ffice.

The proposals on charges to revenue represented the most s ig n ific a n t of the
B i l l ' s proposals in financial terms, the actual implications depending on
the annual percentage reduction in outstanding balance (which would be
specified by Regulation).
The new proposals would work to the disadvantage of the Authority for two
reasons:-

(i)    The Authority was only created in 1986, and i t s inherited debt was
       refinanced over a period of 35 years. This was s ig n ific a n tly longer
       than the average for most Authorities, and results in a lower than
       average annual principal repayment.

(ii)   The three South Yorkshire Joint Authorities use a 10% annual sinking
       fund basis for charging to revenue. This percentage is higher than
       average and again results in lower than average annual principal
       repayments.

A more detailed presentation on the new financial system, including the
B i l l ' s requirements an capital finance, would be made at the proposed
Financial Planning Seminar to be held in April/May 1989.

RESOLVED: That the contents of the report now submitted be noted at this
stage.

COMPUTER DEVELOPMENTS 1989/90

RESOLVED - That, as requested by the O fficers, consideration of the j o i n t
report of the Chief Constable, the Clerk and Financial O fficer and the
Director of Financial Services of Doncaster MBC on this subject be deferred
to the next meeting of the Committee.

CIVILIAN SUPPORT STAFF

(i)    Catering Employees

       A j o i n t report of the Clerk and Financial O fficer and the Chief
       Constable was submitted on a claim lodged on 30 January, 1989 by
       fu ll- t im e officers of GMBATU and NUPE on behalf of th e ir members in
       the Catering Service of the Police Authority for the payment in lie u
       of holidays held in suspense for employees in service on 31 March
       1982.

       The change in arrangements for the taking of annual leave by Manual
       Workers which had occurred in 1982 was recalled, and the
       implications of responding to the claim were detailed, including the
       s ig n ific a n t implication for the v i a b i l i t y of the in-house Catering
       Service i f the burden of such costs had to be discharged by the
       Service.

       RESOLVED - That the Clerk and Financial O fficer be requested to
       consult with the D is t r ic t Council Personnel Officers as a matter of
       urgency, following which, in view of the time factor and in
       consultation with the Chairman and Vice-Chairman, he be authorised to
       take such action on the claim as may be considered to be
       appropriate.
(i i )   Engineering Craftsmen

         A j o i n t report of the Clerk and Financial O ffic e r and the Chief
         Constable was submitted on a claim lodged in November 1988 by GMB on
         behalf of the Engineering Craftsmen of the Police Authority fo r the
         release of the holiday entitlem ent, including a request for the
         Authority to take account of the individual wishes of the craftsmen
         involved in determining how to release the holidays.

         The change in arrangements fo r the taking of annual leave by Manual
         Workers which had occurred in 1982 was rec a lle d , and the res u lt of
         the questionnaires completed by the 21 craftsmen covered by the
         agreement d etailed , together with the implications of responding to
         the claim.

         RESOLVED - That the Clerk and Financial O ffic e r be requested to
         consult with the D i s t r i c t Council Personnel o f f i c e r s , following which
         a fu rth e r report be submitted fo r consideration by th is Committee.

Grading of Control Room Assistants

A j o i n t report of the Clerk and Financial O ffice r and the Chief Constable
was submitted on the application made in March 1988 by NALGO for the
regrading of a ll c i v i l i a n control room personnel on the grounds th a t, since
the introduction of the computerised Command and Control System on
1 January 1987, the roles of the s t a f f a t Force Headquarters and th e ir
D iv is io n a lly based colleagues were now e s sentially the same.

The report sr-t out d e ta ils of the duties and re s p o n s ib ilitie s of the s t a f f ,
together with a comparison with other Forces, and d e ta ils of an o ffe r made
to NALGO following consultations with the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the
Police Authority. The Union had indicated a willingness to accept the
proposed o f f e r .

The Committee recalled and discussed the Authority's general policy of 22
April 1987 of avoiding the use of linked grades wherever possible.

RESOLVED - That approval be given to the regrading of a ll c i v i l i a n control
room personnel to grade Scale 2/3 plus 2 increments with e f f e c t from 1
January 1987 a t an estimated cost (including arrears) of £55,200 (£27,000
net a ft e r Police Grant) in 1988/89, such cost to be met from reserves (the
additional costs in 1989/90 to be a f i r s t call on any savings which might
be e ffe c te d ).

Grading of Handymen a t Rotherham DHQ

A j o i n t report of the Chief Constable and the Clerk and Financial O ffic e r
was submitted on the rig h t of appeal exercised by three Handymen a t
Rotherham DHQ following the assimilation of the Authority's manual worker
posts into the new grading structure introduced by the National Joint
Council.

Their duties had accordingly been re-assessed by the Working Party, and
d e ta ils were set out of the im plications, including f in a n c i a l, of the re­
assessment.
RESOLVED - That approval be given to the assimilation of posts BM161,
BM161/1 and BM172, Handymen at the Rotherham Divisional Headquarters, into
Grade 3 retrospective to 1 July, 1982 (when the new national grading
structure had become operative) at an estimated cost (including arrears) of
£1,928 in 1988/89 and met from within the existing provision for salaries
and wages.

Tape Librarians - Rotherham and Sheffield South DHQ's

A j o i n t report of the Chief Constable and the Financial O fficer was
submitted on the need to appoint two further Tape Librarians to meet the
Authority's policy of phased recruitment in order to meet the statutory
requirement for the tape recording of interviews to be in use nationally by
1991.

Provision fo r the two posts was included within the approved budget
developments for 1989/90.

RESOLVED - That approval be given to the establishment and f i l l i n g by 1
July, 1989 of two posts of Tape Librarian, Grade Scale 3, to be based a t
the Rotherham and Sheffield South Divisional Headquarters a t an estimated
cost in 1989/90 of £12,500 (£6,100 net of Police Grant).

Recruitment - Advertising

As requested by Minute 6.2 of 21 October 1988, a j o i n t report of the Chief
Constable and the Clerk and Financial O fficer was submitted on how best the
advertising of c iv il ia n post vacancies in minority languages also could be
achieved.

The report set out the present arrangements, and details of journals
attracting ethnic minority readership which circulated nationally,
including th e ir advertising rates.

As well as the additional cost of advertising simultaneously in both the
local press and in Asian languages in ethnic minority newspapers,
additional budgetary provision would be required to introduce measures to
overcome work place d i f f i c u l t i e s (such as basic communication and safety
arrangements) which might be encountered by a candidate who was not able to
respond to English language advertisements.

RESOLVED - That, in view of practical and financial considerations, general
information regarding c iv ilia n employment opportunities in the South
Yorkshire Police be published for a t r i a l period in minority languages for
circulation to the relevant D is t r ic t Ethnic Minority Organisations.

REIMBURSEMENT OF TRAVELLING EXPENSES

A j o i n t report of the Chief Constable and the Clerk and Financial O fficer
was submitted recalling the acceptance by the Police Authority on 11
November 1988 of the Committee's recommendation of 21 October 1988 on the
policy to be adopted in order to implement the new agreement of the Police
Negotiating Board relating to reimbursement of tra v e llin g expenses of
occasional non-authorised car users.
The policy provided fo r a financial appraisal by the Committee on a
quarterly basis, as well as the continued monitoring a t Divisional level
required by Force Standing Orders, and the report set out the necessary
d e ta ils .

However i t was pointed out that subsequent to the making of the policy
decision, Home Office Circular 95/1988 had been issued. Amongst other
things, th is C ircular indicated that w h ils t the C iv il Service Public
Transport Rate (used previous to the new agreement of the Police
Negotiating Board) would, as stated,     no longer be no tifie d to Police
A uthorities, a s im ilar reimbursement rate for 'ad hoc' car users could
appropriately be established by local agreement.

Accordingly negotiations had taken place with the Police S ta ff Associations
in South Yorkshire, and details of a proposed rate were set out. In the
event of approval, the previously reported annual cost increase of £76,650
would be reduced by an estimated sum of £24,000.

RESOLVED - That, in view of the change in circumstances now reported, i t be
a recommendation to the Police Authority that the policy set out in Minute
8 of 21 October 1988 be amended to the extent that the South Yorkshire
Police adopt the minimum point of the essential user scale in Police
Regulations for vehicles between 1000 and 1200 cc used for less than
11,000 miles per annum (currently 2 0 .2p per mile) as the appropriate
reimbursement in respect of journeys undertaken by o ffic e r s , not being
regularly authorised car users, who undertake 'ad hoc' journeys in th e ir
private vehicles in accordance with Force Standing Orders and the following
conditions in pa rtic u lar:

a)    Journeys must not be made in the o ffic e rs own vehicle i f a police
       vehicle is available or they can travel as a passenger in another
       o f f i c e r 's vehicle see (b) below.

b)    Officers using th e ir own vehicles must, i f requested to do so,
      convey passengers.

c)    Public transport must be used i f i t is as convenient and expeditious
      as an o f f i c e r 's own vehicle.

d)    The motor vehicle must be insured under a policy of insurance as
       outlined in Standing Order 11J Paragraph 7c.

DEVELOPMENT BUDGET 1989/90 - PROVISION OF EXPLOSIVE DETECTION DOG


1      Matter f o r consideration

        To consider and approve the development                                        of     the     explosive
        detection c a p a b ility of the Force.

2      Background information

        At a meeting of the Authority on 10 February 1989, in considering
        and approving the Revenue Estimates and Capital Programme
        proposals fo r the fin a n c ia l year 1989/ 90, the Authority resolved
        "to approve th e          implem entation of the s p e c i f i c budget
        developments id e n t if ie d in the l i s t now c ir c u la te d " . One such
        development l is t e d was the provision of an additional explosive
        detection dog.

3      Comments

        The Force cu rre n tly has three police dogs which are s p e cia lly
        trained in the detection of explosives and i t is considered th at
        a fourth dog is required to achieve s a tis fa c to ry c a p a b ility in
        th is important area of work.                 The dogs, which need to be
        inte n s iv e ly and re g u la rly t ra in e d , are deployed in   pairs in
        operational circumstances and can only work e f f e c t i v e l y for short
        periods without r e s t .       When not deployed to s p e c ia lis t duties
        they remain with t h e i r handler who also operates a general
        purpose dog for normal patrol duties.

        A su itab le dog, a black Labrador, has been id e n t if ie d and can be
        obtained by donation a t no cost.

4      Financial implications

        Whilst the id e n t if ie d dog can be obtained a t no cost there are
        costs associated with i n i t i a l t r a in i n g , equipment, maintenance
        and handler allowances which are estimated a t 11000 in the
        current year, implementation of which was approved as stated
        above.

5      Recommendation

        The Committee is recommended to approve the acquisition of the
        black Labrador dog mentioned.

VEHICLE PURCHASES - REPLACEMENT PROGRAMME 1989/90


1       Matter fo r consideration

        To consider and approve the programme fo r the replacement of
        vehicles on the Force f l e e t during the fin a n c ia l year 1989/ 90.

2      Background information

        At a meeting on 10 February 1989 The Authority approved the
        Revenue Budget and Capital Programme provisions fo r the year
        1989/ 90. At th at meeting i t was reported, a t Appendix D and E of
        the relevant Agenda paper, t h a t a s ig n ific a n t reduction would be
        made in the planned Vehicle Replacement Programme in order to
        achieve the revenue budget savings required by the Authority.

3      Comments

        The imposed f in a n c ia l constraints have necessitated a reduction
        in the projected 121 vehicles due fo r replacement under the
        accepted vehicle replacement p o licy.             The revised programme
        proposes the replacement of 41 vehicles w ithin the current f l e e t
        of 544 authorised vehicles.            I t should, however, be recognised
        t h a t , allowing fo r a sound, preventive maintenance policy, the
        retention of 80 units beyond t h e i r 'calculated normal economic
        life w ill      in e v ita b ly generate additional maintenance costs.
        These p o te n tia l additional costs cannot r e a d ily be quantified due
        to the lack of relevant costing data associated with the
        operation and maintenance of small fam ily saloons beyond a
        120,000 mile threshold, and larg er saloons beyond a 160,000 mile
        threshold.      At such mileages i t must be expected th a t expensive
        corrective maintenance w i l l be necessary i f the vehicles are to
        continue to give r e l i a b l e service in the demanding police
        environment.

        The revised replacement programme is produced on the premise
        th a t , throughout the fin a n c ia l year, f l e x i b i l i t y of operation
        w i l l permit engineering decisions to be taken with regard to the
        prudence or v i a b i l i t y of e i t h e r the economic r e p a i r or
        replacement of individual vehicles which would have featured in a
        normal replacement programme.         These decisions w i l l be taken in
        conjunction with a core programme of replacement as follows:
                                    - 2 -

                     Total units            41

     In order to allow appropriate purchases to be made in accordance
     with t h i s schedule, i t is suggested t h a t f in a n c ia l approval be
     given, subject to tenders being sought and presented- to the
     A uthority fo r consideration a t fu r th e r meetings and to the
     acknowledgement of the need fo r some f l e x i b i l i t y w ith in the
     Revenue Estimates in order to allow e i t h e r r e p a ir or replacement
     of individ ual vehicles which would require the A u th o rity 's
     approval to tenders fo r such replacements or to a diversion of
     funds to cover the costs of major items of maintenance.

4   Financial implications

     The estimated cost of the proposed replacement programme, net of
     sales, is 1380, 000.  the sum of 1500,400 is included w ithin the
     approved Capital Programme f o r 1989/90 fo r the purchase of
     vehicles (Item 66 ) . Revenue Estimate provision f o r the purchase
     of vehicles included w ithin th a t t o t a l is 1418, 800, which takes
     account of an estimated sum of 181,600 by way of the proceeds of
     sale of the replaced veh icles.

5   Recommendation

     1     The provisional replacement programme as stated above
     2     A Capital Estimate of 1500, 400, and
     3     Approval in p r in c ip le to the diversion     of monies from the
            Revenue Estimate provision f o r the D irect Revenue Financing
            of vehicle purchases        ( 1418, 800) to Vehicle Repair and
            Maintenance subject to fu r th e r reports being submitted to the

Approval was in f a c t obtained on 19th December 1988 but the " L e t t e r of In te n t" was
not issued as the r e p o r t seeking approval to a c a p ita l estimate f o r the proposed new

A u th o rity approved a c a p it a l estimate and the i n v i t a t i o n of tenders (Paper EE).

brunt of the Provisional IRA's savage
campaign; 33 soldiers, including
members of the Ulster Defence Regi­

   Two atrocities alone accounted for
fourteen deaths. Eight soldiers were
murdered whilst not on operational
duty as they were returning from
leave to their base in Tyrone. A road­

soldiers who had just participated in
a charity fun run in Lisburn were kill­

   Six members of the Royal Ulster

murdered by terrorists and many
more were injured, some to suffer
for the rest of their lives.

well-being of employees.

Leader of Sheffield City Council,

Dear Councillor Betts,

As a supporter of Liverpool Football Club and a member of Liverpool
City Council, I am writing to express my deep gratitude to the
people of Sheffield for their generous hospitality in offering the
use of their telephones and for providing cups of tea and help
and friendship to people like myself who were caught up in the
tragic events of Saturday last.

I am certain that no-one attaches any blame to the people of
Sheffield and I hope that out of this tragedy  our two respective
communities have moved even closer together.

With best wishes,




Councillor Peter Millea.

Dear Leader,
          Reference to the weekends tragedy at Hillsborough,  I would
like to express my feelings for such a dreadful incident and I am very
sorry for what has occurred.

          As a keen Fundraiser for Local Charities and major incidents
like  the Kings Cross Fire Disaster,  I feel that I can raise quite a
lot of money for the Hillsborough Appeal.

          What   I would like to do is ask your kind permission for me
to have   Hillsborough Park for the day to set up a Appeal   Concert in
aid of the Hillsborough Tragedy,   one Saturday Weekend in June to suit
you, I have contacts with many different Bands, Stalls, Funfairs, etc.

          I have experience of setting up such Fundraising Events,     I
like your help to carry out this proposal,   what the day will   consist
of is a large stage built by scaffolders,   a Funfair,   several  stalls
such asTombola, Pick a Teddy,   Sweets, Hotdogs etc etc.

          I will   contact the bands etc who would be    interested in
doing  this benefit free of charge for the Appeal,   once I get    your
approval  for such an event.   This type of event will raise   lots of
money and it will also be a day out for many people, I can assure you.

          Once again I am very sorry for what has happened,  I am very
concerned and I need to do something to help in a good natured way  to
raise money for your Appeal.

          Please would you    contact  me by letter  as   soon    as    you
possible can and hope that you can approve my proposal.


                         Yours sincerely

BILES:            But many clubs fin d maj or improvements to their
gro un ds impossible, as the C h a i r m a n of Sheffield United,.Ray
Brealey, well remembers fr o m nine years ago.

BREALEY:             We decided that our stadium needed a lot of
mo ne y sp en di ng on it and the best thing to do was to
redesign.           We called in architects, and prepared a very
go o d scheme, which was about 2 0 m il li on pounds, and it was
tu rned down.       It's as simple as that.

BILES:                   Why?

BREALEY:                 (Sigh)      Two words - political bigotry.

BILES:                   And what is the position now?

BREALEY:            We spent a lot of money on the ground,
repairing, so to speak, and made the ^est of a bad job, but
we h a v e a very good ground;  we have the s a f e t W certificates,
and w e made the best of wh a t w e ’ve got.        i

BILES:              Ho w different w o u l d the n e w stadium have been
if i t h a d gone ahead?

BREALEY:                  It was designed to be a sort of Wembley of
the North.            It would- have- had an eight lane athletics track
a r ou nd the inside, and it h ad all kinds of sporting facilities
u n d e r n e a t h the stadium.     U n d e r ne at h the stands, the snooker rooms
w h er e tournaments could take place.                  It really was a sporting
c o m p l e x - pa i d for by the commercial enterprise w h i c h was
a r o u n d the perimiter of the stadium.

BILES:                 Ironically, a n e w sports stadium, with a
ca pa ci ty of 4 0 .000 is to be built in Sheffield.      Purpose built

 have a ticket or weren’t asked to show one.”
    A 30-year-old BR worker from West Derby

 could have happened. I’ve never known police
 open a gate to allow fans into a ground which
 is already packed to the rafters.”

          DELAYED ENTRY CAUSED
          A FATAL SURGE RY FANS
  TH E DECISION by many fans to
  stay outside H illsborough and
  soak up the sunshine and atmos­
  phere cost them their lives.
    Just 15 minutes before the game was
; due to start police estimate there were
  still 2,000 Liverpool outside the ground                                                                        wm m
  at the Leppings Lane end.
       Fearful of problems as kick-off approached
     officers opened locked metal doors next to the
   jturnstiles and spectators poured through
   ^Gangway 2 with fatal consequences.
       Fans began arriving in Sheffield mid morn­
   ing, but by 2pm there were still plenty of gaps
     on the terraces.

       “I thought it was unusual that five steps
     behind a corner flag at the Liverpool end were
     empty yet it was packed behind the goal. The
   ^distribution of fans seemed all wrong.”

       Lifelong Liverpool fan Kevin Mulvaney,
   •who was outside the Leppings Lane stand with

  5alone from Liveipool on the early train, said
  • many fans had just come along on the day
  ?hoping to get in.

 I “Nothing like this has happened before.”
      The gateman, who has not been named, was
 t asked if the action of the police opening tha
 ;; gate led to the crush which caused this disaster..
 ; He replied: “That is my opinion. Yes. I got
 -upset about it. When I came out of my turnstile
    there were people dead and I saw them.

  of him, despite desperate attempts to pull him from the
  crowd.
    When the fans managed to escape the ground, they
, went to the Fox pub, in Fox Hill Road, Fox Hill,
  Sheffield, to make tearful phone back home assuring
  relatives they were safe.
    Many paced about, separated from their friends,
  wondering whether their pals were alive or dead.
                          ‘Why us?’
       Before the match, they had filled they pub and sat
    outside, singing happily in the sun. There had been no
    hint of trouble, despite 96 barrels of lager being drunk
    and a similar about of beer. Only five glasses were
    broken all day — and all by accident.
       M r Buck said: “ When they left, they were so happy
    and really looking forward to a good game. A lot of
    them left their cars here and came back. They were in
    tears. No-one could believe what had happened.
       “ We had been closed by the police, but I opened up
    again so they could use the phone and ring their fami­
    lies. After the relief came the anger. Loads of them
    showed me their tickets. The stubs had not been taken
    off.
       “They said the police just opened the gates and they
    all flooded in. They were saying: ‘Why us, why us?
    Not again’.”

      In order to simplify any new designs of catch for pitch perimeter gates and
      bearing in mind the fact that there should be no spectators in front of the
      opening sections of the perimeter fencing, test loading on perimeter fences
      could be reduced to, say 3 Kn/m.

      Estimation of >pace Capacity - Terraces

      Under the present "guide", terraces in good condition can be calculated as
      capable of holding a maximum of 54 persons per 10 m 2 , throughout the
      available terraced area.  It is, however, accepted that some parts of that
      area are "peak viewing areas" and as such will achieve in practice a greater
      population density due to their popularity.  Ihe figure of 54/10 m 2 is
      therefore an average, without the peak viewing parts being given a maximum
      packing density.

      It is considered that the 54/10 m 2 should be treated as being the ma ximum
      and therefore only be applied to the areas of peak viewing.   Other areas o
      the terrace should be calculated as having a lower packing density, say
      40/10 m 2 .
                                                                                     ?
      In order to practically achieve the consideration set out in the above
      paragraph, it would be necessary to:-

      (a)   Define the size and position of "peak viewing areas".

      (b)   Surround the areas of "peak viewing" using radial barriers.

      (c)   Calculate the maximum population of each "peak viewing area" and
            adequately steward to see that this is not exceeded.

      Flow Rates

      Throughout the Inquiry, the flow rate of 40 and 60 persons per minute per
      unit of exit width have been heavily criticised as being based on,
      inconclusive research.   A practical lesson that has been learned is that
      wh en people are very tightly packed, their ability to flow through exits is
      dramatically reduced. Until the outcome of further research is known, it is
      suggested that flow rates are reduced to the following:-

      (a)   "Peak viewing area" of terraces - 30 persons per minute per unit of
            exit width.
      (b)   All other areas - 40 persons per minute per unit of exit width.

      It is considered that the emergency evacuation time should remain at 2b
      minutes.

12.   Stewards

      Training of Stewards should be carried out by people who have experience in
      training and safety. Training should be regular to remind existing Stewards
      of procedures and ensure that new Stewards receive appropriate training.

      The acceptable age range for Stewards should be specified as being between
      eighteen and sixty five years, in addition to the current requirements
      relating to fitness etc.

      A Steward (or a police officer) carrying out isolated tasks, e.g.  external
      gate duty, should be provided with an efficient means of communication with
      the Safety Officer.
13.   n a tio n a l F i r s t Aid G uid elines

      There is the need for national first aid guidelines which are drawn up with
      particular reference to occasions when large numbers of people are likely to
      be present, e.g.   football Batches, pop concerts etc.

14.   Counselling and Support for Victims

      The need for guidance and training for those professionals involved in
      counselling and support for victims in the aftermath of a disaster requires
      investigation.

      In conjunction with that, the issue of long term support needed by victims
      of the disaster, also requires consideration.

      Both issues need         to be discussed by a variety of agencies including:-

      Social Services, The Health Service (including G P s ) , organisations assisting
      the bereaved, Samaritans etc.

15.   Public Appeals

      The legal issues surrounding public appeals are complicated, e.g. charitable
      status, tax etc.  Guidelines are required on the establishment,
      administration and termination of disaster appeals to ensure that funds are
      distributed as fairly, quickly and effectively as possible.

16.   Football Membership Schemes - I.D. Cards

      The Popplewell Report recommends (at paragraph 4.128) that consideration
      should be given to some form of membership scheme for football league clubs
      in England and Wales.

      However, in view of the experiences at Hillsborough, careful consideration
      needs to be given to any national football membership scheme.  It would
      clearly be undesirable if any such scheme resulted in significant delays at
      turnstiles.

      There are other practical considerations which must be taken into account,
      e.g., patterns of attendance, different method of entry, space required for
      a complex admission system, i.e., two turnstile systems, number of
      turnstiles required, Additional policing/stewarding required to control the
      crowd and eject individuals, where to eject individuals from and how,
      reducing further the ground capacity.

17.   All Ticket Entry

      In order to increase the speed of ingress of spectators, consideration could
      be given to requiring all ticket entry for events where greater than, say,
      70% of the total available capacity could be expected.

18.   All Seater Stadia

      Consideration should be given to whether all seater stadia should be
      mandatory.  Alternatively, the legislation could be used to prescribe a
      minimum percentage of seated capacity for stadia.  Such a percentage could
      differ for various sizes, types and uses of the stadia.

                            I N T R O D U   C T I O N




These recommendations and suggestions have been drawn together from

representatives with various interests within Sheffield City Council.



They are submitted having taken time to assess the effect of the

Hillsborough Disaster,   the Inquiry and the Interim Recommendations of Lord

Justice Taylor which are being implemented in Sheffield.
C l a r i f i c a t io n and C o d ific a tio n of L e g is la tio n

If the Inquiry is minded to recommend amendments of or additions to the
existing legislation then the opportunity could be taken to codify and
clarify the legislation.

The provisions, which are currently contained in the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975, the Fire Safety and Safety at Places of Sports Act 1987,
various Regulations and statutory guidance could be remodelled to create one
Act and Regulations (with functional statements) requiring certain standards
to be achieved.

Improvement/Prohibition Notices

The 1975 legislation (as amended) makes provision for the issue of a
Prohibition Notice to the holder of a certificate.  It is suggested that
consideration should be given to including an intermediate course of action.
The Health and Safety at Work, Etc. Act 1974 makes provision of the issue of
Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices.  An Improvement Notice requires
the employer to carry out certain works within a given time.  If the
employer fails to comply with the Notice, they are guilty of an offence.

The power to issue Improvement Notices would be a useful intermediate step
where a Prohibition Notice is not appropriate, but where some formal Notice
is required.

Periodic Certificates and Inspections

The Popplewell Report recommended (at paragraph 3.68) that there should be
(i) annual renewal of safety certificates issued under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975; (ii) a duty on the local authority annually to inspect the
premises prior to re-issuing the certificate; and (iii) power for the local
authority to revoke the certificate.

The interim recommendations compliment the first proposal; the second
recommendation was implemented in statutory guidance after the Popplewell
Report; the third recommendation has not been acted upon.

With regard to the first recommendation, annual certificates focus the
parties' minds on the whole situation and not on a particular application or
inspection.  It tends to promote an overall review of the circumstances
surrounding the re-issue of a certificate.

With regard to the second recommendation, it is suggested that prior to
re-issuing the certificate there should be an inspection, but that there
should also be inspections on a half-yearly or quarterly basis with guidance
given as to timing, e.g., prior to renewal, end of season, start of season,
during season (obviously this is less relevant to multi-use stadia where
"seasons" are not as clear cut.)

Visits to the ground should be carried out whilst it is empty and during use
but the limitations on "during use" inspections by their very nature must be
recognised.

Model Safety Certificate Conditions

The Popplewell report (paragraph 3.81) suggested that model safety
certificate conditions should be drawn up.  A standardised form of
conditions could form the nucleus of all certificates.   Additional
conditions could be added to cover local conditions.   This would enable some
degree of national uniformity of application of conditions.  It would seem
appropriate, that the Home Office draw up the standard conditions as it has
done in respect of byelaws for example.

Resource Implications - Fees

At present it is suggested in Circular No. 72/1987 that the statutory
inspection should not result in significant resource implications but that
in general inspections are not expected to take more than about two man days
per ground.  This point is made in the context of emphasising the scope of
inspections, together with associated report work and are not intended to be
as detailed or extensive as that often required by the holder of the
certificate.

Clearly, more time is spent on safety of sports grounds than the Home Office
anticipates.  The resource implications involved for local authorities and
their advisers from other services to implement the existing provisions and
the new recommendations must be recognised.

Although the certificating authority is allowed to charge fees for dealing
with applications for the issue or amendment of a certificate (by virtue of
the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976) there is no express provision
for fees for the ongoing work of enforcing the provisions of the Act and
dealing with inspections that have to be carried out at least once a year.
The Inquiry may wish to consider whether express provisions should be made
to allow a certificating authority to make some reasonable charge.  There
are many examples of legislation where local authorities are empowered to
charge a reasonable fee to cover the cost of administering and enforcing a
particular licensing function.

Definition of Roles

The Popplewell Report recommended that there should be urgent consultation
between the Health and Safety Executive and the Fire Authorities and Local
Authorities as how best to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and
reports (paragraph 3.95).

It has again become clear during the Inquiry that a lack of clarity in the
definition of roles, as well as a lack of communication, can cause problems.
This is particularly relevant in relation to the Police who are involved in
the safety of sports grounds in a number of roles, e.g. a member of the
Advisory Group, upholders of law and order and their role inside and outside
the Ground.  It is also relevant to consider if and at what point in an
emergency the role of the safety officer is subsumed by the emergency
services.

Clarification, following consultation, is needed of the different roles
Authorities are required to fulfil and the means of communication between
them.

The Advisory Group

The Police and the Building Authority and, for metropolitan districts
subsequent to local government reorganisation, the Police and the Fire
Authority, have to be consulted by the certificating authority by virtue of
the legislation.  Sheffield City Council have included officers from the
Building Authority and Health and Consumer Services in their Advisory Group
prior to this Inquiry.
The legislation therefore, provides the basis of expert opinion on which the
Local Authority makes decisions.

The decision making process can take a number of forms, but perhaps the two
extremes are:-

(a) where all the experts are in agreement that decision is delegated to an
officer of the Council, where one or more experts differ - that decision is
delegated to an appropriate committee of the Council;

(b) the appropriate committee considers all matters relating to works
carried out at the sports ground.

Further guidance could be given over and above that contained in    the interim
recommendations as to the preferred course of action.

In addition to the statutory consultees, together with those recommended in
the Interim Report, i.e., the Ambulance Service, the Club and the recognised
Supporters' Club, consideration should be given as to whether any other
bodies should be involved in the wider Advisory Group, e.g., Health and
Safety Executive.

It may also be necessary to have a consultation group consisting of Police,
Fire, Building Authority, Environmental Health, Ambulance Service in
addition to the wider Advisory Group.

Members should be able to have professional advice from officers.

Pooling of Information

Some consideration should be given to pooling information on anational
basis to improve the flow of that information.

Information should be available to all certificating Authorities and their
statutory consultees.  This would assist to achieve a degree of uniformity
throughout the country and enable all Authorities to learn from each others
experiences.

This is particularly relevant to regional level where the emergency services
will cover a number of District Authorities.

Safety Management and Safety Planning

Sports ground management and promoters must accept safety as essential
aspects of their business and not an adjunct to it.   It is essential for
safety responsibilities to be clearly identified and for systems of
accountability to be included.   Any regulations or the "Green Guide" could
usefully develop this theme.   The term safety planning is preferable to that
of emergency planning in that it makes clear to everyone that the process of
safety planning is exactly that and an appropriate safety plan should
promote better safety standards.   All relevant agencies should be included
in the planning process.  Safety planning is aimed to prevent disasters as
well as providing contingency plans to ensure emergencies and disasters can
be coped with.

Status and Content of the "Green Guide"

A comprehensive review of the status and content of the Green Guide is
required.  The present guide to safety of sports grounds is predominantly
written for football single use stadia. Multi use stadia are becoming more
popular and it is suggested that the guide be expanded to cover spectator
safety requirements pertaining to a wider variety of sports, e.g., speedway,
stock car racing, hockey, archery, shooting, etc. and other potentially
dangerous activities.

In addition, either by expansion of the guide or by the creation of a
similar document, requirements for spectator safety of fully enclosed stadia
should be created.

"Flexibility"

The 1986 edition of the Green Guide, paragraph 6, states as follows:-

"Deviations from individual guidelines are possible without necessarily
detracting from the overall safety of the ground.  The variety of type,
function and layout of sports grounds means that a flexible approach should
be maintained to take account of the particular circumstances at individual
grounds".

And paragraph 8 states:-

"It should be borne in mind when using the guide to assess whether existing
circumstances provide adequately for the safety of spectators the criteria
to be aimed for is that of a reasonable degree of safety.  It would be
unreasonable, even if it were practical, to seek the absolute safety of
everyone attending a ground".

And, again in paragraph 11:—

"The principles referred to in paragraphs 4-10 above should be kept in mind
by both ground management and, where applicable, by the local authority when
applying the guide to an individual ground.   The guide is an aid to, not a
substitute for, professional judgment and common sense".

There is a problem in affording the Green Guide this kind of status.  What
is "flexibility" to one mind may be slap-dash permissiveness to another.
Clearly, emphasis on flexibility was and is well intentioned, but the effect
is to produce a code that is not applied tightly and where non-compliance
can be justified as falling within the scope of some flexible discretion
allowed to the relevant authority.

For the future perhaps the Inquiry would wish to consider recommending that
the approach of the Green Guide should move away from that of "flexibility"
to, for example, an approach of the following kind:-

"That the certificating authority, and where appropriate the club itself,
should always seek to establish whether there is some reasonable cause why a
relevant guideline is not complied with, and that in the absence of some
such reasonable cause emerging then compliance with the guideline should be
achieved or insisted upon".  A recommendation not to comply with a relevant
guideline should be in writing and approved by the certificating authority.
If such a decision is considered by the relevant committee of the Council
then the public will have access to that information.

Parts of the existing guide could become regulatory and other parts
re-issued (in a revised form) as a guide cf.  the majority of the Approved
Documents to the Building Regulations or an "Approved Code of Practice" c f .
status of an approved code of practice under the Health and Safety at Work,
Etc., Act 1974.  In the case of documents similar to the Building
Regulations compliance would therefore not be necessary, yet failure to
comply with the Guide could be taken as being evidence tending to show that
the requirements had not been met, unless it could be demonstrated by the
party concerned, using other means, that the requirements of the legislation
had been satisfied.

Specific Recommendations in relation to the Structure and Design
Requirements for a Sports Ground

General Fabric

It is recommended that the headroom for tunnels be increased from 2.4 metres
to at least 3 metres to facilitate overhead viewing of any crushing or other
problems occuring along its length.

Due to the possible risk of explosion, it is suggested that gas
installations should not be permitted in any building in the stadia used for
spectator accommodation.  cf. tower blocks.

To cater for different speeds of travel through tunnels or restricted
passageways longer than, say, 5 metres, a minimum of 4 units of exit width
should be provided.

Ingress

Segregation of entrances for supporters of opposing teams is recommended as
a permanent design criteria.

Permanent unobstructed access to the pitch area for emergency vehicles to be
provided in at least two positions, and these being at opposite ends of the
ground (whenever possible) .

The "guide" states a ma ximum notional rate of 750 persons per turnstile per
hour, however it does not state the design time, i.e., the time within which
all spectators are capable of being admitted.   It is suggested that a
revised code should state a maximum ingress design time of say, 45 minutes.
For multi use stadia, in particular, investigation of the flow rate should
be carried out as rates may differ, e.g., for families with young children.

Terraces

Where terraces are to be sub-divided so as to avoid major migration and
sideways surge, each section should be formed by inserting radial barriers.
Radial fences should be avoided.

It is considered that spectator accommodation should not be lower than the
pitch level or pitch perimeter path level (whichever is the h i g he r ) , so that
spectators do not have to step up from the spectator accommodation.
In the present "guide", it states "gradients steeper than 1:2 (26°, 34')
could be dangerous" (paragraph 94).   In Table 1 barrier requirements are
specified for terrace gradients of up to 30° or 1:1.7, therefore
contradicting the previous statement.    From a graphical interpolation and
extrapolation of all the relevant data the maximum gradient should be 31°,
30'.  This equates to approximately 1:1.63.

Crush Barriers - Design

To avoid rusting in unseen and non-maintainable places, overclipped barrier
rail supports should no longer be acceptable.  All parts of barriers should
be capable of direct inspection and maintenance.
Welding of all joints would achieve the aims set out in the above paragraph
and will create a structural continuity where the failure of an individual
element would minimise the risk of collapse.

Consideration should be given to the application of horizontal, (in addition
to lateral) forces.  This could be taken as 5% of the horizontal force thus
resisting torsional and secondary effects.

The recommended heights of the barrier rails should be re-assessed.
Clarification is also required (preferably by sketch) to show where this
measurement should be taken from.  The present "guide" appears to make an
assumption that the barrier rail is in the same vertical plane as the
terrace riser.  When these vertical planes differ, the method of height
measurement may also differ.  The acid test being at what level a normal
person would stand who was comfortable, immediately behind the barrier.

The opportunity should be taken to re-appraise the required test and design
loads.  An increase would achieve a greater resistance to collapse but may
increase the risk of injury due to resisting greater crowd pressures.  A
decrease, however, may result in earlier collapse, yet may prevent fatal
injury.

Crush Barriers - Testing

It is suggested that each barrier span should be tested separately (for rail
strength) and then adjacent spans be tested together to determine rail and
support strength.

The specification of the test should be modified to clearly state how
recovery deflection is to be calculated.  Such a modification should be in
accordance with the testing procedures in BS 5950 and other similar British
Standard documents.

To avoid any further doubt, a standardised test specification and procedure
is now required.  This should include a specification of a standardised
testing rig and a standardised test result sheet.

Stands with seated accommodation

Although steeper gradients can create better forward viewing for the
spectators, very steep gradients will have the effect of creating equally
steep radial gangways and may create a domino effect during an evacuation
where all persons may be stood - instead of being seated.  No maximum
gradient is directly stated in the present guide for seated areas; the only
tenuous reference being to the maximum calculated gradient for stairways in
paragraph 73 as being 34°,9'.  It is considered that seated accommodation
greater than 30° should have intermediate crush barriers at approximately 5
metre centres.

Pitch Perimeter Fences

The Popplewell Report (paragraph 4.136 to 4.138 and also Appendix 'E',
paragraph E29) recommended that consideration should be given to the design
of a standard efficient perimeter fence, with proper exits.

As a direct result of the Hillsborough disaster it has been suggested that
spectators may feel reassured by the possibility of forward escape onto the
pitch from all sides of the ground.
                                   Page 8


If pitch perimeter fences are to remain, it is suggested that at least 50%
of its linear length is openable and such openings are evenly spaced so as
to provide maximum benefit for spectators' safety.

Where pitch side police or stewards require access into the spectator area
through relatively small doors or gates, these may be provided as additional
openings or as wicket gates in the large opening panels.

So as to avoid sudden forward movement, all such gates should be vertically
multi-hinged and open towards the pitch.  Collapsible panels should not be
acceptable.  It is a further pre-requisite that the release mechanism should
be :-

a) capable of being operational remotely in tandem with others;

b) capable of independent opening whilst under crowd pressure, by the
   operation of a quick release, manually operated catch;

c) all opening devices must be capable of   use under crowd loading
   conditions.

In order to simplify any new designs of catch for pitch perimeter gates and
bearing in mind the fact that there should be no spectators on the pitch
side of the opening sections of the perimeter fencing, test loading on
perimeter fences could be reduced to, say 3 KN/m.

Estimation of Space Capacity - Terraces

Under the present "guide", terraces in good condition can be calculated as
capable of holding a maximum of 54 persons per 10 m ^ , throughout the
available terraced area.  It is, however, accepted that some parts of that
area are "peak viewing areas" and as such will achieve in practice agreater
population density due to their popularity.  The figure of 54/10 m^ is
therefore an average, without the peak viewing parts being given a maximum
packing density.

It is considered that the 54/10 m 2 should be treated as being the maximum
and therefore only be applied to the areas of peak viewing.   Other areas of
the terrace should be calculated as having a lower packing density, say
40/10 m 2 .

In order to practically achieve the consideration set out in the above
paragraph, it would be necessary to:-

(a)     Define the size and position of "peak viewing areas".

(b)     Surround the areas of "peak viewing" using radial barriers as opposed
        to radial fences.

(c)     Determine by effective stewarding or policing that the crowd density
        of each "peak viewing area" is at a satisfactory, safe and comfortable
        level.

Flow Rates

Throughout the Inquiry, the flow rate of 40 and 60 persons per minute per
unit of exit width have been heavily criticised as being based on
inconclusive research. A practical lesson that has been learned is that
                                        Page 9


      when people are very tightly packed, their ability to flow through exits is
      dramatically reduced.  Until the outcome of further research is known, it is
      suggested that flow rates are reduced to the following:-

      (a)   "Peak viewing area" of terraces - 30 persons per minute per unit of
            exit w i d t h .

      (b)   All other areas - 40 persons per minute per unit of exit width.

      It is considered that the emergency evacuation time should remain at 2i
      m i n u te s .

12.   Stewards

      Training of Stewards should be carried out by people who have experience in
      training and safety.  Training should be regular to remind existing Stewards
      of procedures and ensure that new Stewards receive appropriate training.

      The acceptable age range for Stewards should be specified as being between
      eighteen and sixty five years, in addition to the current requirements
      relating to fitness etc.

      A Steward (or a police officer) carrying out isolated tasks, e.g.  external
      gate duty, should be provided with an efficient means of communication with
      the Safety Officer.

13.   National First Aid Guidelines

      There is the need for national first aid guidelines which are drawn up with
      particular reference to occasions when large numbers of people are likely to
      be present, e.g.  football matches, pop concerts etc.

      It is also important for the individuals expected to provide first aid to
      receive appropriate training.

14.   Counselling and Support for Victims

      Substantial knowledge and experience now exists about the services the
      public and those directly affected by a disaster need afterwards.   These
      responses are informed by an understanding of the potentially long-term
      needs of victims.  Initiatives must be taken immediately after the disaster
      without waiting for requests for help and be available for a period of at
      least two years.  Their establishment and co-ordination with the voluntary
      sector and between statutory organisations needs to be undertaken on the
      basis of an agreed general plan.  The services have to be carefully
      provided, managed and last appropriate lengths of time, if the bereaved,
      survivors and rescue staff are not to suffer lasting damage.  These
      co-ordinated services are expensive to provide and outside of the normal
      provision made by local authorities.  Therefore their establishment and
      continuance is dependent on new and additional resources being made
      available.  Such separate funding needs to be made available.

15.   Public Appeals

      The legal issues surrounding public appeals are complicated, e.g. charitable
      status, tax etc.  Guidelines are required on the establishment,
      administration and termination of disaster appeals to ensure that funds are
      distributed as fairly, quickly and effectively as possible.
16.    Pre-Match Entertainment

       Further to recommendation 25 in the Interim Report, consideration should be
       given as to whether pre-match entertainment and associated activities can
       influence the type of crowd attending football matches (in particular) and
       for example can therefore be used to encourage family attendance.  Such
       entertainment may also result in staggered entry times.

17 .   Day and Time

       Consideration should also be given to what effect changing the day and/or
       time of kick off of football matches, in particular, may have on crowd
       behaviour and therefore crowd safety.

18.    Football Membership Schemes - I.D. Cards

       The Popplewell Report recommends (at paragraph 4.128) that consideration
       should be given to some form of membership scheme for football league clubs
       in England and Wales.

       However, in view of the experiences at Hillsborough, careful consideration
       needs to be given to any national football membership scheme.  It would
       clearly be undesirable if any such scheme resulted in significant delays at
       turnstiles.

       There are other practical considerations which must be taken into account,
       e.g., patterns of attendance, different method of entry, space required for
       a complex admission system, i.e., two turnstile systems, number of
       turnstiles required, additional policing/stewarding required to control the
       crowd and eject individuals, where to eject individuals from and how and
       reducing further the ground capacity.

19.    All Ticket Entry

       In order to increase the speed of ingress of spectators, consideration could
       be given to requiring all ticket entry for events where greater than, say,
       70% of the total available capacity could be expected.

Philosophy

          It is    i m p o r t a n t to e n s u r e that the           service response
meets      with    an o v e r a l l p h i l o s o p h y a g r e e d    by the p a r t i c i p a t i n g
agencies.

          For   the    consumer        this      will    mean     that:

(i)         There are clear              avenues        for   seeking       help      (locally       and
            regionally.

(ii)        The r e s p o n s e to       their      requests       will     be    quick     and
            appropriate.

(ii i )     H e l p is e a s i l y a c c e s s i b l e (i.e. help                is   not
            d e p e n d e n t upo n w h e r e people live).

(iv)        Help      should      be   non-labelling            and    non-stigmatising.

          For   the    participating             agencies       this     will     mean      that
services:

 (i)        Should      be    well     co-ordinated           andconsistent.

 (ii)       Should      be    quality       assured.

 (iii)      Cost      effective.

 (iv)       Keep      the    consumer       as    the   primary        consideration.

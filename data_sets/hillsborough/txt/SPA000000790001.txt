2.1   At the meeting of the Finance and General Purposes Committee held on
       15 September 1989, it was resolved that in view of the potential
       expenditure which the Authority may be involved in, and as agreed by
       the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company Limited, officers of the
      Authority were requested to "shadow‚Äù the Insurers in the conduct of
       the claims for compensation and report back to the Committee on
      developments as they arise.

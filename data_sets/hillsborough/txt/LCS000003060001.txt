Dear

                           Eg:   HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY


     Following the tragedy on the 15th of April, I have been co-ordinating
the work of various Social Services agencies in the North West, and we are
now trying to establish a firm financial base for the operation we have
mounted which will have to continue for several years to come.

     We have obviously sought financial support from the usual agencies
of Central and Local Government, and also made an approach to the European
Commission. Given the exceptional nature of this tragedy, and the range
and scale of services, we are also seeking financial support from a range
of other agencies connected with football and private industry.

     It has occurred to us that there may well be football organisations,
particularly in the Middle East, who have a fairly rich financial base,
and we are keen to make contact with these. Your name was given to me as
someone who may have, through your connection with the football fraternity
in that part of the world, contacts that you may be prepared to share with
us.

     If you can help us in any way, and are prepared to provide information,
we would, of course, use it most carefully and delicately. I do hope that
we shall hear from you.



                                 Yours sincerely,




                          DIRECTOR OF SOCIAL SERVICES.

As    he    wa s     doing         so,        supporters               on    the       ground          were        hurling            abuse       at    hit

about       the      situation.



I    continued           down Vere               Rd    towards              Penistone             Rd w here           I saw           supporters

urinating            in g e n n e l s           between          the        terraced          houses           and       also         going       into

those       b a ck      gardens           looking           to     gain          entry       to    the        g round         via      the

the    Penistone              Rd       e n t r a n cjs a n d       in s t a r t l i n g           contrast            there           were    no

queues       at      any      of       trie i u r n s t i l e s         and       by a b o u t         3.03pm         (1503)           I had

gained       access           to       the      terracing.                   I saw       play          stopped           a n d at       first

thought        there          had       been a         pitch           invasion.




As    the    situation                 deteriorated                I decided             that          the     match would                 not

continue,            but      not       grasping            the        full      extent           of     it    I walked               home

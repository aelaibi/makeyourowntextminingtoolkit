Mrs Teresa Glover


                                                 8 September 1992




Dear Mrs Glover,

Thank you for your recent letter about my decision not to
authorise an application to the High Court under section 13 of
the Coroners Act 1988 in relation to those who died in the tragic
circumstances of Hillsborough.

I am writing this short letter personally to let you know that
I do indeed understand your anguish and desire to do everything
you can to see that the events are investigated to the full. I
can assure you that no discourtesy was intended by Mr Wooler's
letter which followed as I am sure you will understand what is
the normal practice.    I was anxious that you should have an
answer to your own letter at the same time as a reply was sent
to your solicitor.

I have children myself and I do indeed understand the depth of
your feelings.   Tragically, there is nothing I can do which will
restore Ian to you.       I can however assure you that your
application was considered by myself personally as well as by the
Solicitor General.   My duty, when I consider a case such as this
is to decide whether to authorise an application for a new
inquest under section 13 and not to do so unless it can be said,
with reasonable confidence, that further information be likely
thereby to be uncovered which would have a real effect on the
issues the coroner had to decide.    I am, as you know, satisfied
that there is no such reasonable prospect.

I am only sorry that there is nothing more I can do to assist and
repeat once again my deep sympathy for yourself and the other
families who suffered in this tragedy.

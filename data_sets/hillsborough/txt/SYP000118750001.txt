                  the S h e f f i el d W e d n e sd a y Football         G ro un d where an      initial    briefing was

                 held for officers              of the     rank of       Inspector and above who were               to be

                 e n g a g e d on s u p e r vi s or y duties         connected w it h the policing            of the F.A.

                 Cu p Semi Final m a t c h to be played at                      the ground between L iverpool              and

                 N o t t i n g h a m Forest Football          Clubs      the    f o 11owi ng d a y .

                 The    format     of the ground and the brief in g                    itinerary were       familiar as

                  I had     previous        i nt erspers ed expe ri en ce at all            ranks,      of being

                  involved      in the       policing      of the ground on such major                  occasions.

                 On concl u s io n of the address                   by Chief S u pe ri nt en de nt D u c k e n f i e l d and

                  other     senior       s t a f f , 1 a cc o mp a ni e d S up er in t en d en t G r e e n w oo d and other

                  officers      to the S p io n H o p area of the ground.                      I was a ware    by reason

                  of   previously         circulated d oc um e nt a ti o n of my duties and area of

                  responsibility.

                  I had charge of serials 9 and                      10 w h ic h were     to be u ti lised on sub

                  sector 4 of sect io n            1A .    S up e ri n te n de n t G re e nw o od was    the ground

                  commander with S u pe r in t en d en t C h a p m a n and Chief                Inspector Beal        being

                  the sector       commanders.

                 The    three    phases        of duty     ie before,          during and after         the m at ch were

                  not new to me as             I had policed this              particular duty on previous
                                                                                                 PAGE

occasions.

The duty stages were              turnstiles        s u pe rv is io n   before   the g a m e , crowd

control       during the game and s up e rv i si o n and                loading of depart ing        fans

on buses at the end of the g a m e .

E s s e n t i a l l y this area of the ground had been d esignated                     for    the use

of the N o t ti n gh a m supporters            however,      past experience and the ticket

a l l o c a t i o n d ic ta te d there w ould u n do ub te dl y be a distinct            and

i dentifiable        propo rt io n of Liverpool             followers who w ou ld gain

a d m is s i o n to this     part of the ground.

Su p e r i n t e n de n t G re e nw o od a d dr es se d   those    present   concerning what was

potentially         problematical         w hich was       to ensure      the safety of any such

opposing       supporters.

The    co n t in ge nc y plans      based on previous             occasions were d i sc us se d and

m u t u a l l y agreed.      The essence         be i ng that any supporters           from

Liver pool w ould be d ir e ct e d/ l oc a te d to the no rth and                  raised     side of

the Kop where         they would be sep ar at ed from the adjacent N o t ti n gh a m

followers       by one or two serials               of    police    officers.

On S a t u r d ay   15 April      1989 at      10.00am      I a t te n de d the m ai n briefing

w i t h all    off i ce rs on duty and directly                engaged on the       policing     of the

ground and the a t te nd in g           supporters         on that day.

That    briefing was         opened      by Chief S up e ri n te n de n t D u ck e n f i e l d who

introduced the          various      other     senior      officers and they        in turn

identified themselves.

The    intention of the Police               together with the me th od to be employed

in the s u pe rv is io n and safe             conduct      of the supporters at and            in the

gr ou n d were      e xp li c it l y outlined.

The various         stages and aspects            of the     policing      in keeping w ith the

operational         order was       oralated to those             in attendance.

At    11.00am that day,           I went with the           two serials      under my     command and

joined others          on the S pi on Kop w here all               of the staff     on duty at that
particular         location were           briefed by S up er in t en d en t Greenwood.

His address         b a si ca ll y    covered the matt er s        d is cussed at s up er vi so ry

level     the     previous     day      in relation to s ec urity and safe                conduct of

the a n t i c ip a te d Liverpool           support.

As    in the m ain briefing and at this second briefing,                            the order of the

day was      reiterated        in that       "the     policing was       to be firm but fair with

the    safety of the          public      being      of prime    importance".

In this sec on da ry briefing S u pe r in t en d en t G r ee nw oo d o ut li ne d from his

experience his          recollections           of previous       policing of Liverpool

supporters.          He spoke         of the    need to be vigilant and he had seen that

these    particular        supporters w ould            not hesitate      to take adv an ta ge and

atte mp t    to    cause    problems        if things were        not going their way or              in

favour      of their       team.

The    nature      of the a nt i ci p at e d      problems and the        relevant        contingency

plans    being e x ha us te d         I then took my two serials                to the area where

they were to be            initially engaged for             phase    I of their duties.              I

briefed them speaking of what                     I e xp ec t ed and advi se d them of their

specific        r e s p o n s i b i 1 ity touching on the        three   phases     of duty.      In

ad di ti on to what        had been said at             the other     briefings      I also

proferred my thoughts                 on what     I deemed an      important       issue w hi ch was

the welfare and safety of each other.                           Suc h matters     as the    exercise

of d is cr et io n     in arr es ti ng       people     or acting     impulsively without

considering         safety.          I m en t io n ed s pe ci fi c al l y how    it was   important

not    to u nn ec e ss a ri l y denude         our   presence     by rigid and       inflexible

a p p l i ca t io n of the    rules without           thought     of the objective         of   the

day.     1 stated that          such a policy on such an o cc asion w ould benefit

to show not         only good         relations      but should ensure          the safety and

welf ar e   of all      not   only at        the turnstiles        but   in later     crowd

control.          I gave   example        for the benefit         of those wit h      lesser

ex perience        of how acting          in isolation w ou ld or         could     leave officers
                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                   R H36

at the m ercy of the           crowd.       I d ic tated that any           public    order matters

inside the ground during              the game w ou ld be dealt wit h by teamwork at

my discr et io n and        instigation.        I also       touched on the need to

exercise      caution      in the searching          of supporters and of ticket

inspection.

At the     completion of my address,                the officers were             paired off and

a l lo ca te d or s el ected specific          t urnstiles wher eb y they w ould

su pervise a dm i ss i on of fans during              phase    I.

I s at isfied myself         that the area we were             required to          initially      police

was a d e qu a te l y    covered and spoke          to each officer          under my       command as

I pat rolled the          location.        During    this   pat rol       I i dent i f i ed that    there

were    some t urnstiles          numbered 65 to 88 w h ic h did not appear                   to have

had staff a l l o c a t e d to supervise            them.     On ascertai ni ng that           some of

these    turnstiles were           to open and a commu ni ca ti on w ith ground

control,     further       officers     but not under my            command were       deputed.

In a dd ition to staff            directly under my          command,       the    police    resources

were    r einforced by the          presence of several             officers       on horseback.

There were eight m ou n te d officers a v ai la bl e                 to    control    any build up

of supporters           outside the ground whilst             queui ng for e n t r y .

The    turnstiles        opened at    IS noon and from that time                   there was a

steady and easily m an ag e ab l e           flow of,       in the main,          we 11 behaved

supporters.        The     progress and admis si on s          at this sect io n of the

ground seemed           steady,    there    never a p p ea r ed to be any major              build up

at any of the           turnst iles and the only            congestion was w hen the

occasional      ticket      taut <s ) made a presence           but any one stage there was

never to my reco ll ec ti on any more                than about       fifty at any one of the

turnstiles await in g admission.

I only recall           the ut il is ta io n of one mount ed pat rol               officer    to assist

in crowd m ov ement         and this was       caused       primarily by the          presence      of a

ticket     tout.
                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                          R236

The m a j o r i ty    of the spectators a r ri v ed at this end of the ground

either on foot or by the                provided double            deck        buses w hi ch were

bringing      s upporters         from the     railway station.

In general        the m oo d of the spectators was good and a l t ho u gh there was

evi dence of         people    drinking       from cans       in the       immediate        vicin it y or on

the a p p r o ac h to the ground,             all    complied w ith            requests      to desist and

either di sg ar de d        the    contents     down the gutter                or   left    the vicinity.

Some     time after       half     past two,        I received a radio t r a n s m i ss i on to the

effect     that      there was      people     trying     to break down a turnstile at my

location.         However,        I was directly         outside         the    particular       turnstile

quoted w ith two m o un t e d officers and there was no evidence                                    of such a

sit u a t i o n being     in existence.             I related this to ground                  control.           In

fact     the only specific           in stru ct io n and a ct i on             I had to take was            to

cause a programme             seller    to    close a concertina type                  gate    from which

she was     selling       programmes         from    inside     the ground to persons                    passing

on the f oo tpath outside.

About 2 . 4 0 pm some         of the m o un te d officers                I believe      initially         two,

but     laterally f o u r , were        directed to the L ep pi ng s Lane                    end of the

ground to assist w it h             crowd control .

I realised from             radio trans mi ss io ns        that     there was a c ongestion and

build up of supporters at the other                        end of the ground and                 I recall

thinking how          clear    it was at our          1o c a t i o n .

Fro m    the turns ti le s        opening at        1E noon to the             period when       the moun te d

off i cers were        released      I had had several              visits          from and brief

conversations wit h S up er in t en d en t C h ap m a n and Chief                       Inspector B e a l .

I then heard the game start at a r ou n d                     I presume 3.00pm.                H o w e v e r , my

staff were still               outside       the ground due to a small                  number      of

supporters        still        being    in the       locality and a d di t io n al l y the               fact that

some     of the      t urnstiles were         to    remain open            until     half    time.

The next thing          I      recall    was that there was an address                       over    the tannoy
                                                                                                 t~'AGE       6
                                                                                                 R236

system      requesting        spectators      to either     stay off or get off            the

pitch.        Very shortly after            this there was a police             radio mess ag e     for

all a v a ilable       officers       to go   into    the ground.         I saw both my serial

sergeants,          ie PS 767 Jessop and PS            1080 H o yl an d    instruct     their    staff

to close the t urnstiles and they                    proceeded    into the g r o u n d .       I went

into    the ground via gate             * 0 ' in company with S up er in t en d en t Chapman.

As    I entered the section between the                  north stand and the S pi on Hop,                 1

saw that there were             numerous      s upporters    on the       pitch at the Leppings

Lane    end of the ground and there was a hostile a tm os ph er e                        in the

crowd.        To all    intents and         purposes,    it seemed that there had been a

pitch invasion from the L ep pi ng s Lane                  end terraces.         I could see that

there was a good             police    presence at      that end of the ground a nd I

therefore          instr u c t ed the staff on the         perimeter       track at the Spion Kop

end to ensure          that there was         no pitch     invasion from that end.

There were numerous             officers a rr iving at the ground                several    were

going     to the L ep pi ng s Lane end and some               remained at        the Kop end.

It seemed that          numerous       spectators were        coming from the L ep p i n gs Lane

end of the ground up to the Kop.                      Several    were     r estrained an d held

back from a n ta g on i si n g        the   crowd    in the Kop.        After    some   time     I could

see    that spectators around               the ground were       beginning       to break       down

several       of t he a dv e rt i si n g hoardi ngs whi ch they began to                carry back

in towards          the L ep pings Lane       end of the ground.            I then saw what were

o bv i o u s l y   injured    people    being    carried from that end of the ground to

the Kop end.           The a tm os ph er e     in general a pp ea r ed very volatile with

spectators          in these    initial       stages jeering and shouting and venting

their frustr a t io n at         the    pitch invasion.

I caused several             officers at this end of the ground to rip down

remaining a d v e rt i si n g     hoardings and         clear    the debris       of the support

structures          so that    they could not         be used as weapons          in the    event of

any further          outbreak    of violence.

                                                                                                R236

It seemed     that w ha tever was        happening at the Leppings Lane                   end of the

ground that       little     control    was being     gained and there were               still

people after what          seemed a considerable          period of time,          clambering

over   on to the      pitch,    some of w hom were        running     to the S pi on Kop end

or towards N o tt i n g h a m supporters        in the south stand a nt ag on i si n g               the

crowd with gestures.

As time    p rogressed the mood of the N o tt i n g h a m supporters                began to

quieten and a pp la us e was heard as what were obviously                     or app eared to

be injured       people    being   carried to this        end of the ground.                 About

3 . 2 5 p m a cordon of officers         began to form and move            from the Spion Kop

end of the ground          up to the half way          line.     I then went       up to this

cordon and a s s i s t e d    in trying to calm and            reason w it h s pectators who

were   in various      emotional       s t a t e s . Some a p p e ar e d to be wan de ri ng about

a im l es s ly and   in tears whilst others           were aggr es si ve and hostile,

shouting    threats and displaying             gestures    at the     crowd and the            police.

I was a pp ro ac he d by a youth of about 20 years dressed                     in a blue

sweatshirt who was           in an e xt remely hostile and aggre ss iv e mood.                       He

began to harrange me with various                ob sc en it ie s and threats           of

violence.        However,    was   restrained by some           nearby supporters.              He was

obviously s uffering          the effects      of alcohol       but a pp ea re d   to     cairn when

c onfronted with his fellow supporters.

However,    as    I began to move away from him,                I felt a violent             blow to

the base     of my neck       be 1ow the    right     ear o bviously having          been hit.             I

looked to the floor and saw a plasti c bag whi ch I picked up and found

to contain a heavy object              but w h ic h   I did not examine.            It had

ob viously been thrown by the y ou th who                I had just spoken           to as      I was

appro ac he d by two of his         colleagues        who began pleading           that      I did not

arrest    him.       I handed one of the youths           the    plastic    bag and told them

to take hirn away.

Whilst    I was      in the area around the           centre of the      pitch,      I remember

hearing a tannoy             broadcast       from the Liverpool            Manager      a lt ho u gh    I do

not    recall     its    content.        I was also at one stage                instructed by Chief

Super i ntendnet Nesbit              to secure        the S pi on Kop perimeter             by the us© of

some    dog me n to         release     further officers            from that side of the ground

to    reinforce       the   cordon      in the       centre    of the    pitch.        Ha vi ng done

this,     I a ga in     returned to the             central    a rea and had by this             time

learned that          there were at          least     two    people dead because             of crushing

on the Leppings Lane               terraces.          It was    not until       this    time which must

have    been at       least 3 0-35 minutes             after    I had entered the gro un d that

I became aware           that    the    situation was          not simply one of a mere                 pitch

invasion but was            something        of a greater         proportion and complexity.

A g a i n ar ou nd this       time     I became a ware from a tannoy broadcast                         that

the m at c h was        to be a b a n d o n e d .

In consequence           of the m atch ab an do nm en t           I spoke      to either Chief

S up er i n t en d en t N e sb it /M ol e    or S u p e r i nt e nd e nt C h ap ma n and was deputed

to take half          of the cordon whi ch e xt en de d f ram the                 cent re spot          to the

north stand outside              the ground at the S pion Kop end to assist                            in the

loading of the buses and to ensure a safe dispersl                                of the       crowd.

The    leaving      s pectators were          safely dis pe rs ed as had been planned                       for

phase    III and about 5. 15 pm              I returned to the ground.                  It was at this

point    that     1 became aware            of the m a gn it ud e     of the     incident and of the

disaster       that     had taken place.

After a de-brief            in the north stand,               I a ss is te d   in reorganising

personnel       who     had a tt en d ed the gr ou nd as a result                of o p er at io n

support      into     serials     for despatch to the town centre                      in a n t i c i p a t i o n

of    public    order       incidents.

I later      returned to the g y mn as iu m             in company with Chief               Inspector

Beal,    Chief      Inspector Creaser and               Inspectors Burns and Sewell                    where

we a ss i st ed     Inspector Charles               in the setting       up of the        casualty

             I retired        from duty at 5.00am,

             I did not        specifically            handle any bodies w h ic h were           removed        from the

            L e p p i n g Lane    end of the ground my only                     i n v o 1vement wit h bodies was            in

            the make      shift mortuary.

             In relation to            command s t r ucture at          the time       of the   catastr ophe       1

            were      the only two o ff icers             in the     initial       stages w ith w hom      1 had any

             contact.         R adio    c o mm un ic at io ns were      very      restrictive and the           radio

            was      either     down or w he n         it was    u ti li s ed    could not be heard due to the

            volume      of the        crowd.

            At    the time and during the                 time    I was     inside     the gro un d   I only became

            aware      in the     very     later       stages    that   there had been fatalities.                 To

            all      intents an d       purposes,        from w he re     1 had been      it looked       like there

            had been a pitch              invasion.

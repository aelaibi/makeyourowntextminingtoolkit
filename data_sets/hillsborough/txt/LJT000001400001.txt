Dear Lord Justice Taylor
It has been suggested to me that I should forward copies to you
of a variety of papers I have been writing on the aftermath of
the Hillsborough Disaster and also on your excellent Report into
that terrible event. I do hope you could find the time to read
them.
I should perhaps add that my Department here at Salford maintains
a continuing active interest in the modernisation of English
football.   We have recently submitted a major proposal to the
Economic and Social Research Council (jointly with the Sir Norman
Chester Centre for Football Research at Leicester) for systematic
research into the changing composition of the football crowd in
England; and we are also very closely tied into a consortium,
based at the European University Institute in Florence, of
researchers with similar interests from most member-states of the
European Community.    We have also been trying to interest the
Home Office, the Football League, the Football Trust and the new
Football Stadia Advisory Council in such systematic research,
focussed in particular on football spectators1 interest in issues
of safety and policing.
I do have to say that the response of the various established
authorities to date has been polite but generally not very
forthcoming. It has also been a particular source of dismay for
us to hear that the Football Advisory Design Council, charged
with the primary responsibility, as I understand it, for advising
on the stadium designs and improvement recommended in your report

has a maximum budget, for everything, of only £100,000.      This
does not bode well, we fear, for any imaginative and creative new
stadia on the Italian or even the more modest Dutch example.

I would appreciate hearing from you, if ever you could find the
time.
All best wishes,

Yours sincerely

  Taking Hillsborough Seriously?

Discussion of the future of English soccer is obviously now
impossible without reference to the disaster at Hillsborough on

15 April 1989 and the ensuing Reports of the Official Inquiry
conducted by Mr Justice Taylor.      The disaster itself was the

'end-point'   - the   logical   conclusion   -   of   those   forms   of

political   and journalistic discussion of football which had
developed throughout the late 1960s, the 1970s, and the 1980s,
articulated almost entirely around a 'law and order' theme and
the identification of soccer's problems almost exclusively with

the issue of hooliganism.   Ninety five Liverpool supporters died

whilst penned into a human cage at the Leppings Lane end which
had been re-constructed in the early 1970s as a response to

'crowd trouble';   the emergency itself,     in the first fateful
minutes, being understood not only by the police but also by the

watching media and football authorities, as a further instance

of ever-familiar 'trouble in the crowd'.         In the aftermath of

Hillsborough, nearly all commentators on English football now

recognise the exhaustion of this kind of law and order talk, and
practice, as a serious response to the problems and opportunities

confronting English soccer.



      But the Hillsborough disaster, for all of its catastrophic

consequences for the 95 dead fans, their families and friends,

was   also vital   for the kind of creative response which it
provoked amongst 'ordinary' football fans and, indeed, amongst

'ordinary people' at large, including those who do not themselves

go to football or even particularly like it.           One of my key
purposes in this chapter is to try to recall and to highlight
some of these important 'cultural aspects' of the Hillsborough
disaster.1 No matter that the future shape of English football

will crucially be shaped by the economic forces of a free market
society,   I would still argue that the present condition of

football in England can only really be understood in terms of an
exploration of football's relationship to working class culture

and to popular culture in the past.        It may also be the case that

any attempt to reorganise English football which ignores the
powerful and cultural specific significance of football to class

and local identity may quite fatally be flawed.                  The popular
response to Hillsborough constituted a powerful but momentary
symbolic expression of those relationships.


     The 'official response' to the Hillsborough disaster, in the

shape of the Taylor Report2, constitutes an important moment in

its own right in the history of English football - not simply
because it is the official response to English football's worst
ever disaster, but specifically because the Report did turn out,

against    the   expectations   of   many3, to    be     a    sophisticated,

sympathetic and creative intervention into the condition of the
English Football League.        Written from a position outside the

'law and order'     rhetorics of previous enquiries4, the Taylor

Report has been broadly understood as having offered 'a lifeline

to English football', and in the afterword to this chapter, I
will offer a series of observations on developments in English

football    since   the   release    of   the   Taylor       Report.   These

observations will be 'realistic' enough to recognise that many
                                 3

of the problems of English soccer discussed in that Report are

economic   (in whose financial interest is it to invest in the
wholesale reconstruction of the English football ground?), but

they will hopefully also be historically and sociologically
enough aware to remember the essential cultural and human lessons

of Hillsborough.


Hillsborough

In this first part of the chapter,      I want to    'retrieve'   six
different aspects of the disaster at the Hillsborough stadium on

15 April 1989 - the ground on which I watched my first soccer in

the late 1940s.


1.     The Soccer Ground as a Shrine

I want first to recall the way in which the supporters of
Liverpool - and, indeed, the supporters of Nottingham Forest
(their semi-final rivals on that fateful day) and the fans of the

host    club,   Sheffield   Wednesday   and   Everton,   Liverpool's

Merseyside rivals - responded in the immediate aftermath of the

disaster itself.    The overnight decoration of the Leppings Lane

entrance, and other accessible parts of the Hillsborough stadium,

with flowers, wreaths and a vast range of football memorabilia
(scarves, hats, rosettes, programmes, etc.) was a mass popular

rite largely without parallel in Britain this century.       Nothing

similar had followed the Kings Cross Underground Station fire in

1987 or the Southern Region railway accidents of 1988 and 1989

 (the month before Hillsborough), although there were reports of
the traditional maritime ceremonials marking the sinking of the
Herald of Free Enterprise - the throwing of wreaths onto the

waters at Zeebrugge Harbour.        The decoration of Anfield and

Hillsborough had no such formal quality,          however.     Mourners
carried with them to the ground, and left behind in the goals,
the most basic, personal and apparently trivial of memorabilia.
One television clip showed a quite elderly Sheffield Wednesday
supporter depositing what was presumably his only personal copy

of the 1966 F.A. Cup Final programme (played between Sheffield

Wednesday and Everton); the only close connection he could make

'affectively' with Liverpool.      The only parallel to this simple
offering of minimalist but intensely personal belongings that I
have ever witnessed was at the Shrine of Guadaloupe, in Mexico

City.     During my visit there in 1970, I saw poor peasants and
others,    all   with   desperate physical    illnesses   or   crippling

disabilities, crawl across the forecourt of the church to make

their humble offerings to their God.         I was also reminded, when

looking at the Anfield and Hillsborough shrines, of the much more
formalized annual rituals in Derbyshire, the 'well-dressings',

where flowers are fashioned into what are known as shrines,

dedicated usually to particular saints, or, in some villages, to

pagan godheads.


        The pictures of the shrines shown on television, and later,

the repeated photographs carried       in the daily press and in

specialist soccer magazines, also reminded me what soccer stadia
have historically for long periods been the objects of what we

might call popular sanctification.5 Certainly the description of
                                      5

Hillsborough used in the 1950s by my father as we got off the

tram at Parkside Road, and walked along Penistone Road to spend
a    few minutes   outside   the   Players'       Entrance    (hoping     for a

glimpse, perhaps, of Albert Quixall, the                'Golden Boy1 of the
Hillsborough faithful) was that we had come to 'the shrine'.

When    pitch   invasions    began,       in   1962,    and   continued    over

subsequent years, I was insistently told, by both my father and
my uncle, that this never happened 'in their day' - because, in

their day, they said, the pitch was sacred.             In several newspaper
reports written about Hillsborough, especially those emphasizing

the way in which the magnitude of the disaster had occasioned an
enormous show of solidarity between soccer supporters, and a

suspension of the aggravation and enmity that has characterized

football rivalry, there was a heartfelt sense that the creation
of    these   shrines   at Anfield    and Hillsborough might mark a

cleansing of a sport bespoilt since the early 1960's by a history
of divisiveness and violence.             Such hopes were given further

sustenance, and an ironic, symbolic significance, by the sight
on television of Liverpool and Everton fans reverently parading

around Goodison Park with ninety-five                  red and blue     scarves

knotted together in a continuous line, before the start of the
Everton-Liverpool league game on 10 May, some twenty-five days

after the disaster.      When Liverpool went on to beat Everton 3-2

in the 1989 Cup Final at Wembley, press reports suggested that
fans of both clubs were present during the traditional homecoming
in almost equal numbers and that there was a 'roaring trade in

Liverpool hats and badges' bought by Everton fans in tribute to

the ninety-five dead of Hillsborough.6
2.    The Ground as an Emblem of Locality

The   reconstruction of the ground as a shrine is a natural
extension of existing relationships of the club to the fan:
football grounds across the country have always had an almost
religious hold on football fans and, indeed, on the families and

kin on whom these, mainly male, fans have imposed their weekend
and mid-week-evening obsession.             In different parts     of the

country, however, these shrines have taken on a particularly
important additional significance as an emblem of locality, often
quite widely shared, irrespective of gender position.           Sheffield

itself, unlike Liverpool (with its inimitable waterfront and its

Victorian    and   Georgian   arcades), and        Manchester   (with   its

venerable Victorian insurance buildings and St Peter1s and Albert
Squares) is a Northern industrial city with no really outstanding

architectural or other features (although lovers of the city,

like myself, will always speak fondly of the Crucible Theatre,
right   in   the   city   centre,    and   then   fervently   of the    Peak
District, on the city's doorstep, as unsurpassable features of

the place).    For many working Sheffielders, however, the symbol

of the city's local pride           (particularly since the closure of

Bramall Lane as a Yorkshire cricket ground) has been Hillsborough

itself, which has been remodelled and upgraded consistently over

the years, and, in the football community itself and beyond, is
widely regarded as one of the best and most modern of stadia for

spectator sport in Britain.           In the recently re-released and
quite marvellous survey of Football Grounds of Great Britain,

Simon Inglis observes about Hillsborough that it:
                                7

    has proved that a club can provide all the facilities
    that   a  supporter   wants,   without   robbing  the
    surroundings of its intrinsic character. It is surely
    no coincidence that Wednesday men are always ready to
    talk about the club and about Hillsborough, and about
    the city of Sheffield that everyone seems to love ...
    a visit to Hillsborough on a crisp, autumn afternoon
    remains one of the quintessential joys of English
    sport.7


In the local paper, the Sheffield Star, on the Monday after the
disaster, a long-time local Sheffield-born sports reporter, Paul

Thompson, wrote in sorrow and in dismay:


     Oh no ... not Hillsborough.     Wednesday and their
     supporters are trying to come to terms with the fact
     that football1s worse tragedy has occurred where
     nobody would have least expected it ...8


He quotes Rita Nettleship, secretary of the Supporters' Club, as

puzzling over the irony that:


     If it had happened at any of the other grounds we have
     criticized ... but at Hillsborough?



and he concludes:


     It is so sad that one of football's old clubs, run by
     decent men, is now synonymous not with sport, but with
     death on a grand scale.
          That is why the club and its followers can barely
     comprehend what has happened to them.9


In Liverpool itself, the importance of the club to 'the people'

was being displayed in ways which confounded even the most

seasoned of footballers and football managers themselves.     As
Jeremy     Seabrook so     succinctly put         it,   this may be because
football 'continues to reach1 some aspects of the social being
which cannot be fulfilled in private life or in ritualized public

consumerism.        That    is     to     say,   that   football         continues,

obstinately and insistently, to represent:


     the passion of locality and of places once associated
     with something other than football teams.10


In the case of Liverpool, this has an unbearably tragic quality,

since:


     ... [in this] great maritime city, with its decayed
     function rooted in an archaic Imperial and industrial
     past, sport now has to bear a freight of symbolism
     that it can scarcely contain.11



3.       Hillsborough and the Question of Modernisation

Reactions to the Hillsborough disaster in the pages of the

financial press in Britain as well as in the North American press

as   a    whole   placed   an    enormous        emphasis     on   the    issue   of

modernisation,      or,     more        accurately,     the    total       lack   of
modernisation of English soccer stadia.12                Particular attention
was given to the fact that - with only a handful of exceptional
cases - the vast majority of football clubs in England and Wales

play in stadia that were originally built before 1900.                            By
implication,      the argument which was being advanced in these

reports was that this 1failure to modernise1 was a key cause of

British soccer's problems with both crowd safety and hooliganism.
      The failure of English soccer clubs to modernise provision
for spectators is legendary.        At the majority of clubs, the only

routine modernisation that seems to be contemplated, between
seasons, is the repair of terraces and crash barriers and, during

the 1970s, the introduction of perimeter fencing.                  The quality

of seating, of toilets, of public address systems, and of first
aid   facilities    remains   derisory.         The    standard      half-time
experience at the average English soccer club, in 1989, is of a

ten-minute wait in line for a tepid and tasteless cup of tea in
a polystyrene cup, for the aptly-named Pukka pie (a food item

which would not be offered, in most countries in contintental
Europe, to a dog). What might have been taken for granted by a
working-class soccer supporter in 1949 is unacceptable forty

years later, in a society whose consciousness of the quality of
food, and of consumer service generally, has significantly, if

unevenly, expanded.


      In the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, the blindness

of    football1s    Boards    of    Directors     to        the   question   of

modernisation      of   spectator     security        and     well-being,    in

particular, has quite properly become a part of football's agenda
for change.     The Taylor Report itself must be understood as a

reprimand to Football League Clubs not only in respect of their
failures in respect of crowd safety but also in respect of the

general poverty of provision by clubs for paying spectators of
comfort, entertainment, and refreshments, and in general, of a

worthwhile product or service to consumers.
                                    10

      I do   want   to   suggest,    however,   that   the    response   to
Hillsborough which saw in it only the failure of soccer to
modernise is a misleading and partial account of what happened

at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.        (It also suppresses the fact

that the disaster occurred, as we have already suggested, in a

stadium in which very significant modernisation had taken place,

notably in the mid-1960s, in preparation for the World Cup games
of 1966.)    The really definitive truth about Hillsborough, and
the deaths of ninety-five people, was not 'the absence of modern
provision1, although this may have placed a really important role

in the communication problems that were evident between the club

and the police, in the melee developing outside the Leppings Lane

end   turnstiles    before   the    kick-off; and      it   was   certainly

underlined by the appalling absence of first-aid provision and
emergency preparedness in the aftermath of the disaster itself.

The determining cause, if this is the appropriate word, of the
Hillsborough disaster was the way in which the Leppings lane

terrace, like so many of the 'popular ends' at English soccer
grounds, had been reconstructed over the years as a caged-in

'pen', from which there was no means of escape at a predictable

moment of crisis of mass spectator excitement and anxiety.               It
is vital to understand that this process of caging-in a section

of the soccer audience, identifiable with that portion of the
underclass   seen to be generally        and universally capable of

violent behaviour,       is a social process - and a process that

focusses, like the prison building programmes of the 1980's, on

'secure containment'.        It is a product or expression of a

particular historical and political moment, deriving initially
                                       11

from the late 1960s and 1970s and developing into the epoch of
Thatcherism.        So     it   is    clear,     for     example,   that    the

recommendations initially made by the Wheatley Report on Crowd

Safety at Soccer Grounds in 197213, in response to the Ibrox
disaster and to a series of pitch invasions and other incidents

of crowd trouble, concerning the safety of spectators at soccer
grounds, were never really activated by Football League clubs
during the followng 15 years,              except at such times when new
stands or terracing were being introduced.                On such occasions,
there is some evidence that architects were asked to take into

account, and to design in, the 'egress time1 of 8 minutes which -
 the Report declared - spectators would require to escape from
a major emergency.        In the meantime, the approach to crowd safety

and provision at the popular ends continued, right throughout the
19 60s to 1980s, to be entirely overdetermined by the question of

the containment and control of the terrace supporter.                  When I
spent my very earliest years as a young Sheffield Wednesday

supporter on the Leppings Lane end, often standing alongside

supporters of the visiting team, there were three means of entry

onto the terrace itself and ony a small ledge separating the

terrace from the playing pitch:              but by April 1989, this same

terrace was divided into two cages, with a single tunnel entrance

into   one   of   these    areas     and    absolutely   no   other means    of
'egress'.      It is not that the Leppings Lane end had not been

'modernised': it is that it had been transformed for the purpose

of physically containing 'an end' of the ground which had, in the

meantime, become re-defined as the section of the ground which

was now dedicated (in respect of routine League games) for the
                                  12

exclusive use, and the effective containment and control,           of

supporters of visiting teams.


4.   Hillsborough and the Question of Violence

In many of the first press reports of the Hillsborough disaster,

both in Britain and internationally, the events at the Lepping
Lane end were interpreted as a further instance of the continuing

problem of English soccer violence.


     The   Belgian   newspaper,   La   Derniere    Heure. offered    a

particular variant of the argument:


     Don't tell us that there is no connection between what
     happened in Brussels on 29 May 1985 and the terrible
     catastrophe in Sheffield. This was not a question of
     hooliganism.   The supporters of the Reds attacked no
     one.    But the question must be asked about the
     attitude of people who, with or without a ticket, have
     deliberately risked triggering this drama.


The same report, by Martin Kettle, quoted a Professor George

Vigarello of the Universite de Paris as saying:


     It has always been the same. The English football fan
     is violent.   He comes to the ground in groups, with
     his mates. He pushes and shouts.13



Undoubtedly   the most   notorious reaction       from Europe to the

disaster, however, was the set of comments made by M. Jacques
Georges of the European Football Association,          in describing

Liverpool supporters as 'beasts' and heavily implying that the

Hillsborough disaster ought to be understood, primarily, as an
                                      13

expression of that truth.          These comments provoked great anger

in Liverpool, and even evinced a direct admonitory response from

Mr Hurd, the British Home Secretary14, who averred that there was

no violence at Hillsborough, contrary to what M. Georges may have
been told.


     In     Liverpool    itself,     any    reference      to    misbehaviour,
rowdiness or drink amongst the Liverpool                 fans at the         fatal

Hillsborough    semi-final    is seen as an            intolerable      slur:   an
informal boycott in Liverpool of the Sun newspaper, which had
carried many reports along these lines in the aftermath of the

disaster,     made   a   significant       dent   in    the     sales   of   that
'newspaper'    on Merseyside.        The popular commonsense seems to

suggest that there is no connection between the disaster at
Hillsborough (which continues to be interpreted by many Liverpool

fans as an instance simply of incompetence and authoritarianism
on the part of the South Yorkshire Police and bad planning by

Sheffield Wednesday F.C.)          and the tragic events at the Heysel

Stadium in Brussels in 1986, where, no-one can deny, 38 fans of

Juventus died as a direct result of a ritual 'taking of the ends'

by drunken and rowdy fans of the Liverpool club.



     In Sheffield itself, a series of unpleasant stories continue

to circulate about the behaviour of a minority of Liverpool fans

after the disaster began to unfold.               There is some scepticism

about the reports, circulated nationally, that ambulancemen and

police were assaulted during the disaster: many commentators

observe that these 'assaults' may in fact have been the desperate
                                      14

attempts by fans who were trying to obtain help, sometimes in

vain, to revive their stricken relatives.               But there have been
persistent reports of some snatching of wallets from the dead or

the dying, and also of some obstructive action by drunken and
aggressive    fans vis-a-vis        the attempts being made to mount
rescues and revivals on the terrace and on the Hillsborough

playing field itself.


       Observations    of    this   kind   in no way      detract    from the

extraordinary acts of heroism, and the exhibition of fellow-
feeling, which the majority of fans exhibited in the wake of the
Hillsborough    disaster.        At the time       these were    subject to
eloquent comment by several Liverpool players (John Aldridge15,

Ian Rush16, Craig Johnston17 and many others) and they have even
been subject to praise by Mrs Thatcher herself, though it is

inconceivable that she could understand the sense of fellow-

feeling that binds supporters of football clubs together in this

way.


       What   I want    to   retrieve      from   the   apparently   confused

reactions of British and European commentators to the violent
deaths that took place at Hillsborough are two truths - first,

the truth that the deaths of the 95 Liverpool fans must primarily

be     understood      as    a   consequence       of    the   architectural

transformation of the Leppings Lane end into a human cage (a
transformation born of the 1law-and-order1 rhetorics applied to
soccer during the previous 20-25 years) but, second, the truth

that there are certain very rigid patterns of fan behaviour at
                                      15

English soccer matches (bound up with the consumption of drink18,
masculinity19 and an explosive mix of tribal solidarity amongst
supporters    of one team coupled with aggression towards the

supporters of the other team)20 which were all apparent amongst

the crowds attempting to enter Leppings Lane before the fatal

semi-final (and which are still all too obvious at many English
League and Cup games). To recognise this is not to say that all
sections of the English soccer crowd conduct themselves according

to this particular, rigid set of 'codes', nor either is it to say
that there is a direct,           causal    link between these codes of

behaviour and hooligan behaviour in all cases.                      Since its re-
emergence    as    a   major    social     problem    in     the    early   1960s,

hooliganism has consistently been a minority phenomenon but it
is nonetheless important to recognise that the reactions of
spectators as a whole to police activity against crowd trouble
inside stadia has remained quite noticeably ambivalent, though
there has tended to be more support for firm police action with

respect to drunken or threatening behaviour outside the stadia.
The essentially class-based traditions of solidarity amongst

supporters of individual clubs and the accentuated masculinism

of terrace culture have militated against popular support from
the crowd for police intervention.              It has taken the disasters

at   the     Heysel,     at      Bradford       and     at    Hillsborough       to

'problematicise'       the     patterns    of   drink      and     masculinity   in

football spectator behaviour in the minds of football spectators

themselves.       This is an issue to which I shall want to return in

the second half of this paper, in my discussion of the future

prospects for English football.

5.    Hillsborough and the Disaster Theme


One vital aspect of the Hillsborough Disaster (that was noted at
the   time    by   a    wide    variety    of   differently-placed     social

commentators) was the fact of it occurring in sequence with a
series of other disasters in public facilities in Britain.                   The

truth was caught most graphically on a poster which appeared on
the walls of Britain's city centres in April 1989, produced by

the Socialist Workers Party, around the now famous photograph of

a Liverpool fan sitting alone and distraught among the mangled
perimeter fences at the front of Hillsborough's Leppings Lane
terrace.     Underneath this photo is the caption 'Thatcherism: Ten

Years of Disasters' (and, of course, a call to various political
meetings). There is no need, I think, to subscribe to the kind
of    simplistic       causal   theories   associated   with    the    SWP    to

recognise the strength of the empirical claim which this poster
attempts to represent.          This is a society which since 1979 has

experienced a series of inner-city riots quite without precedent

in their violence and intensity, but which has also, perhaps more

tellingly, experienced disastrous breakdowns in public provision

on the part of established institutions purporting to provide
for, or, indeed, to 'look after' the citizenry.           The list of such

disasters now includes the Bradford City fire                  (57 deaths by

incineration in May 1985) , the sinking of the 'Herald of Free

Enterprise' ferry in Zeebrugge Harbour
in 1987 (188 British passengers drowned), the fire in King's
Cross Underground Station in November 1987 (31 incinerated), the

explosion on the Piper Alpha oil rig in July 1988                     (167 oil
                                 17

workers blown up or drowned), and the Southern Region rail
crashes at Clapham Junction in December 1988 (35 dead) and then
at Purley (2 dead, 52 injured) in March 1989.     To this 'litany'

of disasters, some observers would add the deaths by fire of 55

holidaymakers in a British Airways plane awaiting take-off at

Manchester Airport in August 1985, the Lockerbie disaster in
December 1988 and the East Midlands Airport disaster just three
weeks later in January 1989.    There has been nothing to approach

these disasters in Britain, either in scale or in public impact,
since Aberfan,   on 22 October 1966, when a landslide from a

pitheap engulfed a local school and claimed the lives of 147, the
vast majority of them infants.



     Although some commentators have denied that there is a
pattern to these disasters, this is certainly not how they are

experienced in popular consciousness, nor how they are viewed by
safety engineers and by informed commentators in the mass media.

A report by the Toronto Globe and Mail. for example, quotes the

Head of Safety Engineering at Cranford Institute of Technology

as saying that 'what seemes to be happening is that safety is

judged by the amount of money that people want to spend (and) at
this point in time, we are in an environment where money has

become   very,   very   important.21   This   Canadian   journalist,
examining the record,     concludes:   'Sifting through the public

inquiries of tragedy after tragedy, common themes can be easily

unearthed: rampant disregard for safety in private and public

services; poor communications once disasters occur; inadequately

trained and overworked staff and, especially, dilapidated public
                                        18

facilities1.


        Public awareness of the declining condition of public space
finds    expression     in   a   variety     of   ways,   not   least   in    the

continuing high rates of the 'fear of crime'.                   They are also

exhibited in a developing public concern about the extraordinary
level of litter which besmirches British streets and public
spaces generally.       Some, like the Sunday Times newspaper, have

responded    to   the   problem    of    litter with      special   campaigns
organised around the inputs of voluntary effort and sponsorship

of parks, public spaces or litter bins by business enterprise.

Others, like the national Tidy Britain Group, have called for
enlargement and strict enforcement of the law against litter.


        Implicit in this public consciousness of delapidation and

the   potential    for disaster      in the public         environment       is   a
theoretical and socio-political connection which the immediate

press coverage of Hillsborough did not even think to make, and

which was certainly not obvious even in Lord Justice Taylor's

Official Enquiry.


        The 'litany' of disasters is, indeed, in the nature of a

critique of a society which simply has not taken seriously the
question of public safety and public provision.                   Even in the

heyday of post-war reconstruction, social-democratic politicians

attempting to build a New Jerusalem (for example, in the form of

'garden cities', or even council houses with space for growing
families, shelves for reading matter, and materials adequate to
                                      19

prevent     environmental        deterioration)     were   seriously       and

consistently obstructed, most usually on grounds of cost                   (no
council houses were ever built with shelving).             So also was the

establishment of the NHS vigorously obstructed by the medical
profession and by other powerful private interests.


       In more recent post-Keynesian times, 'public provision', in
its most general sense, has come to be equated,                 in political

discourse,    with the creation and/or elaboration of a               'nanny

state', encouraging the growth of a 'state dependent' mentality

among the citizenry in general and the underclass in particular.
But what none of these free market commentators ever discusses
is the condition of public space (or, for that matter, of public

life    -   whether   in   the    form     of   interpersonal    concern    or
conviviality) in a free market society.            What possible guarantee

is there, in a competitive free market society, of safer public

spaces, safer public transport and/or a sea-change in the way

that 'authority' treats, for example, the consumer, the sports

fan or the traveller - that is, the citizen - in Britain?



       The fires at Bradfor City and at Kings Cross,               like the
routine vandalism and graffiti on nearly all British housing

estates, were the product of a society in which the public's

regard for disdainful, uncaring and inefficient public provision

was expressed in a littering of the space so provided.             The Piper

Alphas disaster was a product of a society in which a sudden and
continuing demand for oil vastly outstripped any serious concern

for worker safety.22 The Southern Regional rail disasters of the
                                 20

late 1980's were a product of a society in which rail travel is

increasingly    underfunded   (and whose   equipment   is   therefore
massively outdated and its staff callously overworked), and in

which the Government is theologically committed, against nearly
all environmental and economic evidence, to an expansion of the
road system rather than of other public transport systems.        The

Zeebrugge disaster,    in a more complicated way, seems to have
stemmed from a disastrous individual oversight, but was clearly

an expression of a kind of careless inefficiency and neglect for
the public     interest which characterises the British service

industry in general.    The Hillsborough disaster was the product
of a quite consistent and ongoing lack of interest on the part
of the owners and directors of English league clubs in the
comfort, well-being and safety of their paying spectators:          a

particular expression, within football, of what I am arguing is

a generalised problem in English culture - the lack of regard by
authority (and therefore by what we now call 'service providers')

for the provision of well-being and security of others.



6.   Official and Popular Discourses About Hillsborough


In my own earlier paper on the Hillsborough disaster, written

before the release of the Official Enquiry,       I gave voice to

certain misgivings and concerns about the appointment, and also

the likely scope and rhetorical stance of an enquiry headed by

a member of the senior judiciary.     An appointment of this kind

from Government was     entirely predictable    in Britain,     since

enquiries into breakdowns of the assumed and routine practices
                                             21

of authority, both public and private, and their relations with

the citizenry (or of what one might call the taken-for-granted
custodianship        of   the      citizenry         by     the    state       and    other
authorities)     are nearly always conducted in this country by
members of the judiciary.                  In the United States and in many

European countries,            by contrast,         they might be conducted by

senior    officials       within       the    State       executive     arm.         In    the
Commissions     of    Enquiry      completed within               the   US    into    urban

violence and crime, into pornography and sexuality, and a host
of   related    areas,      the       process      of     collecting      evidence         and
organising      an   analysis         of     the   problem,       in    order    to       move
strategically towards a solution,                    has routinely involved the

participation of scholars and practitioners who are closely

involved in the problem, or who have spent years in scholarly or
applied    research       in    the    area.         In    Britain,       however,        such

expertise and practical knowledge has always taken second place
to   the requirement that an                 'independent'         adjudication of a
serious social probe of a disaster be exercised by a senior

member of the High Court.                     The main qualification for the

selection of such persons, in general terms, seems to be that

they     have   developed,        in    the       course    of    their      occupational

socialisation and upward mobility within the legal profession a

finely tuned understanding of what kinds of solutions,                                    and,

indeed, what kinds of analyses, are acceptable - both in general

and in more specific conjunctural terms - within the corridors

of power.       The domination of these enquiries by judges is a

function of their refined understanding and practice of what

Frank Burton and Pat Carlen, in reference to official inquiries
                                      22

into the Irish question, once called Official Discourse.23


     Certainly it is true that the three judicial enquiries

conducted into the earlier post-war football disasters at Bolton
in 1947, Ibrox Park in 1971 and Bradford in 1986, all tended 'in
the final analysis' to reproduce,                albeit in the measured and

sometimes elegant tones of the senior judiciary, the political
and commonsense assumptions that are dominant in powerful circles
at that particular moment.



     The offical Enquiry into the Bolton disaster in 1947 spoke

powerfully about the need to limit the size of crowds at a time
of mass, popular interest in soccer: it said nothing about the
modernisation of the conditions offered to spectators, whether
seated or standing, in the light of the game's new-found post-war
popularity.      The    Popplewell     Enquiry,         as   already    indicated,
especially in its interim report, started out as an examination

of fire risks and the relations of the safety inspectorate to

private   soccer     clubs,    but    it    finished         up   reading   like   a
contribution to the debate, which was then current in England,
on the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill and the extension of
police powers of search.



     My fears about Lord Justice Taylor's Official Enquiry,

however, were mistaken - and, in retrospect, what I had most
crucially     failed    to    grasp   was        the    extent    to   which    'the

commonsense'    of     some   sections      of    the    senior     judiciary   had
departed, by the mid- to late-1980's from the sensibilities and
                                     23

policy preocupations of the Thatcher Government.24              The Taylor

Report is not, of course, a detailed social scientific analysis
of   the broad      framework of    social   relations    (of social   and
regional inequality and working-class masculinism) and in that
sense the limitations - and perhaps also the ideological or

partial character - of Lord Justice Taylor's 'official discourse'

are clear.    But neither is this Report a further one-dimensional
example    of a law-and-order solution applied to              football,   a

further neurotic twisting of the knife by something called 'the
Authoritarian State'.      In a Report which seems to be written for
football and, in many ways, in the name of the football crowd as
a whole,     there is a firm insistence on the removal of the

perimeter fences - the 'human cages' of Leppings Lane - from
English    League grounds;    there       is a clear    rejection of the

Thatcher Government's proposed Membership Scheme as a practicable

solution to soccer violence and also as a meaningful intervention
into football as a popular sport and entertainment, and there is
also a powerful and entirely accurate denunciation of the squalid
facilities     which   have   routinely      been   provided   for   paying

spectators over the years by football clubs the length and

breadth of the country.25



      There is, of course,         quite vigorous controversy amongst

football     fans   (and amongst     football   clubs    themselves)   with

respect to the key recommendation in the Taylor Enquiry, namely,
that all stadia in the English First and Second Divisions, and

all stadia in the Scottish Premier Division, have got to become

'all-seater' by the end of the 1983-84 season.            In the pages of
                                          24

the fanzines,       in When Saturday Comes26 and also in the press

releases and other literature from the Football Supporters'
Association, the proposal for all-seater stadia is interpreted,

in part, as an anti-hooliganism measure.                  Critics of the all-
seater proposal have pointed, in effect, to the fallacies in what

they see essentially to be an architectural determinist argument

- namely, that human social behaviour is a direct expression of
the surrounding built environment.27 They also make reference to

the    well-known       truth   amongst      football   fans    - namely,     that
incidents of hooliganism, so far as they still are occurring in
the aftermath of the 1990 World Cup, tend to occur away from

football stadia, in surrounding streets, on public transport on
in public houses.



       This kind of critique of the Taylor Report's all-seater
proposal from represenatatives of existing circles of football
fans may, however, be based on a misunderstanding of the Taylor

Report's overall strategic agenda.               A close reading of the text

of the Taylor Report suggests that the call for all-seater stadia

is one, important, element in an overall, insistent demand for

the radical modernisation of spectator provision                        in British

football.        It is also quite clear that the demand made for the

introduction of all-seater stadia - discussed as if such seats

might contribute to more orderly behaviour on the part of all
fans    -   is    one    way    in   which     the   Taylor    Report    is   able,

strategically,       to justify its call for the final removal of

'prison-like' perimeter fencing from English League grounds: it

is the "quid pro quo" directed as the "law and order" lobby's
                                          25

preocupations with the effective "containment of the crowd".


        One    of   the problems     in the     continuing defence      of the
standing terrace by the Football Supporters Association and other
representatives of football fans as a whole is that it could be

interpreted as a kind of acquiescence in the Football League

clubs'        stubborn   refusal     to    modernise,      justified   as   that
resistance often is by reference to spectators1 own preference
for 'the traditional'.           This is not of course the way to 'woo
back'    those erstwhile spectators at British soccer who have
stopped coming to games because of the squalor of the stadia, nor

either is it a way to attract a new constituency of support.                  In

the ongoing 'war of position' currently taking place over the

future of football, I would argue that it is vitally important
that the voice of football fans and spectators should clearly

distinguish         itself   from the inert,      reactionary nostalgia of
Football League Boards of Directors and argue unambiguously for
radical       modernisation     of   provision,    not     only   on behalf   of
existing spectators but also on behalf of the large body of

potential support currently content to view their football on

television from the comfort of their own homes.28



        We are precisely in a situation             (because of the Taylor
Report), I would argue, where there is a possibility of radical

modernisation and also transformation of the ways                      in which

football is watched and supported in Britain.                     The Football

Association,         in April   1991,     has   released    its Blueprint     for

Football. proposing the introduction of an 18-club Premier League
                                    26

in seasion 1992-9329, whilst, in Europe, interest in the idea of

a continent-wide Super League continues to gather pace.                  In such
a context, I would argue, it is very important to be careful and

precise in one's evaluation of the essentially populist responses

of existing football fan magazines and organisations to the
Taylor Report and to other changes now proposed for the game.

One of the responses to the Taylor Report's proposal for all-

seater stadia,      for example,    was to argue that the proposal

constituted   a kind of attack on traditional                  (sic)    'terrace
culture'   with its celebrated         (or hypothesised)        qualities of

camaraderie, quick wit and collectivism.             This image of terrace
culture    is,     of course,   very much the        image which has          been

reactivated culturally by the fanzine movement during the 1980's,
but it must be said that the experience of terrace life during
that same period at many clubs has actually been one of rampant

racism,    crudelysexist banter, and of aggravation conducted by
groups of young white males of little education and even less

wit.30 There is a strong suspicion that the populist defence of

terrace culture by those generally well-educated largely good-

humoured, independent entrepreneurs producing the fanzines and

the   alternative     football    literature        of   the    1980's       is   a

'fantastic' representation of actual terrace culture in the same

period:most   of    the   readership     of   the   fanzines,          and   most

contemporary exponents of traditional camaraderie and wit of 'the
terrace' now sit in the stands.



      In April 1991, two years after the Hillsborough disaster,
when the jury at the official inquest before the South Yorkshire
                                     27

coroner,    Dr   Stefan   Popper,    finally    returned     a    verdict   of

'accidental death1 on the 95 victims, there were heartfelt scenes
of bitterness and anguish amongst relatives in attendance for the

finding.     Relatives had apparently been wanting a verdict of
'unlawful killing1 and,       in particular,      affirmation that the
opening of the gates at the Leppings Lane by police - an act
which     precipitated    overcrowding     on   the   terrace       -   should
retrospectively be defined as a crime.



        There is considerable room for debate between 'radical' and

realist critics over the finding of this inquest31, particularly
in respect of what might have been the most instrumentallv useful
in encouraging action to prevent any recurrence of disasters like

Hillsborough on other football grounds in the future.              But I want
to suggest here that the Inquest was important also in the

symbolic realm - not just in providing for some vital means for
dealing with the feelings of sorrow, loss and guilt of relatives,

football authorities and police - but generally in providing a
platform on which Hillsborough could be remembered in all its

various important dimensions.        I began this chapter by reference

to   the    re-decoration    of     the   Leppings    Lane       entrance    at
Hillsborough as a popular shrine and I then tried to retrieve a

sense of the ground in a local people's 'sense of place' (their

cultural geography of 'their' city). I also tried to recall how

the magnitude of the disaster seemed to bring football and

football supporters together in a collective sense of loss and
also,    for a time,      in a new-found determination to               rebuild

football, especially the relationships of clubs to supporters,
                               28

on a different,    cooperative and collaborative basis.   In the

immediate aftermath of the disaster,    Liverpool Football Club

indicated that it was to suspend all its fixtures for the rest

of the season,    including its games in the F .A. Cup.    Kenny
Dalglish, the Liverpool Manager, was quoted as saying: 'Football
is irrelevant when something like this happens1 (Observer. 16
April 1989).



     A memorial service was hurriedly arranged at Liverpool1s
Roman Catholic Cathedral on Sunday, 16 April (with five thousand

in attendance, and eight thousand other mourners outside) and the

Liverpool Manager, and seveeral of the Liverpool players (most
notably,   the Liverpool player John Aldridge)   were quoted as

saying that they could not contemplate playing football in the
immediate future, and that, minimally, the decision as to whether
Liverpool Football Club should continue to play out its remaining
Cup and League games should be a decision of 'the people of

Liverpool1 and, particularly, those who had been bereaved.     He

reiterated, once again, that 'the football doesn't matter any
more' and then elaborated this sentiment with a powerful local
reference:



     When we go to play at Anfield again it will be a
     different feeling. The whole concept of the Kop and
     the goalmouth has changed.
     (Guardian. 18 April 1989)



This sentiment seemed to be echoed by leaders of the Liverpool

City Council, who themselves declared a week of mourning and

indicated that no Hillsborough victims'     familiies   'would go
                                        29

without1.      'This city will look after its own.|32



       For a key period after Hillsborough, that is, there was a
pressing sense that the Liverpool managers and players, along
with the City Council and the local clergy, recognised, in a very
fundamental      sense,      that     'Hillsborough'     had    in   fact     made

impossible a continuation of the normal relations of the football
club   (and, behind it, the Football League,               the F.A. and the

familiar apparatus that is the professional football industry)
with the community.         The problem that was posed was not a problem

of un-modernized stadia or the absence of consumer-friendly free
market forces, but the problem of the contact which football has
lost with its traditional constituency:                'the people'.      In the
week after 15 April, there was in insistent resurrection, in 'the

talk about Hillsborough', of Arthur Hopcraft's idea of football

as   'the people's game' par excellence: a form of passionate
working-class poetry and a vital              emblem of the distinctive
qualities of one's own locality and identity.



       Writing this chapter, two years (almost to the day) after

Hillsborough, it is not clear that football has retained that

urgent, powerful sense of the need to redraw its relations with

its most important constituency: the people.              During the last two

years, the mass media have certainly given much greater coverage

to   issues    of   crowd    safety    and,   to   a   lesser   extent,     crowd

provision.     Especially during 'Italia 90', representatives of the
Football      Supporters     Association      were     given    an   access    to

television, radio and newspapers they might not have had in other
                                      30

circumstances.       But there have also been unmistakeable signs of

the Boards of Directors of some clubs 'dragging their feet1 on
the Taylor Report, not only because of the costs involved in the
upgrading of stadia but also on the grounds that modernisation
of safety and provision was an unwanted and unjustified diversion
from the 'true' purpose (sic) of a football club.34             There has

been a sense that the horror and meaning of Hillsborough has
already been forgotten in some quarters and, in particular, that

football's traditionally inattentive and ungenerous relations
with its supporters, 'the people', reinstated.           It is the light

of the pressure to normalise once again this kind of exploitative
relationship between club and spectator that the angry populism
that was awakened by the Hillsborough disaster is important and
in need of constant reaffirmation.


AFTERWORD



For all these last concerns, there are many positive aspects of
the situation of English football in 1991, two years after the

Taylor Report and some eight months after the English team's

courageous performances in the 1990 World Cup.          Not least of the

changes is the sense that English League football is blessed once

again     with    some    talented   and   exciting   individuals      (Paul

Gascoigne, David Platt, Tony Daley, Lee Sharpe, Mark Hughes, Des
Walker,    Gary     Lineker); that    hooliganism,    for    reasons   also

connected with the World Cup initially and with the European

idea,   has      become   unfashionable;   that   football   is gradually

becoming more open to women spectators, women directors and women
                                        31

journalists; and, not least, that attendances are continuing to

increase,    for the fourth consecutive season.                  Attendance at
Football League games during 1989-90 was 19.4 million, an 18.3
per cent increase on the post-war low of 16.4 million in 1985-
86.35    The attitude of public authority to football, whilst not

generous,    is certainly more supportive and constructive than

would have been possible in the dark days after the Heysel

disaster.36      There    is    also    evidence,     in   the    shape   of    a

mushrooming football literature              (in book as well as magazine
form), of a renewed interest in football as a form of personal

hobby interest     (as a part of one's own cultural                   'identity-
kit') .37



        On any careful reflection, however, it is clear that this
sense of possibility will depend for its eventual realisation,

absolutely crucially,         on football's ability to modernise its
present     material    and    social    condition.        The    longstanding
contribution of Mr Lord Justice Taylor's Report into Hillsborough
will be to have placed the modernisation of stadia and spectator

provision at the centre of football's agenda.                    What are not

directly    addressed    in    the   Taylor     Report,    however,     are    the

economic and cultural contingencies which may obstruct or enable

the new project of modernisation.



        Discussion amongst television 'pundits' during the World Cup
in Italy quite often strayed from events on the pitch to the

quite extraordinary and beautiful stadia which had been built,

either from scratch or by ingenious renovation and extension of
                                      32

existing stadia, to house the games.              There was a remarkable
consensus amongst these pundits that such a stadia could 'never'

be built in Britain38: a consensus that seems on enquiry to be
broadly    shared amongst English football          fans and television

watchers alike.      The acquiescence of the English on this issue

clearly ought to be a matter for analysis in itself (are people

indeed now accepting that England, the home of football, really
is not so modern, efficient and creative a culture as Italy and
therefore could not house its national game with a similar degree
of artistry and financial commitment?) .            What does seem to be

demanded, however, according to many surveys and according to all

hearsay,    is a radical upgrading of our squalid and outdated
stadia.     (See footnote 28)



     In the summer of 1990, the Football League was estimating
that a sum of £665 million would ideally be needed if clubs were

to complete the ground improvements demanded by the Taylor Report

by 1993-94.    But they also indicated that, even with the support
which was now forthcoming from the pools levies which were being

channeled to clubs though the Football Trust, clubs still thought

they would only be able to find a sum of £350 million to spend
on these improvements.39 Only a small proportion of this sum can

be found from increased ticket sales, new sponsorship, increased

TV rights or even from contributions from the Football League,

football pools or the Football Trust.         The recommendations of the

Taylor     Report   had,   of   course,    been   given   the   support    of

Parliament    precisely    at   the   time   that   British     economy   has

encountered its worst recession since the early 1980's.              But it
                                       33

is also clear that - as in so many other areas of British life

in the early 1990's - the fundamental problem is that the limited
amount of capital available to rectify the continuing lack of
serious investment in stadia and infrastructure over the previous

45 post-war years.        Never having ever been run as profit-

maximising businesses, and always preoccupied primarily with the
glory of victories on the pitch, English League Clubs are now
confronted, along with a vast investment defecit, with no obvious

set of solutions for the modernisation project demanded by the
Taylor Report.40 The recent modernisation of stadia in Italy has
been made possible primarily by the peculiar alliances of large
capital and the State - the 1corporatist1 deal in Northern Italy

   (and also by the continuing personal commitment of major

capitalist individuals like Signor Berlusconi or Signor Agnelli
to A C Milan and Juventus).            In the Netherlands and in France,

on the other hand, the modernisation of stadia appears to have
been approached rather more steadily and systematically at local
level, with close cooperation between local private interests and

energetic,     modernising     local    authorities.    In    1free-market1

Britain, in the meantime, there has been a powerful sense during

the   1980's   simply   that    football     clubs   have   become   another

diversion for fast-moving entrepreneurs with no proven interest

in, or commitment to, the medium of long-term future of clubs.
Manchester United, now heading for the finals of the European

Cup-Winners Cup, are still thought to be available for sale on

the open market, though probably the price will now have climbed

above a February 1991 quotation of £16 million.41             In 1990, the

Club was very nearly sold to property speculator Michael Knighton
for slightly less.        Sheffield United, in the meantime, were very

nearly   sold   to   an    Iraqi businessman,         Mr   Sam Hashimi,    with
absolutely no previous connection with the Club.                  Thoughout the
1980's, Mr Robert Maxwell has been involved in attempts to buy
Watford and Reading on top of Derby County and Oxford United,

which he purchased in 1982 and where the chairman is now Mr

Maxwell's son, Kevin.         It is not at all clear how Mr Maxwell's
direct or indirect ownership of these clubs has improved the

performances of their teams or the quality of their stadia.                 Nor
either is it clear how this activity helps Mr Maxwell's interest
in the ownership of a British club that could compete in a
European Super-League.42 It does seem clear, however, that these

'boardroom      struggles'     on   the        part   of   maverick    property

speculators and other capitalists for ownership of clubs are
neither raising the kind of capital which clubs require for the

project of stadium modernisation nor guaranteeing the continuing
integrity of clubs vis-a-vis the communities in which they have

always been located.         In this particular sense, the offering of

these clubs for sale is a profound blow to the idea of the club

as a specifically local and popular institution.                  The offering

out of shares in clubs, via flotation on the Stock Exchange (as

has happened at Millwall and, most notoriously,                   at Tottenham

Hotspur) , does not carry that particular danger: but it does now

seem clear that football clubs - precisely because they are not

profit-maximising institutions - are not proving very attractive
'opportunities' to the mass of investors.43                  There is a real

sense in which the modernisation project of English football is

encountering     the      limitations     of    the   kind   of    free   market
                                       35

individualism that was encouraged by Government throughout the

1980's.     The only new modern sports stadium of any size and
grandeur that is opening in the early 1990's in England is the
Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield, built for the World Student
GAmes in that city in the summer of 1991 on the initiative of a
City      Council      selling   an     idea     to    progressively-       and

internationally-minded capital.



       So one of the pressing issues in the modernisation of
English football after the Taylor Report is the source and the
control of the capital investment that is required.             It now seems
clear that this issue may require a return by clubs and the
League    to   local    authorities,    for the       creation of   local    or

regional collaborations as a preamble to approaches to major,
international sponsors.



       The second issue confronting football is even less open to
effective action by football clubs themselves.             The moves towards
modernised and all-seater stadia,              towards a domestic Premier

League and perhaps towards a European Super League are unlikely

to occur without any kind of defensive-aggressive response from

the popular ends themselves.                Entry into a European League

itself, as many journalistic commentators have observed, would
institutionalise the practice of English fans travelling abroad

'on tour'. Though there seems to have been some reduction in the

number of incidents of hooliganism in the first domestic season
in England since the World Cup Finals in italy, there are no

grounds for believing that anything fundamental has changed in
                                   36

the 'conditions of existence' of hooliganism in the underclass

of this country.    These conditions of existence are not a product
of social deprivation in any straightforward sense.           Instead, as

I have argued elsewhere, the violence exhibited at the Heysel
Stadium, and also routinely exhibited since the late 1960's by
supporters of 'England' and of English clubs abroad, is very much

a    product   of     the    'culture'     of     the    upwardly-mobile,
individualistic fraction of the          (male)    British working-class

which has done relatively well out of the restructuring of
British industry and business in the last twenty years.              This
fraction of the 'working-class' (first sighted, perhaps, in the
lump workers in the buuilding industry and in London's Docklands)

has done well because of its ability to master particular crafts

and to move between work sites.         It has a certain residual sense

of   solidarity,    born of neighbourhood and gender,          but it is
generally individualistic, chauvinistic and racist.            It is this
particular fraction of the class that has exhibited what Raymond
Williams summarized in The Long Revolution and, again, in Towards

2000, as 'mobile privatization',45 and whose cultural and leisure

preoccupations      have    more   recently       been   pilloried   quite

mercilessly by commentators on the radical Right.46            It is this

particular fraction of the class, according to many different

accounts, that is most deeply attached to its reading of the Sun
newspaper (which, in October-November 1989, had achieved a daily

circulation in Britain of 4,095,027) and the Sunday Sport, and
which was most enthusiastically carried along by the jingoistic

nationalism that accompanied the Falklands/Malvinas and Gulf

wars.

     At     the    very    lowest    end     of    the   British working-class,
irretrievably caught in what Phil Cohen once described as an

'exploration' of 'downward mobility'47, are cohorts of unemployed

or under-employed young men, who have left school at sixteen,
most with no qualifications or with a few largely irrelevant

qualifications.          They are the most visible and, indeed, in large
part because of their untutored, unchallenged 'masculinity', the

most troublesome fraction of the vast population of young people

who leave school at this age (some seventy per cent of all pupils
in Britain, compared with only thirty per cent in Japan and ten
per cent in the United States).                    Glenwyn Benson and Stewart
Lansley, analysing these figures, have shown that Britain has

'the lowest staying-on rates in Europe',                      the worst        'gap in

attainment'       between     lowest       and     highest    achievers        of     any
comparable        European    or     North       American     society    and,       most

importantly for our purposes, the 'worst education' population
of   youth    of     a     country    that        describes    itself     as        being
'advanced'.48



     The overwhelming point about figures of this kind is the way

in which they underline the crucial, definitive 'conditions of
existence';       the moral and cultural shallowness,                   and lack of

alternative experience,            which feeds into the tribal weekend
rituals of the underclass soccer hooligan.                    A similarly narrow

form of socialization underpins the nationalistic aggravation

exhibited by those workers who have escaped the trap of downward

mobility,    and, despite their lack of formal or non-technical

education, could afford trips to the World Cup in Spain in 1982
                                           38

or to the European Cup Final in Brussels in 1985.                        In the case

of the downwardly-mobile and much less affluent underclass, no

doubt, this passionate preoccupation each weekend with 'the club'

they support is exacerbated                by the pressing sense of being
excluded from any alternative 'symbolic' world of personal reward
or recognition.



      The   working    class    in    Britain       and     in   other        industrial

societies can be observed as a class that is fractured into many
quite distinct component parts.                 The respectable working class,

gaining a sense of self-worth through labour and immersion in

relatively    integrated       communities,          may    have   gone        forever;
although it was a part of our earlier argument that this sense
of fellow-feeling was 'magically' re-invented, in the scenes of
collaborative activity during the immediate aftermath of the
Leppings Lane crush, and in the ensuing two weeks of 'abnormal'

relations between the Liverpool Club and its supporters, as well

as in the work done by working-class fans from different, often

'competing'    teams    across       the    country        for   the    Hillsborough

Disaster Fund.       It is not at all clear whether this 'magical'
moment can be sustained, in the absence of the industrial base

and   the   social    institutions         which     sustained         that    kind   of

neighbourhood and family based culture of the working class in
the first half of this century.



      With less than eighteen months to go before full economic

integration into the European Community, Government educational

policy in Britain seems to be focussed almost entirely on the
                                               39

introduction       of     a        Core      Curriculum       in    schools,        with     a

significantly increased component of Science and Technology and
a greater attention to the basic skills of reading and writing.

There is very little sense of any major initiative towards the

itroduction of European cultural studies or European history in
schools and only very begrudging support for second language

acquisition.       There is very little feeling that this culture is
about to reposition itself as a full member of the multi-lingual,
multi-cultural European Community, and very little preparation

on the part of major national institutions, like the organised

Football    League      itself,           for a new,        inter-national          European

reality.         Discussions            of   the       problems    that    may   arise      in
international understanding within Europe, including the problems
which might be posed in respect of the education given those 80
per cent of English school-leavers who do not go on to higher

education, and many of whom are active fans of football, are non­
existent.         There       is    a     depressing        sense   that     England

confronting a moment of major cultural and national significance
- has fallen asleep.



     Readers of this chapter may feel that these are strange and
rather speculative premonitions with which to conclude a series

of reflections on a football disaster which occurred, after all,

in the past, but to this I would immediately respond that the

disaster    at    Hillsborough was                 a    predictable       outcome    to    the

remorseless and unthinking application of law and order rhetoric
to the problem of crowd control.49 The real problem confronting

English football,         in the aftermath of the Taylor Report and
Italia 90, I would argue,          is a particular expression of the

general cultural and political challenge confronting the English
and their Governmental representatives : do 'we' want to be a
planned,    cooperative     and    modernising    society   with   new    and

efficient    institutions    and    a range      of   relatively   safe   and

accessible opportunities for sports and entertainment (available
to all,     regardless of gender,       race or age),       located inter­
nationally within the European marketplace?            Or do we want, like
Football Clubs throughout the last one hundred years, to keep
things as they are?

5.   Stephen Edgell has pointed out, in conversation, that
     soccer grounds have also been 'venerated',     in part, as
     architectural icons:    football supporters have retained
     strong affection for particular aspects of the stadia (the
     famous 'cottage' at Fulham, the grand entrance to Villa
     Park main stand, the Clock Stand at Highbury, the concourse
     at Old Trafford, etc.).      It speaks volumes about the
     indifference of 'established opinion' that this form of
     popular interest in the football ground is never reflected
     in recognised literature or talk on the history of British
     architecture.    For further discussion of the football
     ground itself as an arena of sociability,      see Stephen

       grounds (Anfield; St. James Park, Newcastle) can be
       relatively empty some ten minutes before kick-off time and
       then fill up extremely rapidly as fans arrive in their
       masses from local public houses.

      to urinate, exposing themselves when requested to leave.

         reforming Judicial Enquiry, departing from the dominant
         thrust of Government policy and thinking in the Thatcher
         era, by Lord Scarman into his Report into the riots in
         Brixton, Bristol, Toxteth and other urban centres in 1980
         and 1981. Cf. Lord Scarman, The Brixton Disorders. 10-12

         Le isure Management. 10 (2) (1990), pp. 37-38.        It is
         important to note how the Taylor Report takes seriously the
         critiques and denunciation of British football made by the
         Conservative press in the aftermath of the disasters at the
         Heysel and Bradford (in the words of the Sunday Times on 19
         May 1989 'a slum sport played in slum stadiums increasingly
         watched by slum people') but then uses these truths as a
         rationale for a radical modernisation of British football,
         particularly in respect of what it provides for the
         committed fan and, indeed (to use the contemporary language
         of the market) 'the paying consumer'.

27.   Mancunian critics of the all-seater proposal in the Taylor
      Report point to the ways in which visiting fans at
      Manchester City's Maine Road ground consistently prefer to
      stand, rather than sit, on the new seats provided at the
      visitors' end.


28.   One modest step in investigating fans' 'desires' with
      respect to stadium improvement was the survey commissioned
      by the Football League from MORI, released in February 1990
      under the title The Missing Voice. The findings of this
      very limited survey (of only 561 fans, 149 of whom watched
      their football on television) suggested that there is a
      widely-felt interest in 'better refreshment and toilet
      facilities at grounds, more pre-match and half-time
      entertainment, a free Football League magazine and a
      voluntary membership scheme if it also covered free
      admission to local sports and leisure facilities' (David
      Lacey, 'Poll Shows Fans Want Less Than Taylor May Give
      Them', The Guardian. 15 February 1990).


29.   The proposals for a new Premier League were approved
      'overwhelmingly' at a meeting of the full council of the FA
      on 8 April 1991 whilst a set of proposals from the Football
      League (defending the existing 92-club structure of the
      League) was 'flatly' rejected.
      'League Anger at FA "hijack"', The Guardian. 9 April 1991.


30.   'Terrace culture' in the 1980's has been one of the reasons
      for many erstwhile fans and commentators actually deciding
      not to return to soccer. Cf. the account given by Russell
      Davies as to why he was giving up his position as a
      football correspondent for a Sunday newspaper: 'Cockpits of
      Ignobility', Sunday Times. 28 August 1982.     See also the
      powerful polemic of James Walvin, Football and the Decline
      of Britain. London: Macmillan, 1986.


31.   Dr Phil Scraton, Director of the Hillsborough Project
      organised at Edge Hill College in Ormskirk, certainly was
      right in declaring that the Inquest itself, focussed as it
      was procedurally on the minute scrutiny of the death of
      individuals, is an inappropriate instrument for examination
      and analysis of a disaster on the scale of Hillsborough.
      ('Anger Greets Hillsborough Verdict', The Guardian. 29
      March 1991)     What is more difficult from a radical
      perspective is the value of arguing for a verdict of
      unalwful killing (by South Yorkshire Police or Sheffield
      Wednesday F.C.).

32.   Kevar Coombes, leader of Liverpool City Council, quoted in
      syndicated article by James Dalrymple, 'City in Mourning1,
      Ottawa Citizen. 18 April 1989.        The full, powerful
      statement read:    'Nobody will want for anything and
      certainly not money.    We intend to get to every single
      family and make sure they get everything they need. This
      city will look after its own.'

34.   One unfortunate instance of this backtracking was the
      begrudging   discussion  of   the  cost   of  the   Taylor
      recommendations on the part of Mr Derek Dooley and other
      Directors of Sheffield United F.C., televised in the
      episode of the BBC-2 programme, United1 on 19 April 1990.
      Another worrisome instance was the level of interest shown
      by clubs in the conference on Sports Stadia after
      Hillsborough organised by the Sports Council and the Royal
      Institute of British Architects in March 1990: only 11 of
      the 92 League Clubs sent any represenative (The Guardian.
      31 March 1990).

36. Cf. for example, the Report of the House of Commons Home
     Affairs Committee of February 1991, recommending, inter
     j^lia, gradual desegregation of fans, scepticism about the
     importance of all-seater provision in the lower divisions,
     and the criminalisation of racial abuse and missile-
     throwing. The general thrust of this Report was that 'the
     national football authorities     (must) start regarding
     (ordinary fans) as partners in the game, not as fodder for
     exploitation by those who cream off soccer's rich
     pickings'. ('MP's delight fans and League', The Guardian.
     6 February 1991).

       circumstances of football in England, see Vic Duke 'The
       Sociology of Football: a Research Agenda for the 1990s',
       Sociological Review (forthcoming, 1991).

38.   It is intriguing, as well, to remember the many reports by
       English sports journalists in 1989 which suggested that
       these stadia were a pipedream. They would never be ready;
       the organisation would be chaotic and the technology could
      not possibly work.       The convoluted 'Little England'
       sensibilities and prejudices of the average English
       football journalist are a problem which we do not have time
      to address in this essay.

      football confronted the spectre of its vast under­
      capitalisation. Dire warnings were widespread in the early
      1980s about both the financial viability of the 92 clubs
      and the League as a whole.          Cf. my discussion in

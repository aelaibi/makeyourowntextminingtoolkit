I   am   a   member    of   St    John     Ambulance     and   hold   the     rank   of   Divisional
                                                                         i


Superintendent.        On Saturday 15 April 1989 in connection with the semi-final

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Football Clubs I was on duty in the first

aid room of the ground situated next to the police control box under the North

Stand.



I arrived at the ground at 12.50 pm.             There were no other St John Members there

at that time, and as I am not a regular at tender at the ground I did not know

where to find the key to the first aid roan so I stood outside.



The ambulance arrived at about 1.00 pm with                              and one of his members.

I told him that I would be staying in the first aid room during the match,

     and                     arrived and we started to put out the equipment that we

thought we would use on the table and prepared the couches for any casualties.

The other members were told where to go by either                                or Peter Wells, I

am not sure who.       At about 2.30 pm, myself and                          walked round onto the

ground to see if anything was happening.               When we got back to the first aid room

there was a man there who's contact lens had slipped out and was asking for a

^irror so he could get it out.                         & 1                   were assisting him.



At about 2.50 pm, myself and                            walked round onto the ground to watch

the teams come onto the pitch.            When they had done so we returned to the first

aid roan before the kick-off.            At this time there was myself,

           and                   in the    first aid roan.       At approximately 3.05 pm, a

message came over our dedicated radio system, which I believe was something like

"1303, 1304 people are being crushed".            As we did not know where the message was

fran and there was a lot of              background noise      I asked   for the message to be

repeated.        There was no answer to this request.             I later discovered that the
massage had cone fron             I-         «*l             I" P * r0Und t< M r d S

pitch but the entrance to the slope was partly blocked by police do, harpers and

mounted police.   At this point a youth came up the slope carrying his younger

brother who was having an asthma attack and asked if we had any ventolin.              I

explained that we did not but took them round to the first aid roan.             Shortly

afterwards a youth was brought round fra. the pitch with an injury to his l « e r

arm and another youth was carried in on the carrying chair with an ankle injury.

■The youth with the arm injury was sat by the sink and the youth with the ankle

iniury was laid on the couch nearest the door.       I approached one of the county

ambulance man and asked if they had any entonox to help the youth with the a m

injury as he was     in a great deal of pain.      The ambulance man came with the

entonox and a wire splint which he applied to the injured a m .       At this point St

 John Members, police and fans started carrying people round fran the pitch on

 stretchers and advertisement boards.   As there was no space in the first aid roan

 I collected blankets together and put them on the floor outside the first aid

 roar, to lay people on.   S o * of the younger cadets were frightened by the events

 that were happening and requested to go hone - but we felt that this would not be

 a good idea as the traffic situation outside the ground would be very difficult.

   ; driver/attendant of the police cell bus offered to let the cadets sit in the

 front of the bus which they did.

 By this t * . there were quite a lot of people laid on the floor and waiting for

 attention outside    the first aid rear,.    People « r e   caning stating they « r e

  doctors, nurses and medical students and <x»ld they help.     The doctors started to

  check the people who were laid on the floor.     At this stage, I was trying to make

  the r~.-r.le brought round fran the pitch as canfortable as possible and checking

  their breathing and airways where necessary.     One doctor came up to me and asked

  if we could use just one area for the more seriously injured and if we could set

  up a system to put the casulaties into an order of priority for transportation to
  hospital.       I asked in the police control roan and managed to get sane sticky

  labels which I gave to the doctor for this purpose.



  A   police officer    came up and offered    to take any walking casualties to the

  hospital in their transit vans.         We took the youth with the arm injury and a

 young girl who also had an arm injury round to the vans.



 When I got back to the first aid roan there was a man who believed that his

 friend had been killed and was in a very distressed condition.               I tried to

 canfort him.      The Chaplain of Sheffield Wednesday came into the roan and spoke to

 him.      By this time, as far as I can remember, most of the casualties had been

 removed to hospital, but I could not say what time it was.         The only people who

 were about were people trying to find friends and relatives.            It was at this

 stage that we found out how many people had been killed, the number at that time

 was 84.     Most of the members who were on duty were in the first aid roan waiting
 to go    hone.




None of the dead were to my knowledge brought into the first aid roan, but were

  1 taken initially to the gymnasium.




I do not know what time I left the ground, it would probably be sanetime between

5.00 pm and 5.30 pm.       When I left the ground I accompanied a wanan who had heard

the appeal for assistance on the radio and a man frcrn Liverpool who was looking

for his son to the Northern General Hopsital.       The womans name w a s |    1and the

man was     called Barry   (I think his   surname was Devonside).     I stayed at the

Northern General Hospital until about 6.40 pm, when I left to go heme.



At no time during the whole incident was I treated with disrespect or abused by
                                                                              <23

    anyone.   Everyone who offered help was more than willing to do anything asked of

    them without question.

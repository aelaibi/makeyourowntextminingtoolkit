              car        My uncle         lives     in                          ■Halifax,     a l t ho u gh     I d o n ’t kno w the

              as they both had seated tickets                             for the N o r th      stand.          I was     going      to

     leave     them before          the match,          make my way to the L ep pi ng s Ln end and

     then     rejoin      them at full          time     outside.

     Just     before      reaching H i l l s b o r o u g h we           parked our         car on a public               house

     car    park -       I c a n ’t remember what              the      pub was        called or where            it was

     exactly.           We had a drink          there and some              lunch.         It was about           12 m idda

     when we a r r i v e d at        the     pub.       We    stayed for about                1 hour and 20 minute

     and we      left at about           1.20     pm    (1320 hrs).              We    e s ti ma te d about       a 30

     minute walk          to the     ground,        leaving my uncles                  car at        the   public       house.

     On our way to the              ground we d i d n ’t really see much of any other

     s uppo r t e r s    other     than a large          crowd of Liverpool                   fans      leaving     the

     railway station.              T he y were         being e sc or te d         by police           to the ground.

     We saw the          fans    leaving      the      staj^ri3n at about              1.40     pm    (1340 hrs).             We

     didn't     join them but made jfur own w a y .

     I a r r i v e d at H i l l s b o r > w g h at a bout            1.50   pm    (1350 hrs).              I parted wit h

     As    I wal k e d    to the L ep pi n gs L/f end of the ground                           I joined the          crowd o

     Liverpool          fans who     had beer/ e s c orted from the                     railway        station.          I

It was       quite orde rl y          going       through the        t ur ns ti le s      t he ms el ve s and        I

anyone       enter      by any other           means.

Once     inside the en cl os ur e              at the       rear of the West              stand    I stood          in a

I a r ri v ed there were              quite a number           of    people         in the     pen but        it w a s n ’t

just    right        of the    goals.          There was a barrier                  about 5 yds        in front           of

me.     I. d i d n ’t want       to     stand d ir ec tl y next           to a barrier            in case          o-f there

arms    as     they were       pinned        to my side         by the      sheer       bulk of bodies              in the

enclosure.            I had to make            a specific         effort       to    raise my head            to

take    in and as         it   really was           packed and        I found          it d if ficult         to

pusha® down and a g ai ns t                tJre fencing w h i ch      bounds the         pitch.       I could

hjfSr people scr ea mi ng J m d              crying ar ou nd me        because      of the     crush and

the    sheer weight        a g ai ns t      you.     I could feel       the breath         being s q u a sh e d

out    of me as     I was       fo rc ed against        the fencing.           I began to go faint

and    I thought     that       I was       going   to pass out.         I m an a ge d     to get my arms

ab ov e me and grab be d             the    fencing.     I was      dazed    but    I remember            people

pushing me        up and       them    someone      on top of the fencing                pulled me        up by

my arms.        It was     h or ri fi c at this         stage as there were               people      going

blue    faced arou                                                                        Is to escape

It took me a short              time       to regain my breath a nd            I was      badly    shaken.             1

then noticed these              people who were          pushed agai ns t          the    fenc in g    on the

other    side     of the       pens.        It was a truly horrific             sight w h ic h        I

watched,     people were             being    sick over      each other as          though     it was        being

■forced out of them,             they were          so tightly       packed.       The    people at         the

front and against              the    fen cing were all         blue,    their      eyes were         closed

and    they were     quiet ■- I know they ware                  dead.

I tried    to pull at           the    bottom of the fencing myself,                     there were         lots

of    police officers           there as well          doing    their    best      to get     people        over

fencing and        carrying          people     onto   the    playing area.          I n o ti ce d        that    the

game    had been a b a n d o n e d and that            the    players were         leaving     the        pitch.

I did see the        police          carrying away       the    body of a youth,             I saw that

this    youth was        one    of    those who was          next    to me   in the       pen an d who           had

                                                                                                               SI 053

helped to         push me          up an d over        the fencing.          I w at c he d the         policemen

trying         to revive          the y ou th but after a while                they gave         up and    put a

jacket         over    his    face.      He was        dead.

I returned to my task                   of    trying      to pull a wa y the fencing               iydft it was

hopeless j m d we had                no success         in mov i ng    it.      Pe op le               dying    in

So me t im e     later       I h eard over        the     l ou ds peakers      that    people      e sc aping        from

the    pens should make                their way out so           I m ov ed on towards             the N o r th

me.      I joined him              in the stand and he a sk ed me                  if I was alright.                 I

was    quite shaken               but a pa rt    from the grazes            on my     chest      I was    ok.        My

uncle       took me from the             ground and           I walked      towards w here we            had    parked

the    c a r „The whole            incident was         the most h or rific           thing      that    I have

ever     experienced.               I believe      that the sole            problem was          that    every on e

was    d ir ected to the             centre      pens     in the West        stand and that             someone

sh ou ld have         been there         to send other           suppo rt er s      to the       sides.        There

wa sn ' t      stewards       on duty        in the enc lo su re at          the    rear    of the West          stand

nor were         there an y signs             giving      i ns tr uctions      or directions.             As the

game     got under way              people      just    ran    into   the    pens     causing a surge            and

then the         people       inside     like me were           crushed a ga in st         the    fencing.

          managed       to get                   but          most      of them just s^J y e d under           the        crowds.

          As    I was     climbing       over    the fencing             po^i^en

          fence and screaming              for    people to move brack but                     it had no effect

          there were        so man y      people        packed       intorthe         pen that     they were         just      hel>

          there and there was              no escape.               L/also      saw towards        the back         of the

          pens    that     people were          being        looted out of the               crowd by others          who

          were    reaching        down from       the        balcony above            in the seated          part    of the

          stand,

          Prior    to my     climbing       onto        the    fencing         I wasyftanding          next to a couple

          who w ere       pinned agai ns t        the fence             next    to/me.       There was a ma n who




                                                                                                                     I can't

      1   remember a n y t h in g        of the       clothing          he was wearing.

          This    man had his arms a r o u n d a w om an who                      1 presume was          his g i rl f r i e n d

          or wife.         He was    holding          her from behind a nd she was                     facing       the

          f encing      with him behind,              I was     initial l ^ n e x t          to the girl.

          The girl        was white       s k i n n e d also and brad 1ong m o u s ey                 coloured       hai r

          w h i c h was    draped over          her     sho^uldej^T.           I c o u l d n ’t say how old she was

          or give any facial              deta il s      of^_^rer as her          head was       forced down an d              into

          The    couple were        in great          d i f fi c ul t y and      I m a n a g e d to    pull m ys el f a w a y

          from them and onto              the    fence,        the man was          s c re am in g and       I can remember

          his    head was        forced back and              he was       facing       upwards.       He was

          obviously        conscious at          this        time    but    I h eard nothing           from the girl,
                                                                                                               PAGE

she was motionless.

A fter     I had dropped          down off the             fencing an d onto the track at the

other      side    I had to       lie on the          pitch for a time to regain my senses,

1 then         looked up towards             the    fencing and       I saw the mans             face who        I

have     just     d e sc ri be d and who           I was    standing       next    to.     What     I saw

ho r r i f i e d me so muc h         that     I just       began to scream unco nt ro ll ab ly .                     He

was    still      trap p ed     in the same          position an d his            f a ce had been forced

into     the     fencing.        His    face had       changed       colour and was            bright         blue,

his    eyes were wide            open and the          pupils       had    rolled    back      into      his    head.

I could see the f lesh of his face                          being    f or c ed thro ug h the            squares       of

the wire         fencing.        He wasn't moving at all                   and    I feared that           he was

dead.

As    I looked a ro u nd this man                  I saw that       other    people who were              packed

a g ai n s t   the fencing wer e             climbing all        over      him,    the    people        on top of

him were         being    sick and       I could       see that       he was       covered       in vomit.            I

couldn't         see the girl          who   had been w ith him taut I was                   so upset          and

c o n fused that         it may      have     been that       I just       didn't    notice       her.

It was my natural               instinct       to run to the          fence and to start and                    pull

at    it from the bot to m w hi ch                 I did wit h all         my s tr en gt h but          it was

useless.          I stayed       by this man          pulling at          the fence       until    I was moved,

on by some         police       officers.

Since      this    incident       I have       seen new sp ap er          pictures and         reports         on the;

t e l e v i s i o n w hi ch have       clearly shown this man trap pe d be hi nd                         the

fencing.          The    pictures       I have seen of him depict                   him w it h his            face

pushed         into the fenc in g and as I remember                       him just       prior    to my

f r u it l e s s a tt em pt s    to free       him.        I don't    know what          h ap pe n ed    to the man

after     this     or whet he r        he was       taken out alive,             I can't     recall       seeing

him at all after              that     time.

There      is nothing         further        that    I can add,       the only speci fi c               things       that

I can      recall       I have    given,       e v er yt hi ng   else      is just a jumble              of

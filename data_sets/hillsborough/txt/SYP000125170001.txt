 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL     INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THAT IF THE SIDE FENCING IN PENS 3-4 HAD BEEN DOWN ALLOWING ACCESS TO

 THE OUTER PENS THIS TRAGEDY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE NOT OCCURRED.        ALCOHOL SHOULD

 NOT BE CONSUMED IN A PUBLIC PLACE AND THE LAWS SHOULD BE REVISED TO

 ^OMODATE       THIS.

 AT LARGE MATCHES BARRIERS SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE ROADWAY AND FANS CHANNELLED

 THROUGH THESE UP TO THE TURNSTILES.

 LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE SPION K O P .     THE VENUE SHOULD ALSO BE

 CHANGED.      DUE TO THE DIFFICULT APPROACH TO THE LOCATION FROM LIVERPOOL.

            Dear Sir,

            re: My Client;

            I act on behalf of


            My client was injured as a result of the crush          in the Leppings Lane Stand
            at Hillsborough Stadium on Saturday 15th April          1989.

            I am aware that a police enquiry is being undertaken and may be that the
            officers involved will wish to interview my client. He has indicated his
            willingness to be interviewed if you so desire.

            Mv client lost his watch at the ground that Saturday and wonders if it has
            been recovered. Apparently it is of a "Sovill el T itus" make it is white
            with a black strap, roman numerals and the i n i t i a l s o n the face.

             If it has been found, perhaps you could advise how my client can recover it.

            My client will be making a claim for personal injury and I am contacting
            the Liverpool Law Society whom I understand are co-ordinating such claims.

             Yours faithfully,
                                                 -SOUTH YORKS. POMaa

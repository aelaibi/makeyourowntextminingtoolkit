At    11.20 am         ( 1120       hrs)            I commenced            f oo t pat rol             in    company with PC1S91

incident         involving           football             fans    occurred              i nsi de .          These      f ans       believed

the     pavement.            They        had       been    noisy       but      not      causing            any     particular

problems.            About      1.00          pm    ( 1 3 0 0 hrs)        myself         and      other         Officers           attended

the     pub as a        result           of a       report       of a d i s t u r b a n c e            occurring             in sid e.         On

our    arrival         I found           t hat      the    pub wa s        full         but    relatively              qu i e t .        I

prevent       any      recurrence.                  The    premises          were        then         c losed.         No     other

During             the    t i me     I was         on d u t y         on P e n i s t o n e        Rd a       l a r ge      number           of      fa ns

from          the     general           direction            of       the      city       c ent re.          In g e n e r a l         the        f a ns

were          in h i g h       spirits           but     w el l       behaved.              Some      appeared             to       have       been

drinking             and a few were                    in    possession                of      cans     of    beer.             The       f an s

continued                to m a k e       their        way       to    the         g r o u n d at a s t e a d y            rate       u n t il        just

this          p o in t    we     began        to m a k e         our     way        towards          the     gro u n d .




As    we a p p r o a c h e d            the      ground PS T h om ps on                     informed          our       serial            that        there

had       been        some       trouble           inside          the      ground and               t hat    f an s       were       injured.

The       c a us e       of    the      trouble          was       not      k n o w n at        this       time      but        I t oo k         it to

mean          that       there       ha d     been       fighting              between          fans.         As     we w a l k e d            further

PS Thompson                   informed           us    t ha t      we m i g h t        be      required           to go         inside           the

Whilst         I was        standing           in f r o n t       of    the N o r t h S t a n d            I saw several

apparently             injured          f ans     being       assisted             by o t h e r       f a ns    from       the

being       carried          on m a k e s h i f t       stretchers              (made       from advertising                     boards).

As    this       was      going        on     (Liverpool)              fans     in the N o r t h S t a n d w e r e                 shouting

and    the       other       Officers            remained          in the          line as           instructed.              More       and

more     f ans       were        being       assisted         by P o l i c e         although          the m a j o r i t y w e r e

being       helped          by    fellow         fans.




After       about         ten m i n u t e s       several          fan s       came    onto          the    pitch       from       the

the    injured            fans.         They      then       carried           them    over          towards         the L e p p i n g s       Ln

begun       to    drift          further         towards          the     centre       of       the    pitch an d            turning

their       backs         on the        crowd.          Injured           f a ns     were       still       being       assisted           from

end    of      the     ground          to    help.



On arrival             at    the L e p p i n g s        Ln    end       of     the    ground          I saw a         l a rg e     number

of    f a ns     milling         about         in a d a z e d          sta t e .      Some       were       slightly          injured

but    the m a j o r i t y a p p e a r e d            to     be    looking           for    friends.              A few       f an s     were

lying       on the          p i tc h    receiving            first        aid      from ambulance,                   fire     and      police

Officers.              Many       fans       were     still        carrying           boards          to    t h at    end     of    the

ground         but     by t his         t i me    they were             no     longer       required            but     were       j ust

obstructing               those        people a t t e n di ng             to    the    injured.                Many Police

Officers          were       wandering            about       as       if not        knowing          what      to    do.        I tried

to    help       the      injured and advise                      those        looking          for    friends          and
relatives.             Many     f an s    were       expressing               their        anger       at    the P o l i c e

Officers        at     that     end      of    the    ground and               blaming           them       for    what       had

happened and            the     lack      of a s s i s t a n c e         afterwards.




The L ep pi ng s        Ln    terrace          s t il l    contained              several         fa ns      who    were

apparently agitated                   by t he        proceedings.                 During          t his      time a          scuffle

broke     out     b e t w e e n a s m al l          number         of    f a ns    on      the    terrace.           With          other

Officers        I went        onto       the       terrace         to    c al m    them         down.        Whilst          on    the

terrace      I heard          fans       talking          amongst            themselves           about       other          f a ns

stealing        property          from        the    terraces.                I saw        that    there was             a

considerable            quantity          of       property abandoned                      on    the    terracing.                 After

things      had      calmed       down        on    the    terracing              I returned            to    the    pitch.




After     a short         t i me a n a n n o u n c e m e n t            came      over      the    public a d d re s s                system

that     the m a t c h w o u l d         be a b a n d o n e d a n d          t ha t     f a ns    should          remain          in the

ground      u n t il    asked      to     leave.           Shortly after                   t h is a f u r t h e r

announcement            was     made      asking          the      f an s    to    leave         the    ground.              I then

assisted        in     clearing          the       ground and            the      pitch.          When       this    was          complete

I returned           to P e n i s t o n e      R d at      4.40         pm    ( 1 6 4 0 h r s ) to          join    the       remainder

taki ng     place.           I saw a          large       group         of y o u t h s      running          away    up       the      park

unconf i r m e d .        The     youths           were    w a r n e d a n d all o w e d           to       conti nue         on      the i r

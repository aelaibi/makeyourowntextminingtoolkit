 I am getting increasingly concerned that we have still not sent a substantive response to Walker Morris about
 our reasons for not intervening. It must look as if we have something to hide - or even as if we are only now, at
 this late stage, trying to think of some reasons. This, of course, is far from being the case; but the longer we
 leave it, the more suspicious it must look and the less likely will Walker Morris be to accept what we say at face
 value (assuming that they ever were, which might be an heroic assumption). Is Sue Ross still considering the
 matter? Would you please let me know as a matter of urgency what the present position is? When are we likely
 to get Sue's advice and by when do we expect to reply to Walker Morris? I should like to have some firm dates,
 please. If Sue wants to discuss the matter, I am ready to do so at the earliest opportunity.

         Dear Mr and Mrs Church,

         Thank you for your letter of the 5th September 1994.

         I can confirm that Dr. West had now received from Atkinson and Firth
         correspondence dated 2 3rd August 1994 together with some paperwork
         and four videotapes.    Unfortunately the envelope arrived in very
         poor condition and although they mention the enclosure of a
         photograph of Gary this was absent.

          Dr.  West  is at present    on  annual                                           leave            but           will              see        the
          correspondence upon his return.

          Yours sincerely,




          Secretary1

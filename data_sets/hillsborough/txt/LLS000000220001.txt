    Mr. JUSTICE HIDDEN:                              These two actions come before me as test

          actions, following upon the order of the Honourable Mr. Justice

          Rose on 14th May, 1990.
B
                      On that date he ordered that                       "there be a test action on

          pre-death pain and suffering with an estimated length of hearing

          of half a day, to be tried immediately following the actions on

          the 19th June.”                            He ordered that the writ be served within 7

          days with Statement of Facts annexed,                              and that there be trial

          without pleadings pursuant to Order 18 Rule 21 of the Rules of

          the Supreme Court.

                      The first action is in the names of Sarah Louise Hicks, and
D
         her sister Victoria Jane Hicks, both of them suing by the joint

          administrators of their estates,                              Jennifer and Trevor Hicks.     The

          defendant is Peter Wright,                              sued as the Chief Constable of South

         Yorkshire Police.
E
                      The claim endorsed on the writ is for "damages on behalf of

         their Estates pursuant to the Law Reform (Miscellaneous

         Provisions) Act 1934,                               in respect of injuries suffered by them

P        prior to their death on 15th April,                               1989 at the Hillsborough

         Football Stadium,                               Sheffield, caused by the negligence of the

         Defendant, his servants or agents."                                It is important to stress

         at the outset that that is all that is endorsed on the writ;

G        there is no claim under the Fatal Accidents Act for the

         dependants.

                      The Statement of Facts reads:

                      "The deceased were 15 and 19 years of age respectively and
                                                                                                   t

                                                              2

                   attended the match in Pen 3.                      They were both in good health

                   on entry to the Pen.                    Both plaintiffs died as a result of

                   the crushing in Pen 3.                    The injuries sustained by both

                   plaintiffs are contained in Post-Mortem report attached.

                   Prior to their deaths the crowd pressure built up

                   substantially.                    The Plaintiffs rely on chapters 1 to 5

                   inclusive of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report.

                               The plaintiffs will rely in particular on facts set

                   out in paragraphs 71 to 77 of chapter A of Lord Justice

                   Taylor's Interim Report, and will ask the Judge to infer

                   that the Deceased prior to their death suffered, firstly,

                   apprehension of serious injury or death for a period of

                   between 20 and 30 minutes,                     and pain due to crushing

                   injuries and breathless"(n e s s ) "of increasing intensity

                   over a similar period."

                   Material words in that Statement of Facts are that the

       Plaintiffs "will ask the Judge to infer" the conclusions therein

       set out.

                   The second of these claims is between James Wafer                      (suing as

       Administrator of the estate of the late Colin Wafer) as

       plaintiff, and Peter Wright (sued as Chief Constable of South

       Yorkshire Police) as defendant.                              In this action damages are

       sought by the endorsement on the writ, not only for negligence

       of the defendant, his servants or agents, but also for "breaches

       of statutory duty of the Defendant, his servants or agents,

       and/or the operation by him, his servants or agents, of the

       defective system of working."                              The Statement of Facts in this

       case mirrors the Statement of Facts in the other.
 ■s 6 C o . / w. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D                                             t




                                                    3

           Again,            I point out that this is a claim only in relation to

damages on behalf of the estate of the deceased under the Lav

Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934.                        There is no claim

for the dependants under the Fatal Accidents Act.

           The only other pleading to which I need refer is the

Further and Better Particulars of the Statement of Facts served

in the Hicks' case, which pleaded that the period of

apprehension of serious injury or death, and the period of pain,

"probably began at about 2.40 p.m. or thereabouts."

           Although the order of Rose J. of 14th May of this year had

ordered that there be a single test action on pre-death pain and

suffering, these two actions were,                       in fact, called on before me

and heard at one and the same time on the afternoon of 25th June

when the earlier Hillsborough cases finished.                        I consented to

hear them together, though I am not aware today of any formal

order to that effect.                        Indeed, on my enquiry, counsel have

informed me that there was no such order.                        That has been

corrected by my ordering the consolidation which had, de facto,

taken place.

          By any reckoning what happened to these three young people

was horrific and arouses the strongest of emotions, with great

sympathy for their relations and pity for the deceased

themselves.                   I say that at the outset because there are claims

here which have about them something novel, something of a novel

approach to the problem of dealing with litigation which follows

death.           Where death occurs to a young person, where death is

near to instantaneous, or indeed instantaneous,                       it inevitably
    ; L L L E R S 6 C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




                                                                  4

           causes the strongest of emotions and those emotions do not

           always fall into categories which can adequately be dealt with

           by the complications of the law.

                        I have mentioned already the two different ways in which
B
           actions, under particular Statutes,                          normally follow the death of

           a party.                 Those are really two different routes by which two

           different categories of person (who may well in the end be the

           same person) bring actions against a defendant for different

           heads of damage.

                        In these cases there are not both those routes employed,

           there is one route only; the action under the Law Reform

            (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act and not an action under the Fatal
D
           Accidents Act.                           It follows that I have here to deal with a

           subject of the most harrowing in relation to claims which fall

           to be determined in relation to legal principles,                         but deal only

           with the topics covered by one particular Statute,                         the Law
E
           Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934.                          Put in a different

           and less legalistic way,                         it is essential to grasp at the outset

           the vital difference between what these actions seek by way of

p         remedy, and what they do not seek.

                        These actions do not seek damages against the defendant in

           relation to the deaths of either of these two sisters,                          or of

           Colin Wafer.                       Sarah and Victoria Hicks and Colin Wafer,     as I

G         have said, died in the most tragic of circumstances at

           Hillsborough on 15th April,                         1989, but I cannot stress too

           emphatically that these actions are not to seek damages                          in
                                                                                             «


           respect of those deaths.                          Those are matters which are yet to

H
    C L L E R S 6 C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




           come, or may be yet to come, and they are certainly not before

           the Court at this time.

                        What is before the                   Court today are claims for pre-death

           pain and suffering in the case of each plaintiff from about 2.40
B          p.m. and                   lasting for a period of between twenty and thirty

           minutes.                     Indeed, Mr. Hytner put the claim bluntly as being for

            "a very short period culminating                         in death, and that is a l l . ”

                        The           way he put his case was this.          He   said the defendant

           has accepted - for the purpose of these cases - a breach of duty

           towards those killed and injured in the Pens at the Leppings

           Lane end of the ground.                          Mr. Hytner said that the evidence

           pointed to overcrowding,                          leading to discomfort by about 2.40
D
           p.m., and crushing sufficient to cause death at various times

           thereafter, depending upon the precise location.                             The

           probability, he said, was that all those who died had done so by

           about 3.10 p.m.                           He said that in respect of many deceased there
E
           was specific evidence of their suffering prior to death,                             but in

           other cases all that could be proved was that they were alive in

           Pens 3 and 4 prior to the crushing,                          and were later discovered to

           be dead.                 He said the action in respect of Colin Wafer, who was

           aged 19, was an example of the latter category,                           that in respect

           of Sarah and Victoria Hicks of the former category,                            though not

           necessarily in any way representative of them.

                       As to the separate                    cases, the evidence in the case   of Colin
G
           Wafer was that he was found dead after the crushing was

           complete.                  The evidence in relation to Sarah and Victoria Hicks
                                                                                                «




           was as follows: Victoria Hicks was 15 years of age and she and

H
                                                                                                         (
    S E L L E R S 6 C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




             her 19 year old sister, Sarah, were in Pen 3.                               At about 2.45

             p.m. Victoria was seen to be crying and in some distress.                                  Ten

             minutes later Sarah was seen holding Victoria up.                               Victoria

             appeared to be unconscious.                           After the failure of the crash
B
             barrier Sarah was seen to be lying on her back and was later

             carried on to the pitch, as was Victoria.                            Both girls were given

             the kiss, of life and other efforts were made to resuscitate them

             by their father,                          among others.   They both died.

                          I break off to say that those last parts of the submission

             show how enormously distressing and life shattering those events

             must have been to their father,                           and to others.     I stress that,

             while looking at the emotional aspect of the claim I have to
D
             try: later I shall have to stress analytical and academic

             aspects of the claim too.

                         Mr. Hytner went on to say that the issue was: what is the

             proper quantum of damage to be awarded to the estates of those
E
             deceased in respect of their pre-death previous pain and

              suffering ?                    As to Colin Wafer, he submitted that the Court

              should accept as a probable implication from the known facts,

„           that from about 2.40 p.m., or shortly thereafter, he suffered
r
              discomfort and shortly afterwards he began to be apprehensive

              for his safety,                        and that apprehension,   coinciding with extreme

              discomfort developing swiftly into asphyxia and pain in the

G           chest itself, developed into fear until in the final minutes

              there would have been severe pain, asphyxia and the certain

             knowledge of impending death.

                          That, I have to emphasise, was a submission of counsel that

H
                                                                                               t

                                                              7

       the Court should accept as a probable implication.                           It was a

       description of what may or may not have happened, and it was put

       fairly by Mr. Hytner, not as something which was the subject of

       proof, but as something which could be inferred or implied - a

       probable implication from the known facts.

                   Mr. Hytner went on to say that the sum to be awarded should

       be in a higher bracket than that to be awarded for a living

       plaintiff who experienced the same suffering, for example, who

       was rendered unconscious but recovered.                           He was suggesting that

       exactly the same experience to someone who, in fact, recovered,

       in some way should be rewarded with lower damages than would be

       awarded to someone who did not recover.                           The logic of that, I am

       afraid, escapes me.                           The experience is the same, and any damages

       that are awarded for the previous suffering cover the same

       experience whether there is recovery or whether there is not.

                   He submitted further, that all life must end in death and

       paradoxically, therefore,                          a peaceful and painless death is

        itself an amenity of life.                          To be deprived of such a death, but

        on the contrary to be subjected to a painful and terrifying

        death must, he said, be judged a very serious loss of amenity of

        l if e .

                    That argument had about it certain difficulties.                   There was

        at one time a cause of action for loss of expectation of life,

       but that cause of action ceased to be available after 1982.                                 It

        seemed to me at the time - and indeed the point was taken by Mr.

        Woodward a little later - that really an argument was being

        mounted on the basis that there still was an action for loss of

        expectation of life when,                         in fact, there was not.

                                                                8

               Mr. Hytner vent on to submit that in awarding damages for

   pain and suffering, Judges conventionally tend toward

   comparatively modest sums for past pain and suffering.                                   He said

   that that tendency appeared to be based on the philosophy that

   time is a great healer, and past suffering is soon forgotten,

   subsumed in the pleasures or concentrated activities associated

   with daily life.                              He said that these deceased had no such

   opportunity to compensate for their suffering at Hillsborough.

               That, of course,                      is true.       But, again, in one sense it

   seems to be approaching the now no longer available action for

   loss of expectation of life.                                 In another sense it seems to be

   ignoring the fact that, where there is a recovery from a

   situation leading to unconsciousness, when the case involving

   that plaintiff's injuries eventually comes to trial, whether or

   not there are awarded damages for that particular incident of

   the actual infliction of the injury may be hard to isolate in

   relation to the overall figures awarded for the whole history of

   the effects of the injuries.

               The evidence put before me comprised an agreed bundle of

   documents PI, which included pleadings as well as grants of

   letters of administration, and the first five chapters of Lord

   Justice Taylor's Report.                              There were also transcripts of

   evidence from the Taylor Inquiry, and from the inquests,                                  reports

   prepared for the Coroner of South Yorkshire, and medical

   reports.

               The remaining evidence consisted of the testimony of Mr.

   Ian Clarke, who was at Hillsborough in Pen 3 at the material
E L L E R S 6 C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D




       time, and who gave graphic and credible evidence of what he had

       seen and felt in the crush.                                 He had blacked out and only came

       round when he was being resuscitated by a policeman.                                 He agreed

       in cross-examination that what he told me was nothing different

       from what he had,                             in fact, told Lord Justice Taylor.     That

       evidence is part of the bundle in this case in PI, and,

       accordingly, I do not need to review his evidence further.

                   Mr. Hytner cited no authorities in relation to what might

       be the proper sum to award in these circumstances, but put the

       matter attractively and ingeniously by submitting that an award

       which was measured in less than four figures would be

       appeallable, as would one that was measured in five.

       Translating that, what he was saying was, if the award were as

       low as £900 it would be appeallable, but if it were as high as

       £10,000 it would                              be appeallable by the other side.

                   I deal in those figures in what I have to say to indicate

       that this sort of area was being suggested with a lower and a

       higher figure of the differentiation indicated in that bracket.

       I also draw attention to                              the figures in order to indicate that

       we are not in this claim                              dealing with a matter which would

       attract damages of anything, even on the plaintiffs higher end

       of the bracket, higher than £9,000 or so, and that figure

       stretched downwards to a                              potential figure of £1,000 or so.     So

       that the type of                              claim that is being brought is not a claim for

       vast sums by way                              of damages,   it is a much more modest matter.     I

       stress that because there can be no suggestion that the

       plaintiffs'                   actions are being brought in any way for motives of

       a desire for money,                             or any form of greed.

                         Mr. H y t n e r 1s next submissions in relation to what the

             awards should be,                             if awards were to be made, were that since on

             the evidence at 2.45 p.m. Victoria was crying and distressed,

             and that later Victoria appeared to be unconscious and was being
B
            held up by Sarah, the inference was that Victoria must have met

            her death first and, therefore,                                a higher sum should be awarded

             to Sarah than to Victoria.                             That was the submission,    and I shall

            have to look at it in just a little detail later on in my
C
            judgment, because, again, I was being invited to infer that

            Victoria must have met her death first, and I was, on that

            basis, being asked to arrive at a higher sum for Sarah than for

            Victoria.
D
                        Mr. Hytner finally submitted that the plaintiffs had

            suffered a loss of quality of life by the substitution of the

            painful and terrifying death for some other death,                                and this was

             a very serious loss of amenity of life.                                He submitted that the
E
            sort of damages that should be awarded for this period of time

            of pain and suffering in someone who died, should be put into a

            wholly different and higher bracket than for someone who

            survived after,                         for instance,     losing consciousness and then

            recovering.

                        That then was the entirety of the plaintiffs'                         case,   and no

            further evidence was called thereafter.                                 I have to confess that

            since then, and even as I give this judgment,                                I find myself

            struggling to resolve a conflict between two different emotions

            those emotions are at one and the same time sympathy and
                                                                                                      m

         and for Colin Wafer,                        and for their unhappy parents at the loss

         of young lives and probable ruination of older ones.                           But I have

         at the same time a degree of puzzlement as to hov the lav can

         even begin to assess the extent of the agony those young people

         vent through, in order to come to a figure of pounds and pence

         as legal compensation for pre-death pain and suffering.                             I have

          a degree of doubt as to vhether it is an exercise that the lav

         should embark upon at all                        in circumstances such as these.

                     One can test the problem by looking at Mr. H y t n e r 's

          submission in relation to Sarah and Victoria.                         He says that at a

          particular time in this very short period someone sav that Sarah

          looked as though she vas trying to hold up Victoria, vho vas

          unconscious.                    Therefore, he says,      the figure for Sarah's estate

          should be higher than the figure for Victoria's.

                     There is at one and the same time an avful logic in that,

          and an avful sense of unreality.                         Who knovs vhat suffering those

          tvo sisters vent through ?                        Who knovs vhich actually suffered

          the greater physical pain ?                        Who knovs vhich vas actually the

          more affected by emotional distress ?                         I confess at once that I

          do not, and, further,                       I do not see that there is any vay in

          vhich I can be put into possession of that knovledge,                           that

          proof.             I do not consider that the judicial process, vhich has

          at all times to guard itself against speculation and insist on

          proof, is equipped to ansver the problem in the absence of

          evidence.

                      Take, for instance,                the case of the tvo sisters.      What

          happened to each of them was different,                        as is, indeed,    submitted

                                                               12

         by Mr. Hytner.                          What happened to Mr.     Clarke, the witness who vas

         call ed , must have been, and was, different in turn from what

        happened to either of the tvo sisters.                               I am concerned as to how

         I could ever finish the sentence, vhich every Judge has to
B
         pronounce to himself in every case:                              "I am satisfied on the

         balance of probabilities t h a t                             "

                     What happened to those three young people,                      Sarah and

         Victoria Hicks, and Colin Wafer,                            in the twenty to thirty minutes
C
         from 2.40 p.m. onvards on the afternoon in question is, I

         consider,                 a matter vhich is beyond proof and it is only in proof

         - pompous though this sounds - that the lav deals.                              It is

         different vhen someone lives on after some dreadful incident to
D
         them. Where someone like Mr. Clarke                              is put through an agonising

         experience in vhich he loses consciousness, but then happily

         recovers and survives the experience,                             then there is proof of

         vhat that experience vas like.                             There is proof because he can
E
         prove it from the vitness box in his claim for the pain and

         suffering and loss of amenities vhich he suffered in relation to

         his injuries.

                      Again, vhen someone dies an action can be brought in court

         for that death, and all the elements involved in that death for

         vhich the lav allovs recompense can be made the subject of

         proof.               That is the more normal course, and that involves the

         using of both the Statutes I have mentioned in the claim.

         Dealing with, again, strictly the question of death it may be,

         for instance, that the poor man or voman has had horrific

         burning and has lived on for tvo or three days in agony,

H




                                                                                                    r

   sometimes drugged, sometimes conscious, until eventually life

   has given out.                           Then there is proof because his nurses and

   doctors who tended him, his family and friends who sought to

   give comfort, can all testify as to what actually happened.

   Then the lav has material upon vhich to vork, and the material

   is not regarded as speculation but hard fact.

                  I turn to consider the submissions of Mr. Woodvard for the

   defendant.                      He argued that the plaintiffs vere looking for tvo

   things.                  First, damages for pain and suffering for misery and

   hurt, and, secondly, for a claim for damages for loss of life in

   the sense of a loss of expectation of life, meaning the chance

   of death in a different manner.                                He put it, that, vhile Mr.

   Hytner vas suggesting that he vas not seeking to restore the nov

   defunct claim for loss of expectation of life, since an

    expectation of life must include an expectation of death, what

   Mr- Hytner vas, in fact, seeking to claim vas the loss of a

    chance of dying in a happier vay.

                  As I have already pointed out, the right to claim damages

    for loss of expectation of life as a separate head of damage has

    nov been abolished by Section 1 1(a) of the Administration of

    Justice Act 1982.                              The learned text book vriter of McGregor on

    Damages at p. 968, paragraph 1533 notes that abolition and says:

                   "By section 1 of the 1982 Act the right to damages for loss

                   of expectation of life is abolished and by section 4(2) the

                   right to damages for prospective loss of earning capacity

                   during the so-called lost years is taken av a y ."

    He goes on to indicate vhat the effect has been.                               He says:
                                                                                        (

                 "This does indeed leave recovery for loss by way of pain

                 and suffering,              loss of amenities, medical expenses and loss

                 of earnings all accruing before the death, but whereas

                 damages for loss of expectation of life and for prospective

                 earnings were unaffected by the fact that the death, as is

                 common, vas instantaneous or followed upon the injury,

                 damages for the remaining heads are likely to be of little

                  or no consequence in such circumstances."

                  The large aspect of the remaining heads there described

     include here questions of pain and suffering before death.

                  Mr. Woodward moved on to consider the injury vhich caused

     death, namely traumatic asphyxia, and said that it led very

     rapidly to unconsciousness.                      He quoted the evidence of Dr.

     Slater before the Coroner, that:

                   "One normally believes that in traumatic asphyxial deaths

                  unconsciousness occurs rapidly, usually vithin a fev

                  seconds.             I vould suggest, perhaps, between five and

                   fifteen seconds.             Unconsciousness normally continues,   and

                   the individual unfortunately passes avay after a further,

                   say, three to five minutes vhen the brain is affected."

     Dr. Slater said in further evidence to the Coroner, that in an

     asphyxial situation a person becomes unconscious vithin anything

     from zero to twenty to thirty seconds,                     and that as soon as a

     person became unconscious pain modalities and discomfort again

     disappeared very, very quickly, perhaps within a second or five

     seconds.

                   Mr. Woodvard cited the evidence given by Dr. Gumbert to the
                                                                                                             i

        Coroner, seeking to describe the movement from slight

        unconsciousness to deep unconsciousness in these words:

                     "I think slipping from slight unconsciousness to deep

                     unconsciousness in this circumstance,                          1.     because of the

                     compression, and 2. because of the asphyxia,                             and 3, because

                     as Dr. Slater again explained everything is shoved up into

                     the-head, and so there is nothing moving around,                             it would

                     have been very quick, almost as quick as a rabbit punch I

                     would have thought."

         These quotations summarise the medical evidence before me which,

         of course, I accept.

                     Mr. Woodward cited those words in posing the questions:

         what is it proved an individual suffered ?                                  Was there any pain

         and suffering ?                               He stressed the word "a n y " .    Was there any pain

         and suffering ?                               It is here that all parties in this case are,

         in a sense, on the horns of a dilemma.

                      This action is a difficult one for the defendant to defend,

         but it is equally a difficult one for the plaintiffs to bring

         because, of course,                              in order to submit arguments in support of a

         successful claim for damages, counsel for the plaintiff is

          compelled to seek to establish longer agony, longer pain,                                    longer

          suffering than his clients, the plaintiffs,                                    in their natural

         human emotions, will want to believe in.                                   Any parent,    any person

          who has lost any loved one, wants to believe that the loss was

          as instantaneous as possible because of the love and affection

          they have had for that person.                                  It is, therefore,    in a sense,

          anomalous that by bringing the claim which is brought in these

                                                                   16

A           cases, they are forced into the position of arguing against that

            vhich they truly want to believe.                             It is, again, for this reason

             that I vonder if this is a route that the lav should travel dovn

             in coming to its conclusions.

                        Counsel for the defendant also cautioned against

             speculation, and made the point that fear vas not compensable

            vithout some injury relating to it.                             He cited the case of

            Behrens -v- Bertram Mills [1957] 2 Q.B.                             1 , in relation to the
C
             injuries of the vife of a midget in a circus vhen trampled on by

             elephants, and her husband's shock.                             The point he vas making vas

             in relation to mental suffering and physical injury and the

             argument that injury aftervards makes that vhich vas not
D
             compensable, compensable.

                        It vas vhen he came to the end of his submissions that he

             faced his greatest difficulty.                             Inevitably, because of the

             emotions that cannot help but affect people vhen they consider
E
             incidents of this sort, he had to put forvard the unattractive

             argument that I should,                         in fact,    avard no damages in this case

             at all.              When he made those submissions,                that really there could

P          only be an avard of damages                          if it vas proved that there vas pain

             and suffering that vas more than minimal, he had to go on to say

             that there had been no such proof.                             In the spirit of the moment

             I asked him, perhaps rather tersely and coldly, vhether he vas

G          suggesting that these vere cases vhere nothing should be avarded

             by vay of damages.                          His reply vas that he vas.     It vas a reply

             vhich vas, at that time, both conscientious and courageous.

             What he vas saying vas that if it vas proved that there vas more

       than minimal suffering, damages should be modest, but it really

       vas not proved.

                    His final submission amounted to this: that on the

       evidence it vas not, and could not be proved, that the suffering

       vas of more than a very short duration,                   and if that vas the

       position then no avard of damages should follov.                    That vas a

      hard, difficult and unattractive submission to make in vhat vas

       bound to be an emotional situation.                    It had, hovever, to be made

       and it has to be considered.

                    In the case of Reeves and Butcher [1891] 2 Q.B. 504 at 511

      Fry L.J.                said about the function of the Court:

                    "We have not to determine vhether the defence here set up

                   is handsome or conscientious,            but vhether it is good at lav

                   - and I am of the opinion that it is."

                   I have to say that, stepping back from all emotion,            and

      trying to look as analytically as I can at the problem, that I

      am of the opinion that the defendant's submissions in this case

      are correct.

                   When I listened to them as they vere uttered it may veil be

      that I reacted to them in a critical manner, but the more I have

      sought to stand back from the emotion of the events,                    the more I

      have concluded that vhere there has tragically been a death, the

      exercise of seeking to separate pre-death pain and suffering

      from the fact of death is not one vhich the lav is equipped to

      carry out, at least in circumstances such as these vhen death is

      svift and sudden as shovn by the medical evidence.                     I regret
                                                                                  »




      that I cannot find it possible to find for these plaintiffs, but
C Li-C RS a   C O . / W. L L O Y D W O O D L A N D                                              t




                                                               18

      I console myself that in such cases there exists the more

      conventional route for actions under the Fatal Accidents Act for

      damages for the actual deaths of their loved ones, including,

      where appropriate, for bereavement.

                   Accordingly, not without regret,                    I find for the defendant

      in these cases.                            I consider that a claim in these circumstances,

      where deaths were almost instantaneous and where the claim is

      made under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934,

      and is brought separately from a claim under the Fatal Accidents

      Act, makes the Court act on speculation and not on proof, which

      is a route that the law should not take.                             I understand, however,

      and do not for a moment criticise the feelings which have

      prompted the bringing of these proceedings.

                   I should for completeness add one further comment.                        As a

      result of a piece of inadvertence, which I have dealt with in

      open court, there appeared on the day of the hearing in this

      case an article in a newspaper which revealed that the

      defendant, despite the fact that this case was being contested,

      had offered small sums to people in the position of these

      plaintiffs;                    some had accepted and some had rejected these sums.

      Both counsel for the plaintiffs and counsel for the defendant

      expressly indicated that they did not wish me to disqualify

      myself from hearing the matter further.                             I considered the matter
                                                                                         t


      there and then and told them in open court that I would not

      disqualify myself.                             I have not done so, and it goes without

      saying that I have not paid the slightest bit of attention to
                                                                                          t




      that piece of information in coming to my Judgment in this case.

                   I find, accordingly, that in these cases there will be

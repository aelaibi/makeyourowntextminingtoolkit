                  Dear Mr. Sharp,
                  Some of the Solicitor members of our Group have been approached by clients who
                  are anxious to know when the DPP is likely to make a decision as to whetheror
                  not, any criminal charges will be preferred following the events at Hillsborough
                  on the 15th April 1 9 8 9 *

                  Their- anxieties are apparently two fold.
                  Firstly, to have some idea as to progress and when the decision will be made
                  but secondly mo that when it does come it does not come as a surprise to them
                  as undoubtedly whatever decision is made will bring back memories and could be
                  a shock to people who in many cases are still suffering from the effects of
                  the traC
                   Whilst I would not expect you in a n y w a y to pre-empt the decision itjvould be
                   very helpful if you could let me know if there is any date known now when the
                   d e c i s i o n will be announced (even if this is say the beginning of September/
                   beginning of October etc).
                   If no date is known now would it be possible for you to let me have say seven
                   days advance, notice of the date when the decision will be announced so that
                   I fan let members know*

   Dear Mr. Sharp,
   Some of the Solicitor members of our Group have been approached by clients who
   are anxious to know when the DPP is likely to make a decision as to whether or
   not any criminal charges will be preferred following the events at Hillsborough
   on the 15th April 1989-
   Their anxieties are apparently two fold :-

   Firstly, to have some idea as to progress and when the decision will be made
   but secondly so that when it does come it does not come as a surprise to them
   as undoubtedly whatever decision is made will bring back memories and could be
   a shock to people who in many cases are still suffering from the effects of
   the tra^e^y.
   Whilst I would not expect you in anyway to pre-empt the decision it would be
   very helpful if you could let me know if there is any date known now when the
   decision will be announced (even if this is say the beginning of September/
   beginning of October etc).
   If no date is known now would it be possible for you to let me have say seven
   days advance, notice of the date when the decision will be announced so that
   I can let members know.

   Every good wish.

   Yours sincerely,

Meeting of   S.A.S.G.A.G - 16th July, 1987


Mr. Bc6>nes  opened the meeting and stated that thediscussions    would be divided
into four areas

1.   Definition of Rolls
2.   Inspections
3.   Status of Group
4.   Admin.Machinery of the Group


1.   It was   agreed that rolls should bebroadlydefined   andresponsibilities
     taken on by the appropriate of the three "lead authorities i.e. Police,
     Fire and Building Surveyors subject to agreement where overlap occurs.

     A1 contact with the grounds should be through the licensing authority.

     Environmental Health would take a    "general safety roll"    and not be a
     "lead" authority.

2.   The annual inspection is to be a joint      full   inspection to be carried
     out near the end of each, season.

     D.P. inspections to be done on an individual basis.   Prior arrangements
     to be made with the Police, but not the Club.    The Licensing Authority
     to be informed when an inspection has taken place.

3-   The meeting was informed that legally the group is essentially an advisory
     authority - only the council can be the ultimate decision making authority.

4.   Individual authorities to correspond to the sports grounds through the
     licansing authority who will subsequently circulate copies of all letters
     to each "lead" authority.

     Meetings of the group will be held at irregular intervals depending
     on need and can be called by any member of the group. Individual
     authorities need not attend specific meetings if they have no "interest .

     Agendas will be issued prior to each meeting.

   SUBJECT-                    Safety a t _Sports Grounds.......................

   Meeting held at Division Street Conference Room, 10 March 1987.
   Present:-          D Bownes (Lie), Mr I   I (Enviro Health), Messr'sl                                                                                           (3ldg
                      Surveyors), Messr's Hildreth, Grimshaw,
                      and        (SYCFS) .
   Contents of letter dated 18.2.87 (SYCFS - D Bownes) were discussed and agreed that
   these matters be taken up with the Club. With regard to the timber buildings
   beneath stands, it was agreed that the Club be requested to remove or resite these
   structures.
   With .respect to locker?, doors under^the South Stand, it was_ agreed that thi? matter.,__
   v;o’..id"-bc. dealt'wit:u^aer';-r^-Acx ■iis7i . yastenihgs:'to slidinigf5 ^ates.':Ver£ alti.
   discussed and a copy of a sketch showing a single hook arrangement for securing
   such doors was circulated.        It was agreed that D Bownes would put this solution to
   the Club for their comments.
   Stewarding and securing of all gates was discussed and the Fire Service indicated
   that existing arrangements were only acceptable subject to exits being stewarded
   and unlocked during 1 0 0 % of the time that the ground was in use for a designated
   puroose. Any relaxation of this would mean an insistance that panic fastenings
   only be provided.
   Discussion then took place on areas of responsibility and ground inspections.
   On areas of responsibility D Bownes’did not want to be tied down to individual
   references and even indicated that his Department could not act indeper.dantly but
   must refer all matters to the Council Committee responsible for SASG Act.. Whilst,
   all others present would prefer definitive areas of responsibility (allowing that
   there must be some overlap), David Bownes preferred to refer back to a future
   meeting following further consideration of the matter.
   On ground inspections, D Bownes referred to the recent Lords decision tnat grounds
   should be inspected annually, he anticipated that this would mean a much more
   thorough examination than the present system of bi-annual inspections, and that tnis
   would be backed up by inspections during ga mes.
   This was agreed by all present, but reservations about the suggestion that during
   game inspections be carried out by the whole working party were expressed by the
   Fire Service.   It was agreed however that one such .'during game' inspection would be
   set u d and the outcome monitored.

It was also pointed out b y the Fire Service that the new guide now included
a section which defines in detail, management responsibility.     It is.-recommended
by-the'Eire .Authority that the Club Certificate .specifies as -a -condition', of
licence that this’section be complied with.

             Mr.            Building Surveyors);

             Mr. D. Bownes (A. and L.);
             Miss              (A. and L . ).

Also present at various times during the inspection of the Kop were
Dr. Eastwood; Mr. Chester; Mr. Woodward and another Director of the Club.

The new Kop was inspected by all the Officers present and the Club
representatives.  In the course of the inspection, Dr. Eastwood made various
comments to the various Officers at different times. At the end of the
inspection, during which Officers noticed quite a few points, Chers was- ar
meeting in the Club itself at which various points were discussed.

Dr. Eastwood promised that he would supply detailed plans o j . the northern e.^it
route which at the moment is demolished in order to give access to the tower
crane. • It is ianticipated--'that-'the-iw.o.rks       rnmplet^l.by-           -?ec-cnd;--
week; of “ the football -season ;-i-t-is-anticipated that some temporary "arrangements-
will have to be made around the northern exit route so that spectators can be
safely accommodated whilst works are in progress. The question of the new pitch
perimeter gate was raised and Dr. Eastwood indicated that it could be pui. m u O
place quite easily and at fairly short notice.

Much discussion then followed about the evacuation of the Kop in the light of
the Green Guide "Eight Minute" Rule.  Dr. Eastwood took the view that the eight
minute limit was somewhat mythical and had no basis in fact; he went on l O
suggest that no research had been done as far as he was aware on the behaviour
or turbulence in crowds who are detained xor more than eight minutes.   Th_ tou3-
evacuation time for the new Kop without using the pitch perimeter gate would be
approximately ten minutes and twenty eight seconds. During the course or the
discussions, Dr. Eastwood went into the history of evacuation times from..various
stands and terraces, and indicated that the ten minute twenty eight second time
would perhaps be the best of its kind in the country and in his opinion was
quite adequate.  Dr. Eastwood also explained that the eight minute rule
originally came from him in response to an enquiry several years ago.

I got the impression that there was an element of confusion about this eight
minute rule.

After some further discussion, the meeting broke up and I arranged an Oifi^e*.
meeting for Tuesday 15th July 1986 at 2.30 p.m. at the Niagra Sports Ground.

             Miss              (A & k)


 The Group looked at 3 plans which had just been submitted by Eastwood & Part^
'in connection with the new Kop development.  Plan 771/2B (general arrangement o
 disabled toilets under north west corner of the Spion Kop) was felt to prese
y   problems but would, of course, require Building Regulation approval.

 Plan 6648/56F (showing the’new step and barrier layout on the Spion Kop) was
 noted and approved as far as it went*

 The third drawing 6648/54D (details of the new exit and terracing to the north
 west corner of the Kop) attracted the most attention.         It was noted that the
 plan does not show what happens to the exit route after it leaves; the new
4errace^rraWgement./ind -before ~it .reaches, Che . R e i a s ^ n e ^ a ^ ^ ^ i ^ d e t a U ^
 essential*Mn"order to“determine'the number--of people--which tne entire exxt -
 can accommodate.  It was also noted that the start of the exit route was no*
 shown as being 5.5 metres as opposed to 5 metres m the original plan a.d tna. a
 -main column stanchion" was positioned in the middle o. this ex_i, route. ^ At
 first glance it appears that the useable exit widen would tnen oe reduceu ^ o m
 10 units to 8 by virtue of this stanchion.

  Mr.I
  nr*              mentioned
                   meniiuucu that
                             m a w the bank

                                                                                , of the
  new Kop development would be the subject of a further site neeting Wlth
   Dr. Eastwood nearer its proposed time of completion; apparently x. is n
b u i l d i n g practice to leave such details as these to the last n o a s ^ a«d to
" p p r o v e general ideas immediately before work is undertaken.

  Summary:

 The course of action now open to the Council would appear
 Club expressing concern about the missing details on p an 04 ,         _      7-ouid
 8 minute rule discussion and the likelihood that no decision on c a p a c ^ y v,ould
 be made until the whole of the development was complete.

                                     t(South Yorkshire County Fire Service)-




  Mr. Vaughan pointed out that the Local Government Act, 1985, would abolish
  the South Yorkshire County Council (and the other Metropolitan'County Councils)
  on 31st March, 1986. From 1st April, 1986, the Certificating Authority under
  the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, would be the appropriate District
  Council.  In the case of the Hillsborough Stadium this would naturally be
  the Sheffield City Council. For this reason, it had been'suggested^to^the
  City Council that appropriate representatives in addition to the Building
  Surveyors’ Division might find it useful to be present at the meeting, and
  Mrs. L. Bashforth and Mr.              were welcomed and introduced to the
  remainder of the representatives present.

  Mr. Vaughan took the opportunity of expressing appreciation and thanks to^
  the representatives for the help and assistance which they had given to him
  in his role as Co-ordinatpr of the Officer Working Parties since 1978. There
  had obviously been occasions when differences of opinion and interpretation
  had occurred but, in -the main, these had been resolved .both amicably and
  constructively. -•

       the Club,-Dr.'-Eastwood thanked Mr. Vaughan for his services and wished
  ■F o r

  him well-for the future.    Other representatives endorsed Dr. Eastwood

'*v2 rA-^y-Purpois'e'-of Meeting

       purpose o£ the meeting was .two-fold; firstly to discuss the further
   details of development proposals at the stadium forwarded.with the letter
   dated 23rd December, 1985, from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners and, secondly,
   to carry out the "winter" inspection of the Stadium.

   A.                Development Proposals for the Spion Kop

   The further details were in addition to the comments set out in the letter
   dated 29.th November, 1985, on the observations made following the Officer
   Working Party meeting held on 13th November.
      (i)    Sheeting of Outer Face

      Dr. Eastwood reported that the sheeting of the enlarged Spion Kop at
      the rear and sides would result in the structure being virtually
      sealed.  In reply to queries -from the County Fire Service, he confirmed
      that no storage would be allowed under the structure and that checks
      for any accumulations of rubbish would be undertaken on a regular basis.

      (ii)   Climbing of the-Jnner Steel Frame

     • As regards the possiblity of.unruly spectators climbing the inner steel
       frame of the new-structure, Dr. Eastwood reported that the bottom boom
      member was now to be omitted.; The resultant height of ovej.lO feet
      would make it very difficult far spectators to climb the structure.

      (iii) New Step and Barrier Layout

      Drawing N o . w a s      -circulated and considered. This related to the
      new step and barrier layout on the Spion Kop, and Dr. Eastwood reported
      in particular on the discussions which he had had with the Planning         _
      Authority as to the height of an intermediate or a low second rail       to ■,
      the barriers.where the. drop ,to -the gangway below could be over one    metre
      in places. He sought the Officer Working Party's viewss and the merits
      of the options were considered.                   •                   .

      IT WAS AGREED that, in the view of the Officer Working Party, the best

      a. height of some 200 ami.                                           ....... -

B.   .Facilities for the Disabled                                        j.:

To illustrate that the figures originally quoted to provide facilities for the
disabled at the foot of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) were not
unrealistic, Dr. Eastwood reported on the breakdown of the tender figures
(opened on Monday) for the enlarged, roofed Spion Kop. He still considered
that any such proposals would involve the loss of up toV1 ,000.of the extra
5,000 spectator places which would be provided by the enlarged Spion Kop.
Other areas of the Stadium had also been considered and investigated, but
none could provide as large a flat, easily accessible area as that in front of _
the North Stand, which had been successfully used.for so.long without any major
problems. Up to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants, used the area.. The only
major drawback he saw was that when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
could be blown onto the disabled, despite the cantilever roof of the North
Stand extending virtually to the pitch. For this reason, the Club were willing
to roof an area from approximately the letter "0" on the results board to the
end of the Stand .(nearest--to the Spion Kop) .with a substantial roof, including
armoured glass where there might be "a visibility problem, .provided that this
was supported by .the Officer .Working J E a r t y *

Whilst accepting much .‘of ;what ;Dr.‘ 'Eastwood said^ -the Officer Working Party
(and the Police representatives in particular) still expressed somp cbr..-.srn as
to whether making semi—permanent facilities, for the disabled in front of the
North Stand was the appropriate and correct thing to do.

The Building Authority confirmed that, after further investigations, it was
considered that the disabled facilities requirements of the Building
Regulations 1985 did not appear to strictly -apply to the roofing of the
enlarged Spion Kop.
IT WAS AGREED that, in the first instance, Dr. Eastwood would prepare sketch
plans of the suggested roofed disabled facilities in front of the North Stand
for consideration by the Officer Working Party.

C.    Ground Inspection
      (i)   West Terrace and Stand

The Police representatives confirmed that the revised segregation arrangements
to the rear of the Stand worked well on by far the majority of occasions.

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that the segregation rail in the upper seated area'"
of the stand could be moved within .certain limits if the Police considered
that this would achieve a useful purpose.

IT WAS AGREED:-

(a)   that the additional advertisement hoardings, at the front of the upper
seated stand area (nearest to the North-West Terrace) should also be securely
fixed to concrete wall;

(b)   that further areas-of spalled concrete at the front of the upper
seated stand area should received'attention as matters of maintenance.
                                                             **
       (ii)   North-West Terrace

"t r ' M s /A g S e I d H- iP I ^                              upper North­
 west Terrace'should be securely fixed.

       (iii) North Stand

The area for the suggested covered disabled facilities was inspected.

As previously mentioned by Dr. Eastwood,'the possibility of providing an
increased width access to the pitch area (between the North Stand and the
Spion Kop) for possible use by emergency vehicles, as well as for maintenance
by the Club was discussed. The facility could be incorporated into the
enlarged Spion Kop proposals relatively easily.

It WAS AGREED that, whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
was not essential for their purposes, it could be useful for use by emergency
vehicles in certain situations and generally should be supported.

       (iv)   Spion Kop

Dr. Eastwood indicated the extent of the work to construct the enlarged,
roofed, Spion Kop, and.confirmed that steps' 'would'be'taken:to prevent'
unauthorised access to areas where work might be in progress during the
 course of the season.             V_.;. ... . ,                                £

 Tt -nr-, noted that the additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the
 front corner nearest to the South Stand, with a stepped arrangement to
 assist access and egress, had been provided.         ...        .

       (v)    South Stand

 It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden floor of the upper
 portion of the Stand (with sprayed non-slip surface) had proved to be of an
 acceptable appearance in use, and generally appeared to provide a compromise
 solution to the flammability problems inherent in such wooden structures.

IT WAS AGREED that its condition would continue to be monitored.

1 .____Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the response to be given to the
proposals outlined in the letter dated 25th October, 1985 and plans received
from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to facilities for the disabled, an
increased capacity for the Spion Kop and consequent additional exit routes.
Outline details of the roof to be erected over the Spion Kop had also been
provided.

2 .____Disabled Facilities

The Officer Working Party expressed reservations on both of the suggestions
proposed by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for the disabled. If the disabled
continued to be accommodated in front of the North Stand, they would still
be in the "firing line" of mis-aimed shots and any clear sheeting over the
top of the area they occupied could constitute an unacceptable hazard to
persons who might vacate the North Stand in an emergency situation by
climbing over the front wall of the stand onto the pitch perimeter. It was
accepted that the means of escape did not provide for this to be done, but
it had to be recognised that in practice this was a real possibility. The
structural strengthof such a structure would also be something of a problem.
The other suggestion of accommodating the disabled in front of the perimeter
fence along the front of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) was also
unacceptable for the reasons stated by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners.

The suggestion of the Police representatives was that the front area of the
lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the terracing levelled
to provide, say, a two-tier level landing on which to accommodate the disabled,
with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch perimeter fence in
front of this area could be removed, and the disabled would continue to gain
access from the ramp between the Spion Kop and the North Stand as at present.
This would also enable free access by the disabled to the proposed disabled
toilets under the rebuilt terracing of the Spion Kop.

The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.

 IT WAS AGREED that the proposals for the disabled, as now
.outlined by the Police representatives, should be supported and
- transmitted to ffessrs .’Eastwood & Partners as the views of
 the Officer Working Party, subject to there being no obstruction of exit
 routes and flows.

3 .____Enlarged Spion Kop

The Fire Service and the Building Authority agreed that calculations showed
that the enlarged Spion Kop would provide for an increase of some 5,000
spectators on the present capacity of 16,850, and that the number of exit
widths required to achieve evacuation was 46. The proposals to increase the
tunnel exit on the north side of the Kop to 8 clear units and to provide a
complete new six unit staircase on the south side were regarded as acceptable.
As when the original calculations had been made, the units of exit width
included the emergency gates in the pitch perimeter fence, but it was cons­
idered that landings in front of these gates should be constructed (as has
been done at Bramall Lane).

IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, the proposals from the
enlarged Spion Kop> submitted by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners were generally
acceptable:-

      (a)   adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the
            upper rear and the new south side exit routes:
      (b)   to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents'
            toilets and the new ladies' toilets in the new six unit staircase
            on the south side;
      (c)   to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
            gates in the pitch perimeter fence;
      (d)   to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
            the south side and on the Penistone Road side;
      (e)    until acceptable alternatives are available, the new exit gates to
            be fitted with a turn-bar arrangement under the control of
            stewards.

4._Roofing of Spion Kop

Whilst itwas accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals had been
supplied to date, the Building Authority pointed out that the plans showed
that the gables were not lined.

IT WAS AGREED that this should be pointed out to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,
as well as the fact that should any of the proposed works on enlarging or
roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the close season, it will be
a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be secured to prevent
unauthorised access.

5.     Crowd Flow aC?fEe!!Ce^ii^i*'|Lgnie^End^of the Stiaiimgj|f

 The Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the merging of
 spectators from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Lane end.

 It was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the physical restraints
 to achieve this could conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present
 position to continue.

- 6. . Duties of Stewards '^ookTet^

 IT WAS AGREED that the draft of a Booklet prepared by the South Yorkshire Police
 outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and should be distributed
 to designated grounds for the information and guidance of stewards employed at
 such grounds.  Factors peculiar to particular grounds could, of course, be
 added if considered appropriate.

 7.    Spot Checks at Designated Grounds

 The Fire Service reported on the success of the recent spot check carried out
at the Oakwell Ground of the Barnsley Football Club in conjunction with the
Police and the Building Authority, and reported that the Divisions of the
Brigade were being asked to carry out similar spot checks at designated
grounds in their areas.

IT WAS AGREED that such spot checks were essential to ensure that the required
standards were being maintained by the Clubs.

                         (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.    Purpose of Meeting.

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "summer" inspection of the
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

2.    Ground Inspection.

A.    Leppings Lane End

The progress of the works to segregate visiting supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Working Party's meeting held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive s letter
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of 1st August.

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
checking and comment.

On the inspection, the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
to be the poor standard of workmanship in the construction of the new
dividing wall which was being built behind the Stand. The position of the
Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by
45° chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall
and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on the plan subnitted).

 As regards the single block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
 in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
 Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
 was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the walls were braced
 by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted
 the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the
dividing walls in the new toilet facilities evidently did not have any
foundations, apparently having been built straight onto the existing
concrete slabs.  It was noted that there were some 9 inch thick brick walls
in the Male Toilets, it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
would be more likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

The Club pointed out that the new toilet facilities would not be completely
finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would
be left on site.

The position of the new refreshment area under the most westerly staircase
up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been built
straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
new 2 m . wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the Police.
This gate would still be available for the use of spectators in an
emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
Police would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. wide gap.
However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required.    It
was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South
Central Terrace Pen.

As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners^had
sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
both the Stand and at the Access level.

IT WAS AGREED:-

(a)   that the condition of the internal walls in the new male and female
toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;

(b)   that the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
extended or have steps to provide easier access from the new 2 m. wide gap
formed by the new radial fence;

(c)   that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence should be provided from
the new South Central Terrace Pen;

(d)   that the advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated stand
area should be securely fixed to the concrete wall;

(e)   that the spalling of the concrete of the wall at the front of the
upper seated stand area should receive attention as a matter of maintenance;

 (f)   that the corrosion of the steel columns at the rear of theStand
 should receive attention on a maintenance basis.

B.    South Stand

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reported that the condition of the upper
concrete outer portion of the exterior wall of the Stand had been
investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.

 It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
 Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the non-slip
 surface was to commence very shortly (and certainly be completed by the
 start of the season).
IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand should largely overcome the flammability problems inherent in such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they would ensure that the
wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
laying of the metal sheeting.

C*    Spion Kop

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details of the Club s
proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of the
Officer Working Party b y ‘letter dated 22nd July. As part of that scheme,
the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed.    Its present condition
remained acceptable with continuing maintenance.

In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which could
occur when large crowds were present.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new gate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
arrangement to assist access and egress.

D.    North Stand

The temporary storage facilities created by the erection of a timber wall
(in front of the Ladies' Changing Facilities in the Sports Hall) were
inspected.

IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
basis.

E.    Closed Circuit Television Facilities

The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and outside
the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed Closed Circuit
Television System were explained to the Officer Working Party.

 IT WAS AGREED

(a)   that a 2\ kg. CO 2 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the
Police Control Box and'the Disc Jockey Box;

 (b)   that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should be made
 secure.

    1   .       Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the detailed plans submitted by the
letter dated 25th July from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners of arrangements
for the segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

    2.          Consideration of Proposals

    The 14 detailed p l ans.submitted were each considered and discussed individually.

IT WAS AGREED - that, subject to the                   following points and to the submission of
the necessary detailed calculations                    to the Building Authority, the proposals
for segregating visiting supporters                    at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium were generally                    acceptable:-

                Plan No. 6705/6 -                                                   gress^Kirjrose
                            ertceT«eate        ^p tPViaed

    (b)    Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by Turnstile 23 to be either
    shortened or re-aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer
    (river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
    the new handrail not to be less than the width of the roller shutter gate
    between Turnstiles 16 and 17;

    (c)   Plan No. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the interal walls
    (e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
    substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
    be required;

    (d)         Plan No.   6705/10A - same comments as for plan 9A;

    (e)   Plan No.   6705/11A - no objection in principle, but details of               exact
    location required;

    (f)   Plan No. 6705/12 - no objection in principle, but no barrier height
    indicated;

            )    Plan No.  6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved by steep
             oes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped" arrangements to give
              \\
foothold, the proposals are satisfactory but the possible need to take
measures on top of the wall to discourage persons from attempting to climb
over will have to be borne in mind;

(h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last year, the front
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered 5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;

Informal meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield on 5th June 1985

PRESENT:                 (South Yorkshire County Fire   Service)

1 ._____ Purpose of Meeting.

The purpose of the meeting was   to inspect the mock-up of the proposed steel
covering to the wooden decking   to the Upper South Stand    seated      area, andto
consider the future of the timbered under-roof cladding to the asbestos roof
of the Stand.

2 ._____ Proposed Steel Covering    to the Wooden Decking.

To achieve fire resistance of the wooden decking (which     sat on concrete
decking),  the Club were considering covering it with steelsheeting.

 The Fire Service felt that whilst this would be a      short-term answer to fire
 resistance, there would be a slipping hazard if the steel sheets were not
 surfaced in some way and a tripping hazard where the sheets were joined and,
 as time passed, by the sheets lifting at the edges. In time,, the sheets
DvoeLcT'342 0
 “Phe mock-up klso had a small gap where the sheets were joined which would
 enable small items to pass through and fall into the small void between the
 wooden and concrete deckings. Whilst the Building Authority felt that there
 were no objections to the proposal from a structural point of view, they
 supported the points raised by the Fire Service.   (NOTE - subsequent to the

  Strange? he would also make the point to

 IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, there was no objection
 in principle to the Club’s proposal to encase the wooden decking of the
 upper South Stand seated area with steel sheeting:-

 (i)     the horizontal areas of the sheets to be sprayed or covered with a
          non-slip substance,

 (ii)    the lateral ends of the sheets to be securely fastened to prevent
          lifting;

 (iii)   the vertical ends of the sheets to have an overlay to prevent articles
          passing through into the small voids between the wooden and concrete
          deckings;

 (iv)    some form of ventilation to be provided to overcome deterioration
          of the encased woodwork;

 (v)     inspection of the steel sheeting to take place after every match and
          maintenance carried out as necessary.

1.       Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
and plan from Messrs. Eastwood S Partners relating to the Proposals
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two "“ banks of
turnstiles and various runs of fencing a n d new gates in order t» « hlev
segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings
Hillsborough Stadium.

2.       Consideration of--Proposals                   -   ‘              ‘

•The Police representatives pointed out that ^ ^ ^ a ^ A t ' o n e
n-ompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At one
time both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns o .- tendances
at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element
 home supporters as well.

 The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
 Police representatives, subject to:_

 (a)      additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
          and the wall of the inner access road;

 (b)      the central area of the Terrace (indicated a s the neutral area or
          visiting supporters’ terrace) being divided m half y a ne
          central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to t
          pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit en y
          to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed ne
          secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
          on the plan to be abandoned);

  (c)     the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters’
          terrace) also to be divided in half by a new ceteraL;radial fence
          running from back to front with two gates (the existing radl^
          fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral area an
          home supporters - to have a second gate installed,

     /    the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
     (    installed   one in the neutral area and one in the hoee supporters
           area

                                               1.
The County Fire Service sau no objection in principle to the proposals,
subject to more detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects,
and the Building Authority similarly sao no objection, s u j         £
submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety
Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

3.    Action

IT WAS AGREED
(a) That R. G r i m s h a w should investigate as a matter of urgency the means

outcome.

           D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
Stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football
League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

2.    Ground Inspection

A.    South Stand

The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
had been completed since the "summer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

(ii) That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit" sign in the Match
Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

(iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
should be infilled with mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly
with the appropriate Regulations.

 (iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
 of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

B.     West Stand and Terrace

The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
temporary barriers.  This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters
of the West Stand and Terrace.  On those occasions when the number of
visiting supporters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
obviously desirable to allow home supporters access to a sheltered area.
IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the Club would consider at some future date a scheme for
permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
being submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party in the
usual way.

(ii) That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.

(iii) That the apparent rusting of the steel columns at the rear of the
Stand should receive appropriate treatment by the Club.

C.   North West Terrace

No comments.

D.   North Stand

IT WAS AGREED that so long as larger, not easily combustible, materials
continued to be stored in the timber screened store area under the Stand,
the area would be regarded as acceptable.

E.   Spion Kop

It was noted that the remedial work to the roof of the tunnel exit from
the Kop had stabilised its condition for the time being (pending the
Club’s development proposals proceeding'; that the loose coping stores
had been removed from the top of the wall between the Spion Kop and the
South Stand, and that the damaged corrugated metal sheeting between the
Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i) That the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop should
continue to be monitored.

(ii) That the Club would carry out the pointing work to the outer perimeter
wall on Penistone Road once the frosts had ceased.

F.    Lighting Pylons

The visual inspection of the lighting pylons (first mentioned at the
inspection on 29th February, 1984) had yet to be carried out by the Club.

IT WAS AGREED that the visual inspection of the lighting pylons would be
carried out by the Club in the near future (weather conditions permitting).

3.___ Public Address System

The Club pointed out that an improved public address system had been installed,
and the Police confirmed that reports received indicated that it was noticeably
better than the previous system.
4.    Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Officer Working Party confirmed that plans for the revised catering ^
facilities at the rear of the West Stand had been received from the Club s
Architect and had been formally approved.

The Club reported that the scheme for the general up-grading of toilet and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand) was shortly to be
considered by the Board.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would submit the proposals for improved toilet
and catering facilities for approval in the usual way, subject, of course,
to the Board’s decision whether to proceed with the scheme-

Stand (ndtified by the letter dated 16th May from Mr.____________ (Chartered
Architect, and commented on by the Officer Working Party through the Chief
Executive's letter dated 31st May) were noted. The Club reported that the
contractors had stated that all except the Banqueting Suite would be finished
by the start of the season.

 rear of the Stand required attention.

 B.              West Stand and Terrace

 IT WAS AGREED        -

 (i)       That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
 at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
 to be monitored.

 (ii)     That the damaged angled support brackets to the pitchside security
 fence at the front of the Terrace should be repaired or replaced.

 C.           North West Terrace

 The wire mesh barriers on the inside of the upper access desk had been
 test-loaded (as suggested at the meeting on 29th February, 1984), and had
 satisfactorily met the Green Guide requirements.
D.       North Stand

It was noted chat a metal water storage tank had been installed adjacent to the
ramped access to the upper stand level.  It was also noted that a store area^
had been formed by timber screening under the strand between the outer edge of
the walkaway and the Gymnasium building.

IT WAS AGREED that the County Fire Service would investigate the acceptability
of the timber screened store area and/or the items stored, and inform Mr.
Vaughan of the outcome.

E.        Spion Kop

That part of the perimeter fencing erected at the norther end of the ramp at
the rear of the Kop to prevent access to the roofs of the new facility (referred
to at the meeting on 29th February, 1984)had been up-graded andsatisfaci-orily
tested to the Green Guide requirements.

The brick built screening wall in front ofthe Male Toilets underneath   the
"Stands" Club had been braced by metal supports.

It was noted that the condition of the spalled concrete and corrosion of the
roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop had continued to deteriorate, as had the
dividing wall between the Spion Kop and the South Stand and the outer perimeter
wall at the Penis cone Road eHd of the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED   -

(i)       That Mr. Strange should let Mr.         have proposals in writing^
for stabalising the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop (in
view of the Club's reported intention of proceeding with development proposals
in the comparatively near future), following which Mr.         will let
Mr. Vaughan have detailed comments-

(ii)      That the removal of loose  coping stones and the pointing of the wall
between the Spion Kop and the South Stand (mentioned at the 11th August, 1983

corrugated metal sheeting between the Spion Kop and the South Stand should be
removed.

(iv)      That pointing work should be carried out as a matter of urgent^
maintenance Co the outer perimeter wall pending agreement between the Building
Authority and Dr. Eastwood as to its stability (during the present close season,
as mentioned at the 29th February, 1984 inspection).

 (v)      That the redundant woodenpost and loose- wire adjoining   the walkaway
 at the top of the Spion Kop should be removed.

 F.       Lighting Pylons

 The visual inspection of the lighting pylons during the present close season
 (as mentioned at the 29th February, 1984 inspection) had not yet been carried
 out .

 IT WAS AGREED that, pending the visual inspection of the lighting pylons,
 corrosion of the base of the pylon at the rear of the West Stand and of the
 adjoining fence posts and manhole cover, required attention.
It was pointed out that the sets of tests carried out in June had completed
the five year test cycle at the Stadium.  The cycle would re-coimnence next
year.

3_-________ General Safety Certificate

The numerous alterations to the Stadium since the issue of the General Safety
Certificate on 21st December, 1979, were recalled.

IT WAS AGREED that up-dated plans were required for incorporation into the
General Safety Certificate in order to indicate the present facilities at the
Stadium.

4.________Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Club gave an. advance indication of the likely up-grading of toilet and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand), subject to the outcome
of an application for grant from the Football Improvement Trust.   In the more
immediate future, the caterer in question had expressed a wish to serve food
from the rear of the West Stand through serving hatches instead of from inside
The area used would remain the same.   If structural alterations were required,
the Club would also require building regulation approval from the City Council

MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING

The minutes of the meeting held on 9 August 1983, which had been previously
circulated, were accepted as a true and accurate record. There were no matters
arising.

SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
- PROGRESS REPORT

Mr Vaughan, the Secretai’y of the working group examining and administering the
provisions of the Act, gave a brief history of what had been achieved in South
Yorkshire.

He drew attention to the condition contained within the general safety
certificate that 21 days notice must be given to the County Council of any
proposed alterations to the grounds.   He was aware that this was not happening
and asked Club Secretaries to be mindful- of the fact that to fail to comply
with a condition of the certificate was an offer.ee under the Act.

Chief Superintendent Carlin asked if there was still in existence a voluntary
code of safety adopted by Clubs not falling within the bounds of the Act, as
he was most disturbed at the condition of Doncaster Rovers ground.  He was
worried that should disturbances occur in the ground there was a surfeit of
large pieces of concrete and other potential missiles which could be used by
unruly elements.

Mr Holloway agreed with Chief Superintendent Carlin that parts' of Belle Vue
were in need of immediate and extensive renovation and said that he way to have
a meeting with the Chairman of the Football Grounds Improvements Trust in order
to ascertain if there were monies available to Doncaster Rovers to improve tneir
ground.
Chief Superintendent Carlin questioned the determination of tl^e Directors at
the Club, as improvements had been spoken of for a number of years and nothing
had been done. He reiterated'his concern for the safety of police officers
on duty in the stadium, and enquired of Mr Vaughan whether the County Council
could assist.                         '

Mr Vaughan stated that as Doncaster Rovers did not qualify under the Act, the
only way the County Council could help would be at the invitation of the Club,
and any changes recommended would have to be ■undertaken at the Club s expense,
but he did offer to visit'Belle Vue, together with the other members of the
working group should the Club so wish. Mr Holloway thanked Mr Vaughan for the
offer, which he felt would be accepted.

Item discharged.

1984/1985 SEASON

The Chairman gave members a brief account of what he predicted for the
forthcoming season as regards policing problems, stressing the possibility of
recent lawlessness witnessed on picket lines being repeated at football grounds
especially when teams from working mining areas such as Nottingham visited South
Yorkshire.

Mr Clement also warned members of the possibility of policing football matches
with less officers than operationally desirable due to continuing heavy demands
upon manpower.

Chief Superintendent Broomhead recounted an incident at a match at Bramall Lane
towards the end of last season when stones were thrown by the Hooligan element
in the crowd.

Chief Superintendent Moseley wanted placing 011 record his appreciation of the
efforts made by the Sheffield Wednesday Manager, Howard Wilkinson, in trying
to prevent pitch invasions at the end of last season. He also informed members
of the difficulties being faced by British Rail in respect of lack of rolling
stock which would affect special trains to Wadsley Bridge Station, thereby
increasing the number of supporters going through the city centre from the
Midland Station to Hillsborough.

Chief Superintendent Carlin asked Club Secretaries to make their supporters
clubs aware of the difficulties faced by the police after games had finished.
He referred particularly to travelling supporters stopping off in towns, usually
for alcoholic refreshment, which sometimes resulted in confrontations with other
supporters and then the police.

Chief Superintendent M e a d o w s agreed with Chief Superintendent Carlin, and
informed the meeting that with the .assistance of the British Transport Police
and British Rail it was hoped that trains carrying supporters would be
tioie-tabled so as not to arrive at stations such as Doncaster at the same time.

 The Chairman summed up by saying that although there had been signs during last
 season that the hooligan problem associated with football was declining he feared
 that the trend may not continue in the forthcoming season.

 Item discharged.

  SEGREGATION OP SPECTATORS

  Chief Superintendent Moseley introduced this item, outlining a problem occurring
  in the Leppings Lane stand at Hillsborough.  Traditionally, the terracing at
  the Leppings Lane end had been allocated to 'away' supporters, but from
  time-to-time 'away' supporters had also been allowed in the stand. He was most
  concerned at the continuing sale of season tickets in the stand to Sheffield
  Wednesday supporters increasing the likelihood of confrontation.  He asked for
  guidance as to interpretation of the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975, on this
  point.

  Mr Vaughan replied that the conditions for segregation of supporters contained
  in the Safety at Sports Grounds Act had been interpreted as applying to standing
  areas and he was of the opinion that it did not apply to seated parts of grounds.

   Mr Chester stated that Sheffield Wednesday were aware of the problem of home
   supporters in the West Stand and had tried to reduce the numbers of season ticket
^^holders from over 200 last season to under 40 this forthcoming season.        He
^Pp o i n t e d out the problems associated with this policy, as some of the season
   ticket holders had been using that stand since it was built for the 1966 World
>, Cup.

    The Chairman pointed out that as season tickets had already been sold to
 •• Sheffield Wednesday supporters for the West Stand, the potential for
    confrontation would have to be borne in mind when arrangements for policing
    matches were made.                                    -          .

   Item discharged.

   DUTIES OP STEWARDS

   Chief Superintendent Moseley also introduced this item, saying it had come to
   his notice that stewards were not fulfilling .their duties and on occasions had
   removed their jackets and mingled with the crowd in order to avoid trouble.
   He was concerned with the abrogation of their responsibilities and asked Club
   Secretaries to make it clear to stewards what their duties entailed.

   The Chairman stated that it was better for the Clubs if minor disputes which
   need not involve the police were resolved by the stewards rather than resorting
 ; to police intervention.

   Item discharged.

   ANY OTHER BUSINESS

   a.   Financial Arrangements for 1934/85 Season

   The Assistant Chief Constable (Management Services), Mr Watson, -stated that
   it was the intention of the South Yorkshire Force to police the five football
   league grounds in an identical manner to previous seasons. Divisional Commanders
   would assess their manpower requirements for each game and deploy sufficient
   police officers to ensure that there were no public order disturbances.   The
   Clubs would be charged as per the agreed formula based on the official attendance
   at the match, irrespective of how many officers were actually used. He furcher
   stated that with effect from 1 September 1984, it was expectcd that there would
   be an approximate increase in charges of 4.8£ to reflect a similar increase
   in police pay.

   There was no dissension fi’om this proposed course of action and Mr Watson lurt'hei’
   indicated that in respect of each game Clubs would be allowed 21 days to meet
   the account rendered or legal proceedings to recover the charges would be
   commenced.

                                       i
Mr Chester stated that Clubs would have appreciated advance notice of the
increased charges before setting their admission fees. Mr Watson replied that
the review of police pay was based on a wages index (May to May figures) and
these were not released until late July each year. To estimate the proposed
increase would be dangerous as evidenced by the NUM dispute which had reduced
the pay index from approximately 1% to H.8% this year.

Item discharged.         £

b.   Affairs of Football clubs Discussed
     in Police Committee

Mr Chester asked that Clubs be forewarned about matters concerning them which
were to be discussed at future Police Committee meetings. He stated that within
an hour of the Police Committee meeting, the Clubs were being approached by
the press and asked to comment about matters on which they had little or no
information.

Mr Vaughan replied that the County'Council were aware of the problem and would
look into it.

Item discharged.


The Chairman wished the Clubs a successful and prosperous forthcoming season
and assured them of the continued support of the South Yorkshire .Police.


There being no further business the meeting closed at 12.40 pm.

■ items following "the J,summer" inspec'tioft had “yet'vt6'be carried out. This wa,s
  due to a combination of the change in Club Secretary and certain development
  proposals (outlined on a confidential basis) which the Club had in mind.
  However, chose which the Club's staff could undertake would be commenced shortly
  and tenders had been invited and received for the urgent remaining larger
  items (to be carried out commencing in M a y ) . The exception was the roof of the
  tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the North Stand end) in view of its
  possible inclusion in the development proposals outlined.

  2.     Ground Ir.soection

 A.        West Stand and Terrace

 It was noted that the former ARP.building adjacent to the boundary wall was
 in the process of demolition and the site cleared and levelled. This would
 have the additional benefit of improving the access/egress.

  B.      North West Terrace

  It was noted that whilst generally the sealing of the cracks beneath the Terrace
  to prevent seepage of water had been successful, there was still a slight
  seepage from one of the repairs.

 The possible need for protection of the wire mesh on the inside of the upper
 access deck was also discussed.

  IT WAS AGREED -

  (i)    That the Club would continue to monitor the slight seepage of water
  from the repaired cracks under the Terrace.

 (ii)   That the possible need for lateral bracing to the frame of the-wire
 mesh barriers on the inside of the upper access deck be investigated by a
 test loading during the forthcoming close season.
 A:j previous Iv indicated, the Club confirmed that' the remedial work to the
 existing access ramp and barrier rails required as the result of the
 construction of che new refreshment and toilets together with the erection
 of barriers to prevent access to the roofs of the new facilities, had been
 carried out.

 The present condition of the spalled concrete and corrosion of the roof of
 the tunnel exit from che Spion Kop was inspected.

 The stability of the perimeter   wall at the Penistone Road   end of the ground
 was also discussed.

 IT WAS AGREED -

 (i)   That theBuilding Authority and Mr. J. Strange of   Messrs. Eastwood &
 Partners should discuss and inspect that part of the perimeter fencing
 erected at the northern end of the ramp to prevent access to the roofs of the
 new facilities.

 (ii)  That the Club wouldundertake continuous maintenance work on theroof
 of the tunnel exit, pending a decision on any development proposals.

 D.     Lighting   Pylons

 The Club undertook to carry out a visual inspection of the lighting pylons during
 the forthcoming close season and to make more detailed inspections should this
 prove to be necessary after the visual inspection.

 E.     Emergency Lighting,   Fire Alarm and Public Address Systems Test

 IT WAS AGREED - That the County Fire Service in conjunction with the South
 Yorkshire Police and the Club's staff, would carry out a test of these systems
 at the evening match against Fulham to be held on 7th March.

inspection of the Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly
visits to Football League grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate

                                     ■'                      ■   •;           ■”
In particular, the Officer Working Party wished to see the position with
regard to the effect of the carrying out of the improvements at the
Penistone Road end of the Ground (considered by the Officer Working    Party '
on 28th June, 1983 and agreed subject to certain reservations contained in
a letter to the Club dated 29th June). Reports being received from the
Building Authority had indicated extensive movement of existing retained earth
material, apparently of sufficient magnitude to impair the stability of the
adjacent'access ramp and associated perimeter walls and barri'er rails.

2 ._____ Ground Inspection

A.         Electronic Score and Message Board

It was noted that, since the agreement indicated at the "winter" inspection
of the Stadium on 21st February, 1983, the electronic score and message
board had been erected between the South and West Stands. Evidently, it
was proving to be a most welcome feature.

B.     West Stand and Terrace

The Club's intentions with regard to the brick built former A.R.P. building
at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall (now used as a
store) were again discussed in view of its condition.

The condition of the crack in the brickwork- at the rear corner of the Stand .
(nearest to the North West Terrace) raised at the last meeting was inspected.

Dr. Eastwood reported that the crush barriers on the Terrace had been tested,
completing the first cycle of crush barrier testing at the Stadium. One had
failed and been replaced.
IT WAS AGREED -
(i)     That, if the Club intend   to continue to use the former A.R.P. building
adjacent to the boundary wall, the lintel over the door would requifle attention
in particular, as would the general maintenance of the building.
(ii)    That the condition of the crack in the non load bearing brickwork at
the rear corner of the Stand (nearest to the North West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.
(iii)   That the Club would give attention during normal maintenance to the
loose concrete rendering apparent in places.
C.      North West Terrace
As the Terrace and the West Stand were separate structures, the Club were of
the opinion that there would continue to be movement between the structures
caused by changes in weather conditions, thus making it difficult if not
impossible to achieve a seal sufficient to permanently prevent the seepage of
water between the two.
IT WAS AGREED that this was not a matter of safety and that the Club would
continue to monitor the position.
D.      North Stand
The Club reported that the further attention to the crack at the expansion
joint adjacent to Stand entrance "R" requested at the last meeting was in hand
as a matter of maintenance.
E.    ' Spion Kop
As requested at the last meeting, the Club had investigated the spalled concrete
and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the
North Stand end). Action would be taken shortly to cut off the front (and
worst affected) portion of the roof, which would also have the effect of
increasing the headroom.
Whilst certain remedial work had already been undertaken by the contractor to
stabalise the banking at the rear of the, Spion Kop following digging out
to provide new refreshment and toilet facilities, the Officer Working Party
were of the firm opinion that further work was essential. Measurements had
shown that in places there had been as much as four to five inches of
movement.  Simple visual inspection showed that there was a lack of the
former retained earth material underneath the access ramp in places, and
consequently there had also to be doubts about the stability of the foundations
of the existing barrier rails. The Club would have to look to the contractor
(or his insurers) to meet the cost of the remedial work to the existing access
ramp and barrier rails.
As pointed out in the letter to the Club dated 29th June, measures would
require to be taken to prevent the public gaining access to the roofs of the
new facilities (as they were not load bearing). Barriers would have to be
provided or other measures taken to enable the new facilities to withstand
crowd pressures where these were capable of being generated (as also pointed
out in the letter of 29th June).
IT WAS AGREED
(i)     That the Club's proposals for dealing with the spalled concrete and
corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop be supported in
principle.
 (ii)    That as soon as possible, and certainly prior to the first home
 match on 3rd September, the condition of the existing ramp and barrier
 rails must be stabilised (possibly by drilling holes at intervals and
 inserting grouting under pressure) and the resultant success or otherwise
 of the measures tested by test loading the barrier rails (or a representative
 sample) to the Green Gnxde requirements.

 (iii)   Also prior to the first home match on 3rd September, measures must
 be taken (a) to orevent access by the public to the roofs of the new
 facilities and (b) to enable the new facilities to withstand crowd pressures
 where these are capable of being generated.

 (iv)    That the new buttresses to the existing boundary wall in connection
 with the new turnstiles and exit gate must be sited so as not to reduce the
 support to the wall, and that the need for pointing of the wall externally
 in places must also not be overlooked.

 F.       "Stands" Club

  It was noted chat there was stalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel
  beams underneath the "Stands" club.  It was understood that the premises
  were leased on a full repairing basis to Mansfield Breweries j^td.

  It was also noted that there was a certain amount of deflection in the brick

* pressure was’iapplied to_ the top .of the ,®aLl ^

  IT WAS AGREED

  (i)     That the Club would request Mansfield Breweries Ltd. to give
  attention to the spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel beams
  under the "Stands" Club in accordance with the terms of their lease.

  (ii)    That the brick built screening wall in front of the Male toilets
  should be test loaded to the Green Guide requirements.

  G.       South Stand

  It was noted that some of the loose coping stones on the top of the
  dividing wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop had been removed,
  and that a certain amount of pointing of the wall had been undertaken.

  It was also noted that there was severe corrosion at the bottom of both
  steel supports to the sides of theconcertina— type exit gate from the
  Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).

  IT WAS AGREED

  (i)     That the Club would remove the remaining coping stones and arrange
  for the remainderof the pointing to the upper level of the wall to be
  undertaken as a matter of maintenance.

  (ii)    That the Club would shortly consider a scheme to be prepared by
  Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for replacement of both steel supports to
  the exit gate from the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).
H.      Ground Fitness Certificate

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that many of the matters discussed at the meeting
were contained in his Annual Ground Fitness Certificate. However, he had
delayed submitting this to the County Council, as required by the General
Safety Certificate, in view of the situation on the Penistone Road end of
the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED that Dr. Eastwood would submit his Ground Fitness Certificat
to the County Council, excluding the Peniston6 Road end of the Stadium at
the present time. •

of the existing barrier rails. The Club would have to look to the contractor
 (or his insurers) to meet the cost of the remedial work to the existing access
ramp and barrier rails.
As pointed out in the letter to the Club dated 29th June, measures would
require to be taken to. prevent the public gaining access to the roofs of the
new facilities (as they were not load bearing) . Barriers would have to be
provided or other measures taken to enable the new facilities to withstand
crowd pressures where these were capable of being generated (as also pointed
out in the' letter of 29th June).
 IT WAS AGREED
 (i)     That the Club's proposals for dealing with the spalled concrete and
 corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop be supported in
 principle.                                                   -
(ii)    That as soon as possible, and certainly prior to the first home
match on 3rd September, the condition of the existing ramp and barrier
rails must be stabilised (possibly by drilling holes at intervals and
inserting grouting under pressure) and the resultant success or otherwise
of the measures tested by test loading the barrier rails (or a representative
sample) to the Green Guide requirements.

(iii)   Also prior to the first home match on 3rd September, measures must
be taken (a) to prevent access by the public to the roofs of the new
facilities and--(b) to enable the new facilities to withstand crowd pressures
where these are capable of being generated.

(iv)    That the new buttresses to the existing boundary wall in connection
with the new turnstiles and exit gate must be sited so as not to reduce the
support to the wall, and that the need for pointing of the wall externally
in places must also not be overlooked.

F.      "Stands" Club

It was noted that there was spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel
beams underneath the "Stands" club. It was understood that the premises
were leased on a full repairing basis to Mansfield Breweries Ltd.

It was also noted that there was a certain amount of deflection in the brick
built screening wall in front of the Male toilets underneath the Club if
pressure was applied to the top of the wall.

IT WAS AGREED:-

(i)     That the Club would request Mansfield Breweries Ltd. to give
attention to the spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel beams
under the "Stands" Club in accordance with the terms of their lease.

(ii)   That the brick built screening wall in front of the Male toilets
should be test loaded to the Green Guide requirements.

G.      South Stand

It was noted that some of the loose coping stones on the top of the       ^
dividing wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop had been removed,
and that a certain amount of pointing of the wall had been undertaken.

 It was also noted that there was severe corrosion at the bottom of both
 steel supports to the sides of the concertina-type exit gate from the
 Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).

 IT WAS AGREED:-

 (i)     That the Club would remove the remaining coping stones and arrange
 for the remainder of the pointing to the upper level of the wall to be
 undertaken as a matter of maintenance.

 (ii)    That the Club would shortly consider a scheme to be prepared by
 Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for replacement of both steel supports to
 the exit gate from the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).
H.      Ground Fitness Certificate

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that many of the matters discussed at the meeting
were contained in his Annual Ground Fitness Certificate. However, he had
delayed submitting this to the County Council, as required by the General
Safety Certificate, in view of the situation on the Penistone Road end of
the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED that Dr. Eastwood would submit his Ground Fitness Certificate
to the County Council, excluding the Penistone Road end of the Stadium at
the present time. •

                             [(South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.     Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the usual winter ins iction carried but of the Football
League grounds in South Yorkshire ^originally referred to in the Chief
Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981), as well as to
discuss and comment on the Club's proposal to erect a new score and
message board (referred to in the letter and plans from Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners dated 7th February, 1983).

2.     New Score and       Message Board

The new board was to be erected in the south west corner of the ground
between the South and the West Stands at a height of some 7 metres above
the terrace level. The siting and construction of the supporting pillars
were such that there would be no appreciable effect on the number of
spectators who could be accommodated on the terrace.

ihe Building Authority regarded the detailed drawings and calculations as
satisfactory, and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners outlined the steps taken to
take effect of wind and ice-loadings on the structure. The South Yorkshire
Police were satisfied with the assurances given that the structure would,
for all practical purposes, be climb proof. The South Yorkshire County
Fire Service saw n<? objection to the proposal.

IT WAS AGREED That the Officer Working Party saw no objection to the
proposal, and that Mr. D. Vaughan would reply to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners
to this effect.

3 ._____Ground Inspection

A.    West Stand

It was noted that, whilst the foot of the steel supporting pillar had been
cleared of light surface corrosion and its gusset plate had been covered
by a concrete haunch (as agreed at the summer inspection on 24th August,
1982), it still required to be painted.
It was also noted that the crack in the concrete adjacent to stand entrarces
"W" and "X" had been made good.

The Club had also been requested at the sunnier inspection on 24th August,
1982, to consider whether any useful purpose would be served by retaining
the store shed at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall.
This point was repeated, and the  Souti Yorkshire Police added that at
some time in the future they hoped the Club would be able to provide some
form of segregation, as well as separate bar and toilet facilities, to
separate home and visiting supporters at the rear of the Stand.

IT WAS AGREED that the new expansion crack in the bric\;rork at the rear
corner of the Stand (nearest to the North West Terrace) should be
monitored to ensure its condition did not worsen.

B.     North West Terrace

It was noted that the seepage of water between the North West Terrace and
the West Stand in heavy rain (also raised at the summer inspection) apparent
continued to occur.

IT WAS AGREED that, whilst not being a matter of safety, the Club should
be recommended to replace the bitunan impregnated fibre board as a matter
of maintenance to overcome the seepage problem.

C.     North Stand

The crack at the expansion joint adjacent to Stand entrance "R" (which     the
Club had been requested to investigate and make good at the summer
inspection) had received some attention but could not be regarded as
satisfactory.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would give further attention to the crack.

D.     Spion Kop

All of the crush barriers had been tested since certification, the main
problem having been rusting of some of the clips over the top tubes on
certain barriers.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would investigate and make good the spalled
concrete and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop
(at the North Stand end).

E.     South Stand

In view of recent adverse weather conditions, the agreement to visually
inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection after exceptional gale
or snow loading was recalled.  It was noted that the sixth roof truss from
the East Gable (including the Gable) particularly appeared to have deflected
since the summer visit.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)    That some form of measuring the evident deflection in the roof
trusses was desirable, and the Club were requested to consider whether some
form of quick and/or economic method of doing so could be devised.

(ii)  That the ChiefFireOfficer     berequested toconsider thesuitability
from a fire resistance point of view of thecladding  in the first floor
enclosed link bridge from the Stand to the Restaurant.

F.     Police and First Aid Facilities

The new police and first aid facilities under the North Stand had been
welcomed by the users and were proving to be most useful.

G.     Maintenance

It was noted that certain items of maintenance throughout the ground
required attention.

IT WAS AGREED that under this general heading the Club would look particularly
into the loose wiring at both ends of the South Stand, at the pointing and
spalled concrete in the Male Toilets at the Spion Kop end of the South
Stand, and at the pointing required to the wall (including coping stones)
and the loose metal sheeting between the South Stand and the Spion Kop.

H.    Floodlighting Pylons

Whilst the electrical contractor's staff obviously had to climb the flood­
lighting pylons from tine to tine, it appeared that no regular inspection
of the pylons tookplace from a structural safety point of view.

IT WAS AGREED that  a regular inspection of the floodlighting pylons from
a structural safety point of view was desirable, say, every, two or three
years, and that to  establish the present position, an inspection of one of
the pylons should be carried to see what was revealed. -

I.    Painting of Structural   Steelwork, Roof Trusses, etc.

Whilst not being a matter of immediate concern, the Officer Working Party
felt it would be in the Club's own interests to institute a programme for
the painting of structural steelwork, roof trusses, etc.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club should be requested to consider instituting a
programme for the painting of structural steelwork, roof trusses, etc. on
a regular basis.

J.    Penistone Road Side

The Club were not yet in a position to say when the proposed improvements
at the Penistone Road side of the Ground were likely to be implemented.

 _______Ground Inspection

A        West Stand

•It was noted that there was light surface corrosion at the foot of the
 steel supporting pillar nearest to the North-West Terrace. .As there was
 no enclosing wing to the stand, the pillar was open to the elements.

The possibility of spectators climbing onto the roof of the'store shed to
the rear of the stand and adjacent ta—the boundary wall was discussed.

IT WAS   AGREED -

(i)     That the Club would arrange for the footof the steel    supporting
pillar to be cleaned and painted andpossibly for the gusset     plate to be
covered by a concrete haunch.

(ii)   That the Club would consider whether any useful purpose would be
served by retaining the store shed adjacent to the boundary wall.

(iii) That the Club would investigate and make good the crack in the
concrete adjacent to stand entrances "W" and "X".

B        North West Terrace

It was n oted that the cracks in the concrete underneath the Terrace ha d
be en repaired and appeared satisfactory. However, there was seepage of
water between the North West'Terrace and the West Stand in heavy rain.

IT WAS AGEEED - That the Club'would make good the bitumastic sealing
between the Terrace and the West Stand.

C     North Stand

A crack in the concrete at the expansion joint adjacent to Stand entrance
"R" was noted.

IT WAS AGREED - That the Club would investigate and make good the crack.

D     Spion Kop

The Building Authority suggested that at some future date the Club should
consider giving attention to the original steps at. the rear of the Kop
(at the bottom of the new staircase) so as to remove the slight downward
tilt and ensure a common height of risers.

IT WAS AGREED - That, whilst there had been no reported incidents, the Club
would bear the suggestion in mind for attention at a future date.

E     South Stand

The Club reported that the gantry access to the Commentary Box on the top


IT WAS AGREED - That the Club would replace the missing rings in the chain
used as a handrail on the gantry.

F     Crush Barriers

The Club reported that the remaining third of the crush barriers on the
Spion Kop had now been.tested. The only problem had been rusting of some
of the clips over the top tubes. Thtse had been replaced or would be '
replaced by the start of the Season on 28 August.

A visual inspection had also been carried out of the clips on the crush
barriers on the West and North-West Terraces, and similar action taken.

G     Police and First   Aid Facilities

The new police and first aid facilities under the North Stand were well
on the way towards completion, and would be utilised at the opening match
on 28 August.

H     Penistone Road Side
             1     r      "
It was noted that the steel girders adjoining the wall., at’.,the rear of the
Butcher's Shop had been satisfactorily attended to, and that the Folding
Exit Gates had had new tops and runners installed and the concrete made
good.

So far as the proposal to re-site an existing toilet block to the rear of
the Spion Kep to enable additional turnstiles and anexit gate to be
installed was concerned, the Club had reported to the Chief Executive
by letter that this had had to be deferred until the end of next season
due to the size of the problem and the possibility of creating hazards for
spectators.
I      T e levision Camera Facilities

It was noted that the scaffolding Tower erected'on the Spion Kop for
Television camera purposes had now been removed.

There did not appear to have been any progress with the Television
Authorities to date on the subject of permanent or semi-permanent
facilities.

J     Fire-Fighting Equipment

Whilst the Club were confident that all of the fire extinguishers, etc,
were still sited as originally required by.the General Safety Certificate,
the County Fire Service felt that a routine inspection of the equipment
would now be appropriate.

K     Maintenance

Certain areas of spalled concrete in the Stadium required attention, and
the Club had the work in hand as items of routine maintenance.

                                         (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

        1.     Puroose of Meeting -

        The purpose of the meeting was to discussvthe apparent difference of opinion
        on certain aspects of the radial barriers installed on ths ttfpst Terrace
        and the security gates at the top oi the North stand ramps, as well as to
        carry out the usual winter inspection or the Stadium.

        2.___ Ground Inspection

        A.     West Terrace

    0   Whilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches played since the
        erection of the radial barriers indicated that generally they worked well and
.       satisfactorily effected the segregation of opposing groups of fans.

        However, the police pointed out that in places the existing crush barriers
        had been extended up to and, in some cases, completely through the new
        radial barriers, which had the effect of making it relatively easy for anyone
        who wished to do so to climb from one pen to another. Also, in the pen
        nearest to the South Stand, a small length of existing crush barrier had been
        left unsupported.

        IT WAS AGREED -

        (i)   That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
        prevent crowd surge by the existing barriers being extended up to and/or
        through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
        able to climb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of the
        current season.

        (ii)    That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
        be cut off.

                                                  -1-
B.    West Stand*

One of the security gates which the Club wished to instal at the bottom of
the two staircases had now been erected.

IT WAS AGREED     that this could be regarded as satisfactory.

C.    North Stand

The Fire Service felt that the manner in which the security gates had been
installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available.

The Club's Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
applied in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the top
of the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or not.

IT WAS AGREED   that, as the point might well have been covered in the
initial consideration of the Club's application for a General Safety
Certificate, the point would not be pursued at the moment.

      NOTE -     A search of the file subsequently revealed that, as
                suspected, the point had been considered at a
                meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.-2.79,
                the relevant part of the Note of the meeting jreading:-

                  "the'construction and width of the'ramps being
                   such that they could quite..properly be
                   regarded as elevated roadways".

D.      Spion Kop

-It was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on
 the left of the original exit at the top of the Kop had taken place: that
 the boundary fence at the top of the Kop had been reinforced, and that the
 existing barriers had been permanently extended and the area at the foot
 of the new Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)
 levelled off as agreed.

E.      South Stand

The agreement to visually inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection
after exceptional gale or snow loading conditions was recalled.

F.    Items of General Maintenance

IT WAS AGREED     that the following items of general maintenance required
attention:-

(i)   The rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
the exit at the southerly endof theWest Stand (to be     done that day), as
well   as the rounding off of thebrackets to the NorthStand   securitygates.

(ii) The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
Gate "0".
(iii) The cracks'in the concrete terracing of the Spion Kop to be   filled.

(iv) The wooden support to the electrical       line between the    brick built
refreshment point and the Owls Club to be fixed more securely.

(v)   The brick wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop (nearest
to the South Stand) to be pointed.

(vi) The concrete supporting strut to the wall between the Spion Kop and
the South Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) to be protected (cracks and
exposed b a r ) .

G.       Temporary Structures

Concern was expressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability
of temporary structures, such as scaffolding used in connection with
television transmissions.

Paragraph 20 of the Club's General Safety Certificate required T.V. cameras
and portable equipment to be placed only in such positions as may be agreea
between the Police and the Club.    TheClub also were generally required   to
ensure that the Stadium complied   with good engineering andbuilding practices
and with the relevant British Standard Specification or Code of Practice.

IT WAS AGREED that the. question of temporary structures should be kept
under review, and that the Club's Consultants should give advice to tha
 Club.

 3.      Future Developments

 A.      Police and First Aid Facilities

'It was likely that, following continuing consultations with the Police, the
 Club would shortly be in a position to formally notify the County Council
 that the new Police and First Aid Facilities would be provided in the
 forthcoming close season.

 B.      Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate in Penistone Road

 The Club hoped to formally notify the County Council shortly of their^
 intention to proceed in the forthcoming close season with the demolition of
 some of the existing toilets on the Penistone Road side of the^Stadium m
 order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate on that side of the
 Stadium.

 C.      Widening of Walkway and Erection of New Fence

 Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the
 rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Owls Club) had had to be removed.
 When settlement was complete, it was intended to widen the existing
 walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.

                    D.   I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1 ._____Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the request of the Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club Ltd. (contained in correspondence circulated to each
of the disciplines represented on the Working Party) to temporarily increase
the number of turnstiles on the Penistone Road side of the ground by taking
out the 21 ft. exit gate and installing six additional turnstiles, pending
the carrying out of a permanent scheme in the 1982 close season.

2.    Additional Turnstiles

Thp Police representatives pointed out that public order and public safety
problems were caused on occasions outside the ground (mainly at evening matches)
by spectators spilling out onto Penistone Road whilst trying to gain admission
to the ground. These problems had been discussed with the Club, and had
probably resulted in the request now before the Working Party. However, whilst
putting the case for additional turnstiles, the police representatives stressed
that in no way did they consider this should be done at the expense of means
of escape, should the Working Party consider that this would be the result of
the Club's temporary proposals now under consideration.

The Fire Service representatives reported that they had carried out a site
inspection, and pointed out that the existing five exits in question were only
just adequate in the event of a maximum capacity crowd (using the Green Guide
calculations).

The Working Party discussed a number of options which might be open to the Club,
pending the carrying out of the permanent proposals in the 1982 close season.

IT WAS AGREED that, whilst the Club's permanent proposals were welcome in
principle, the temporary proposals for six additional turnstiles on the
Penistone Road side of the ground (by removing the existing 21 ft. exit gate)
could not be supported.

IT WAS ALSO AGREED that, in order to be constructive, the following options
should be brought to the Club's notice:-

(a)    a r e duction of 3,840 in the Spion Kop c a pacity should the Club wish
       to proceed w i t h the temporary proposals;
(b)    the construction of some form of easily removeable turnstiles to enable
       the existing 21 ft. exit gate to continue to be available;

(c)    the construction of new turnstiles in the area of the Stadium between
       the end of the South Stand and the Penistone Road, possibly for use solely
       at evening matches where large attendances are envisaged should the
       Club wish to normally retain the exclusivism of the South Stand area.

3_._____ Police and First Aid Facilities

Whilst neither the Club nor its Consultants had replied to date to the
representations made regarding the new police and first facilities, the Police
representatives reported that it appeared that some progress was being made and
that the subject had been discussed at a recent Board meeting.

IT WAS AGREED that, in the absence of a firm indication from the Club as to when
the new police and first aid facilities are to be provided, Hr. Vaughan should
draw to the Club's attention that the North Stand capacity is determined by
the evacuation time of 8 minutes originally agreed using the non-combustibility
standards of the Green Guide.  If the existing police and first aid facilities
are to remain, then the evacuation time will have to be reduced to the
combustible standard evacuation time of 2\ minutes. Naturally, this would
entail either a reduction in the number of spectators admitted to the North
Stand or an increase in the number of exits from the Stand.

1 ._____Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the request of the Sneffield
Wednesday Football Club Ltd. (contained in correspondence circulated to each
of the disciplines represented on the Working Party) to temporarily increase
the number of turnstiles on the Penistone Road side of the ground by taking
out the 21 ft. exit gate and installing six additional turnstiles, pending
the carrying out of a permanent scheme in the 1982 close season.

2 .____ Additional Turnstiles

The .Police representatives pointed out that public.-.order and publit. safety .
                                                                               c.
problems were caused on occasions outside the ground (mainly at evening matches)
by spectators spilling out onto Penistone Road whilst trying to gain admission
to the ground.   These problems had been discussed with the Club, and had
probably resulted in the request now before the Working Part>. However, whilst
putting the case for additional turnstiles, the police representatives stressed
that in no way did they consider this should be done at the expense or means^
of escape, should the Working Party consider that this would be the result of
the Club's temporary proposals now under consideration.

The Fire Service representatives reported that they had carried out a site
inspection, and pointed out that the existing five exits in question were only
just adequate in the event of a maximum capacity crowd (using the Green Guide
calculations).

The Working Party discussed a number of options which might be open to the Club,
pending the carrying out of the permanent proposals in the 1982 close season.

IT WAS AGREED that, whilst the Club's permanent proposals were welcome in
principle, the temporary proposals for six additional turnstiles on the
Penistone Road side of the ground (by removing the existing 21 ft. exit gate)
could not be supported.

IT WAS ALSO AGREED that, in order to be constructive, the following options
should be brought to the Club's notice:-

(a)        a r e d u c t i o n of 3,840 in the Spion Kop capacity should the Club wish
           to proceed w i t h the t e mporary proposals;
(b)    the construction of some form of easily removeable turnstiles to enable
       the existing 21 ft. exit gate to continue to be available;

(c)    the construction of new turnstiles in the area of the Stadium between
       the end of the South Stand and the Penistone Road, possibly for use solely
       at evening matches where large attendances are envisaged should the
       Club wish to normally retain the exclusivisuvofthe South Stand area.

3^_____ Police and First Aid Facilities

Whilst neither the Club nor its Consultants had replied to date to the
representations made regarding the new police and first facilities, the Police
representatives reported that it appeared that some progress was being made and
that the subject had been discussed at a recent Board meeting.

IT WAS AGREED that, in the absence of a firm indication from the Club as to when
the new police and first aid facilities are to beprovided, Hr. Vaughan should
draw to the Club's attention that the North Stand capacity is determined by
the evacuation time of 8 minutes originally agreed using the non-combustibility
standards of the Green Guide.  If the existing police and first aid facilities
are to remain, then the evacuation time will have to be reduced to the
combustible standard evacuation time of    minutes. Naturally, this would
entail either a reduction in the number of spectators admitted to the North
Stand or an increase in the number of exits from the Stand.

               1.    Purpose o£ Meeting

    .\~y   ~   xhe purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 2nd September
               and plans submitted by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners-on behalf of the_
               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. relating- to the proposed erection
               of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and
               Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand now that the
               gymnasium was open to the general public..

               2.    Radial Barriers on West Terrace                   ...........

               Fnilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
               approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
               Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
               from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with      .
               opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
               gates, but the police considered that they could cope with any problems
               of this nature.

               The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
               the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
               existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
               Terrace.

               It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head­
               room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the
               radial barriers and gates be installed.

               IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
               thatthe Officer Working Party  sees no objection to the proposals to instal
               two 1680mm high radial barriers, with 1.15 metre wide gates at the rear,
               on the West Terrace at the Hillsboro'ugh Stadium, subject to:-

                      (i)-        the further calculations required by the Building
                                  Authority being satisfactory;

                      (ii)        confirmation that adequate headroom will be
                                   available at the rear of the Terrace, and

                      (iii)       the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being
                                  under police control.

3 » - S e c u r i t y Gates around North. Stand -r.^-- — -------------------------.■

Now that the gymnasium-was' open to .the general public, the Club wished to
erect security gates' at^. the top'of-the ramps at both ends of the North
Stand, with additional gates at ground floor level at the Penistone_Road
end of the Stand. - A separate gate would also be placed behind the West- ..
Famp to prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards .
Lepping^ Lane.                       ’

These gates would .be fastened when the gymnasium only was in use so as to
provide'security for the rest of the ground.- However, on match days they
would be secured in the fully open position to allow unrestricted access.-
                                                                                       •   •



IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the erection of security
gates around the North Stand, subject to1 the gates and/or their supports,
hinges, etc not impinging'on the existing critical ramp widths, and to the
gates being secured in the fully open position on match days.

4.        Police and First Aid Facilities
                                    •   *        *

It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first aid _
facilities under the North Stand had Been accepted on an^interim basis.
The CluB had undertaken to provide purpose Built facilities in a similar
position to the existing timbered facilities^during the 1980 close
season. Whilst some progress had been made in discussing details of the
facilities, no firm indication had yet Been given as to when they would
actually Be provided.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr..D, Vaughan should press the CluB and/or its
Consultants   for a firm indication as to when the new police and first
aid facilities are tovBe provided.

5.         Lottery Ticket Boxes

Attention was drawn to the Blocked egress which could result if the
timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps were- to
be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr, Vaughan should draw the Club’s attention to the
desirability of re-siting the lottery ticket boxes.

1 _____ Purpose of Meeting

 The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
 Workin" Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
 mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originally referred to
■'in 'nhc 'Cfrref--Exe-eativs1‘-'"l-et'ter to -the .Club -.January..- 198 ■ vhe.-
 visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
 venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

 2._____ Inspection of   Stadium

The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

 (a)    South Stand

 The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel
 trusses referred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, m
 the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be given.

 It was noted that the monitoring device to-be sited adjacent to the new^
 metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
 public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
 be provided.

 (b)    West Stand

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars supporting the steps at the rear of the
'stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
 had been made good.

 As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
 the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
 (nearest to the South Stand).

 Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
 considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand.
 An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
 when these had substance.
  (c)      North-West Terrace

 The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take place after
 treatment had now been satisfactorily treated.

 It was also noted'that the tie bars through the upper level concrete
 area to the rear had been protectively wrapped.

  (d)      North Stand

 The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
 Kop) had been made good.

  (e)      Spion Kop

 The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
 original exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would
 be attended to shortly.

 The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of the
 new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
 Kop original exit steps (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
 to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
 extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
 level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
 original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.

.. ,( £)___r JSenexaJL>~j».

  It was noted:-

  (i)    that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the
  rear of the Butcher's Shop on Penistone Road required attention because of
  corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall between the Spion
  Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

1.         Purpose of Meeting

•Bearing in m n d ~ the-F.A.- Cup-Semi-FinaL-which: was't:o take place on Satwrdajr,-   '>
 11th April, 1981, it was felt it would be desirable for the Working Party to
 visit the ground, especially as'a small number of matters had arisen since the
 last visit on 10th February, 1981.

2.     ’ Inspection of Ground

 (a)       South Stand

The previous comments relating to the roof structure and the exterior windows in
the Ladies’ Toilets below the stand were still applicable.

The L.P.G. cylinders had been removed from beneath the Stand,and the batteries
supplying the emergency power supply for the police address had been enclosed in
a satisfactory fire resisting metal case. Whilst the provision of an automatic
battery charger would be a longer term solution, in the short term arrangements^
had been made for the batteries to be charged before each game and for the public
address system to be checked relying only on the emergency battery supply. The
indicator for the batteries condition was presently in the Public Address Box.
It was suggested that it would be less likely to be overlooked if the indicator
was sited adjacent to the new metal case for the batteries.

 (b)       West Stand

As previously agreed, the Club would round off the steel supports to the new
emergency exit (nearest to the South Stand) as soon as a grinder was next present
at the ground.

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand which required pointing, the
apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the steps at the. rear of the
stand, the cracks in the concrete at the' tpp bo both sets of stairs, as well as
the currently slight corrosion-in the base plate of the outer steel column
(nearest to the South Stand) had all been included in the maintenance pro gramme
and would be undertaken shortly.-
(c)     North West Terrace

The cracking of the concreting had been attended to by xnjecting material from
the top.  The results had been satisfactory, except in two small areas where
water seepage had obviously taken place and which would receive further
attention.

.(d)    North Stand

The expansion cracks which had appeared in the wall of the North Stand (nearest
to the Spion Kop) had been included in the maintenance schedule and would be
attended to shortly.

 (e)    Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original
exit at the top of the Kop would be given attention in the close season.

Whilst the brick built chip shop at the bottom of the new exit from the Kop had
been erected, it was not yet in use.  It was noted that the siting of the
chip shop had resulted in a possible danger to spectators in that a gap into
which spectators could be pushed, or possibly stumDle because of the camber, had
been created. As regards the F.A. Cup Semi-Final,

IT WAS AGREED - -      '   ■- >   .-       -                              • -           •         ••••••... -

that a temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes should be erected between the end
of the new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps.  In the longer uerrn, the existing barriers would need
extending to fill the gap and ideally, the area between the bottom of the new Kop
exit staircase and the original Kop exit steps should be levelled ofi.

 3._____ Ground Evacuation'Procedure

Whilst the Club had been supplied with a Schedule on "Fire Instruction and Drills"
on 9th April, 1980, consultations between.the County Fire Service and the South
Yorkshire Police had resulted in the production of an "Emergency Evacuation
Procedure".  The Club undertook to circulate copies of the procedure to all
Stewards who would be on duty for the F.A. Cup Semi-Final.

           D.   I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1.       Purpose of Meeting

Mr. H. E. McGee, the Club's Chairman, welcomed the Working party.

As had- been explained- .in--.‘theChie.f' Executive's let ter. .da.*.ad. 10th January ~
the Club, the County Council -felt it was desirable to introduce a twice-
yearly programme of visits by the Officer Working Parties to all five of
the League Football Grounds in South Yorkshire (namely, early in the year and
also in the middle of the Year) in an effort to maintain public confidence
in their safety at football grounds. Additionally, at the other grounds,
it was hoped that this procedure would obviate the real possibility of the
Clubs carrying out works which might prove abortive or require additional
work on designation. This was the first of such a programme of visits.

2.       Inspection of Ground

Mr. McGee left to attend to other business, and the remainder of the
representatives made a tour of inspection of the ground. It was agreed
that the majority of matters revealed (detailed below) could be regarded
as routine maintenance.

(a)      South Stand

The detailed inspection of a mutually agreed part of the roof structure
had taken place on 13th/l4th January after the erection of scaffolding and
platforms.  Bearing in mind the age of the stand, relatively little
deterioration had taken place.  It had been agreed that the apparent
deflection in the steel trusses should be monitored over a period of time.
Whilst there were signs of water staining on the roof timbers, it was by
no means certain if water penetration was still taking place.  It was
agreed that the area around the roof hatch should be particularly investigated,
which would also give the opportunity of inspecting the roof tiles generally.

It was also agreed that should any of the exterior windows in the Ladies'
Toilets below the stand be broken, they would be replaced by wired or some
such safety glass.
(b)     Spion Kop

Except for the continuing maintenance of the concrete terracing and crush
barriers, the only matter requiring attention was the infilling of a step
adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original exit at the top of -
the K o p .

The Club had received Planning Permission and    Building Regulation approval
to the erection of a brick built chip shop at    the bottom right of the new
exit from the Kop (viewed when descending).     The siting of the chipshop
would not interfere with the egress from the    new      Kop exit.

(c)     North Stand

Expansion cracks had appeared in the wall of the North Stand(nearest     to
the Spion Kop) which required attention.

The Club were in the process of building showers and changing accommodation
attached to the existing gymnasium at the rear of the Stand. The public
did not have access to the facilities. Additionally, the Club were
investigating the possibility of acquiring property in Vere Road so as to
provide an alternative exclusive access to the gymnasium without using
the existing access through the ground.

'Revised proposals~For'the 'facilities to be provided j u v ae*r Police .Post., .
 and First Aid facilities had been agreed, and it was intended to build
 permanent accommodation in virtually the same position as the existing
 temporary structures.

(d)     North West Corner Terrace

The Club had received quotations for making good the cracking of the concrete
on the terracing, which the Board were to consider shortly.

(e)     West Stand

Some cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand required pointing and then
checking to see if the cracks re-opened.

Apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the steps at the rear
of the Stand required urgent attention, and attention ought also to be
given to cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs.

The weathering and corrosion in the base plate of the sheeting column in
the south-west c o m e r of the stand required attention, possibly by concrete
sheeting.

Finally, the steel supports to the new emergency exit (nearest to the
South Stand) still required to be rounded off.

(f)     Police Control Facilities

The Club pointed out that the police now had exclusive use of the box
(overlooking the whole of the ground) previously used by the disc jockey.
The disco unit had been re-sited underneath the original box.
3.        Re vised Entrance Facilities

The Club outlined the consideration being given to the siting of caravans
outside the Penistone Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell
tickets.  It was hoped that if this took place, increased entry flow of
spectators to the ground would result by reducing delays at the turnstiles.

4.______ Bar Facilities

The Club also outlined the consideration being given, at the request of
the Police, to revised bar facilities at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground.

5 .____   Future Developments

Whilst the proposals were in a very preliminary stage, consideration was
being given by the Club to the provision of an Executive Club' at the
Leppings Lane end of the car park under the South Stand and the adjoining
store area. There was also a possibility of the existing office accomm­
odation being extended outwards. -Additionally, the reception lounge
might be extended, the kitchen area moved and a new Directors' Room built.
It was stressed that these were long term plans and no firm proposals existed
at the moment.

1 .______Purpose of Meeting

In view of the F .A . Cup Sem i-Final at Hillsborough on 12th April and following recent
visits by the disciplines represented on the Working Party, the Chief Executive of the
South Yorkshire County Council had raised with the Club by letter dated 31st March various
matters which apparently were still outstanding.

A letter of reply dated 3rd April had been received from the Club, as well as letters dated
4th and 8th April from the Club's Consultants, Messrs.- Eastwood and Partners, giving
details of the present position.

2 .______Inspection of Ground

The Working Party inspected the ground in company with the Club's representatives.

(i)       Training of Safety Stewards

          The Club had felt there was little point in pursuing thetraining of the Safety
          Stewards until the fire warning system had been completely installed, but with
          agreement the County Fire Service had instructed some stewards yesterday.
          A schedule specifying the duties and responsibilities was handed to the Club's
          representatives.

(ii)      Exit Signs

          The Club's representatives felt thatthe exit signs generally had been     sited where
          required and were of adequate size and/or illuminated.

           It was agreed that there were a number which could be more advantageously sited
           and/or illuminated, and some which might be more effective with larger lettering
and/or direction arrows. The Couhty Fire Service undertook to liaise with
M essrs. Eastwood and Partners.

Emergency Lighting in the South Stand

As was evident, complete re-w iring of the South Stand with separate e iic u u s tuul
already commenced, and the County Fire Service undertook to let M essrs. Eas.wood
and Partners know their detailed requirements.

Fire Warning System

The Fire Warning System had been, installed, except for the trickle charger and
battery equipment. These item s had been subject to delivery problem s, but the
system should be complete by the end of the month.

It was agreed that as regards the F .A . Cup Somi-Final, the Police Communications
b J e wMch would be at the ground would also be used for Fire Service purposes if        ,
 necessary.

         of Fire R esisting Frame s                            . . . . . . . ___    ______

 The sealing of the fire resisting door fram es against the supporting: M ils had generally
 be^n carried out, but there were a sm all number which were now showing signs of
 sm all gaps.

 Fire Retardent Paint

 The Club pointed out that "Nullifire" fire retardent paint had been specified on the
 partitions within the South Stand but, as the Contractors were on holiday until
 14th April, it was not possible to say with certainty at this time whether it had actually
 been used.

 Wired Glass

 The Club pointed out that to the best of their knowledge wired glass had been used
 wherever required by the County Fire Service.

  The County Fire Service and the Police were generally satisfied that the sm all panes
  of glass in the upper half of the wooden partitions within the South Stand woul n
  normal circum stances be regarded as a fire and/or safety tazard ^ e Club agreed m
  the longer term to consider the fitting of wired glass and, in the short term , to
  consider fitting wooden battons as an interim measure.

  Sharp Edges to Steelwork on South-West Stand

  Whilst there were a number of sharp corners on the supports, these were at a height
  of at least seven feet. However, the Club undertook to round them off.

  Perim eter Fencing on the Spion Kop

  The Club pointed out that this had been tested where feasible and the results forwarded
  to the Chief Executive in January. A copy had been passed to the Buil ing u o n y n
  30th January.                                 ‘
Possible Step Obstruction on Upper Exit Area on Spion Kop

Whilst it was agreed that the erection of the barriers at the Upper Exit Area had left
a sm all adjacent area of approximately one foot wide by four foot long at a lower level
than the remainder of the exit, it was felt that its position coupled with the crowd
flow at that point meant that it did not unduly create an hazard. However, the Club
undertook to give attention to it in the longer term.

Mesh Fencing under North Stand

In view of the normal crowd flow rates on the public side of the mesh fencing and the
fact that there was no public access to its rear, it was felt that the timber framed
mesh fencing under the North Stand providing security to storage areas was acceptable.

 I.____ purpose of Meeting
 The original intention of the visit had been to check that the outstanding matters
 referred to In the Note of the meeting held on 12th November had been completed
 or were In the course of completion prior to tbs anticipated issue of the Certificate
 by the County Council this week.

 2.         Minor Matters

 An Inspection of the ground showed that a number of minor matters still required
 attention, but the Club undertook to ensure that these were attended to in the db xt
  few days.

  3.        Major Matters

  A.        E m erg en cy L ighting - South Stand

  The meetings which had taken place between the County Fire Service and M essrs.
  Eastwood and Partners since 12th November on the South Stand Emergency Lig ing
  had produced agreement on an interim arrangemert which would be regarded as
acceptable for the duration of the existing battery life. F      modtflratlons at
                                                              u r t h e r


that time would remedy the shortcomings o f the existing Installation.
contained in the letter dated 12th December which M essrs. Eastwood and Partners t
h a daddressed to the Fire Service.

B.      South Stand Construction

The Building Authority expressed concern a s to what they saw as a lack of structural
Integrity In the South Stand. In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
p rogressive deterioration of the Stand which, it was felt, could only be properly
determined by a full structural survey. The report forwarded by M e s s r s . Eastwood
and Partners in the la st week was not considered to be aifficlently comprehensive
to provide tte required information, and the basis of calculation used could not be
agreed as appropriate. Whilst It was agreed that there had not fc jn ji specinc
 written request for such a full structural survey of the South Stand, ^                    m
Authority felt that it had been Inherent In the detailed discussions which had taken
place that such a report would be fbrthcomlng. The Building Authority were
 concerned at the possibility that the requirements of the Building E e ^ l^ io n s and
 the Code of Practice Safety Factors could not be met; In particular the Structural
 stability o f the South Stand In conditio ns of gale force winds and heavy snowfall
 was mentioned.

  For the Club, Dr. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obviously not be built to the
  same specification or the sane construction standards n o ^ d a y s t o pointedout
  that, for instai ce, none of the buildings in Sheffield built before 1970 could m eet _
  the la test wind pressure requirements. Even the Building Research SUtion was ,
  evidently thinking In term s that these requirements were unrealIstically high. In
  his professional opinion, the Stand was structurally safe and able in practice to mee
  the loadings demanded. In any case, the conditions which had been d escrib ed as
   being possibly dangerous would mean In practice that a match could not be played
   and consequently no spectators would be present.

   Experience of the corrosion of Indoors steel in the Sheffield area showed this to be
   minimal, and the Stand was regularly test loaded by spectators. Structures sue
   as this would show obvious external sign s, such as cracks, well before there was
   any possibility of collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
   visual inspection. Even though he did not consider It essential, pla^ng of the
   front steel columns had been carried out as a compromise to try and meet the
   Building Authority’s concern. He agreed there might well be a continuing          ^
   maintenance problem with the stand, but this was a different matter to saying there
   was a structural problem. Reference was made to the Guide’s advice that when
   a ssessin g whether existing situations provided adequately for the safety of spectators,
   the criterion to be used is that of a reasonable degree of safety. In Dr. Eastwood s
    view, it would be unreasonable and unnecessary to Insist on a full structural survey
    of the South Stand or to delay the Issue of the Certificate. It was his professions
    opinion (which he was m ost jealous of and would not put in jeopardy) that the Snit
    Stand was structurally safe and that the basts of the calculations provided was
    appropriate. He was prepared to advise the Club to use the appeal procedure open
    to them should this be necessary.


                                           2.
IT WAS AGBEED that:

(a)   as there was no obvious deterioration In the South Stand structure of such
       a nature as to be of immediate concern, no objection wax Id be raised to the
       continuance o f the derby game with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning
       provided that no extreme weather conditions occurred in the Intervening
       period, and

(b)   a furtoer meeting should be held as a matter of urgency between the Building
        Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood to discuss the structural Integrity of the
       South Stand and the appropriateness of the calculations used (Mr. D. Vaughan
       to be present at Dr. Eastwood’s request).

NOTE As the discussions on the South Stand Construction hinged on structural
     theories and practices, the Fire Service and Police representatives felt
     there was little they could contribute and left the meeting prior to its
     termination.

2         regarded as acceptable as regards the emergency lighting in toe Souta
          Stand. It was agreed that a trial should be conducted during the hours of
          darkness attended by representatives cf the Club and tne tire service su
          as to identify the danger areas. Consideration would then be given to

          A s agreed, a suitable permanent Police R o o m would be provided in the lv8G
          closed season.

          The Club explained that it would be preferable from a building point of view
          for both the police and first aid facilities to be in the s a m e overall building
          although physically separated. The police representatives reserved their
          position on this point, pending the outcome of detailed discussions with the
          Club.

           The question of parking for both police and St. John’s personnel purposes
           would also need to be looked at in detail.

  S.     Ground Capacity

           Provided the outstanding points we re satisfactorily resolved, it was agreed
           that the crowd capacity would be as shown, i.e. a total of 50,174.

1 &      It was obvious that there was a difference of opinion as to what could be
2        regarded as acceptable as regards the emergency lighting in the South
          Stand. It was agreed that a trial should beconducted during the hours of
          darkness attended by representatives c£ the Club and the Fire. Service su
          as to identify the danger areas. Consideration would then be given to
          possibly installing an extra battery and additional wiring to those particular
          areas not covered by the emergency lighting covering other parts of the
          ground.

 I.      Fire Warning System

          The problems with the public address system s eemed to be mainly ones of
          diction and correct volume level. It was agreed that the police would monitor the
          position at the next home match and, pending the new police control post being-
          erected, would arrange for an officer to sit alongside the Disc Jockey in the
          meantime.

          It was also agreed that the monitoring point for the fire deteetrm equipment
          should be in the tower between the South and West Stands, and would proceed
          once the electrical work was completed.

 j.        F i re Extinguishers


           The fire extinguishers had been delivered and were to be fitted shortly as
           shown on the plan. The Fire Service undertook to clear any doubtful points.
K.    G eneral F ir e P recau tion s

2.    Work to be carried out shortly.

3.    Waste paper cleared at bottom - other areas to be cleared shortly.

L.    Training of Safety Stewards and Staff

1.    To be erected after decorations complete.

2.    Will be put in.hand once agreement            reached on emergency lighting.

N.    Emergency Procedure

       It was agreed that the Fire Service wouldsupply the Club with details of the
       n ecessary wording.

Q.    A c c e s s for E m e r g e n c y Vehicles


 1.   It was agreed that whilst no real problems haci occurred in the past, the Club
       would (in consultation with the Fire Service and the Police) m ars out a Lane,
       from the main gate to the South Stand in which parking would not be allowed.
       It was also agreed that the hydrant outside the South Stand would have to be
       kept clear.

 P.    Public Address System

       Already discussed under "Fire Warning System"

 Q.   Police Facilites and R. F irst Aid Facilities

        As agreed, a suitable permanent Police Room would be provided in the iy8G
        closed season.

        The Club explained that it would be preferable from a building point of view
        for boththe police and first aid facilities to be in the same overall building
        although physically separated. The police representatives reserved their
        position on this point, pending the outcome of detailed discussions with the
        Club.

        The question of parking for both police and St. John’s personnel purposes
        would also need to be looked at in detail.

 S.___ Ground Capacity

        Provided the outstanding points were satisfactorily resolved, it was agreed
        that the crowd capacity would be as shown, i . e . a total of 50,174.

                                                   4.
The Club were anxious that the Certificate should be in force by the derby game
with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning, and they were assured that providing
the outstanding points were satisfactorily resolved, it was stiLl the intention to
Issue the Certificate at the beginning of December.

1_._____ Sheffield United Football Ground

The Working Party considered Preliminary Drawings nos. 1917/1, 2, 3 and 4 forwarded
by M essrs. Eastwood and Partners relating to the Club's proposals to erect a new
security fence around three sides of the pitch at Bramall Lane.

Superintendents Gavins and Johnson confirmed that the proposals followed recommendations
which they had made to the Club on security grounds.

IT WAS AGREED that the proposals were generally acceptable, provided that the security
gates in the fence were not regarded as means of escape and that the necessary stress
calculations were supplied and were acceptable.

As they were primarily concerned with only the Bramall Lane ground, Superintendents
Gavins and Johnson left after this item.

The Working Party considered the progress of work at the Ground since their last
meeting on 12th July.

Whilst it was agreed that the Club had done much of the outside work referred to in the
Schedule of Matters Requiring Attention (dated 8th June), the Building Authority
expressed particular concern about the possible stresses on the extensions at each end
of the West Staircase to link with the simple steel construction emergency staircases
to be erected. It was also pointed out that, at the present time, no strengthening of the
corrugated sheeting on the North West Terrace had been carried out and that the Fire
Prevention Works and Structural and Rectification Works in the South Stand had not
yet been commenced. The urgent need to carry out the South Stand work was stressed.

It was noted that M essrs. Eastwood & Partners had by letter dated 10th August received by
the County Council yesterday sent revised drawings, calculations for the steel staircase
and cantilever slabs on the West Stand, and details of the prqposed works to upgrade fire
resistance.   Comments had been requested by 3rd September.

Whilst many detailed preliminary plans had been provided by M essrs. Eastwood and Partners
these were not suitable for including as part of the Certificate. The conditions and
date of issue of the Certificate ^ i e also discussed, as was the provision of the
First-Aid Facilities recommended by the Area Health Authority.

A letter had also been received that morning from M essrs. Eastwood and Partners.,
requesting alterations to the previously agreed barrier arrangements in the North
Stand.

IT WAS AGREED:-

 (a)    that the aim be to issue the Certificate at the beginning of December; that the
        Club be advised of this aim and asked to state their programme for the                ^
        completion of the required works, any works not completed by that date to
        be included in a Schedule of Crowd Capacity Limitation to be incorporated in
        the Certificate;

 (b)    that particular emphasis be placed on the necessity of carrying out the required
        works to the South Stand as soon as possible and that provided that it is feasible
        the Building Authority and the Fire Service be requested to let the County Council
        have their observations on the structural and fire resistance aspects for
        incorporation into a reply by 3rd September as requested by M essrs. Eastwood
        and Partners' letter dated 10th August;

 (c)    that the question of plans to form part of the Certificate be re-considered when
         all the preliminary detailed plans being submitted have been agreed;

 (d)    that, as with the proposed Police permanent structure, the Club be requested
         to provide the proposed First-Aid permanent structure in the 1980 close season,
         subject to the Club agreeing to provide the recommended equipment immediately;       ^

  (e)   that M essrs. Eastwood and Partners be advised that the alterations to the
 • |    previously agreed barrier arrangement in the North Stand set out in their leti.er
■vf '   dated 14th August cannot be agreed, the alternative to their suggestions being
         the retention of the 1.1 metre height (as recommended by the Guide) in line
         with the stairs but with a possible reduction in height of the returns to 1 metre;

 (f)    that the following amendments be made to the Draft Certificate -

        (i)     paragraph 8 to be deleted and replaced by the following new paragraph -

               »8(1)    The Holder shall provide and maintain at the Stadium to the

                whereabouts are known to those in the Police Central Control
                Room at the Stadium.

        (3)     The Holder shall arrange for the attendance at every specified
                activity of such numbers of qualified First Aid assistants as
                the County Council shall require but without prejudice to the
                foregoing the Holder shall ensure that at every specified activity
                there is at least one First Aid assistant for every 2, 000
                spectators."

        the Chief Fire Officer and indicated on plan no.

(iv)    paragraph 29 to be re-numbered 30 and the following new paragraph
        29 to be inserted -

        "29.    Subject to the provisions of this Schedule the Stadium shali be
                maintained with the facilities and structure including all
                entrances, exits, means of escape and crush barriers in the
                number size position and strength existing at the date of the
                Cei'tificaie ana indicated on the plans and no alteration shall

                County Council in accordance with paragraph 5 .2 of this Part
                of this Schedule."

                           Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 18th April, 1979.

                           Whilst informal meetings on technical points must obviously take place in the
                           first instance, I feel we must'bear in mind that we are approaching the stage
•
                           when the County Council (as Certifying Authority) wiil have to put formally to
                           the Club in writing detd Is of the requirements to be imposed.

                           With this in mind, no doubt, you will let me have as scon as practicable details
                           of the requirements which you w aild wish to see imposed. I will then

                      -     it may well be necessary to call a meeting of-the Working-Party to finalise •                 -
                            the detailed requirements.             ' .

                          • Once the exact form of the certificate and the requirements have been
                            determined, it will, of course, be necessary to seek the approval of the Fire
                            Service Committee to them before the certificate can be issued.

                             Th e fire-services officer proposed a n ew exit from the
                   front terracing under the st a n d and through a new 1.2m wide
                   door adjacent to the existing snack bar.                                                                     Wall surrounding
                   this area to have 1 hour fire resistance.                                                                    Existing doors

                   resistance.                               It was agreed by Building Surveyors representatives
                   that the exi sting construction could be upgraded by forming
                   a sandwich using                                         ’S u p e r t e x ’ or a similar product.

 4.                Mr.             [requested that the brick staircase walls be
            butt ressed where crowd surge pressure could be generated.
            (At a later inspection the           location of these buttresses
            was a g r e e d ) .   Handrails to   be added as was       agreed at the
            meeting on 2 April.

 5.                P r i o r to the meeting the     bases of two       stanchions had
            been exp osed by removing floor timber.               Rusting is not
            excessive.        All bases will be exposed for inspection.                If
           necessary steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts
            before encasing in concrete for permanent protection.
                   In inspecting the two bases,waste paper, and shavings
           of woo d together with cigarette ends were found in considerable

           would be removed from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats
           from in front of each of the 9 upper exits.                   'The total
           number of seats lost is therefore 126 compared with 225

Note of a meeting between the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) and the
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

           Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield: 1 Sth April, 1979

PRESENT:      Representing the. Club

              Dr. W. Eastwood (Consultant)
              E. England (Secretary-)
              H. E. McGee (Chairman)
              R. Whitehead (Director)

              Representing the Working Party

                        (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
              D. Hurst (South Yorkshire Police)
              K. Jones (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

              D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council - Admin. Dept.)

Apologies for absence were received from Dr.            (Sheffield Area Health* .
Authority) and H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service).

The Note (previously circulated) of the meeting held on 2ndApril, 1979, was considered
in conjunction with a Note (circulated at the meeting) of a meeting between Eastwood
and Partners, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the City of Sheffield
Metropolitan District Council Euilding Surveyor's Department held on 13th April, 1979.

The Note of the meeting held on 2nd April. 1979, was agreed, subject to the following
amendments and additions in the light of the further investigations and discussions:-

2A     Spion. Kop

Paras. 1 & 2 -'R evised copies of drawing no. 1610/IX were circulated at the meeting
showing the proposed new crush barrier layout, including the two lines of radial
barriers. This was AGREED in principle.

Para. 3 - A 16, S50 crowd capacity on the Kop as existing would mean an unacceptable
evacuation time of some 2.2-j minutes. Larger and re-aligned gates in the b airier
and improvement of the existing upper exit couid reduce this time to some 10 minutes,
but 8 minutes could only be achieved by installing a new exit of 3 metre overall width.
This couid be integrated into the proposed future scheme for enlarging’ and roofing the
Kop. The Club AGREED to give consideration to the proposals.
Para. 4 - The exploratory work regarding the improvement of the headroom had
still to be carried out, but was not expected to be a major item.

Para. 5 - Because of the difficulty in devising a suitable method of testing in places
(such as the top of the Kop), it was AGREED that proposals should be formulated
after further discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

Para. 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
structure should be looked at. It was AGREED that the question of the height of some
of the crush barriers be considered again after it was seen which of them failed on
testing.

Para. 7 - The Club stressed that their proposals for the improvement of the means of
egress would hopefully be carried out in the shorter rather than the longer term future.

Para. 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush barriers, together with
the installation of the new crush barrier layout and alteration of the gates in the existing
barrier, could all be carried out in the close season. Their aim was to achieve a
16, 850 crowd capacity.

2B       West Terrace

:Para. 2 *- The Oltib accepted 'that ia viesv.of-the cross-fa 11 on the north-west corner ^ ...
 exit, the steps should be re-built. It was AGREED that the other matters would be
 considered again after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.

2C       North West Corner         Terrace

Para. 2 - Whilst accepting the need for the improvement or replacement of the
existing corrugated sheeting, the Club felt they wished to consider whether to carry
out more extensive works so as to bring the existing unused area into use for an
additional 250/300 spectators.

3.       North Stand

Para. 1 - Dr^ Eastwood, the Building Surveyors and the Fire Service had reached
agreement on a scheme which could be recommended to the Club. This would
involve the removaTof 10 seats from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats from in
front of each of the 9 upper exits. The result would mean a loss of 126 seats
compared to the 225 in the original proposals. The Club AGREED to give
consideration to the proposal.

Para. 2 - The word at the        end of the first line shouldhave been'Tea'and not'Team .
It w as AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and theFire Service would discuss in detail an>
fire protection, works considered to be n ecessary.
      4.      W est Stand

      The Club AGREED that additional exits of simple steel construction should be
      provided from each end of the upper stand.

      5.      South Stand

      Para. 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor timber.
      Whilst rusting was not excessive, it was AGREED that all bases would be exposed for
      inspection and, if necessary, steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
      encasing in concrete for permanent protection. Because of the apparent accumulation
      of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
      Club also AGREED that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.

      Para. 2 - Provided the penning barriers were removed entirely, it was AGREED that
      it would not be necessary to remove any seats for escape purposes in the upper part
^     of the stand (the covered area).

       Para. 3 - It was AGREED that timber handrails should be provided down each of the
       outer edges of the main staircase; that the existing iron centre railing should remain,
       and that a new handrail down the centre of each side of the stairway should be installed.
  - ._.lt-w as-also AGREED that, the bricL...s±aircase.«ails._ahould bG.-buttressjGd,;\vhexexra'vd .
■     su ige pressure could ’b eigenefated-^ - ■

      Para. 4 - So far as the front open air part of the stand was concerned, it was AGREED
      that on the west side a new exit through a new 1 .2 metre wide door adjacent tc the existing
      snack bar should be provided, with appropriate fire resistance measures in the
      surrounding area. On the east side, consideration was given to an extension of the
      footway at the front of the stand and the removal of the wall, provided the new exit was
      isolated from the Ko^exit. It was AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service
      should consider precisely what measures could be considered satisfactory so as to
      avoid any loss of seats.

'     6.      Ground Exits

      The 1:500 site plan was in the process of being circulated.

      7.       Communications

      The Club stressed they were thinking in terms of an upgrading of the existing public
      address s ystem. It was AGREED that the Police should have an over-ride facility
      from their Police Room, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look into the possibility oi
      achieving this through radio, rather than wire, means.

       8.      Police and First Aid Facilities

       Paras. 1 & 2 - The Police stressed that it was essential that there was no gap in

9.      Any other Topics

 The evening of the 27th April was agreed as mutually convenient to test the existing
"emergency lighting equipment.

10.     Future Action

Mr. McGee stressed that it was essential for decisions to be taken urgently if the
Club were to complete their plans, both from a financial and practical point of view.

The Club were to make application for financial assistance under the Football
Association's Ground Improvement Scheme, and had to have over 50.00.0 crowd
capacity if the aini of attracting international matches was to be achieved. The latesf  _
proposals, if implemented, appeared to give a capacity of some 50,750.                  c™

So that they could be noted and returned for agreement, the Working Party asked for

PRESENT:       Representing the. Club

               Dr.   W. Eastwood (Consultant)
               E.    England (Secretary)
               H.    E. McGee (Chairman)
               E.    Whitehead (Director)

               Representing the Working Party

                         (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
               D. Hurst (South Yorkshire Police)

               D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council - Admin. Dept.)

Apologies for absence were received from Dr.             (Sheffield Area Health- .
Authority) and H. E. Wright (South Y'orkshire County Fire Service).

The Mote (previously circulated) of the meeting held on. 2ndApril, 1979, was considered
in conjunction with a Note (circulated at the meeting) of a meeting between Eastwood
and Partners, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the City of Sheffield
Metropolitan District Council Euilding Surveyor's Department held on 13th April, 1979.

The Note of the meeting held on 2nd April, 1979, was agreed, subject to the following
amendments and additions in the light of the further investigations and discussions:-

2A     Spion Kop        •

Paras. 1 & 2 -'R evised copies of drawing no.-1610/IX were circulated at the meeting
showing the proposed new crush barrier layout, including the two lines of i-adial
barriers. T h i s was AGREED in principle.

Para. 3 - A 16, 850 crowd capacity on the Kop as existing would mean an unacceptable
evacuation time of some 12^ minutes. Larger and re-aligned gates in the b a n icr
and improvement of the existing upper exit couid reduce this time to some 10 minutes,
but 8 minutes could only be achieved by installing a new exit of 3 metre overall width.
This could be integrated into the proposed future scheme for enlarging and roofing the
Kop. The Club AGREED to give consideration to the proposals.
para. 4 - The exploratory work regarding the improvement of the headroom had
still to be carried out, but was not expected to be a major item.

para. 5 - Eecause of the difficulty in devising a suitable method of testing in places
(such as the top of the Kop), it was AGEEED that proposals should be formulated
after further discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

Para 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
structure should be looked at. It was AGEEED that the question of the height of some
of the crush barriers be considered again after it was seen which of them failed on
testing.

Para. 7 - The Club stressed that their proposals for the improvement of the means of
egress would hopefully be carried out in the shorter rather than the longer term future.

Para. 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush barriers, together with
the installation of the new crush barrier layout and alteration of the gates in the existing
barrier, could all be carried out in the close season. Their aim was to achieve a          n
16, 850 crowd capacity.

2B         West Terrace

para; 2 -•The Club-accepted that in.view of-tBe cross-fall on the north-west corner ..
exit, the steps should be re-built. It was AGEEED that the other matters would be
considered again after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.

2C         North West Corner Terrace

Para. 2 - Whilst accepting the need for the improvement or replacement of the
existing corrugated sheeting, the Club felt they wished to consider whether to carry
out more extensive works so as to bring the existing unused area into use for an
additional 250/300 spectators.

3.         North Stand

Para. 1 - Dr. Eastwood, the Building Surveyors and the Fire Service had reached
agreement on a scheme which could be recommended to the Club. This would ^
involve the removal of 10 seats from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats from in
front of each of the 9 upper exits. The result would mean a loss of 126 seats
compared to the 225 in the original proposals. The Club AGEEED to give
consideration to the proposal.

Para. 2 - The word at the end of the first line should have been 'Tea' and not 'Team'.
It w as AGEEED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service would discuss in detail an>
fire protection works considered to be n ecessary.
4.       W est Stand

The Club AGEEED that additional exits of simple steel construction should be
provided from each end of the upper stand.

5.       South Stand

Para. 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor timber.
Whilst rusting was not excessive, it was AGEEED        that all bases would be exposed for
inspection and, if necessary, steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
encasing in concrete for permanent protection. Eecause of the apparent accumulation
of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
Club also AGEEED that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.

Para. 2 - Provided the penning barriers were removed entirely, it was AGEEED that
it would not be necessary to remove any seats for escape purposes in the upper part
of the stand (the covered area).

 Para. 3 - It was AGEEED that timber handrails should be provided down each of the
 outer edges of the main staircase; that the existing iron centre railing should remain,
 and that a new handrail down the centre of each side of the stairway should be installed.

Para. 4 - So far as the front open air part of the stand was concerned, it was AGEEED
that on the west side a new exit through a new 1 .2 metre wide door adjacent tr. the existing
snack bar should be provided, with appropriate fire resistance measures in the
surrounding area. On the east side, consideration was given to an extension of the
footway at the front of the stand and the removal of the wall, provided the new exit was
isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGREES-that Dr. Eastwood aud the Fire Service
should consider precisely what measures could be considered satisfactory so as to
avoid any loss of seats.

6.       Ground Exits

 The 1:500 site plan was in the process of being circulated.

 7.      Communications

 The Club stressed they were thinking in terms of an upgrading of the existing public
 address sy ste m . It was AGEEED that the Police should have an over-ride facility
 from their Police Room, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look into the possibility of
 achieving this through radio, rather than wire, means.

 8.      Police and F irst Aid Facilities

 Paras. 1 & 2 - The Police stressed that it was essential that there was no gap in
 the provision of Police Facilities when the temporary structure was replaced by
 the permanent structure. With this in mind, they were happy for the safety aspects

■1.   Scope and Objectives of Discussions

Mr. H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best in Europe. Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and it was hoped to expand this side of~the Club's activities. The Club's
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

IT WAS AGEEED-

1.    That, whilst Designating Orders did not specify time limits for the issue of
General Safety Certificates, it was essential to aim for the Certificate to be Issued
by the start of the 1979/80 Season.
                                                                                                                     >

     x.    That, in view of the obvious difference of opinion between the Club and the
     Working Party as to the appropriate steps (if any) to be taken over the width of the
k,-' existing gangways, both sides be requested to consider all the points made, and
     to re-consider the matter at the next meeting.

    2.    That the question of fire protection works to the Store Room and to the Team
    Room be the s u b j e c t of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the
    Fire Service.

     3.     That the replacement (from a fire hazard point of view) of the existing Police
     and First-Aid Temporary Structures under the Stand be accepted in principle, and
. ■' that the facilities required in the new permanent structures be considered later in
     the Agenda.

     4.    That the existing Wire Mesh barriers under the Stand be the s u b j e c t of
     discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service.

    5.    That the question of the provision of handrails'be the s u b j e c t of discussions
    between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.
                                                          3.
   4.          W est Stand

    IT WAS AGREED -

   That, whilst the upper level of the Stand can be emptied in the required time,
   consideration be given to reducing the congestion which may occur in the lower

   end of the Stand (possibly of the Fire Escape type for emergency u se, rather
   than for normal use),

   5.          South Stand

    IT WAS AGREED -

   1.     That Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor discuss in detail the apparent
   spalling of the concrete frame at high levels, apparent corrosion of the main
   steelwork columns, removal of the timber casing at base level for inspection (2
   only as representative sample), and load testing of a representative sample of
   single and double skin walls.

                                                                 r-.v*

   handrails down the stairways.

   4.    That the means of escape problems in the front open air part of the stand
   be 'dealt with on the West side by making an additional exit for emergency use only
   through the Tea Bar wall to the foot of the existing stairway, and that on the east

   derelict land adjoining the Spion Kop.

   5.    That no immediate answer seemed to be available with regard to a possible
   limitation On the use of the car park behind-the Stand by entitled persons immediately
   before a match, even though police had control of its use after a match.

    6.         Ground Exits

     1.    '   PUrpo.se of Meeting'' %

     Following the postponement of the meeting with the Club because of adverse
     weather and the difficulty in agreeing a mutually convenient alternative
     date, the purpose of the meeting was to review the position since 12th February,
     1979, prior to the re-arranged meeting with the Club which was now to fcucs
     place on 2nd April. 1979.

     2.        plans

     The plans at 1:500 scale and indicating all site fixtures were, it was still understood,
     to be supplied by Eastwood & Partners at the meeting with the Club.

     3.        Report                         ___
     (a)       General

     The County Council had contacted the Home Office, but had been given little
     information additional to that contained in their various Circulars. Basically,
     they had said that any new work or reconstruction had to be to a standard not
     lower than that set out in the Guide. However, the maximum flexibility had
     to be maintained in the case of existing structures and differences in suoii
     matters as age, size and mode of construction had to be taken into account.

     The Fire Service had contacted four other Brigades with designated grounds,
     and only in one case had the recommendations of the Guide been strictly
     adhered to.

                                         1.
 (b)       Spion Kop (pages 2, 3 & 4) . .        ...    .. . . • .                ,

 Additional to the points mentioned on 12th February, 1979,- concern was'
 expressed by the Building; Authority as to the general maintenance of the Kop
 and the loose and broken concrete at the bottom in particular. If attention
 was not given to this, it was AGREED that it would be necessai-y to restrict
 admission to the Kop, additional to the restriction to 11,040 if the extra
 exits are not provided.               »                            . .

 On the question of exits, it was again AGREED that it was essential to line
 up the gates in the existing barrier with the gangways. Of the existing two
 exits, concern was expressed as to the effect of the right-angled turn on
 the embankment at the exit at the rear. After discussion, it was AGREED
- that the best compromise was to leave things as they existed, provided
 handrails are provided on.the stairways, taking into account the
 desirability of maintaining a smooth flow.           •.

  The Fire Service queried the exact form of the lateral separation discussed
  at the meeting on 12th February, 1979, as this would naturally have a
  bearing'on the means of escape recommendations. After discussion, it
  was AGREED that the metal fences should not be of the climb-proof type,
^that i j i w a s j o t                          ic t t h |.£ ^
i-lnxpi^quefibe?''ti"ie*padldcl<M*ga|&\yayrf^                    .'be, dr opped£giv . .j ^
 However, it was AGREED that it was still desirable to seek 3 x 2 central
  barriers but, if the Club really resisted the suggestion, 2 x 2 could _ :
  reiuctantly.be conceded. The Building Authority stressed that whatever
  barriers were provided would have to pass the appropriate strain tests.

 The fact that the height of many of the existing crush barriers was below the
 recommendation in the Guide, in some cases wall below, was pointed out by the
 ^Building Authority. The corrosion point mentioned at the last meeting was
 also reiterated. It was AGREED that these points must be drawn to the                                 -
 Club's, attention, as must the condition of the Score Board Structure. ^

 (c)       The West Terrace (pages 4 & 5)                                                    (:> y ^

 As well as the condition of the crush barriers mentioned at the la st meeting,
 the Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places of the
 terracing in small areas near to the stand. The cross-fall on the steps on
 the north-west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw
 people forward. The height of the crush barriers mentioned in regard to the
 Spion Kop also applied. It was AGREED that all these points must be drawn
 to the Club’s attention.                            ,     .

 (d)     . The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 6)

 Having now had the opportunity of having a closer look at the existing corrugated
 sheeting, the Building Authority confirmed that it would require alteration to
 meet the requirements of the Guide.

                                     2.
          Tb.o North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

 The removal of a row of seats from the top o£ the stand down each gangway
 to the upper exits and the removal of four seats at those exits was
 confi , j''.ed as being a reasonable compromise to put to the Club.

 As the asbestos sheets at the top of the stand were protected, the Building
 Authority felt that these could be accepted, and confirmed that the glazing
 at the ends of the stands was not glass and so would, not shatter.

 (£)      The West Stand (page 7)

 Consideration was given to the Building Authority's suggestion of lateral
 gangways and the segregation of exits but, after discussion, it was AGREED
 that the additional staircase agreed at the last meeting should be confirmed.
 So long as it was of 4-unit exit width, it was AGREED it was not necessary
 to in sist it should be on the south-west corner. Such staircases could be
 bought "off the peg" and, if not installed in the close season, it was
 AGREED that a g reduction in capacity would be necessary.

 (g)      The South Stand {pages 7 & 8)

-As mentioned a v^ G '^ astin eetin ^ .^ c perming arrangements of the seating
 and the numbers of seats in the rows caused problems. Bearing in mind, the
 need for reasonableness and to make the situation better, it was AGREED
 that, oven though not strictly in accordance with the Guide, that the b?st
 compromise was to seek the removal of the existing barriers and their
 re-alignment, together with the widening of the gangways at the position
 of the wings.

 The Fire Service pointed out and it was AGREED that Fire Resisting Doors
 would be required leading to the Directors' seating, and 1 hour fire
 resistance would be required for all problem areas under the stand. Tnis
 could be reduced to i- hour if automatic detection equipment were to be
 installed.

 For their part, the Building Authority reiterated their concern as to the
 corrosion of the steelwork of the stand, and also pointed out the concrete
 spalling which was occurring. Again, the likelihood of the balustrading,
 barriers and guardrails needing to be reinforced or replaced was mentioned.
 It was AGREED all would need to be given attention by the Club.

 (h)      General Requirements (pages 8 & 9)

 As well as the Fire Service pointing out that the present temporary
 structures used for police and first-aid purposes would need removal
 from a means of escape point of view if the capacity of the North Stand
was not to be reduced, the Police stated that they were ready to discuss
with the Club the facilities they woulu require. Briefly, they envisaged
a permanent structure almost twice as large as the existing temporary
structure, and expected communications, detention, '.c'let, parade room,
e t c ., facilities.

So far as First-Aid was concerned, the Sheffield Area Health Authority
had confirmed their willingness to provide advice on First-Aid and
Medical Facilities, but the person nominated (Dr.               - Specialist
in Community Medicine (Social Services)) was on holiday until
2nd April, 1979. He had been invited to the meeting, with the Club on
2nd April, but it was recognised that possible practical difficulties might
prevent his doing so.

1.      Puroose of Meeting

Following tlre-WorMng’^ lr ty 's meeting/with the representatives OFfche ‘v" '
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 13th December. 1873, the
Secretary of the Club had (by letter dated 22nd January. 1979) circulated a
Report, together with Plans, drawn up by Dr. W. Eastwood of Eastwood
and Partners. The Secretary had also suggested a meeting on Friday,
16th February, 1979, to discuss the documents.

The purpose of today’s meeting was £0 consider the views which the Working
Party should put to the Club on the 16th February.

2   .   Plans

(a)     'Whilst the "Notes for the Guidance of Applicants" stated that detailed
plans at 1:100 scale should be supplied of all buildings and other accommodation
for spectators, some of the plans supplied were to 1:200 scale. The Fire
Service felt that the latter size were acceptable provided all of the plans were
to the same scale, and it was AGBEED that the "Notes for the Guidance of
Applicants" should be amended to read plans to 1:200 scale.

(b)     The site plan at 1:500 scale had not been supplied as required by the
Notes, but Eastwood and Partners had undertaken to prepare this in time for
Friday's meeting. The firm had also promised that all site fixtures would be
indicated on that r>lan.
                                            1.
(c)    It was AGREED that th e plans s u p p lie d had inaccuracies and
inadequacies. In particular, they lacked indications of cross sections,
profiles, s t r u c t u r a l stability, p o s i t i o n o f handrails and balustrades, width
of stairways, etc. Where appropriate, these could, as an alternative, be
described in a Report.

(d)   The County 'Council's hope was that, in view of limited resources in
the Architectural & B u ild in g Services Division, the plans supplied and finally
accepted by the Working Party could form the basis of the Certificate
Drawings.                      ,

 3.         Beport      ;   ,‘         ’

 (a)        General

 It was recognised that the criteria set out in the Home Office "Guide to
 Safety at Sports G r o u n d s .(Football)" required new work or reconstruction
 to be to a standard not lower than the standard set out in the Guide, and that
 In existing situations the criterion was that of a reasonable degree of safety.
 A s the Guide stated, it would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable,
 to seek the absolute safety of everyone attending a ground.

  With these factors in mind, both the Fire Service and the Police felt that
                                                  . s a i l e r . a d a p t e d - r,
‘                                                                AuthorHy--saggeit^- >
  it would be useful to know the reasoning behind the recommendation in the
  Guide that gangways should not be le s s than 1,1 metres wide. The County
  Council AGEEED to try to find this information out, arid the f i r e Service
  AGBEED they w o u ld contact their colleagues in other areas who had been
  Involved in the Certification process to ascertain how nearly the 1.1 metre
  gangway recommendation had been observed in existing situations in their
1respective areas.
 At the request of the Fire Service, the County Council also AGREED to try
 and find out if there was any general recommendation on reduced
 admission if a ground were used at a night time instead of during the day
 time,

 (b)         Front Cover                         '

 Whilst it was probably a typing mistake, it was AGREED that the wording
 on the Front Cover should read "REPORT TO SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY
 COUNCIL" and not "REPORT OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL".
    (c)    Spion Kop (pages 2,3 i; -i)

    The Working Party agreed with the Club's view that, with the existing three
    exits, there was no way that the recommended discharge time of S minutes
    could be met. Where they disagreed was that an evacuation time oi 11 £
    minutes should be regarded as acceptable. If no more exits were to be
    provided, the Working Party AGREED that a crowd limitation of 11,040
    on the Spion Kop should be imposed.

    The existing exit at the North end passed under a bridge with a headroom
    below agreed by the Club to be le ss than the recommended value of 8ft.
    As this was in fact some 6?6M, the Working Party AGREED that the Club
    be informed that in their view it is essential that the floor be lowered to
    remove this danger to spectators.

    The exit at the South side would also require widening, and possibly flow
    barriers would need installing.

    The area at the back of the Kop would also require close attention.

     new exits were to be provided by the Club, it was .AGREED that at leas*.
    If
    TWO would be required. The most economical way of providing one would

'^^:th€S‘g angways, with-di^9h^se:ontQ-.tli#*pitch^r^uftd^,andj
     require to be a completely new exit.

     The Building Authority felt that the majority of the crush barriers would fail
     the tests, and consequently any necessary re-siting would probably not fcs
     too much of a problem. Certainly the suggested additional barriers would
   • require careful consideration.

    For the purposes of crowd control, the Police suggested there should be som
    form of lateral separation. The Working Party AGREED, and it was suggest
    that three metal fences sited c e n t r a l l y in the blocks (as opposed to adjacent
    to the g a n g w a y s ) should be provided; with access between each limited to a
    padlocked gateway under the control of the Police.

    As recent adverse weather conditions'had proved, ice and snow on the Kop
    could cause problems, and it was AGEEED that Paragraph 11 (4) of the draft
    Certificate should be amended so as to require the Club to take steps to
    clear the Kop of ice and snow before a game was played.

    The Building Authority pointed out that information was still required from
    the Club on profile and step dimensions and.the slope of the Kop.
(d)     The West Terrace (pages 4&5)        ' !          e

In view of the lack of depth of this terrace, the Club*s offer to reduce the
spectator limit .to 7, 200, and the discharge time of 6. 6,minutes, the
Working Party AGREED that it would be unreasonable to insist that
gangways or-additional exits must be provided.

 However, even if the existing crush barriers were to pass the tests, the
• Working Party AGREED that the barriers would require special attention
 in view of the apparant sharp edges, corrosion, etc.           . ..

(e)     The North West Corner Be in forced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 6)

The Working Party AGREED there were no real problems here, but the
Building Authority pointed out that as well as the crush barriers, the
existing corrugated sheeting would require to pass the appropriate tests.

(f)     The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

Whilst the flow rates and discharge times were probably satisfactory (the             {
construction and width of the ramps being such that they Jcould quite properly
be regarded as elevated roadways), the fact remained that the gangways in
the North Stand were only 640mm wide for much of their length, compared


Additionally, observations had shown that two-thirds of the spectators used
the upper exit, whilst the remainder.used the lower exit. An ideal would be
to provide additional exits at the top of the stand but, in View of its cantilever'
construction, the cost would be prohibitive.- --

A s an alternative, the Working Party AGREED that consideration might be
given to removing a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangway*
to the upper exits, with a physical barrier across the stand below the upper
exits to ensure more equal use of both upper and lower exits by spectators.
If this would cause difficulties, a barrier in the gangways only below the upper
exits might be considered.

So far as the Wire Mesh barriers under the stand were concerned, the
Working Party AGREED that these must either be removed or made of a
permanent construction.

 (g )   The West Stand

Whilst the exits were adequate and well spaced and the discharge times-
were acceptable in view of the type of stand, the Fire Service felt that
      ♦         ft* -leans of escape were so t adequate as the only moans o i egress „**
                t y ^ v of two r t t o M W . The Working Party AC8 BKD 8» t » w . essential
                that another staircase be provided, ar.d one on the south-west corner was .o.t
                to be the most acceptable.

                (h)     The South Stand (pages 7 & 3)

                So far as the seating arrangements were concerned, the Working Party
                felt that It -.vas the front, open air part which caused the c o n c e r n Because
                of the bad in g ress/eg ress, the Working Party A G B fcE D vhat two
                exits would be required. It was suggested that .he m os. economic w
                doing this was by means of one discharging at the Spion Kop ena and the
                other by breaking through che wall by the Tea Bar.

                Additionally, the penning arrangements of the seating would need to be
                 looked at closely.

                As the balustrades and handrails were constructed of timber, the■ Building
                Authority considered they would be likely to fail the appropriate tests.
                Also, as the staircase was a 24 instead of the maximum 1l riser reco
                in the Guide it was probable that this would have to be reconstructed

                 Contrary to their initial reaction, the Fire Service felt that, P ^ e d that the

ii'- iv. :-j"   - W d m t « b e ?&   problem from ar GowMstabilitWpoiht ^ : v le w : ,i^ ^ e y j ia d :^.^
                 anticipated.

                 The BuiV’in*- Authorltv exores.^d concern as to the corrosion of the steel
                 work of the stand, and considered that this would require investigation.

                  The Police expressed concern about the use of the car park behind the
                ' Stand. Persons entitled to use this car park frequently arrived just oetore
                  the start of a match and drove through the spectators attempting to gain ^
                  a ccess to the ground. As they left immediately afterwards, the same ttung
                  occurred at the end of a match. This practice had to be stopped, eimer dv
                  banning the use of the car park entirely on match days or imposing some sort
                  of time restriction on its use before and after a match.

                  (h)     General Requirements

                  These were not discussed by the Working Party at this stage.

 (a)      General

 It w a s recognised that the criteria set out in the H o m e Office "G uide to
 Safety at Sports G r o u n d s .(Football)" required n e w w o r k or reconstruction
 to b e to a standard not lower than the standard set out in the Guide, a n d that
 in existing situations the criterion w a s that of a reasonable degree of safety.
A s the G u i d e stated, it w o u l d b e unreasonable, e v e n if it w e r e practicable,
 to s e e k the absolute safety of e v e r y o n e attending a ground.


 W i t h these factors in m i n d , both the F i r e Service a n d the Police felt that
 the flow of spectators w a s the m o s t important criteria to b e adopted.
 Whilst not disagreeing with this viewpoint, the Building Authority-suggested
 it w o u l d b e useful to k n o w the reasoning behind the r e c o m m e n d a t i o n in the
 G u ide that g a n g w a y s should not b e less than 1.1 m e t r e s wide.           T h e County
 Council A G B E E D to try to find this information out, a n d the Fire Service
 A G R E E D t h e y w o u l d contact their colleagues in other a r e a s w h o h a d b e e n
'involved in the Certification p r o c e s s to ascertain h o w nearly the 1.1 m e t r e
 g a n g w a y r e c o m m e n d a t i o n had b e e n o b s e r v e d In existing situations in their
■ respective areas.


 A t the request of the F ire Service, the C o u n t y Council also A G R E E D to try
 a n d find but if there w a s a n y general r e c o m m e n d a t i o n o n r e d u c e d
 a d m i s s i o n if a g r o u n d w e r e u s e d at a night tim e instead of during the day
 time.

 Whilst it w a s pr obably a typing mistake, it w a s A G B E E D that the w o r d i n g

               T h e Working' P art y a g r e e d with the Club's vi ew that, with the- existing tnreo
               exits, there w a s no w a y that the r e c o m m e n d e d discharge time of 8 minu te s
               could be met.       W h e r e they disagreed w a s that an evacuation time of 115
               m i n u t e s should be r e g a r d e d as acceptable.     If no m o r e exits w e r e to be
               provided, the Working- P a r t y A G R E E D that a c r o w d 'limitation of 11,040
               o n the Spion K o p should be Imposed.


                T h e existing exit at the North end p a s s e d u n d e r a bridge with a h e a d r o o m
               b e l o w a g r e e d b y the Club to be less than the r e c o m m e n d e d value of 3ft.
               A s this w a s in fact s o m e 6'6", the W o r k i n g Party A G R E E D that the Club
               b e i n f orm ed that in their v i e w it is essential that the floor b e l o w ere d to
                r e m o v e this dange r to spectators.


                T h e exit at the South side w o u l d also require widening, and possibly flow
                barriers w o u l d n e e d installing.


                The area at the back of the Kop would also require close attention.

                If n e w exits w e r e to b e provided b y the Club, it w a s A G R E E D that at least
                T W O w o u l d b e required.     T h e m o s t e c o n o m i c a l w a y of providing one w o u l d
                b e to u s e the gates in the existing barrier, provided these w e r e lined u p with
                the g a n g w a y s , with discharge onto the pitch surround, a n d the other v.ould
                require to be a completely n e w exit.


                T h e Building Authority felt that the majority of the crus? barriers w o u l d tail
                the tests, and consequently a n y n e c e s s a r y re-siting would probably not be
                too m u c h of a p r o b lem .   Certainly the suggested additional barriers w o u l d
               ■ require careful consideration.


                F o r the p u r p o s e s of c r o w d control, the Police suggested there should be s o m e
                f o r m of lateral separation.       T h e W o r k i n g Party A G R E E D ,   a n d it w a s suggested
                that three m e t a l fences sited centrally in the blocks (as o p p o s e d to adjacent
                to the g a n g w a y s ) should be provided, with a c ces s bet wee n each limited to a
■   ?*r
          r-    pa dlocked g a t e w a y u n d e r the control of the Police.


                As recent adverse weather conditions' had proved, ice and snow on the Kop
                could cause problems, and it was AGREED that Paragraph 11 (4) of the draft
                Certificate should be amended so as to require the Club to take steps to
                clear the Kop of ice and snow before a game was played.

                T h e Building Authority pointed out that information w a s still required f r o m
                the Club on profile a n d step d i m e n s i o n s and.the slope of the Kop.


                                                            -   3 -
(d)       T h e W e s t Terrace     (pages 4& 5)                          -


In v i e w of the lack of depth of this terrace, the Club's offerto r e d u c e the
soectator limit to 7,200, and the discharge time of 6.6 minutes, the
W o r k i n g Party A G R E E D that it w o u l d be unreasonable to insist that
g a n g w a y s o r additional exits m u s t be provided.


H o w e v e r , e v e n if the existing c r u s h barriers w e r e to p a s s the tests, the
• W o r k i n g P ar ty A G R E E D that the barriers w o u l d require special attention
in v i e w of the apparant sharp edges, corrosion, etc.

T h e W o r k i n g P a r t y A G R E E D there w e r e no real p r o b l e m s here, but the
Building Authority pointed out that a s well a s the crush barriers, the
existing corrugated sheeting w o u l d require to pa ss the appropi’iate tests.


 (f)      T h e N o r t h Stand    (pages 6 & 7)


Whilst the flow rates a n d discharge t i m e s w e r e probably satisfactory (the
construction a n d width of the r a m p s being such that they could quite properly
b e r e g a r d e d a s elevated roadways), the fact r e m a i n e d that the g a n g w a y s in
the N o r t h Stand w e r e only 6 4 0 m m w i d e for m u c h of their length, c o m p a r e d
with the r e c o m m e n d e d width of 1.1 m e t r e s .


Additionally, observations h a d s h o w n that two-thirds of the spectators u s e d
the u p p e r exit, whilst the r e m a i n d e r u s e d the lower exit.      A n ideal w o u l d b e
 to pro vid e additional exits at the top of the stand but, in v i e w of its cantilever
construction, the cost w o u l d b e prohibitive.               ■ •


A s a n alternative, the W o r k i n g P a r t y A G R E E D that consideration m i g h t be
given to r e m o v i n g a r o w of seats f r o m the top of the stand d o w n e a c h g a n g w a y

 exits to e n s u r e m o r e equal u s e of both u p p e r and lower exits b y spectators.
 If this w o u l d c a use difficulties, a barrier in the g a n g w a y s only b e l o w the u ppe r
 exits m i g h t be considered.


 So far as the W i r e M e s h barriers u n d e r the stand w e r e concerned, the

 Whilst the exits w e r e adequate a n d well s paced and the discharge t ime s
w e r e acceptable in v i e w of the type of stand, the Fire Service felt that

that another staircase be provided, and o n e or. the south-west corner w a s

to b e the m o s t acceptable.

So far a s the seating a r r a n g e m e n t s w e r e concerned, the W o r k i n g Par-/
felt that it w a s the front, ope n air part w h i c h caused the concern.               Because
of the b a d ingress/egress, the W o r k i n g P a r t y A G B E E D that two « * * > - «

.Additionally, the penning a r r a n g e m e n t s of the seating w o u l d n e e d to be

looked at closely.

A s the balustrades a n d handrails w e r e constructed of timber, the Building
Authority considered they w o u l d be likely to fail the appropriate tests.
 Also, as the staircase w a s a 24 instead of tbs m a x i m u m 12 riser                recom m en ced
 in the Guide it w a s probable that this w o u i d have to be          re c o n s , rue ted.

 Co n t r a r y to their initial reaction, the Fire Service felt that, p r o v i d e d that the
 n e c e s s a r y increased fire resistance m e a s u r e s w e r e carried out, the sJind
 w o u l d not be the p r o b l e m f r o m a c o m b u stability point of v i e w chat they aaa

 anticipated.

 T h e Building Authority e x p r ess ed c o n c e r n as to the corrosion of the steel

 T h e Police e x p r e s s e d c o n c e r n about the u s e of the car p a r k behind the

 Subsequent to that meeting, the City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council had
 indicated their desire to suggest quite substantial amendments additional to those
 suggested at the meeting.

 Copies of both the second draft and the City .of Sheffield further amendments had
 already been circulated, and copies of possible amended paragraphs were circulated
 at the meeting.

 The Working Party discussed these further suggested amendments, and agreed on
 those which should be made to the draft.

 IT WAS AGEEED - That the Administration Department make the agreed amendments
 to the second draft General Safety Certificate and circulate it to the Worldng Party
 for information prior to its submission to the Fire Service Committee on 30th November,
 1978, for approval as the standard South Yorkshire County Council Safely Certificate.

 - first time, it was recalled that the* bounty Council's powers and duties u n d er-
  the Act had been delegated to the Fire Service Committee. At a meeting on
  8th January, 1976, that Committee had decided that its functions should be
  exercised initially through officer Working Parties for each of the Borough
  Council areas, consisting of representatives of the Fire Service, the Police
  and Building Surveyors of the Borough Council, with co-ordination being under
  taken by the County Council's Administration Department. An agreed division
  of responsibility for the various aspects of the Act was contained in a Schedule
  previously circulated.

  2 .______ General Safety Certificate

  The Administration Department had already circulated a draft General Safety
  Certificate which it was intended to submit to the Fire Service Committee for
  approval as the standard South York* ire County Council General Safety
  Certificate.

  The Working Party discussed the observations put forward on the draft, and
  agreed on the amendments which should be made.

  IT WAS AGREED - That the Administration Department would prepare and
  circulate a second draft General Safety Certificate for consideration by the
  Working Party with a view to submission for approval by the Fire Service
  Committee at their November meeting.
  3.          Sheffield United Footbalt Club Ltd.

  As decided at the meeting of the Working Party on 4th April, 1978, the
  Sheffield United Football Club had been supplied with a copy of the Notes for
  Guidance of Applicants for Safety Certificates and requested to supply the
• necessary information in th3 standard form and type required by the County
  Council.

   The correspondence with the Club since (copies of which had been circulated
   to the Working Party) showed that all of the plans which the Club had supplied
   to the County Council at various stages had been returned to them. As would
   be seen from the latest letter which the County Council had sent to the Club
   (dated 8th August, 1978), an offer had been made for the Working Party to
   meet the Club to review the situation on a preliminary basis without any kind
   of commitment by the Club. No reply had yet been received from the Club.

   4.         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

    Following the designation by the Secretary of State of the Hillsborough Stadium,
    the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd had forwarded a formal application

   There was no time limit specified in the Act in which the County Council had
   to determine the application, but it was understood that the intention was that any
   necessary works should be carried out in the close season in the spring/sum m er
   next year.

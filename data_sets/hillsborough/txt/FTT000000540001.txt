                 Mrs P Finney (Secretary)



1.         Apologies for absence
Apologies were received from Cllr McDonald and Mr Steedman.
2.     Minutes of previous meeting
The minutes of the previous meeting were accepted and signed
by the Chairman as an accurate record.
3.         Matters arising

There were none.
4.     FGIT
Details of the last meeting of FGIT Trustees were given in
the minutes of the meeting of the Licensing Authority Liaison
Committee  (LALC) held on 15 May. The Second Deputy Chairman
reported that FGIT Trustees had accepted in principle the
winding up of the Trust.
5.         Finance
The First Deputy Chairman confirmed the forecast set out in a
paper circulated to all Trustees, anticipating that the
revenue until end-1992 from Spotting-the-Ball was expected to
amount to £24 million. Of this £18 million was available for
allocation, by LALC and the remaining £6 million would fall to
the Chairman's Committee.
It should be possible by the next meeting of the Trust to
report on the total assets and liabilities of the two Trusts,
(now the responsibility of The Football Trust 1990), giving
a total picture of its finances.
This did not take account of the funds coming from the
reduction of pool betting duty, which would be recommended
for allocation by LALC in accordance with government's wishes
and the requirements of Lord Justice Taylor's report.
Mr Thwaite reported that it was hoped that Vernons would sign
the agreement between the PPA and the Football League
relating to the variation in the copyright agreement at a
meeting arranged for 22 May.


6.     Minutes of the Chairman's Committee

6.1    Budget Proposals
        FA/FL/PFA National Football in the Community Plan
The Chairman reported on the background to the Committee's
recommendation to the Trust to suspend for two years the
former local authority allocation to enable the monies to be
directed to the joint scheme       agreed by the     Football
Association,  the Football League     and the    Professional
Footballers' Association, amounting to £2 million.
Mr Kelly said that the project was intended to become self-
financing at the end of two years. The Football Association
was contributing financially to the scheme, both in terms of
staff appointments   (three of whom were women)   and budget
commitments, which were expected to amount to some £250,000.

The scheme would be carefully monitored by the three bodies
and credit would be given to the Trust for its assistance.
Mr Fox and Mr Taylor had been appointed to the     Board    and
would report back to the Trust.
It was agreed to allocate £2 million in 1990-91 and a further
£2 million in 1991-92:    £1.5 million in each year from the
Chairman's Committee and the remaining £500,000 from LALC.

£1,000 to assist with the "Soccer Coaching and Skills Weeks"

School Coaching Scheme, Glasgow
A further £2,000 (indicating that there was no guarantee               of
further assistance).
                                                                  5
Sports Turf Research Institute
£6,000 to extend the original research programme by one year.
Trustees did not feel able           to   support   the   following
applications for grant aid:
Northumberland Association of Boys' Clubs
It was recommended that this organisation should be requested
to come back in a year's time, rather than set a precedent by
repeating the first grant.
Institute of Child Health/Sports Council
Trustees felt unable to support this proposal, but Mr Kelly
indicated that the Football Association would be prepared to
consider  assistance if an     application were    submitted
directly.
London Youth Games
It was       agreed that this proposal should be directed to   the
WFA for     funding from the increased budget.
6.4       Floodlighting
          Langley Park Welfare Football Club, Co Durham
          Felixstowe Town Football Club
The First Deputy Chairman advised that the Trust would    be
under pressure,   since floodlighting was eligible for grant
aid to League clubs, to agree to assist non-League clubs.

It was    agreed to defer a decision until the advice of       the
Sports Council had been received.
6.5       Middlesbrough Football   Club
It was agreed that the original grant of £80,000 should not
be reinstated. This would not preclude further submissions
being considered separately at a later date when suitable new
initiatives had been established
6.6       Storm Damage
          Southwick FC
          Dunstable FC
          Liskeard AFC
          Cheltenham Town FC
          Amersham Town FC
                                                          6
Mr Kelly had advised Trustees that these proposals for
uninsurable damage could be directed to the County FAs and
that bona fide claims would be supported by the Football
Association. There was therefore no need for Trust funding.

6.7     World Cup Arrangements
6.7.1      Trustees' expenses in Italy
It was agreed that the expenses incurred in Italy by the
First Deputy Chairman, Mr Endicott and Mr Thwaite during the
World Cup should be reimbursed.
6.7.2      Football Supporters' Association
It was agreed to offer £2,000 to assist with World Cup
arrangements in Italy, on the clear understanding that the
closest co-operation was maintained      with the    Football
Association, that all contact with the media and other
organisations should be through that body and that FSA press
releases must first be cleared by Mr Kirton of the FA.
6.7.3      Reguest from Sunday Times' Journalist
Trustees felt unable to support the request that the Trust
should consider funding his visit to Italy, in a reporting
capacity independent of his own newspaper as there could be a
conflict of interests. The First Deputy Chairman would write
and convey this to the journalist concerned.
6.8     Policing Costs incurred by the Football Association

There being insufficient time during the last meeting of LALC
to discuss these, it was agreed that the Chairman and two
Deputy Chairmen would discuss these, when advised of the
likely cost, and decide upon the level of grant aid.
6.9     Football Association and Scottish Football
        Association leaflets
Similarly,  it was left to the Chairman and two Deputy
Chairmen to discuss together the level of grant aid to both
organisations when costs were confirmed.
6.10    Grant Approval Procedures
It was agreed that recommendations for individual grant aid
against agreed allocations should be approved by the Chairman
and First Deputy Chairman (or in his absence one other
Trustee) when received from the administering bodies.     Any
cases of dissent would be       referred to the Chairman's
Committee.
                                                              7
6.11    Date of next meeting
It was confirmed that this would take place at 10.30 a.m.    on
Tuesday 17 July 1990 at Walkden House.

7.      Minutes of Licensing Authority Liaison Committee
The Second Deputy Chairman reported the death of Mr Tom
Lauchlan,  the first Scottish representative on the Trust who
had actively supported the work of the Trust ever since.
Trustees expresssed their deep regret.
The purpose of the meeting had been to set the parameters for
consideration of grant schemes which were the responsibility
of LALC and to progress with all speed arrangements for
production of the new Blue Book, which on completion would be
made available to League clubs generally.
It was agreed that the policy formerly employed by FGITwith
regard   to Irish League clubs should be continued.   This had
allowed for a a single grant of £300,000 to be made to the
IFL, for a period of two years against individual grant
recommendations which the IFL would submit in due course for
approval by the Trust, through LALC.     It was not recommended
that the whole of the grant to the IFL should be applied to
one ground only and claims from individual clubs received
independently of the IFL would not be considered.
7.2     Nominated Surveyors -Messrs George Corderoy & Co
It was agreed that     Mr Carter would have a letter      of
engagement prepared,   setting out Corderoy's daily fee  and
specifying the terms of his own consultancy separately,on an
hourly fee basis at    the current market rate. Corderoy's
daily charges would be reviewed at the end of the year.

7.3     Reporting Accountants - Messrs Rushtons
Mr Foster emphasised that his firm would not be acting as
auditors or tax consultants, but had established the basis of
a working relationship with the Trust's auditors and tax
advisers, Coopers & Lybrand.
Rushtons' detailed brief would be forwarded shortly defining
future relationships with other professional parties,  clubs
and the Trust,   in consultation with the Chairman and two
Deputy Chairmen.
After some discussion it was agreed that declarations to be
completed by clubs in respect of grant applications should be
signed by the Chairman and Secretary and should provide all
                                                                     8
information requested by the Trust when considering their
eligibility for assistance.                        <----—
It was agreed that Rushtons should continue to provide budget
forecasts of funds and commitments, liaising with the First
Deputy Chairman, Mr Carter and Miss Firth.

7 .3      Police Charges
Subject to review pending ACPO deliberations, it was agreed
that police charges grant aid should be allocated from
Spotting-the-Ball revenue as follows:
1990-91    -     £1.6   million at 35%   with a ceiling of £80,000
1991-92    -     £1.3   million at 35%   with a ceiling of £70,000
1992-93    -     £1     million at 35%   with a ceiling of £60,000
The ceiling to          be applied to First Division clubs    in     the
Football League.
One fifth of the total to be set aside for            clubs   in     the
Scottish Football League.

7.4       CCTV
It was agreed to allocate a sum of £2 million for the years
1990-91 and 1991-92 to augment existing facilities and
provide additional equipment. Police control boxes would be
eligible   within this figure if      part of    the   safety
requirement, as would camera equipment, wiring and monitors.
It was stressed that proper maintenance of equipment of
equipment was crucial to the success of the scheme as a
whole, and it would be the responsibilility of the police to
ensure that this was properly organised and paid for by the
clubs as account would be taken of this when considering
future grant aid submissions.
Following on previous discussions Mrs Finney emphasised that
payment of grant for further       CCTV equipment must    be
conditional on clubs providing evidence that contractors had
been paid before grants were released.

7.5       Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report

Computerised turnstiles
It was agreed that applications for computerised turnstiles
would be considered as a matter of priority and would come
from the funds derived from the reduction in Pool Betting
Duty and Spotting-the-Ball revenue.
Fencing                                                  9

It was agreed that dismantling, replacement and exiting to
fencing   on the specific     instruction of the licensing
authority and with the agreement of the Football Association,
would be eligible for grant aid.   It was accepted that there
could be anomalies in future if the Football Licensing
Authority's instructions were in conflict with those of local
authorities or the police. Grants for these purposes
would come from Spotting-the-Ball Revenue.
7.6       Major Projects/new Stadia
It was agreed that major improvement developments and clubs'
relocation to new grounds would qualify for grant aid,
providing the Trust acted as a catalyst contributor and
financier of last resort. Clubs' resources and contributions
from sale of former grounds would be taken into account and
subjected to detailed scrutiny by the Trust's reporting
accountants.
It was important that average attendance be one of the major
considerations in assessing eligibility.    Each application
would be considered individually on its merits and funding
would come from the reduction in pool betting duty.
Whilst it was considered vital that clubs were informed at
the earliest possible moment of the Trust's policy with
regard to grants to all League grounds, it was agreed that no
public statements would be issued by LALC and that these
would emanate from Trust decisions as the responsibility of
the First Deputy Chairman.
7.7       FGIT
The winding up of FGIT would take place at a date to be set
by Trustees now serving on LALC to ensure a smooth handover
to the new Committee. Funds remaining unallocated after the
handover would be incorporated into Mr Foster's budget
forecast for LALC.    (This was currently estimated to be in
region of £750,000 to £1 million, which continued to be drawn
on) .
7.8       Funding
The variation agreement between the Football League and the
Pools Promoters had yet to be signed by all parties before
funds from the reduction of pool betting duty could be
released to the Football Trust 1990.
Additional funding from the Football Association and the
Football League was still the subject of discussion, with
particular regard to the tax implications. It was agreed
that future benefactors' wishes as to the disposition of
                                                          10
their   contributions would be honoured.

7.9      Seating
This was a major recommendation of the Taylor Report and
Trustees were greatly handicapped by the fact that the
Football Licensing Authority had not yet been established.
They took the view, however, that if progress were to be made
during the close season they       ought to give financial
assistance to sensible schemes.
It was agreed that the first stage of grant aid for seating
under cover should be offered at 75% up to a maximum of £70
per seat.    The sum of £70 per seat would cover all related
works for the installation of seating and would take account
of average seated attendances. This would permit urgent work
to proceed in the coming close season.
The    ceiling   imposed would   not preclude Trustees from
considering, exceptionally,    individual applications beyond
this   ceiling when more detailed discussions had taken place
on the subject generally and the individual needs and
resources of applicant clubs were made known to the Trust.
Seating was seen to be a five year priority and clubs would
be expected to consider and present their ideas for ground
development and seating requirements within that period.
First Division Clubs were required by Lord Justice Taylor's
report to be all-seated by 1995 and the lower divisions by
the year 2000. Grant aid would not be made available for
"anticipated attendance".
It was agreed that clubs with substantial resources would not
necessarily be paid first and that payment would be spread
over a period of three to four years.
Until the release of the pool betting duty, funds for this
scheme would come from Spotting-the Ball revenue initially,
plus   the uncommitted balance from the FGIT allocation(£2
million) for seating.
Trustees would exercise discretion in the application of
funds released by reduction of pool betting duty.  It was
accepted that as a result some clubs would receive greater
levels of grant aid than others.
It was agreed that seating applications received     to   date
could    be  accepted as follows:
Everton                  3,000 seats £200,000
Heart of Midlothian        900       £ 12,000
Hibernian                5,172       £254,113
Port Vale                4,871       £280,000
Portsmouth               9,000       £180,000
Plymouth                 3,860       £164,000
                                                               11
Dunfermline                1,665             £ 24,000
Derby County               3,284             £118,748
Crystal Palace             4,968             £560,000
Blackburn Rovers           4,200             £380,000
Middlesbrough              3,082             £ 51,043
Aberdeen                   3,800             £ 77,000
Motherwell                 1,100             £ 16,060

applications from:

Rochdale
Leeds
St Mirren
Rangers
Aston Villa
Southampton
West Ham
Hull City
Ipswich Town
Dundee United
Swindon Town
7.10   Trustees, Area representatives and Secretaries'
        insurance
It was agreed that Mrs Finney would proceed with           further
necessary arrangements for insurance cover for:
1.     Personal accident and loss of baggage whilst
        on travelling on Trust business.
2.     Trustees' and Area Representatives' Indemnity
        with an Indemnity limit of £1 million for
        any one claim and aggregate in the year.

7.11   Administration costs
It was agreed that the League's Management Committee be asked
to suggest an appropriate fee for secretarial services and
support in connection with the       work of the Licensing
Authority Liaison Committee. This would be considered by the
Trust in due course.
7.12 Date of next meeting
The next meeting of LALC would take place at 11 a.m. on
Monday 16 July at Walkden House.
The Chairman, on behalf of Trustees passed a vote of thanks
to the Deputy Chairmen and Secretaries for the speed with
which both Committees' minutes had been produced in the short
space of time available.

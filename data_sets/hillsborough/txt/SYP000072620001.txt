              We     t r a ve ll ed down     in a car driven by my father and we got to

              S h e f f i e l d about      1 O ’clock         (1300 hrs)        having       e n c o u n t e r e d delays    at the

              M61 and M62 j u n c t i o n for                10 minutes.         We       parked a w a y from the ground

              an d w a l k ed down to the ground                     but    r e c eived     no escort       to the      ground.

              We     found the entrance             to the turn s t i l e s           fa i r l y   crowded by a number               of
                                                                                                              PAG E            2

people m il l i n g about, but had no t r o u b l e                  in getting          to our entrance

point    because we had been tf^re                      previously.

I e n te re d thro u g h a t ur ns y i l e and han d e d my ticket                       in.

Once    inside       the ground,          y    couldn't      see any signs where                to go but

h e ad ed for the tunnel             I knew       led to the         pens and stands.                Fro m where           I

was    I could see the             pitch and movem e n t            towards       the tunnel          was   fairly

free moving.           In the tunnel             I had to move            in between and             in and out of

people    to make my way down the/tunnel                           towards    the    stands          but saw no

police    or stewards          there.

I e ve nt u a l l y got      to the       otfcrt’er end of the        tunnel       an d m oved        into the

right    hand pen,          pen numbe^r three.               At    this    time,    about       twenty five           past
                                          /
two    <1425 hrs)       the    pen Was          full    towards      the    top but there were                spaces

towards       the    bottom,        I /could see           some young       people,       boys and girls at

the    fence near the          bottom          of the      pen and a few old people as well.                           I

went    to the       front    of the m a i n       crowd      in the       pen,    and    it was       fairly

quiet    to start       off w ith &ut whe n the                   players    came out          for    the war m up

the    crowd behind me             s ta r t e d singing and jumping about.                       As we were

sing i n g and as       I was at          the    front      of the    crowd       I kept       getting      pushed

f or w a r d down to a barrier about                    10 foot      in front       of me.           This was       the

last    barrier       before       the    fence.

B y a bout a quarter           to or ten to three                  (1445 h r s ) or       C1450 hrs)          the     pen

was    full    and    crowded.           1 c o u l d n ’t move my arms            or upper       body and was

subjected       to some       crowd surge as               I m o v e d to the      left and          right with

the    crowd.

After    a while       the    crushing          became      too much and          people       in front       of me
                                                       /

b egan shouting and            scr e a m i n g    f ofr the       crowd to move          back.       We tried to

push    back but       it was       impossible.

Later    still,       the    crush was          so m uch that        I was    in pain and             I too

s t a r t e d shouting       for    the       crqwd to move         back    but we       couldn't move

anywhere .          I remember       the      police       down on the       fence were          starting       to

move    up and down the fence                    front and           indicating        for    us to move         back

but o b v i o u l s y we      c o u l d n ’t.      I saw about             five    or six     people       climbing

the    fence     by this          stage       but the        police     climbed the          other    side

and    pushed them back                 in the     pen,       maybe     t h i nking    them to be          invading

the    p i t c h .The      crushing       con t i n u e d and        I remember a man about 20 yrs                      of

age an d w i t h black             hair       to my    right hand side,               slipping       down to the

ground.         He had       blac k e d out and as                 he s l i p p e d to the ground           I later

became aware            of him a ro u n d my feet                  because    due to the surge              I was

f orced      to tread        on him.          B e h i nd me to my           right     I saw a man about 55 or

6 0 yrs      of age and w ea r i n g a jacket                      of some    sort,        he was    bent    over      the

barrier       behind me wit h             the    bar    stuck        into his       lower     chest.

His    face was         blue and he was               u nconscious          and    I ’d say dead.           I c o u l d n ’t

do a n y t h i ng     to help him because my arms were                             pinned to my           chest.       Then

the    crowd surged f or w a r d a g a i n and                     I was m o v e d toward the             barrier

w h i c h was    in front          of me.        I was sort           of sideways           on to    it and      I came

to    rest    on my        left    hand side against                 the    bar.      As    I was    folded      over

the    bar    I star t e d        panicking and thought                    I was    going     to die       there and

then.        I saw a man           in front        of me and wit h me w r a p p e d over                   the   bar    in

pain,     I tapped him an d               he m an a g e d to turn ar o u n d and grab me                     by the

trousers        and     I sort of         sc r a m b l e d    under     the bar and up the                other side.

P e o p l e were som e w h e r e         beh ind me by now and still                       pushing me forward

t owards      the fence at              the    front,        the next       thing     I knew,       the    bar must

have    g iven way          behind me          because        people were          pushing and falling

beh i n d me.         As    I went        forw a r d I fell           onto a body down behind

the wall        under      the     fence.        It     was still       and m o t i o n l e s s   and I

presume       he was        dead at       the time.

I ’d landed on my back                    w i th my arm and           leg upwards,          my foot towards the

fence.       Pe o p l e    ar o u n d     me were all s t r u g g l i n g         to get up and treading                  on

me    in the     process.           I was       panic        s t r i c k e n an d for the second time

t hought      I ’d die       if I d i d n ’t get             up.     I became aware           of my       leg being

              l ifted      up     t hr o u g h the fence       by      a p o l iceman an d as          I was    pulled up by

              m y ar m by         a scouser        Ihad to       push off w i t h           my other       hand on the body

              of    the    bloke who was           dead.         The    crowd was          starting       to crush a g a i n

              a ft e r     the short       break and        I had to get up quick                    to survive.

              I must       have      been there        for about           twenty minu t e s amon g s t         the    screaming

              a n d s h o u ti ng and m a yh em until                the    pressure        e v e n t u a l l y eased off.

              Pe o p l e   had     climbed the         fence a bove me by walk i n g                 over us      people      near

              to    it,     in an effort          to get       out.        E v e n t u a l l y the   crush s u b sided and as

              the     pen cleared          I could see           numerous        people ar o u n d the         pen either          dead

              or    injured,         lying     or sitting         on the        pen floor.           I looked to my          left

              a nd saw two young men w ith an older man who was                                      lying    under    the    f e nce.

              He was a big man and                  lying      on his back or side,                  I c a n ’t be sure.

              The     lads were         h ysterical       so     I rushed        round the fence to where                 they

              w ere      and shou t e d at them to do something.                            I grab b e d h i m a r o u n d    his

              tunnel        to the other          end.      We      put him down by the wall and                    I saw a

              policeman           standing       ne a r b y so      I grab b e d him by the shoulder and he

              t u r n ed    round,      saw the body and               he got down and star t e d m o u t h to mouth

              moved        out of the way.             I later         saw them s t ripping            him off down to his

              boxer        shorts and trying             heart mass a g e           but    I think     he was a l r e a d y

              dead.         I went      back    into     the     tunnel       and    found a hysterical             man   in there

              w i t h a friend.            I he l p e d them out onto                the a rea out of the tunnel                 and

              t hen went         to the a l l e y w a y w hi c h        leads       to the S o u t h stand.           It was       here

              times.

              I went        back     into the gr o u n d but was               stop p e d from going           onto the       pitch

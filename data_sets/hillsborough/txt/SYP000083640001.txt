                    Shal esmotyre and Hoyle Street



                    At 2.45 pm I was transported to the driving school at ESright side Lane

On      arrival       at    the       ground             our    transit             van     parked         o u t s i d e the P o l i c e

An      Inspector          on    the       Ditch          told       us     to      form     a cordon         on     t h&--edqe---------

I    could      see    that          the    North          Stand          contained           Liverpool              supporters           who

were      shouting          abuse          at    us       and    1 saw           coins       being      thrown           as    missiles         at

u.s *



1    could      see    that          most       of       the    crowd          at    this     location          were          pointing

towards         the    Leppings             L a ne        end    of       the       ground.




I    looked      across          and       saw       numerous             L 1 v e r p o o 1 s u p ju s - r t e r s    o n the        p it ch

Numerous         of    these          fans       were          running           across       the     pitch          towards         us   and

the     Nottingham              Forest          fans       at    the       Kop       end.




I assisted            other          officers             in    preventing              them      doing        so     and      was    met      wit

Forest        fans.         The       forest             fans    at       this       time     were      chanting              and    jeering

We    managed         to    force          the       Liverpool              fans/back           towards         the       Le p pi .n gs     Lane

end     and     then       I formed             oart       of    a    cor/fon
                                                                         s    across                 the     half        way    l i ne . .

                                                                                                               S2790

At this        point    I could see several                  bodies      lying ar o u n d the       pitch and

both Liverpool            fans and Police                officers were att e n d i n g           to them and          i

some    cases     trying       to    revive         them.



I was        instructed      by an         Inspector        to    remain as      part     of the    cordon

across       the half way           line w hich          I did for a while.



I then saw supporters                  on the        pitch       carrying    i>ufnerous people           from    the

                                                                             d been taken from the

perimeter        track                                                                them to do

                                           so        etcher      bearing



At   first      I was    of the       opin i o n        that a pitch         invasion had taken            place

farts causing          t roubie.           11 was at        this    point    however       that    I real ised

that a major           incident       had h a p p e n e d at        the L e p p i n g s   Lane    end.



I cont i nued to ass ijfl both the                      f ans and the Po 1 i c a 0 f f i ce rs wi th rne

remove       i n jured/pimple from the                   pitch and      I could see         that    both fans
----------            ( f ------
and other Police             officers were              upset and d i s t r e s s e d      by what was          taki

p 1a c e .



After a w h i 1 e I f e 11 back                  into    the $*dr don across          the half way         line.

remained there           until       the        g round >i!5egan to clear at a r o u n d 4 .1 5            pm.



Throughout        the    time       1 was        on the     pitch,     the   t h i n gir't'fat stands      out    in

my   recollection          is that almost               all. the Liverj>do 1 fans            I came       in

contact wit h on the                pitch sm e l i e d of a 1 c/fho 1 an d some were                 in fact

very drunk.            I tried       to     reason w i t h s'everal          of them to move             off    the

pitch so that           em e r g e n c y    services        could a t t e n d    to the     injured       but    to

CHIEF INSPECTOR MCROBBIE                                                                          R125




I transferred to 'F' Division on Monday 3 April 1989, as the Chief Inspector

(Admin).

The Operational Order for the F.A. Cup semi-final was drafted and I was not

included on the order.

As a new member of the Division I made a request to the Chief Superintendent

to be able to attend the event in order to observe the Police operation.

As   a preliminary         to    the    event   I received      an overview of the        planning    and

rationale from Inspector Sewell at 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday 12 April 1989-

I did not attend the Commander's brief on Friday 14 April 1 9 8 9 .

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I attended Sheffield Wednesday football ground at

9.^5 a.m.       I was off duty attending in my own time, in civilian clothing in

order to watch, listen and learn.

I took up a place at the rear of the No^th Stand, behind CID Officers, but

in front of the Special Constables.

It   appeared      to me    that attention to detail was evident                  in the way serials

were ordered, officers wore headgear and professionalism prevailed.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield imparted a factual briefing identifying the

various Section Senior Commanders by name and in person.                           He impressed that

officers     must    act    in    a professional        manner       which would reflect     credit    on

South Yorkshire Police.

This brief was clear, concise and audible at the rear by use of a microphone

and amplifier.

This part was followed by Superintendent Murray.

I    was   again    impressed          with   the   standard    of    briefing,   again   attention    to

detail such as the evacuation procedures                       and officers being aware of their

indvidual requirement in the event of such eventuality.

I    particularly      recall          him    saying,   "We    have    fully   tried   the   evacuation

procedures twice this season, the first time was eood. the second time was
                                                            -   2-




excellence;        if    we    are   required          to       impliment evacuation                today,   it must    be

excellent."

This    briefing         was     followed         by   an       up        to   date     intelligence         report    from

Detective Sergeant Charlesworth.

Finally,     Inspector Sewell gave general                            information about radios,                issue and

mealing arrangements.

It   was    stressed         that    all    officers        must          be   on     their    respective      points     by

11.15 a.m.

After the briefing it was evident that little of value would be gained until

later      into    the       operation      so    I    left      the       stadium      to     return   to    my   private

vehicle.         I was approached on three separate occasions in Penistone Road and

asked if I had any tickets                  to sell.

There were a lot of people                  around first sitting on walls in groups.

I went      to    my    vehicle      and    drove      to       Hammerton           Road      Police Station where        I

carried out some outstanding clerical work.

I began to walk back to the stadium, leaving my car at Hammerton Road Police

Station,      when       a    police       car    offered            me    a   lift     to    the    ground.       This       I

accepted.

I    saw ___________________ and                 another        officer        outside        Threshers      near Holme

Lane and was pleased to see officers doing what was expected of them.

I asked to be dropped a little away from the stadium as I wanted to observe

officers on their respective areas and see how they were performing.

I was really anonymous to them or many of them as I was new to the Division

and not in uniform.

All Police Officers were acting properly,                                  but I was a little surprised that

at 1.00 p.m. there were so few cars and pedestrians in the area.

By Hillsborough Park I saw a group                              of people           sitting     around,      there was        a

white plastic carrier bag with them and                                   the outline of cans could be seen.
The visible cans were of Heineken lager in the green can.

There   were      six men      and    they were              joking    about      having        to drink the lot      as

they would not be allowed to take them into the ground.

Approx 1.15 p.m.

By   Leppings      Lane    gates      were        few    supporters,         road     clear,      plenty of Police

officers evident.

I    went   to    the     barrier         at    Leppings           Lane/Vere      Road    where     I    spoke   to   'A'

Division officers, Police Constables Parkin and Drury.                                         A few people passing

and we spoke about running and 'A' Divisional work.

I    then   walked      past     Leppings             Lane    gates    and     came      to    barriers    and   Police

Officers - Police Sergeant Norburn and others I do not know.                                             There were no

other people        near    this      area.            I knew from my preliminary discussions with

Inspector        Sewell    the    necessity            to provide        a sterile            area to keep opposing

fans separate.

I    continued     along    the      road being              the    South Stand past            the T.V.    unit vans

where I was met with another barrier of metal barriers and Police Officers.

I produced my warrant                card,        but    I was       known to      one officer who I did not

know.

I went down and along Penistone Road which was b u s y .

I walked towards Parkside Road and I was against the flow of people, it was

very busy.

I    stopped      and     spoke      to    Police        Constable       Vallance         from     'A'    Division    and

                                               from    'A'    Division       at   separate        points   but due     to

enquiries        and sheer numbers                of persons          it was prudent            to move on,      as they

 needed all their attention to deal with the volume of people.

 I returned to rear of South Stand.

 About 11.45 p.m, the Liverpool team coach arrived.

 There was a motorcycle lead and Police horses controlling a large crowd
                                                    -   4-




awaiting the trains arrival.

I noticed the horse near me was displaying a Merseyside Police badge on the

saddle.

There were no incidents.

Sergeant Sorsby of South Yorkshire Police Mounted said to the other officers

- "Exactly the same for the Notts Forest Coach".

About 1.55 P-m. the           Nottingham Forest team coach arrived.                     The procedure     was

as for Liverpool, no problems, crowd good humoured.

I     left this     area and returned        to Penistone            Road    as     I intended to use     the

entrance to the ground by the Police Room.

Penistone Road was quite busy but there was no queuing at the turnstiles as

I     would have expected.         At that time about one hour                  to kick off.

I     knew there     was a Liverpool train due at Wadsley Bridge                         around 2.05 p.m.

but decided to go into the ground.

I went to the main            sliding gate and produced my warrant card and a special

card    issued      to me     by Superintendent                    Murray.      Both were         fully   checked and

examined by the stewards which I thought was excellent.

I was assured no unauthorised person would                           gain entry at that g a t e .

I went     down     onto    the    perimeter       track and was           immediately surprised by how

full the Spion Kop was.             I turned and saw the North Stand was not very full.

I made my way to the Police Control box.

Inspector      Sewell        had   alerted    me    to the          fact     that    inside   there was   only

limited space.             I intended to visit,              see   it operated and leave if I was in

the w a y .

 I wanted      to   see     the    Control     point         as    I was   at   Doncaster Rovers when the

 camera equipment           was    first   installed and operated                   at the beginning of the

 present      season.        The   engineer   was       always       quoting      the   Sheffield Wednesday

    system as being excellent and holding thesystem as the way all grounds
should o p er ate .

On entering the Police box there was Sergeant Goddard, Police Constable Ryan

at     the    front     and      Police     Constable        Bichard     at    the    rear    by   the     camera

operating controls.

I was        informed    by      Police    Sergeant    Goddard        that    Superintendent        Murray      had

gone    to     speak    to    the   referee    so I sat        on his        seat   and was   offered a hot

drink.        It didn't appear particularly busy and quite clearly everything was

under control.

Assistant       Chief        Constable      (Operations)        Mr.    Jackson       came    to    the    control

point, he was in civilian clothing.

I    saw     through     the      control     room    window     Superintendent         Murray       and    Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield,                 in uniform, walking along the track.                      They came

through the uncovered seats in the South Stand and entered the cor"..â€™ol room.

I went to the far end of the room and stood by the camera control area.

I was prepared to leave, but did not appear to be hindering anyone and felt

I would gain onset benefit from staying and observing from this point.

On looking into the ground the Liverpool areas had a lot of space, the Notts

Forest       parts     I could      see    on the    South Stand        and the      Spion    Kop were quite

full.

I recall        Chief       Superintendent      Duckenfield       commenting         about    there      being no

entertainment being provided to encourage the supporters to come early.

I    remember        when    I   was   a   child     there    always    being       a band playing         by    the

players tunnel at every game at Hillsborough.

Whilst I didn't see it, Assistant Chief Constable Operations commented that

a person just below the Police control had just dropped his trousers.                                           When

I looked the person was jiggling around.                         I remember thinking how empty the

area around           this youth was.          Police        Constable       Bichard operated the camera

 and I watched him be able to zoom onto him which I thought was a super
facility for spotting troublemakers in the crowd.

I was    aware      the   area    in Leppings              Lane    behind     the goal was          filling up but

this was to be expected.

I was    then aware        that both teams came onto the pitch for a pre-match warm

up.     As there was nothing special happening on the screen or in the ground I

looked onto the playing area.

I was aware that Alan Hanson of Liverpool was on the ptich and was surprised

as I didn't think he would be playing.                            The Liverpool fans were shouting his

name and he acknowledged them by raising his hand.                                   All was good humoured.

The    area behind        the    goal    at Leppings              Lane was      getting      full   but      there was

space at the front.               People seemed reluctant to move forward, probably all

wanting to maintain their best view of the playing area.

Approx 2.30 p.m.

I     looked   on   the    left    monitor           and    was    aware      there    seemed       a    build     up     of

supporters.

I remember asking Superintendent Murray about this, he explained that due to

necessary      segregation         of    fans,       access       to   the    North    Stand,       which had been

allocated      to    Liverpool          supporters, could                only   be    done    by        Leppings        Lane

entrances, this           meant    that        the    entrances          on   Penistone      Road       to   the    stand

which would normally be used were unavailable.

This explained at that time in my mind the crowds on the screen.

I recall a suggestion that the loud hailer/tannoy should be used to request

fans to move forward to create room at the rear to prevent crowding.

People began advising control that radio reception was poor.

An     engineer      came       into     the     room        to    try    and     improve      transmission              and

reception.

I remember          him   in     blue    under        the    control       room   bench, I          thought        it    was

 crowded as Police Sergeant Godd^ard was walking round/over him.
I thought of leaving but was unable to get past and was better staying where

I was.

I was aware Superintendent Marshall requested the                        closure of Leppings Lane

to traffic.

I looked to the screen and whilst there seemed a lot of people this was to

be expected and this had been the situation for quite a time.                               It was not

extraordinary.        I recall seeing a cream double decker bus travelling slowly

through the crowd which indicated the road was not blocked and free movement

was possible.

The situation remained like this, poor reception,                        the ground slowly filling

up and everything progressing as one would expect for such an occasion.                                 The

crowd seemed good humoured in the ground.

Approx 2.45 p.m.

The crowd outside appears denser on the camera but I can see a Police horse

on    the   screen.       Having      seen them at close hand control the crowd when the

team coaches arrived, I sensed they were well in control.

Officers were deployed to assist, including a land rover with P.A. equipment

to assist officers outside.

Around      this   time       a radio    message    was   relayed    requesting    the     gates   to    be

opened as persons were trapped up against the gates.

I remember thinking,                you can't open the gates or you lose control over who

is admitted, you are unable to search or check persons admitted for weapons

and    may   create       a    difficult   public       order   situation     for Police    inside      the

 ground.

The     gates      were       not    authorised    to     be    opened   by    Chief   Sueprintendent

 Duckenfield at this time.

 I am aware that the teams are no longer on the pitch so the start could not

 be far off and there was still a lot of space on the terrace under the
Police Control.

It   occurred      that   some    Liverpool    supporters    were    leving    it late but people

often enter after the start of many games.

About      this time I can see people climbing over the wall and point this out

to   the    controllers.         I then saw the gates displayed on the camera which I

believe      are   the    concertina   gates    on   the   service    road    to     the   rear   of the

South Stand open and a surge of people rush into the ground.                               I said,   "The

gates have been forced".

It was difficult to estimate how many entered the ground but the gates were

quickly closed again.             It seemed control was regained with help of a mounted

officer who put his horse across the gap in the g a t e .

People however are still being able to climb over the wall into the ground.

Superintendent       Marshall      again    requests   the   gates   to be opened.            This   is a

general request.

It is getting close to kick off time.

I can see by the players tunnel a semi                 circle of photographers awaiting the

arrival of the two teams.

It   seems    the Superintendent           will have to try and prevent the start of the

game as the        fans will      not all get in but I thought thereis no way anyone

can get to the referee            or team managers to do this at this late stage.                    As I

was thinking this the crowd errupted as a team ran on.                         I've no idea which

team as the sound inside the ground transmitted itself outside and from what

I saw on the monitor control was difficult outside now.

At   this    point    Superintendent        Marshall   requested the         gates    to be   opened as

there was going to be serious injury or someone killed outside in                             the crush

 if they were not opened.

There was still room on the terrace under the control.                         The South Stand was

 much fuller but not full.
Superintendent Murray was standing with a personal radio in his hand asking

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield for a decision.

It was   evident    there existed a tremendous problem for officers outside the

Leppings Lane entrance.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was deeply considering the situation.

I recall    him thinking aloud words to the effect               - If there's likely to be

serious injury or death outside I have no option than to open the gates - He

told Superintendent Murray, "Open the Gates".

Superintendent      Murray   gave   the   general    instruction   over   the   radio   to open

the gates.

On the monitor I saw the concertina gates open and fans come flooding in.

The game had started when I looked back onto the playing area.                   The play was

at the Penistone Road end.

I became aware of a perimeter track gate being opened and people being let

onto the track out of the pen behind the goal and ushered and pointed in the

direction of the part where           there was still plenty of space.

The movement seemed orderly           but the numbers were building up.

Fans were going onto the track starting to move in the direction as directed

but then stopping and standing watching              the game.

A Policewoman was in control of the gate into the area where there was space

but did not open i t .

 I thought she probably d i d n â€™t have a radio or handn't sensed that                  she   must

 open it to let fans into the open areas behind her.

 I began to sense youths would run onto the playing area so ran out of the

 control point, through the           uncovered seats onto the perimeter track and got

 the gate by the Policewoman open and began directing fans to thearea.                    More

 and more    were   coming onto the track,          I was ushering them to the open gate

 and the Policewoman assisted.
I went behind advertising hoardings to prevent persons encroaching onto the

playing area.

I    could       see   people     pushed   up    against       the   fence   but   not   aware   of   any

particular problems or injuries                  as there      is a steady stream of people onto

the perimeter track.

More    and more people on the track and beginning to move onto the grass by

the goal line.

I see Superintendent Greenwood on top of the fence, having climbed up and he

is gesturing by waving his arms and asking for the game to be stopped.

It seems by his frantic waves Control are not understanding his request.

I run      to     control   but    by   the uncovered       seats      I meet   Superintendent   Murray

with his hat on running the opposite way.                        We run together to a linesman to

get his attention to stop the game.

The linesman ran straight past Superintendent Murray.

I chase the linesman shouting him to get the referee's attention to stop the

game.

I then see Superintendent Greenwood running towards the referee.

There are lots of fans in the Liverpool goalmouth in front of Leppings Lane

Te r r a c e .

I think it is a public order situation.

As     they      are   Liverpool    supporters,     I run onto the playing area and protect

Nigel Clough in case any Liverpool supporters try to attack him.

When I am satisfied there is no danger to players I look and see hundreds of

    people spilling onto the playing area.                  There is quite clearly in my mind a

major      public       order   situation       which   will    need    a large uniform presence       to


    control.

    I am in the centre of the playing area, in plain clothes.

    There is nothing I can usefully do in a public c&er context so J* decide to

    return to the Police Control point.

    En    route    I    am       passed    by    uniformed         reinforcements          as    I   pass    through     the

    uncovered seating.

    On    re-entering            control    room    I     learn      that      persons     are   suspected      of     being

    injured.

    An    ambulance         is    called    for     and       quickly      arrives    behind         the   Leppings     Lane

    goal.

    A    message       isrelayed      to Police          control         that many people            are    injured.     As

    they are not local people, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield decides to call

    out Casualty Bureau staff.

    I am directed                by Assistant Chief Constable, Mr.                    Jackson, to call for Chief

    Superintendent Addis and request he comes to Hillsborough.

    I make the request by telephor^ to Force Operations Room as instructed.

    I've     no accurate           assessment       of    time,          but   this call    should be recorded           on

    tape     in Force        Control.           Coins    or    other       items   are     being     thrown    at Police

    Control       in large         numbers.        In view of             the situation unfolding,              Operation

    Support' is authorised.

    All available personnel are deployed in area.

    I     suggest       I        go   to   Hammerton          Road       Police Station         and receive     Operation

    Support personnel and deploy them from                               there as directed by Ground Control.

    I go     to Hammerton Road Police Station.

        I leave the ground by Leppings Lane and am able to stop Chief Inspector Shaw

        in a marked Police car.                 He conveys me to Hammerton Road Police Station.

        I change into uniform and act at this location as Incident Commander.

        Officers are deployed as requested from Ground Control to specific areas in

        makeshift serials.

        I remain to organise Social Services who have arrived and set up an incident

        enquiry room.

Relatives and calls are all being dealt with from Hammerton Road.

At   this   stage   there   is   little   further      which   is   of   benefit   regarding    the

series of events under review.

Subsequent    actions   by myself     involve      reception    and sympathetic       welfare    of

distressed relatives.

Liaison with Social Services and other support agencies.

Setting up of HOLMES incident room.

All non contentious but essential facilities to assist officers at scene.

I did not directly handle any injured or dead bodies.

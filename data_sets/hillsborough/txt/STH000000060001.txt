              17th April 1989




              Dear Doctor

              Your patient was involved in the Major Incident at Hillsborough
              Football Ground on Saturday 15th April. They may require psychological
              support and you may wish to assess these needs yourself.

              If there are any physical or psychological problems which you
              encounter which were not appreciated by us at the time of the
              incident, I would be very grateful if you could let us know.



               Yours sincerely

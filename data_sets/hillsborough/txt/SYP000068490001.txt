B eca u s e   of the      pressure          of the     crowd,      people          began jamming              in the

was     tor any / o n g e r           this would          become      impossible            so     1 f o r c e d my way

As     I got       to the       gates a w o m a n grabbed               hold      of ngf a r m ,         she     had    injured

the     crowd so          I left       her     in a triangular              clearing made                by the        opened

Ail     the time          people were          pushing          past me , adding              to the         crowd,,         1

wanted        to tell          them that       they should            hold       back     for a while             and

although           some d i d ,       the m a j o r i t y    didn't,,        I then         looked along L e p p i n g s

      a lot of the              other       casualties             who     had b&jrfi carried            here were          bsinc,

      l e f t , presumably              because         they w e r e        drffad.

      1 then made my back                    towards             t h ^ / Ceppings       Lane      end.   I assisted           in

      several        groups          of Liv e r p o o l          fans     on the      pitch who were asking                   if the

      game was        to be abandoned.                       They also a s k e d me how they                    could obtain

      r e f unds     on the i r t i cke t s .                I    c o u 1d n "t thi nk of a r e p 1y „

      towards        the    lep to          try and              find my serial             sergeant. I saw            a pile         of

      property        near       to the          centre          gate     of the      pen.        1 saw a y o u t h picking

      coins    up from the                 ground,.         I did not        sea      him    putting       the m o n e y with

      the    other        property.              I cannot          say     if he was         looting as         I did       not

      challenge           him.

      Our    serial        then m oved            out       of the        ground where we were                 s t a t i o n e d at

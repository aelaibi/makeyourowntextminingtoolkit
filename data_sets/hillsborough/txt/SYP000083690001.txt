               I was on duty at the         1988 Semi F i nal          tween Liverpool and Not ting ha

               Forest.     Before the kick off I wj^s conducting searches of supporters

               and examining tickets at the lye p p i n g s Lane end of the ground before

               entry to the ground.          Durivf’g this period I made the f 1 rst arrest to

               After documentation ^rfid doing a report                 I then had my meal     in the

               gymnasium and then went to the               rear of the Lappings Lane s t a n d .       I c

               recall    that the tunnels were filled for some ten feet pr so back                      fro

               the terrace with spectators and four or five I1o 1 i car Off icers at the

               rear of the spectators.            I then went o u t s i t         tLeppings    Lane end o

               the ground and awaited the end               of the matcinT" I can also recall bein

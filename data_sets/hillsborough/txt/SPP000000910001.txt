Dear Dr Popper,

Thank you for your letter of 17th January 1991.

With regard to points 1-6 in your letter 1 would comment as follows:-

1.   1 am obiiged to you for your understanding in relation to Mr Hughes.

2.   Ihank you for calling Mr Langley.        -

3.   Noted,                                                               '

4.   Ihe possibility of hearing from Amber 1ine witnesses was initially
suggested to me by Mr Glover Snr.. it has proved difficult to obtain names
of individual drivers from the Company due to their confidentiality policy.
1 believe that a number of drivers may have given statements to West
Midlands Italics but at this stage of the Inquest 1 do not suggest that this
matter be taken.any further.                '

5.   1 await your decision in relation to Mr Lloyd.

6. Inote that you do not intend calling P.O.        land am obliged too
for*ucaJ.ling Mr Robertson in order to clarify the summary into Jonathon's
death.

With fpgard to the outstanding queries of individual family members, 1 look
forward >to ^hearing from you once the further review has been conducted by
your Officprw      Â«t possible, it would be appreciated if we could begiven
stae notice 'as":to' Mien queries are to be addressed.

Ihank you once'again for your assistance.

Yours sincerely.,

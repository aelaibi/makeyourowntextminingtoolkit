...THERE WAS A BARELY AUDIABLE ANNOUNCEMENT WHICH REQUEST FANS ON THE
TERRECES TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE TUNNEL, TO MAKE WAY FOR INCOMING CROWDS. THIS
REQUEST WAS IMPOSSIBLE AS THERE WAS NO WHERE TO MOVE TO BECAUSE OF THE
DIVIDING FENCE. AT THIS STAGE I HAD TO WEDGE MYSELF RIGHT UP AT THE REAR OF
THE TERRECE. AT ABOUT KICK OFF A FEW FANS SCALED THE FENCES, AND THEN IT
PICKED AND MORE AND MORE FANS WERE CLIMBING OVER. SO IT WAS APPARANT THAT
SOMETHING WAS WRONG. SOME OF THE FANS PLEDED WITH THE PLAYERS TO HELP. BUT NO
0 1 * K N E W WHAT WAS HAPPENING. FANS WERE ESCAPING ANY WAY THEY COULD.AFTER A
WHILE MORE POLICE ARRIVED AND LINED UP INFRONT OF THE GOAL, BUT DID NOTHING.
ONE OR TWO OFFICERS STARTED TO HELP WITH THE FANS TO GET OUT OF THE PEN. FANS
WERE TAKING DOWN THE BOARDS TO HELP THE INJURED, BUT THE POLICE WERE TRYING
TO STOP THEM, BUT THEN THEY REALISED WHAT THEY WANTED THEM FOR. AN AMBULANCE
ARRIVED NEEAR TO THE GOAL, FANS TRIED TO TAKE THE NETTING DOWN, BUT AGAIN THE
POLICE TRIED TO STOP THEM. THEN ON IT WAS UTTER CHOAS. THE N/F FANS BECAME
ABUSIVE BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING. I SAW LIVERPOOL FANS TEAR DOWN A
FENCE DIRECTLY BEHIND THE GOAL, SO THAT FANS COULD ESCAPE. WHY DIDN'T THE
POLICE, AND THE FIRE BRIGADE ATTENDED FAR TOO LATE.

THERE THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS IN LEPPINGS LANE WERE SCREAMING AT THE POLICE
TO OPEN THE GATES. THEY WERE DOING THIS NOT BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH BUT BECAUSE
THERE WAS SO MANY PEOPLE TRYING TO GET IN THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD MISS THE
KICKOFF. WHEN WE GOT IN. WE WERE SEATED IN ROW 10 OF THE ACTUAL WEST STAND
AND COULD SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.     I SAW A MAN WHO WAS BLUE IN THE FACE BEING
OR ATTEMPTING TO BE PASSED OVER THE RAILINGS ONTO THE PITCH. HE WAS SO HEAVY
THAT THE FANS WERE UNABLE TO GET HIM OVER AND HE FELL DOWN INTO THE CROWD. A
P Q M C E MAN SAW THIS AND I SAW HIM CRAWL THROUGH THE ACCESS GATE AND CRAWL
AJOTRG TO TRY TO REACH THE MAN. HE COULDNT GET THROUGH AND HAD TO TURN BACK.
IF HE HAD OF GOT THROUGH HE WOULD ALSO HAVE DIED. ANOTHER THING IS THAT THE
TICKET COLLECTORS WERE SO COMPLACENT AND WERE NOT BOTHERING TO CHECK ALL THE

LAD ABOUT 14 YRS BACK THROUGH THE TUNNEL WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD.

HEARD AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON PA SYSTEM TELLING EVERYONE TO GET BACK ONTO THE
TERRACING IT WAS OBVIOUS NO ONE KNEW THERE WAS TROUBLE. POLICE DID NOT KNOW
WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY WERE PUSHING PEOPLE BACK ONTO THE TERRACING AS THEY
WERE TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE CRUSH. VERY FEW POLICE AB OUT OUTSIDE THE
Gi®ND. NO ATTEMPT TO MAKE QUEUES NO ORGANISATION AT ALL.
THEY SHOULD HAVE CLOSED THE GATES TO THE TUNNEL EARLIER. ORGANISATION CAME
FROM SUPPORTERS NOT POLICE. BOTH KNEES BADLY BRUISED. DIFFICULTY IN WALKING.

- FATHER.
WE ENTERED AT LEPPINGS LN AT 1430HRS AND WENT THROUGH THE TURNSTYLES WHERE
OUR TICKETS WERE CHECKED I STILL HAVE THE STUBB.
THE SIGN POSTING TO THE TURNSTYLES WAS BAD AND NOONE SEEMED TO KNOW WHERE WE
WERE GOING,A POLICEMAN TRIED TO DIRECT US TO THE WRONG AREA.
IT WAS VERY CROWDED WITH A FUNNEL EFFECT AT THE TURNSTYLE..THERE WAS NO
QUEING AND NO ORGANISATION..POLICEOFFICERS WERE JUST STANDING AROUND DOING
NOTHING..I DID NOT SEE ANY STEWARDS AT THE MATCH.
THE BUILD UP OF PEOPLE WAS CRAZY AND WE WERE STILL BEING SEARCHED THIS WAS
CAUSING DELAYS    WE ACTUALLY GOT UP THE STEPS AT ABOUT 1450HRS...I COULD SEE
PEOPLE CLIMBING ONTO THE TURNSTYLE BOOTHES WAVING PIECES OF PAPER..IT WAS
OBVIOUS PEOPLE WERE NOT GOING TO GET IN BEFORE KICKOFF..I COULD SEE THE CRUSH
BELOW AS EVERYONE WENT FORWARD...THEY WENT OVER THE FENCES ONTO THE PITCH

PEOPLE IN FRONT OF ME CLIMBED OVER THE TURNSTILE, I FOLLOWED AS DID MANY
BAHIND ME. I DID NOT SHOW MY TICKET TO ANYBODY. THERE WAS A POLICE OFFICER
STANDING BY THE TURNSTILE WATCHING US CLIMB OVER. I THEN MADE MY WAY DOWN THE
TUNNEL IT WAS CROWDED BUT NOT TOO BAD, I WAS INTENDING WHEN I REACHED THE
TERRACE TO MAKE MY WAY TO ONE OF THE SIDE WINGS, I WAS NOT AWARE AT THAT
STAGE THAT THE SIDE WINGS WERE FENCED OFF AND HAD TO BE REACHED BY A
DIFFERENT ROUTE, THERE WERE NO DIRECTIONS. AS I REACHED THE TERRACE I
IMMEDIATELY SAW HOW CROWDED IT WAS, I TRIED TO MAKE MY WAY THROUGH THE CROWD
TO THE LEFT OF THE PEN TO GET TO THE SIDE WING BUT THE FORCE OF THE CROWD
J U A PUSHED ME FORWARD. BY ABOUT 2.55PM I HAD BEEN PUSHED ABOUT 2/3 OF THE
W A i D O W N THE PEN. I WAS BEING CRUSHED AGAINST A SIDE FENCE IN FRONT OF THE
GOAL. PEOPLE WERE SHOUTING AT THE POLICE FOR HELP, I SAW THAT A SMALL GATE AT
THE FRONT OF THE FENCE BEHIND THE GOAL HAD BEEN OPENED AND PEOPLE WERE
SPILLING ONTO THE PITCH, BUT THE POLICE JUST MADE THEM GET BACK.THIS WAS JUST
BEFORE THE MATCH HAD STARTED. PEOPLE ALSO STARTED SHOUTING TO PEOPLE COMING
ONTO THE TERRACE FROM THE TUNNEL TO STAY BACK. THE POLICE AT THE FRONT JUST
KEPT SHOUTING AT US TO MOVE BACK, BUT THERE WAS JUST NOWHERE TO MOVE BACK TO.
AT ABOUT 3.15PM I MANAGED TO CLIMB ONTO A FENCE AND TO SAFETY.

                          20YRS SAME ADDRESS, HAS ALREADY CALLED HOTLINE
WE WERE THERE FROM 2.15 TILL ABOUT 25 PAST 4 IN PEN 3 OR ON THE PITCH.
WE ARRIVED IN PEN 3 AT ABOUT 20 PAST TWO BUT THE CRUSH WAS SO MUCH THEN I WAS
SEPARATED FROM MY SON, AT ABOUT 2.30PM I PUSHED MY WAY OUT BACK TO THE TUNNEL
AND WENT IN THERE AT ABOUT 10 TO 3 SAT ON THE FLOOR FOR 5 MINUTES TO RECOVER
MY BREATH AND THEN WENT INTO THE NEXT PEN WHICH WAS QUITE COMFORTABLE, I MADE
MY WAY TO THE DIVIDING FENCE, WHEN THE MATCH WAS ABANDONED BECAUSE IT WAS
OBVIOUS SOMETHING MAJOR HAD HAPPENED AND I WAS LOOKING FOR MY SON, I GOT
ROUND TO THE REAR OF THE THE MIDDLE PEN AND LOOKED AT THE BODIES THERE AND I
ALSO WENT TO THE PITCH TO CHECK THE BODIES THERE, MY SON WAS DOING THE SAME
AND IN FACT HE HAD STOPPED AT THE REAR NEAR THE BALCONEY AND WAS HELPING THE
YOUNGER FANS THERE.WE MET UP AT ABOUT 25 TO 4.
I DID WRITE A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF NOTES BEFORE I SAW ANYTHING ON THE
TELEVISION AND I GAVE THES INTO THE LIVERPOOL CLUB ADDRESSED TO EITHER PETER
ROBINSON OR TONY ENSOR THE CLUB SOLICITOR. IF YOU REQUIRE A STATEMENT COULD
H O N AND I BE INTERIEWED TOGETHER AND THE NOTES FOUND PLEASE.
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THERE WAS NO CRUSH WHEN WE WENT THROUGHT THE TURNSTILES,
THERE WERE POLICE STANDING IN FRONT AND BEHIND AND RANDOMLY SEARCHING FANS,
BUT ONCE THROUGH THE TURNSTILES THERE WAS NO ONE TO DIRECT THE FANS ANYWHERE,
THE ONLY STEWARDS WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS TO THE SEATS ABOVE AND THEY
ONLY SEEMED CONCERNED WITH KEEPING THE FANS WITH STANDING TICKETS OUT OF THE
SEATING AREAS. THIS I THINK WAS A MAJOR CAUSE OF THE DISASTER I THINK THERE
COULD HAVE BEEN A TRAGETY AT 20 TO 3 WITHOUT THE GATE BEING OPENED.

THAT SECTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED BEFORE THEN, BUT PEOPLE STILL KEPT
SQUASHING IN. WE COULDN'T HELP ANYONE. THERE WAS A BLOKE BEING PINNED AGAINST
THE CRASH BARRIER ACROSS HIS THROAT, AND MY MATE AND ME WERE KICKING HIS
ANKLES, TRYING TO GET HIM OFF THE BARRIER, BUT HE COULDN'T MOVE, AND NEITHER
COULD WE. HE WAS SCREAMING AT ME TO KEPT HIM OFF. HE WAS WERAING A BLU SHIRT
AND HAD LONG BLOND HAIR. I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR HIM. PEOPLE WERE BEGGINBG
ME TO HELP THEM, AND THERE WERE PEOPLE ON THE FLOOR UNDERNEATH ME, BUT I HAD
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. WE COULDN'T MAKE THE POLICE UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS
HAPPENING. A MAN BESIDE ME SUDDENLY HELPED ME OVER THE TOP OF THE FENCE BY
G R ^ B I N G MY BELT AND LIFTING ME UP, BUT THE CROWD SURGED AGAINST ME AND MY
LEGS WERE TRAPPED. I WAS PULLED DOWN AGAIN, AND I CRAWLED TO THE FRONT.
SOMEONE PUNCHED ME IN THE BACK AND I WAS KNOCKED FORWARDS ONTO THE FLOOR BY
THE GATE AND A POLICEMAN PULLED ME OUT. I WANDERED ROUND IN A DAZE FOR A
WHILE, THEN A POLICEWOMAN TOLD ME TO GO THROUGH A GATE INTO AN EMPTY SECTION
OF PEN AND I WAITED THERE. I COULD SEE FANS HITTING THE POLICE, BUT IT WAS
FRUSTRATION BECAUSE THE POLICE REFUSED TO OPEN THE GATES AND THAT COST LIVES.
IT WAS ABSOLUTE MAYHEM - I HAD TO CLIMB OVER OTHER PEOPLE TO GET OUT - IT WAS
EVERYMAN FOR HIMSELF. IT WAS CHAOS WITH POLICE AND AMBULANCES MILLING ABOUT.
IN THE END I FOUND TWO OF MY FRIENDS. ONE OF MY FRIENDS SAW A POLICEMAN
ACCEPTING A BRIBE TO ALLOW SOMEONE INTO THE GROUND WITHOUT A TICKET FOR A
TENNER - BUT I DIDN'T SEE THAT MYSELF, ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE HIM.
THERE WERE NO DIRECTIONS AT ALL ONCE YOU CAME THROUGH THE TURNSTILES.
THERE WAS NO SECURITY AND NO-ONE TAKING TICKETS - I'VE STILL GOT MINE. THERE
SHOULD HAVE BEEN STEWARDS TAKING TICKETS. WHEN I CAME HOME I FOUND A FRIEND
OF MINE HAD DIED. IT SAID ON THE NEWS THAT TICKETS WERE BEING CHECKED BUT
THEY WEREN'T BECAUSE ALL MY MATES AND ME HAVE STILL GOT OUR COMPLETE TICKETS.
IT WAS TOTAL PANIC. I HAVE BEEN IN THE KOP AT LIVERPOOL WHEN IT WAS CROWDED,
BUT IT WAS BETTER ORGANISED AND NOT SO DANGEROUS. THERE WAS NO CO-ORDINATION
ON THE PITCH WHEN PEOPLE GOT OUT OF THE CRUSH. THE POLICE SEEMED TO PANIC.
THERE WAS NO WAY OUT - WE WERE ALL TRAPPED TOGETHER AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE BLOKE WHO HAD HIS THROAT PINNED ACROS THE BARRIER.

I WAS WITH:

     AND          ( I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THEM)

CONT..IT SEEMED THAT THERE WAS NO WHERE ELSE FOR THE FANS TO GO,AS THERE
WERE NO STEWARDS DIRECTING THEM INTO THE STANDS WHICH HAD NOT BEEN PILLED.
THERE WRE A FEW ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THE P.A.SYSTEM ALTHOUGH THEY COULD NOT BE
UNDERSTOOD.
I THOUGHT THAT THE OFF LICENCES WHICH HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO OPEN BEFORE THE
MATCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD TO SHUT TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM LOITERING AROUND
INSTEAD OF GOING STRAIGHT INTO THE GROUND.IT SEEMED ILLOGICAL THAT THE PUBS
W ^ SHUT AND THE OFF LICENCE LEFT OPEN.

DI^TCULTY GETTING THEM OUT AS THEY WERE SO CRUSHED TOGETHER, SOME PART OF
THEM WAS STUCK. VERY FEW GOT THROUGH THAT GATE. THERE WAS A BALD POLICEMAN
WORKING VERY HARD TRYING TO GET PEOPLE OUT SHOUTING FOR THEM TO PASS PEOPLE

BY THE GATE. I MANAGED TO PUSH MY     WAY OUT AND WAS THEN PUSHED THROUGHTHE
GATE.     I GOT TO THE QUEUE FOR THETURNSTILES WHICH IS SEPERATED BY BARRIERS
AND STILL THE PEOPLE WERE PUSHING.      AS I STOOD IN THIS QUEUE A POLICEMAN TOLD
ME TO DUCK DOWN UNDER THE BARRIER      AND GO ROUND TO THE SIDE TO AN OPENED GATE
I WENT THROUGH WITHOUT ANYBODY SEEING MY TICKET, WHICH I STILL HAVE. AFTER
I'D BEEN TO THE TOILET I WENT DOWN THE TUNNEL AND GOT INTO THE GAME JUST AS
THE MATCH WAS STARTING. THE AREA THAT I WAS IN WAS ABSOLUTELY PACKED WITH
PEOPLE AND I WAS GETTING CRUSHED. I REALISED SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS WAS
WRONG.I TRIED TO GET BACK THROUGH THE TUNNEL BUT I COULDN'T. THEN THERE WAS
A 0 D D E N SURGE FORWARD AND A BARRIER COLLAPSED AND I WAS KNOCKED BACKWARDS
ONTO OTHER PEOPLE.     SOME PEOPLE ALSO FELL ON TOP OF ME.   I MANAGED TO ROLL
OVER AND GET UP. I SAW THE PEOPLE UNDERNEATH ME, INCLUDING A CHILD WHO
LOOKED BLUE. I WANTED TO HELP THE CHILD BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE I WAS STILL
GETTING PUSHED MYSELF AND I THOUGHT I BETTER GET OUT MYSELF.       I EVEN LOST
SIGHT OF THE CHILD DURING THE CRUSH. I THEN WENT OUTSIDE THE TUNNEL WHERE A
POLICEMAN HELPED ME AS WAS HAVING AN ASTHMA ATTACK. , I DID NOT GO TO
HOSPITAL.     I ATTENDED THE MATCH ON MY OWN.

CONTINUED FROM 2 ....
THERE WERE POLICE MEN ON HORSES TRYING TO GET PEOPLE INTO AN ORDERLY LINE,
BUT THE COULDN'T SUCCEED.       IT WAS GETTING REALLY BAD OUT BY THE TURNSTYLES, I
WAS CRUSHED, I COULD HARDLY BREATH.       I WENT INTO THE GROUND THROUGH THE
TURNSTYLE, WALKED IN AND ALL I COULD WAS A TUNNEL, SO EVERY ONE JUST HEADED
STRAIGHT DOWN IT, THERE WERE NO DIRECTIONS AND         THERE WAS NO ONETHERE TO
DIRECT TO THE OUTER PENS, WHEN I GOT INTO THE TERRACING AREA IT WAS CHOCK A
BLOCK, AND I REALISED THAT THERE WERE A COUPLE OF THOUSAND STILL TRYING TO
G E T ^ N T O THE GROUND, AS I WAS WITH MY BROTHER WE TRIED TO MOVE OVER TO THE
LE^         WE FORCED OUR WAY TO LEFT AND CAME UP TO A FENCE, WE CLIMBED OVER THE
FENCE, AND WENT INTO A GANG WAY ABOUT 5 FOOT WIDE, THE MATCH HAD NOW STARTED,
AND WE WERE STANDING WATCHING, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING FROM THE
CENTRE TERRACE INTO THE GANG WAY, AND THIS WAS         BEGINNING TOGET PACKED, WE
MOVED BACK, AND THE WE WERE LIFTED UP INTO THE SEATING BALCONY.        FROM THIS
AREA I COULD SEE THE FRONT OF THE CENTRE PEN, AND I COULD SEE THAT PEOPLE
WERE BEING CRUSHED AND THAT SOME HAD ALREADY DIED, PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO LIFT
BODYS OVER THE TOP OF THE RAILINGS, PEOPLE WERE ALOS TRYING TO CLIMB OVER THE
RAILINGS BUT THE POLICE OFFICERS WERE PUSHING THEM BACK OVER, AS I AM A NURSE
I THOUGHT I HAD BETTER GET ONTO THE PITCH SO THAT I COULD HELP. I WENT BACK
DOWN THE GANGWAY AND WENT ONTO THE PITCH. I INFORMED THE POLICE OFFICERS ON
THE PITCH THAT I WAS A TRAINED NURSE AND ASKED WHERE TO GO SO THAT I COULD
HELP, NONE OF THE OFFICERS SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON SO I HAD TO JUST
RUN ROUND ALL THE BODIES, SEEING WHICH ONES HAD A CHANCE OF SURVIVAL.
SOME OF THE OTHER FANS STARTED TO PULL THE FENCE DOWN TO HELP GET OTHER
BODIES OUT OF THE TERRACE BUT THE POLICE KEPT TRYING TO STOP THEM. THE
POLICE THEN REALISED WHAT WAS BEST, AND HELP PULL THE FENCE DOWN.        I CARRIED
ON TRYING TO RESUSITATE PEOPLE BUT IT WAS NO GOOD, THEY HAD BEEN LEFT IN THE
CROWD FOR TO LONG. MOST OF THE BODIES WERE CARRIED AWAY ON THE HOARDINGS,
DOCTORS AND AMBULANCES ARRIVED ON THE PITCH,
THERE SEEMED NO ORGANISATION, SOME OF THE POLICE OFFICERS WERE JUST STANDING
AROUND TALKING WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELPING.

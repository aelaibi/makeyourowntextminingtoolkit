              I remember             on the           a p p r o a c h to the c o a c h       park       there       was        a lot      of

              T he    coach was            parked       w h e r e a ll     the L i v e r p o o l          coaches         were       parked           I

              think       by the B a s s          Brewery.

              The     f o ur    of    us    then walked              to the g r o u n d .              We d i d     not      receive           any

              Police        escort.           Although         there       were       quite        a    fe w P o l i c e m e n       stood          in

              turnstile          area       was       completely          free.         We    were able             to w a l k       through              the

              did     not      see a n y      stewards         outside          either.            Once       inside         the     ground

I suppose              this     wa s       about          2.05       pm    (1405)          at    the    l at e st .          I remember

thinking           how empty               the       terracing             was.        In our P e n             people          were    sitting

down       there was            t ha t         much       room.

I j us t        stood        talking            to m y         father        and                       . I was         s t o o d w i t h my

b ac k     to     the    barrier               and    the       pen w a s            filling        up s t e a d i l y as I w o u l d

normally           expect          a ground               to    do.

At     about       2.40       pm      (1440)          the       two       teams       were       warming          up on the            pitch.            1

became          aware        t ha t       by    now       the      pe n wa s         getting        really           full.         I would

probably           describe               it as       full         to     c a p a / i t y , but        not      uncomfortable.                    I

have       still        got m y           back       to    the      barrier           at     this      stage.

From       then        on the         pen j us t           kept         getting        tighter          and       tighter,           I was

being       forced away                   from       the       barrier,              but    I kept        consciously forcing                      my

way      b ac k    to    it as            I knew          t ha t    wa s    a        saferplace           to     be.       By     about       2.

55pm       ( 1455),          it was            now    very         tight        and    uncomfortable.                      I was       still        by

th e     barrier,            I wa s        beginning               to     panic a          little       bit,         I was       having

difficulty              breathing               it w a s        very       hot a n d        you     could         not      expand your

c h es t    property.                                , who         was     to m y      right        and        in f r o n t      of me       wa s

also       panicking            and        getting             ups et .         My    father         was       in f r o n t o f ________

he     told       us    that       when         the       g am e     started          it w o u l d        e a s e off a l ittle.

At     this       sta ge ,      I could              not m o v e          at all       of m y       own      free will,             I only

m o v e d as       the       crowd         did.

I remember              people            at    the       front         were      shouting           at    the P o l i c e .           There          was

about       2 Policemen                   by the          fence         looking            in.

The      people         at    the         front       were         shouting           at     the P o l i c e         to    open     the      g a te

and      t h at    people          were         getting            c ru s h e d .      All       the P o l i c e          kept     saying         wa s

calm       down and           get         back.

Then       it j u st         seemed            to    get       even       tighter          and     tighter           by 3 p m      (1500)         when

the      game      started            I had          now       been       pushed away              from        the     barrier         I was

against,           a n d w as         a    few       f e et     to the          r i gh t     and    towards            the      fr on t .     I was

pitch,          they were          physically              trying        to s t o p        people        climbing           out.         They

were       putting          their       hands      up to s t o p           them.

By    now       I was       so    frightened              I was    shouting             at      the     Police        together           with

everyone           a r o u n d me.         We w e r e       shouting          to      open        the    gat e s.

At about           3.02pm         (1502)        certainly a              couple         of m i n u t e s        into    the       g a me    as

Notting ha m Forest                 attacked              I was    aware         of a s u d d e n            surge from           behind

the    g r id.         I wa s      now      completely            unable         to m o v e        even my head and                   I was

facing          away     from      the      p i t c h all       I could          see       was     the       corner     flag        to     the

r ig h t    of     the      goal    as     I looked                         and       my     father          were     now     in f r o n t

Nobody          seemed       to    be     getting          through         the     g a te       from     the     front,        but       I saw

people          being       passed        overhead          through          the      gate.           These      people        were

obviously             unconscious.

People          were     stil l      climbing             out   o nt o     the     pitch and also                   over      the     side

fencing          into       the    outer        pen.        I saw        that      by      no w    there       were     more        Police

by the          fe n ce .         Some      seemed         to be    helping            and       o t h e r s not.

My    father          was        now a g a i n s t        the side         fe nc e ,     and      I w a s a w a r e t ha t      the

that       my    father          took     her    onto       the    pitch.              I stayed where                 I was       getting

my    breath          back.

I c o u l d see a            lot     of     people         just    lyi n g       or     sitting          on the        pitch,         also

there     were      st ill         a    lot    of    screams          coming      from         the    front        of       the    pen    I

had escaped             from.           It w a s     just       chaos.

I walked         down        to    the    gate       out      onto      the     pitch,         the    g at e     wa s       open and          I

was    going       onto       the       pitch.        This       Policeman            came a n d         stopped            me,    he    told

me    only    the       injured were                allowed       on the         pit c h.          I told        h i m m y D a d was

o n the      pitch       but       he    t o l d me      to     stay      there.

Then    I saw a Liv er po ol                   supporter          come        over     and      p u s h the P o l i c e m a n            out

of    the way.           I got          through       the        g at e    and found my              father and

who    were      by the           18 y a r d    box.

I was     j us t    then          sitting       on the            pitch,        I wasupset           and       c ry i n g    because           I

could     not      believe             what    had    happened.

I saw a young                boy       lying    on the           floor        by me.         There       w e r e two        firemen

giving       him artificial                   resusitation,              they     kept         doing       it for a f e w

minutes.           But       after       a while         they     stopped and               they      covered           his       face.

This    was      th e    first          time    I realised just                  how       serious         the w h o l e          incident

was.

T h e n my    f at h er ,                      and    myself          went      out    of      the    ground,           through          the

S out h Stand.               We    sat    on a wall ,                                 ribs      were       hurting           and    she

was    very      upset.

The    Police,          f i re     brigade          and ambulancemen                  k ep t    asking          her     to    go    to

hospital,          but       she       refused.

A Policeman             came a n d a s k e d          us      if we       all    wanted a            cup* of        tea,      he sat          us

in the       back       of a P o l i c e        dog      van and          gave    us a d r i n k           of     tea.

I went       b a ck a n d         had a       look w h a t       wa s     happening            on the        pitch, I s a w             that

there     wa s     a Police             line    across          the     halfway        line        and     s t i ll     a    lot of

people       lying       on the          pitch       being       treated.             By    no w     the    two       pens        behind

the    goal,       were       emptied          out.        One    of     the     Stewards            said       there        were       six

people       dead.

I went       back       to    the       van where          my    father         and                   we r e .        At     this       poin t

Ves      1 recall   noticing when taking up our seats       in the

Di re cto rs’ Box that the centre section of this area was very

packed with supporters - Liverpool          supporters at that e n d .



DID YOU SEE ANY INCIDENT IN THAT STANDING APEA WHICH YOU

BELIEVE COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DISASTER?



Not specifically - I have commented on the crowding of the

centre area,        I am familiar with the ground ana I have been

t o s em i-f i na Is at H i 11sbo r ough bef o re asm I have ne ver see n

a situation where the          centre section was   packed and the

outer areas were so thinly occupied before a game.

14-40 hours.



DID YOU SEE ANY UNUSUAL CROWD SURGE          IN EITHER PEN 3 OR PEN A OR

BOTH?    IF SO, DO YOU KNOW THE CAUSE AND WHAT TIME DID IT OCCUR?



No.     My belief    is that   it was too packed to have any surge .

the fact that there was no swaying          conf i rmed that to me,   that

it was very tigh11y pac k ed .

        DID YOU WITNESS ANY ACT BY SUPPORTERS WHICH OBSTRUCTED EITHER

        POLICE,    STEWARDS OR MEDICAL PERSONS AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?



        Rather more distraction than obstuction,    I recall the run of

        some Liverpool    fans towards the Spion Kop which had to be

        dealt with by the    police,



Q29.    HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF THE POLICE

arid I recall an ambu 1ance           comi ng onto the pi t ch but,          i n general

t e rins , no.

On a general       n o t e , it seems to me amazing that when it was

otherwise,       no.

Q37.   DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED

       FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?



       My impression is that there was just total                  confusion all

       around and lack of direction amongst               the    'official1'

       services,.        It seemed to me that the fans were taking all the

                          C-^r i
           I am a Liverpool Football C l u b ^ u p p o r t e r and on Saturday 13th April

           1989,   (130489)         I attended the Liverpool versus Nottingham Forrest

           match being staged at the Hillsborough Football Stadium,                                  Sheffield.

           I am a season ticket holder for the main stand at Anfield and

           therefore was able to obtain a ticket for the Leppings Ln standing

           area at a value of £6.00.                  The ticket, which I have retained with all

           three sections          in tact,         is numbered LL3                  entrance B, Leppings Ln.

           I left for Sheffield at 11.15am (1115) and was travelling alone                                       in my

           private car.            I did not stop on route,                but I w a ^ ^ u b j e c t e d to

           approximately 40 minutes of traffic delays^ oiprthe M&7 mainly.

           I arrived at Sheffield Eagles                   car park at Jfcout 1.50pm,               (1330) which

           at this time was only about a third full.                             I was amazed at this.             I

           have used this car park on previous occasions.                               I did not encounter
                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                       S2382

         any Police directing traffic at all.

         I then walked along the Pennistone Rd after             leaving the car park.       I

         turned left by the South Stand where I was stopped by Police and told

         to turn round and go around the streets.            I retracted my steps along

         Penniston Rd, turned right onto another          road and walked along there

         towards the Leppings Ln area.

         During this walk I saw several Liverpool supporters standing                idly

         around just talking.        I d i d n ’t see any of the arguing or any type of

         disorder.     I d i d n ’t see any of them actual I f   drinking or with cans of

         beer.

         It was about 2.10pm <1410? to 2.15pm j/f415> that I came up to the

         Leppings Ln area and I noticed tha'ythere was a mass of people outside

         the turnstiles.     There    looked las t h o u g h there had been some semblance

         of a queue at some stage,       but these were^qui ckly disappearing.

         The people were massing and bunching JTLghtly together outside the

         turnstile area.      I was entering iha/right side standing area

         turnstiles and joined the       ’q u e u e ’ in a central   position.    Immediately

         it became obvious that nobody was moving forward to enter the

         turnstiles,    but were moving sideways and forwards and backwards.

         Sensing a potentially dangerous situation,           I manoeuvred myself to the

         right,    next to a barrier from where there was an immediate escape               if

         needed.     Having reached the barrier I was forced a couple of meters

         along    it in the direction of the turnstiles.             I found myself trapped

         against    it and I was unable to move even my arms without             considerable

         effort.     I then began to suffer from the effects of having my waist

         and side crushed and after a couple of mi nutes^jf alarm and physical

A-r      punishment,   I decided to force myself undei^^rhe barrier and even under

‘— I'—   a Police horse,    to the relative safet\ 9 / the side passage leading to

         the South Stand.

         I stayed in the corner of the immediate turnstile area in the hope
                                                                                    PAGE     3
                                                                                    S2382

       that the congestion would be eased to allow easy access.             This,    very

       sadly, was never to happen.

       Other    people joined me in the corner and stated their disbelief at the

       crushing in front of their eyes.

       By this time dads were removing tha»ir young ones and those of other

       people who were seeking sarictuajpy from the mayhem.         Police Officers

       were t r y ing to organise the yefrowd into orderly queues,       but they were
 ^rr
HU     ineffective due to a r e l i j /tance in the crowd to physically move to

       safer areas, which,    e L jtfn at   this stage, was still a possibility.

       There was a gate behind the turnstiles which was controlling the flow

       of people to a certain extent.          Others had now gone to the exit gate

       adjacent to the turnstiles area to ask the Policemen to let them in.

       This would be at about 2.30pm          (1430) and I think it would have been

       possible and sensible to have let those,          I emphasise,   with tickets,       in ,

       to ease the congestion.        Instead the congestion was allowed to gather

       momentum and panic set in amongst both the crowds of people and the

       Police   in the turnstiles area.

       By now kick off time was fast approaching and there was no way forward

       or back and even the sideways passage had become blocked.             This

       effectively cut off any escape routes.

       The only other reasonably feasible escape was onto the b a n k o f           the

       River Don,    but this was treacherous and potentially dangjpous.             As it

       turned out I had to use this escape route when the ga^re in front of

       the turnstiles area,    not adjacent to them, was o p ^ e d ,     a couple of

       yards away from me and the crowd surged t h r o u g h ^ h e m and towards the

       turnstiles.

«>|S   It was quite obvious then that there were too many people in too small

       an area.

       Without hesitation I climbed the fence and clambered along the river

       bank holding onto flimsy branches to keep my balance.
                                                                    /   PAGE    4
                                                                  / .   S23S2

By now my back was turned to the events going on,        but wbren I turned

round I noti ced that the exit gate adjacent to the turnstiles had been

opened.     A Police horse and a Policeman stood Nas ii±e and the entrance

was now totally unobstructed as I helped a young lad to climb back-

over the fence and I followed.

At that time it was the safest place to go and I gladly accepted it.

By now I was stunned and shocked as I thought about the next move that

had to be made and the one that was to prove the most vital decision

of all.

I passed through the gate without showing my ticket to anyone and I

was one of the first through it.       It therefore struck me that it would

have been just as easy for those without tickets to pass through

unchecked.

I stood still for a short while in the refreshment area behind the

terracing and thought carefully about the safest        place to stand.   No

guidance on where to stand was provided by anyone.          Not stewards or

Police.     I didn't see anyone around to ask.          A

There was a standing area in front of me,        but xJS seemed already full
                  fews      \ 12 -                 /
so I headed for the extreme right to find another entrance         into the

standing area and was successful.       I .came/upon a less crowded area and

tucked myself    right up against the baVj$/wall where I could not be

pushed from behind and also to provide me with a fairly easy escape

route in the event of an emergency.       This would have been about five

to three    <1455),   just as the players were   coming out onto the pitch.

By now,    having had a few moments respite,     I realised that people had

been injured outside      in the turnstiles area and that possibly people

had died.

I stood in disbelief as I saw the teams      run out onto the pitch.      I

thought    it would have been far better for the game to have been

delayed for a while to allow the situation outside to ease.

                                                                                       S2382

    O f T   It also seemed to me that theryg was a total            lack of concern shown by

'Waesk.     the Police at the overc row diXg, particularly in the central area where

            I noticed people were bedngf picked up into the seated area out of the

            crowd below.

            It just made no sense and the distress I felt as the match started

            reminded me of the object misery of standing through the Liverpool

            versus Juventus European         Cup Final   in 1985.

            You saw Police observing         the situation with all their modern

            sophisticated equipment and said to yourself everything must be okay,

            but at the back of your mind you could not understand it.

            Even as some fans forced their way onto the pitch there was still a

            lack of urgency in dealing with the situatior^f            The emergency exits

            were inadequate to immediately relieve the/rrushi n g .

            When the football finally stopped, fans £ e r e being dragged onto the

                    -              _______

            became apparent.

            After a further ten minutes       I left'the terracing to evaluate the

            situation.     As I walked back to the exit gates I noticed fans crowded

            round other fans who were lying on the ground and being tended to.

            One fan, whose life had been        lost was lying uncovered      and you could

            see clearly how the life         had literally been crushed from him.      It was

            a ghastly and horrific sight,
                  C A * r Kfifcjs-j-
            I then went up into the seating area to see the scale of the disaster

            and then swiftly left the afound, as there was nothing I could have

            done to help and did not\y/ant to suffer, any longer,           the scene of

            carnage and death.

            I have several views and impressions Regarding the ev en t s:•

            Ln turnstiles by the Police, who f e r e       supposedly in control outside

                                                                                                   S 2382

                    consequence of plenty o£S pushi ng and jostling.

                    <2)     Fans did not s tyow sufficient        concern for the safety      and well

                    desire to enter'the ground/6efore the kick off.

                    <3)     Too many fans w ithout tickets had congested the area outside the

                    Leppings Ln turnstll/'s and had not been moved away by the Police.

                    <4)     The Police were completely inflexible          in their control of the

                    crowd and stuck to their orders regardless of what events were taking

                    place.        For example,     the exit gate adjacent to the turnstiles       could

                    have been opened at about 2.30pm <1430) with Police               letting those fans

                    in who were in possession of tickets.              It was very distressing to see

                    their    reluctance to make any decisions          at all.

                    <5)     The total non-existence of ground          stewards inside   the grounds to

                    direct the crowds into the correct areas and prevent overcrowding even

                    after the gates were opened.

                    <6)     At five to three        <1455) the Police had noalternative       butto open

                    the gates and let the fans             in as a serious life threatening situation

                    was developed outside the Leppi/ngs Ln turnstiles.

 c a t              <7)     The ground stewards should have spent more time worrying about

                    what was going on inside tine ground than outside and implementing
 a -t

                    emergency arrangements jm the event of a crisis.                They disappeared

                    when they were mos\t needed.

                    entering the ground has wse effect of creating delays on entry.

           At ^yjarn (0900)    on the above date I reported to Ecclesfield Police

           Sta^io^K^where transport was waiting to tafk^off icers from F2 to

           Hillsborough Stadium.      At Hillsborough I was Driefed along with all

           under the direct supervision of PtSi^ PS323 PROCTOR.  Our duties on this

           date were outside the gX^^id in Leppings LN near to the turnstiles

           which ware to be used as access      points into the ground for all

           Liverpool   sb^> porters with the cb<-rect ticket.
                                                    ---------     Our brief was to

           receive fans at that location and tcKmaintain order and also to

turnstiles at Leppings LN.        I was   in possession of my personal        radio,
     " N _ _


At 11 am (1100)    that date, we received a further briefing at the r\ar

of the West S'Uand which       is at the iSeppings LN end of the ground.

This briefing was carried out by Inspector          SYKES who ensured that       all

officers were aware of specific duties under his command outside the

Leppings LN end of the ground.        We were   instructed to carry out

selective searches of fans outside the ground and to search any

vehicles that were carrying Liverpool supporters and depositing them

at the ground.     Serial    19 then went outside the ground to the area of

Leppings LN adjacent to the turnstiles at the mouth of the official

car park at the rear of South Stand.          It was evident at this point

that    large numbers o f ^Liverpool fans were already in the area, many

of th^m ^as king if tickets were available and also asking            For

di rectiotrs* to any local     pubs tnat might be o p e n .    At 12 noon (laOO)

the turnstiles    into the     ground were opened a nd some fans began to

enter    in an orderly fashion.     Other fans weY-e not interested in

entering the ground and were milling around in Cxppings LN i n quite

large^rmmbers,    many of them drsjjnkinq from lager cans etc.          Up until

about    1 yBO pm (1330), there did not appear to be any serious            problems

irKLeppings LN despite the fact that many fans           (hundr^s     in my

estimation) ------------------
             did not have tickeTNs
                               cks™ and were drinking.            FronTM.30 pm         _-

(1330)    onwards, maintaining any sort of order,        either at the turnstiles

or in Leppings L.N itself became very difficult.              Officers from serial

19 were    constantly trying to remove fans without tickets from

  ppings LN.     This task was quite impossible as droves of Liverpool

fans with tickets were arriving.   The pavements and the road way were
                                      \          liCAfp/c   Qfty
completely cisQcked and I was made aware that traffic was to be   *

stopped from entering Leppings LN.         Shortly afterwards a special

 train containing Liverpool        fans was arriving and the fans would

 shortly be arrivirvg in Leppings LN.           By 2.30 pm (1430)        the situation

 in Leppings LN had deteriorated to such an extent that I would say it

 became every man for himself.  There was so mucsfa nastiness from some
                                                           *A2727,

 arrested.       People were    coming up to me and s'Kowing obvious forged             '

 tickets, some of them were mere photostat             copies^f    originals and

 t^is had created a lot o f ^ ^ t a g o n i s m amongst supporters.         At about

 2.4 5 s>m    (1445),   the double gates situate to the left         (as you look

 from outside the q r o u n d ^ o f N turnsti les number o n e N ^ r e   opened to ease

 there was unbelievable.          I went to ttrs perimeter gates situate

 fifteen yards      in front of the turnsti les 'StJQd^ tried to close one of

 them to prevent any more         p'»o^sojiTS from getting near to the

 turnstiles.       These gates were forced open by fans wanting to get to

 the turnstiles.         The gates were   pushed wideNi^en and fans began to

 scrambl^Nthrough towardl^vJihe turnsti 1 es'K         Double exit gates just in

 the official      car park were opened to ease \h e        pressure of the crush

 outside,      Qjne young male fan had already been 1 i H^ed from within the

 crowd and han had over the top to police officers and fans were
                        LSN'ftU C A T
 scrambling up ther outside waliNto get into the ground.  The opening

 of these g a ^ s       caused many people \o rush through and lots of

 people      in Leppings LN saw the opp or t uni ty to gain entry and did so

 then heard a loud speaker ^nnou^t^jXe'nt telV^ng fans to get off the

          Further to my statement submitted earlier                relating to my involvement

          at the Hillsborough Semi Final            I will add the following giving details

          of my invaflb^ement on the pitch.

          I arrived on the pitch shortly after a radio message from ground

          control      requesting all available o H i c e r s      go to the pitch.         As I

          arrived I could see only a few spectators on the pitch and a few

          Pol i ce^a^fi cers stood in front of the perirruKAr f e n cin g.               I went to a

          access to Pen three.              I could see that ^ s e r i o u s crush was developing

          and I tried to tell        people by use of my hands to move back.                   This

          proved a useless exercise the problem being too serious.                       Other

            particular officers       in the gym.       At 4.50 pm I travelled on a coach

           with people who     could not trace relatives or friends.                I went from the

            ground to Hillsborough boys club Middlewood Road, Sheffield.                    I took no

            further    part in the incident.

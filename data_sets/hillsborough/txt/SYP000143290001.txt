                                                                          PAGE       4

           Did not go to the Leppings Lane entrance.        Entered the ground via

           the main gates.



    Q16. FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE WOULD YOU SAY THERE WAS EXCESSIVE CROWD

           BUILD UP AT ANY OTHER GROUND ENTRANCES ON YOUR ARRIVAL?



           There were as usual    large numbers of supporters at the main

           entrance waiting for the team coaches.     The numbers of fans

           when we arrived was nothing unusual.



    G17. DID YOU WITNESS ANY UNAUTHORISED ENTRY TO ANY PART OF THE GROUND?

           (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



           No



0   G 1 8 . DID YOU WITNESS ALCOHOL BEING BROUGHT INTO THE GROUND OR BEING

           No,    on arrival at the ground I remained in the dressing room area

           with the team and management until about 2.45pm when I joined my

           wife    in the main reception area.



    Q19.    DID YOU WITNESS ANY SITUATION WHICH YOU THOUGHT AT THE TIME WAS

           OF A    DISORDERLY NATURE?   (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)

       Nothing until     I took my seat in the Directors Box when my long

        proffessional    experience and instinct told me there was going to

        be trouble at the Leppings Lane end on the terrace.       I sensed

        this   principally from what appeared to be severe

        overcrowding    in the centre sections behind the goal.



GZO.    COULD YOU SEE CLEARLY THE STANDING AREA IN FRONT OF THE WEST

       STAND?



       Yes

        No



Q22.    DO YOU KNOW IF YOU SAW ANYTHING WHICH YOU BELIEVE WAS DIRECTLY

        CONCERNED WITH THE BREAKING OF A BARRIER     IN PEN 3?



        Nothing specifi c , but there was an obvious degree of significient

        crowd movement    in this section.   Large numbers of people were

        moving in all directions with clearly no control of their own

        mobility due to the overcrowding.



Q 2 3 . WHAT TIME DID YOU TAKE UP YOUR MATCH VIEWING POSITION?



         About 2 . 5 0 pm to 2.55pm

                                                                   PAGE    6

       See item 22 above



Q25.    AT THE TIME OF THIS INCIDENT,   CAN YOU SAY IF YOU WITNESSED THE

        DEATH OF ANY PERSON?



        No

        No



027.    DID YOU ASSIST ANY OF THE INJURED?     (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



        No,I did not go onto the pitch,   staying with my wife who is

        p regnant.

        POLICE, STEWARDS OR MEDICAL PERSONS AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?



        No



G29.    HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF THE POLICE

        OFFICERS AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?



        I was suprised the match w a s n ’t stopped sooner.



030.    HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF ANY OF THE

        MATCH STEWARDS AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?
                                                                                PAGE      7

       No,   I had no contact with any of the Stewards.



031.   HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE          ACTIONS OF ANY       OTHER

       PERSON IN AUTHORITY AT THE TIME OF THE          DISASTER?



       About 20-30 minutes after the game was          stopped,    I was     present at

       a meeting in the Board involving the Secretaries of the 3 Clubs,

       the Chairman of the 3 Clubs, Mr Kelly of the F.A. and I believe

       one other F.A.     representative,      possibly Glen KIRTON.        There was

       also another Liverpool Director          present,    I think he is a

       solicitor.     The meeting was also attended by a senior Police

       Officer   in uniform (wearing spectacles)           and later another Officer

       in plain clothes who announced himself as Assistant                 .......

       There was general a g r e e m e n t   at that stage that the match was

       unlikely to proceed.        The officer with glasses confimed there

       were deaths,    but in terms of control of the incident I was not

       filled with confidence what he said.           That may have been because

       he was not in full      possession of all the facts.         The Officers did

       not wish to announce there had been deaths or the game abandoned

       at that time.      The Officers were conscious of the aj^pest in the

       crowd generally and there was agreement that there must be some

       form of announcement quickly.



G32.   WERE YOU SUBJECTED TO ANY THREATS OR VIOLENCE?



       No



G33.   DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL ACT

       BY ANY PERSON?
                                                                      PAGE
                                                                      D6H0



       No



034.   HAVE YOU BEEN PRESENT AT, OR HAD EXPERIENCE OF ANY OTHER

       FOOTBALL TRAGEDY?   (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



       No



033-   IF YOU ATTENDED LAST YEARS SIMILAR MATCH WAS THERE ANYTHING

       SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT WHICH YOU THINK    IS A CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR

       TO THIS DISASTER?   (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



       In 1988 in the last four days before the semi- final       large

       numbers of Liverpool Supporters spent long periods at the

       Nottingham Forest ground trying to get tickets,       presumably

       because they could not get them at Liverpool.      In 1989, when

       the ticket allocation was identical,    there was a noticeable

       absence of the Liverpool   fans from the previous year.



036.   HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ON THE DISTRIBUTION       OF FANS IN   THE

       STANDING AREA TO THE FRONT OF THE WEST STAND?



       There was a noticeable degree of overcrowding    in    the two centre

       sections whilst there appeared to be plenty of room on the

       wings.   This was noticeable as soon as I took my seat first

       before the teams came out.    I instinctively pay alot of

       attention to crowds and their behaviour because of my post as

       Club Secretary and my responsibilities    in that area.



037.   DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              D62Q

       FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?



        (i)    The seriousness of the situation was not

               immediately recognised,      many people believing it was just

               pitch invasion.



        (ii)   I recall   no announcements at an early stage on the public

               address system informing the crowd that people were

               injured and asking for medical assistance.



        (iii)There appeared to be total         chaos,    no co-ordination of the

               operation to assist the injured and rescue those stopped.



038.   IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL

       TO THIS JUDICAL INQUIRY?



       It is my personal     opinion that if ticket allocation had been

       reversed,   it would not necessarily have prevented what occured,

       by that I mean if the Liverpool          fans had been on the Spion Hop,

       the same incident could have happened there.

         TICKET ALLOCATION



         In 1988 I attended a meeting at Hillsborough to discuss the semi-final

         arrangements      in general a few days after the venue had been decided.

         I was informed before the meeting that ticket allocation had been

         decided and given details,      i.e. that Nottingham supporters would have

         the main stand and the Spion Kop.        I was satisfied with the allocation

         and made no comment.       If the allocation had been reversed I would have

         accepted that as well.       I was aware that Liverpool were unhappy with

         their allocation.       It was my understanding that the Police had

         insisted on the allocation and I understood the reasoning for it,            i.e.

         the geographical approaches to the ground by the two sets of

         suppo rte r s .

         In 1989 the semi-final was a repeat fixture of the 1988 match.             There

         was no pre-match meeting      called at Hillsborough and I was informed by-

         somebody    (it was either the Secretary,    Graham MACKRELL or

         initially)    that the 1989 ticket allocation would be identical to the

         previous y e a r .   I was ent i rely satisf ied anbd made the necessary

         arrangements.

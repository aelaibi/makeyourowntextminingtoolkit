           1.   I was born on 10.2.60.       I am a qualified ambulance man.
                This involves a two week induction course followed by six
                weeks basic training and two weeks driving course.    You then
                spend 12 months on the road and go back for assessment.       If
                you pass you are then a qualified ambulance man.          I have
                been in the service for about 6 and a half years.         After
                every five years you have to go back to the regional
                training school at Leicester.          There   is a two week
                residential course and a local course for one week.          You
                have to go every five years to maintain your qualification.
                Before the ambulance service I was in the Navy for four and
                a half years.       I was an able seamen with no medical
                training.     I also worked with the Red Cross before joining
                SYMAS.    I learned basic first aid with the Red Cross.


           2.   On the Thursday and Friday I was on       a shiftof   1400 to
                2200.    On Saturday I was supposed to be off for the day.    I
                was asked by Station Officer Eason if I would cover the
                football match and I agreed.     I had never done a football
                shift before.     It was explained that this was a big match
                and that we wanted to put cover on for it.     Eason asked me
                on Friday.    We were told to meet at the station for 1345 on
                the Saturday.    I arrived a bit earlier so that I could get
                something to eat.     I saw Eason and qualified ambulance man
                             I was the driver down to the ground.

Eason, Station Officer Higgins and myself all went down in
one ambulance.


Higgins directed the way.     We received no direct briefing as
to what to expect.      I was not aware of any "Hillsborough
plan”.     I did know about the major incident plan which
applies      to any major   incident    and   deals   with   the
relationship between the police and other authorities.         I
knew that the first thing for a crew to do was to set up
first aid posts and sort out where vehicles were coming
from.     We were to assess the situation with regard to
numbers and types of injuries and inform         control what
vehicles were required.     We should advise on the best access
routes and set up a casualty clearing point.     We should then
liaise with senior fire officers and police officers until
someone of a higher rank arrived to take charge.       The first
vehicle should always stay and that is initially regarded as
the command vehicle.


We set off to the ground at about 1400.       It took 10 to 15
minutes to get there.     Herries Road was busy with fans in
cars.   We parked in the north stand Spion Kop area.    Station
Officer Higgins told me to park there on the way down.        We
did not try to get the vehicle any further towards the pitch
than that.     It was about 1410 to 1415 when we arrived.    We
then chatted while the station officers were checking their
portable hand sets to see if they worked.     Apparently there
was static on them.    At 1430   we all walked to the front of
the pitch and stood in the corner next to the police,
St.John's ambulance men and the press.         The view was good.
The Spion Kop was already full and the north stand was
already full.     The west stand was half to three quarters
full and the south stand about half full.          The west stand
was filling    in the middle but     not towardsthe sides.         We
stood and chatted and just observed the crowd.         I returned
to the vehicle every five to ten minutes to check that it
was OK.   Nothing happened prior to kick off and kick off
took place at 1459y (feu*                <>v           l, -^c



At about 150^ I saw people spilling on the pitch behind the
Liverpool goal out of the west stand.     All four of us were
standing at the time.       I said to Eason that there was
something going on up at the top end and we could already
see some people lying on the pitch. -4#e decided to go amU
investigate.     I was thinking it was the usual           idiots
invading the pitch.   Eason and I went up the pitch side line
in front of the north stand and a few police officers
followed us.   The game was still continuing.I think it           was
about 150^.    We saw a lot morepeople spilling       on to      the
pitch as we walked up and when we got to the corner of the
north stand you could see lots of people on the floor
rolling about and climbing over the fence.       The police were
initially trying to stop them going on to the pitch.            There
were now probably 50 to 70 people on the pitch.           We went
further round and got to just before the goal posts when a
fan lashed out and hit Eason and then hit me and ran off.
We then moved to the 18 yard box to avoid Deing hit again.
Eason used his portable radio to call control to ask control
to call Higgins and           who were back at the ambulance
and tell them to bring the basic equipment down and a
stretcher and fracture -bags as it looked like a few people
had broken legs and other injuries.      At this stage I still
did not think that we were dealing with fatalities.          I
looked at the west stand and could see police standing up to
the fence.    Fans were running out on the pitch and the
Forest fans were chanting.    People were still climbing over
the top of the fence and the police and fans were now
helping to drag people over the fence.


I do not know whether Eason got through with his message but
the next thing was that           came up to where we were
standing and he was not carrying anything.     Eason then told
        and myself to go back and fetch stretchers and frac
                              0~7
packs.  This was now about 152^.    By this stage the match
                                                      [   l» X
had stopped and the players were going into the tunnel. We-“
jogged back to the ambulance and got one stretcher, one frac
pack, a bag mask resuscitator, portable oxygen and first aid
bags containing, dressings, airways and general first aid
equipment.   Station officer Higgins said he would get the
other stretcher ready and the frac packs and bring them
down.   We did not radio control and I do not know if Higgins
or Eason called.              We all went back up the pitch this time
diagonally across it.             It was now chaos in the west stand.
People were all over the pitch and climbing over the
fencing.              I still did not know why they were trying to get
out though it did cross my mind that there might have been a
                                           O
surge in the crowd.   It was now about 151^.    I could see
people lying on the pitch and I did not think in terms of
fatalities.


I went up to the goal mouth were Eason was waiting for us.
A person was on the floor against the post.              Eason said he
had suspected broken leg£.             I treated him with the frac pack
which took about one minute.                I then looked up and saw
people giving mouth to mouth resuscitation on the floor.
The people were mainly police and St.John's ambulance.                  I
got up and went to my first aid bag to get some airways out.
A policeman came up to me and asked for some airways for
mouth to mouth resuscitation and gave him.one.               wo— uU*a— I

I set off to see what I could do and put in about six or
seven airways on various people within a very short space
of time.   All these people were being tended by the police

or St.John's ambulance. It was now about 151^. I then saw
a young boy on the floor with the policeman so I went over
to help.         I put an airway into the boys mouth and told the
policeman to do a cardiac massage while I did mouth to
mouth resuscitation.            Then a crowd of fans surrounded us and
kicked me a few times.              They were definitely kicks and not
accidentally bumping into me.               I then saw fans carrying
advertising boards as stretchers.                 They fell over onto us
and we shoved them off and continued to treat the young boy.
There was no response from him.                 I went back to my bag to
see if there were anymore airways and found that the
stretcher had gone together with the bag and masks.
Apparently             had taken it.        I    left the young boy with
the policeman       -I believe that the          boy was now dead - and
went to see if there was anyone I could                help.


By this    time      I realised there            was a major incident
happening.     I saw Eason and he told me that there were ten
vehicles on their way.                 This was now about 1520.                    I
presumed that Eason must have managed to get through to
control.     I went back to the ambulance to see if there were
any more airways.        As I got back to the vehicle I saw that
the doors were open and two people were in the back working
                                                             (<K.cL^L^ry>0%^, f o r ©t)
on a casualty.                 was also     there.     Another ambulance A
had now arrived and was parked by the side of ours.                     I went
back   into     our v e h i c l e    and    gave     mouth     to      mouth
resuscitation.                 then went into the drivers seat and
was about to set off when someone said that there was an
asthmatic in a distressed state.                We put him in the front
seat and then left with the police escort up to the Northern
General which is the nearest hospital.               This was now about
1530 to 1535.      It is about two or three miles away and is
         straight up Herries Road.


10   .   We had no problems getting out with the police outside
         directing us and stopping other traffic.                    We arrived at the
         hospital about five minutes later and went straight into
         casualty.     They were already expecting us.                     There were
         already four or five ambulances there and fans in casualty.
         I took the patient to the plaster room and gave him to the
         casualty staff and then went back to my vehicle.                           I put a
         spare stretcher back on the vehicle in order to get back to
         the ground.   We had a police escort back to the ground.


11   .   It took us five minutes to get back to the ground and again
         there was no problem in access.                 When we were back in the
         yard by the gym                 went into the gym which was the
         casualty clearing point.    He returned later with a trolley
         and a man with chest injuries on it.                      We loaded him on to
         the ambulance/and then left for the Hallamshire.                           We had
         heard from someone that the Northern General was full.                          It
         took about five minutes for us to arrive at the gym, get
         loaded and set off again.             Hallamshire hospital is about
         five miles away.   Again we had a police escort and I think

         it took us about 10 minutes.^ We had no problems en route.
         We were met by someone at casualty and were then directed to
         orthopaedic and unloaded the patients to the casualty staff.

                the Standards and Efficiency Officer told us not
to go back to the ground but to stand by on Netherthorpe
Road dual carriageway.      This is about one and a half to two
miles away.     She did not say why we were to wait there.     We
made our way there without a police escort and it only took
us a few minutes.      I then radioed to control and    said that
we were standing by as instructed.          They acknowledged my
message.     Another vehicle parked up behind us.    Control then
told us to proceed to Herries Road bus depot and stand by
there but not to go anywhere near the ground.           I do not
really know what time it was but it may have been around
16.30.     It took us another five to ten minutes to get to
Herries bus depot.        I backed the vehicle up.     There were
already about 20 vehicles there and Eason was directing
things.     He told us to stand by.      We kept seeing vehicles
coming in and out.     About 20 minutes later we were told that
the first three in the line were to go to the gym.        we were
one of them.      It took us about five minutes to get to the
gym.     There was easy access.    Mr. David Jones was there and
appeared to be in charge.         There were about six vehicles
parked around.     We parked and then went to get a drink from
the police.     Mr.Jones then told us to return to the station.
This was about 1805 to 1810.        We arrived at the station at
about 1825       and I signed off at about 18^40


My vehicle call number is Sierra 405.      The ambulance carries
standard equipment of two trolleys,       scoop stretcher,   two
     frac packs, bag and masks, resuscitators,   suction unit
     oxygen cylinder,     pain killing gas and first aid kit
     including airways.

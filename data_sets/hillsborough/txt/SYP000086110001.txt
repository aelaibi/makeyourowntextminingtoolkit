My first           sight was       of a y oung man            lying     on the     ground,           half    in and

half    out        of the gate.            His     upper     half was      free,     but       from the waist

down he was           trapped        by others          lying    on top of       him and            it was

impossible           to    pull    him free         until     those    on top moved.                The     persons

head    level        with the gateway,                 the one on top of him was                     further          back

still,     and so on.           The     only      practical          w a y of    freeing      people was          for

those at the back            to be m o v e d to ease                 the weight         on those      on the

floor.         Several    officers          were    on the          terraces      trying      to do this.             ins

be relentless,           and a free          space       behind those            on the floor was             only-

a c h i e v e d with great        difficulty            due    to the     crush of people.                 At this

time whilst          I was waiting           for    the man on the floor                   to be freed,           I was

aware     of    people    pushed        up against            the    fence.       At this time            they all

appeared        to be alive,          but    obv i o u s l y    distressed.

Eventually          the man was         freed,      and wit h anot h e r           officer        I pulled        him

returned and tried to help others                             out.     The whole          problem was         the

n a rrowness        of the   gate       through which               people      had to     pass - there were

time    could a c tu a l l y     stand       in the       gateway.

Whilst waiting           to try and          help,       I was aware            by now that         the    si t u a t i o n

FIRST ALL SEATER STADIUM IN THE LONDON AREA AS A RESULT OF THE
TAYLOR RECOMMENDATIONS

1.   You recently sought advice as to the advisability of a Home
Office Minister attending the ceremony arranged to mark the start
of construction work on a new all-seater stadium for Millwall
Football Club. The site of the new stadium at Senegal Fields is
close to the present ground at The Den, Cold Blow Lane, London
SE14. We understand that building work is due to start May/June
to be completed in readiness for the 1993/94 season.

2.   We have been aware of Millwall's plans to relocate to a new
purpose-built all-seater stadium for some time. The plans have
been widely reported by the media. The original plan was for the
new stadium to be able to accommodate 25,000 seated spectators
but high estimates for construction costs have led recently to
the club revising the capacity downwards to 20,000.
3.   The ceremony to mark the start of building work will attract
wide media coverage.    This would always have been the case as
this is the first new football ground to be built for a Football
League club in southern England for many years. The increasing
public debate about the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor
as regards the elimination of standing accommodation (by August
1994 for 1st and 2nd Division clubs; August 1999 for those in the
3rd and 4th Divisions) which were accepted by Government, will
ensure that the occasion receives even greater publicity. Some
clubs, many supporters and other interested parties are
questioning the need for clubs to go all-seated - especially
those clubs in the lower divisions.   The high costs threaten the
existence of some clubs , and the change of culture is unwelcome
to some fans (many of whom prefer to stand) who will have to pay
more.

4.   A briefing meeting with Lord Ferrers on 31 January discussed
the Taylor recommendations. The Minister stated that the policy
and deadlines should be defended robustly but in view of the
controversy which currently surrounds this issue, Ministers
should not be exposed unnecessarily to the media.
Therefore, while officials would welcome a public Ministerial
statement confirming the Government's determination to maintain
the policy on all-seated stadia, we would advise that only if
they are prepared to make such a pronouncement and to defend it
in the face of hostile questions, should they attend this or
similar functions.

5.   Should Ministers decide not to attend the Millwall ceremony
they are advised to indicate approval of the clubs plans and
efforts. Should this line be agreed I shall arrange with PRB for
the drafting of a suitable press release to be timed to coincide
with the ceremony.

6.   DES have been contacted. To date, the Minister for Sport
has not been approached to attend the Millwall celebrations.
Should such an approach be made, the Sport and Recreation
Division of the DES will tender advice similar to this to their
Minister's Private Office.

                            ambulanceman,         and am employed by S Y M A S .          I have wo rk ed for

                             them for       13 years.

                             On S at ur da y    15th April     1989 I was off duty and since                I am a

                             keen football        s upporter    I had the chance to go to

                            H i l l s b or o ug h S he f fi e ld to see the      cup semi-final      between

                            N ot ti n gh a m Forest and Liverpool.

                3.           I went    to the turnstiles          at the S pion Kop end of the              ground,

                             that would        be at about     1445.      At   the time    I went    in without

                             difficulty?        there were     no queues where         I was,    a lt ho u gh

                             further along        towards S he f fi e ld       people were waiting        to go        in.

                             I entered by the         turnstile 77/88,          and   inside was     orderly.           I

                            went     into    the kop and having         been told that there was                plenty
                                                                                            PAGE         2
                                                                                            S2538

          of    room at the       front,    I made my way down to a part,               s li ghtly

          off    centre and about a third of the way back from the                           front.

5.        The mat ch began on t ime a nd as far as                I could see there was

          no sign of trouble anywhere.

68        The m atch had not been            in progress       long,   when     play stopped.

          Soon after       that    the    players    began to    leave the f i e l d .        From

          where    I was    I could see at the opposite                end of the      pitch

          people were       beginning       to congregate       on the    playing field.

          A lot of    police were attending and then                   I saw an a mbulance

          just on the       pitch;       I saw    it go towards    the other         end.     On

          seeing    the amb ul an ce       on the    pitch I felt       that    there might         be

          some    trouble and,       because       of my training       that    I might      be

          able    to help.        I therefore went       to one of the gates and told

          a policeman there who             I was.


      *   He said

          had been
                     I might

                      injured.

                                         1 went
                                                                       end because

                                                   through the gate and trotted
                                                                                            people



          across    the    pitch.

          About    one third of the way down the                pitch I came across a

          casualty    lying       on the g r o u n d , being tended to by someone.

          The    patient    had stopped breathing and             I gave him the kiss               of

          life.     A doctor       came and       looked at the m a n.         The   doctor       said

          he was ^dead.

10.       I then went       to the       crowd and for the next hour or so                  I gave

          first aid treatment            to numerous      patients.       I helped to treat

          injuries    such as shoulder and             chest    injuries,       also several

          that had hyperventilation.

          I also    helped    to organise          people who wanted to help but                  did

          not know what       to do,       eg taking them off the          pitch to where

          the a mb ul an ce s were w a i t i n g .

          Slowly but       surely the       pitch cleared as the          casualties         were
                                                                                                        P AGE     3
                                                                                                        S 2538

                             being m oved away.          The s ituation eased and things          became

                             calm.     The    last    casualty    I helped was a Liverpool        man who

                             was    in shock.        I took him under       the stand and     left him with

                             the P o 1i ce and other       he 1 p e r s .

             '! -3 ,         I would    like to say that all            the Liverpool      supporters    I came

                             into    contact wit h and all         the p ol ic e I met were     doing all

             14.             The    police    put a line of men across          the   pitch and   I would

                             like to say this was a very good t h i n g , it prevented                  crowds

                             of people       coming across and treading          on us and the     injured

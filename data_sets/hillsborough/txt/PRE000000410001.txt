    We certainly haven’t lowered
our standards.
    Just our interest rates.
    This spring we’re offering a
finance package that’s clearly
                    to miss.




    You’ve got until the 5th of
June to order entrance doors,
patio doors, secondary windows,
replacement windows, cladding,
a porch or a conservatory.

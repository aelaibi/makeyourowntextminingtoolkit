            I am the above   person and I reside at the above address.                   I am a

            single man and I live with my parents.                I am a




            I am a Liverpool   supporter,     indeed I have been a supporter for many

           years.   I am a season ticket ho 1der and I am a member o f ^ H e a r t                    of

           England branch of the Liverpool Supporters Club.



           The Heart of England Supporters Club pick up fans on their coach in

           Nuneaton and on Saturday the        15th of April            1989 (150489),   I tr ave ll ed

            to the FA Cup semi-f i rial game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forrest

           at Hillsborough in Sheffield.
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             S2S26

On the bigger games the Supporters Club tend to use a large coach and

a mini   bus,   on that day I travelled in the mini         bus.



The mini bus travelled independently from the main coach,               it also

travelled earlier than the main coach.



I do not know the names of many of the supporters             in the club,   I tend

to know only first names or nicknames.           I tend to only know the faces

of most supporters.



I had a ticket for the North Sta                    ground and I sat in the

stand with a couple off the mini bus,         called          and                 I

don't know their second names.        Others from the mini bus and main bus

were sitting in the stand near to where I was sitting.              Others had

tickets for different     parts of the g r o u n d .



After the game was abandoned I left the ground and returned to the

mini   bus, we then all   returned home.      I was    not aware at this stage

that anyone from our Supporters Club had been killed at the match,

only on the afternoon of Monday        17th April      1989 (170489),   did I

realise that Carl and Nicholas HEWITT had been killed.              I. did not at

that stage know the lads names.         I d i d n ’t see the two lads at all on

the day,   they must have travelled to the game on the main coach.

Since the incident     I have seen photographs         in newspapers of the two

HEWITT brothers and I recognised them as being fellow members of the

Supporters Club.



I have completed a "Supporters Questionnaire" to describe my movement

and observations on the day.

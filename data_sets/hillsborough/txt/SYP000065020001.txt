    queue st ar ts to d i s i n t e g r a t e and a fu nne ll in g               type queuing         begins.

    I fo un d     it impossible           now to search fans as the                    pressure     on the     front

    two    fans en tering          the turnsxtiles         is too great.               Gone are     the

    re sp e c t a b l e   father/son,       m i d d l e \ a g e d me n and women.             Instead these are

     e p l a c e d by youths,        late teens,          early twenties.

      snute by mi nu te         the swell        of fans       increases as doNss the               pressure and

    the    cr H^ h i n g element.          By this time         I have m o v e d to the side t>f

    tur n s t i l e    12 to a v o i d    injury.      Se a r ch in g    fans    is now totally

    im po s s i b l e as well as          checking     tickets,         as the single queue               is now 4,

    5, 6 abreast.            The   noise      limit also        increases and            I find     it hard to

    pass on my orders to Li v e r p o o l              fans:      One,    to stop pushing an d               crushing

    people at the front,                 an d two,   to make sure          they have the            correct

    co l o u r e d ti ck et s for this          part of the ground.

    As far as          I can see,        fans are    ch oc~ a~b loc k      past the blue            swinging

q ,1505             I rejoin my serial                 at the mai n blue metal                gates a t the

on the      pitch.      I im m e d i a t e l y went to the       fence and helped f a n s who

them aw a y from the scene to a s a f e r /q ui et er                place.

pulping      fans up fronOfrhe t e rr ace s           below them.         It now became ap pa re nt

to me what        had happened.            I contin ued to help on the              pitch,    asking

people      how bad their          injuries were an d those who were                 not    injured and

who   could walk        to move a w a y from the scene              near to the fence,

as by now Po li ce were              carr yi ng    bodies out who ur ge n t l y required

t re at e m e n t and space was also              needed to      perf orm this treatment.

Ten to f i f t e en m i n u t e s     into the      incident,      I se ns ed fans becom ing aggr ess

tow ard s    the Police.           This    hadn't    been helped by the Notts For est                    fans

at the S p i o n Kop end who              had been     chanting and up set tin g the Li ve rpo ol

fans.       I saw Li v e r po o l     fans   climbing         on the goal     posts and then tearing

the   net ting     off.      The     t e n s i o n was getting     greater as fans bla med mys elf

an d other O f f i c e r s    for what       had happened.

I saw a fan kick a metal                  object    on the track        perimeter.         I could see

this was      one of the metal             tent    type   pegs    used to hold the          netting       to

the ground.          I qu ic k l y    picked this and ab out            th i r t y others    up as they

were about        six   inches       long and at one end they were ground to a                       point.

I did this be cause of the m e n t i o n e d growing                 te n s i o n on the     pitch an d

the   po ssible      circumstances.

I d e ci de d to take them to the                 pl^3ers'     tunnel    and as     I did this       I

saw the      corner flag at the W e s t / S o u t h S ta nd          corner uprooted.            I also

picked this        up as     it had a m^t^l          pointed base.

  FA/HILLSBOROURGH

 I spoke -to Julian Gibson-’tfal^f? who said that we ^ma^...get
 headlines tomorrow. The police officer who Graham Kelly
 spoke to in the polica control box had admitted he lied to
 Kelly* by saying the gats had been forced. He knew perfectly
 well that it had been opened at his instruction.

 i said that he should pick up fro$v1       1pigaon hole the
 FA's response to his fax,  It was not very encouraging.

  Ha asked if we could get a copy from the Independent
  Magazine for Sunday which gave Counsel to the Inquiry
f Mr Collins QC the information on the FSA angle. We should
  discuss wi’
            1:l trohn%Dys6h what best to do with the FA's
  position on this.

 Engaged 15 minutes including dictation

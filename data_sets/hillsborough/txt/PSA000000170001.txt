        Dear sir/Madam
        FLA CONSULTATION       PAPER.   NO   2   DRAFT    GUIDANCE        ON   SAFETY
        CERTIFICATES
        Under section 13 of the Football Spectators Act 1989, the
        Football Licensing Authority is charged with keeping under review
        the discharge by local authorities ("certifying authorities") of
        their safety certification functions under the Safety of Sports
        Grounds Act 1975 in relation to sports grounds at which
        designated football matches are played.        The FLA sees an
        important element of this role as being the promotion of best
        practice and the bringing about of greater consistency in safety
        certification.
        The FLA has decided not to issue a model safety certificate
        mainly because it is important that certifying authorities should
        fit the wording of the certificate           to the particular
        circumstances of the ground concerned. It is aware, however, of
        a number of model certificates, in particular those being
        prepared by the London District Surveyors' Association and by a
        Working party of the Local Authority Associations, which have
        helped inform its work.
        The FLA proposes instead to issue detailed guidelines to
        certifying authorities on the format and content of safety
        certificates and on the certification process. A draft of these
        guidelines is attached as FLA Consultation Paper No 2 on which
        comments are invited.
        All responses should please be sent to me at the above address
        by Friday 17 January 1992.
                                                     Yours faithfully

                   DRAFT GUIDANCE ON SAFETY CERTIFICATES


Introduction


(i)       This     guidance        note     is     designed        to   assist        local
        authorities            ("certifyingauthorities”)                  which        are
        responsible       for     the     issue    of     safety    certificates        to
        designated football grounds under the                      Safety of      Sports
        Grounds Act 1975 ("the 1975                Act") as amended by the Fire
        Safety and Safety of Places                 of Sport Act 1987.  The
        Football Licensing Authority                ("the FLA") is aware of
        considerable variations between safety certificates issued
        by certifying authorities.                      Its aim    is to bring about
        greater consistency and to promote best practice.


(ii)      This document covers both the format and contents of
        safety certificates and also the procedures for issuing and
        revising       them.      The   guidelines        supplement      but    do    not
        replace Home Office Circulars,                  the Home Office Guide to
        Safety at Sports Grounds ("The Green Guide") and the
        various information booklets issued by the Football Stadia
        Advisory Design Council (FSADC) to which reference should
        continue to be made for technical guidance.                     They should be
        read with the recommendations of the Hillsborough Stadium
        Disaster Final Report ("the Taylor Report") and those of
        the committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at
        Sports Grounds ("the Popplewell Report").


(iii)     These guidelines should not be regarded as statutory
        requirements to be imposed rigidly,                  irrespective of the
        circumstances at particular grounds.  They do not remove
        the discretion of certifying authorities to include such
        terms    and     conditions       as     they    consider       necessary       or
        expedient to secure reasonable safety at the ground to
       which the safety certificate applies.                  However, certifying
authorities should satisfy themselves that they can justify
each departure     from these guidelines        on    its    individual
merits, for example because of the smallness of the ground,
and should record their reasons for doing so.                    In such
cases,   the    local     FLA    Inspector      is    available        for
consultation.

  It will be noted that, in referring to the requirements
to be included in safety certificates, these guidelines use
either the word "may1' or "should” or "must".               "May" means
that the FLA considers the matter to be for the informed
discretion of the certifying authority in the light of
local needs,    "should" is to be understood as prescriptive
but not mandatory; variations will be acceptable if they
are shown to be justified.             "Must” should be regarded as
mandatory   save   in    the    most    exceptional       circumstances.
Certifying authorities should be aware that the FLA
reserves  the  right   to  exercise its power  under
Section 13(2) of the Football spectators Act 1989 to
require a certifying authority to include in a safety
certificate    such     terms   and    conditions    as    the   FLA   may
specify should it consider this necessary.
1.    CERTIFYING AUTHORITY PROCEDURES


Responsibilities of certifying authorities


1.1    Under the 1975 Act, the responsibility for determining
       what terms and conditions should be included in a safety
       certificate rests with the certifying authority.                      In
       exercising this responsibility, the certifying authority
       should be guided as appropriate by the Police, Fire
       Service, Ambulance Service and the Building Authority, as
       well as other bodies or individuals (including voluntary
       first     aid     organisations)     with    relevant       Skills    or
       experience.       The certifying authority should take into
       account the views of the football club and, where this
       can be determined, of representative supporters.


1.2   The FLA supports the recommendation in the Taylor Report
       (recommendation 31) that each certifying authority should
       maintain and chair a Safety Advisory Group which should
       include    representatives      of the      Police,    Fire    Service,
       Ambulance       Service   and   Building    Authority.         The   FLA
       recommends that the football club should participate in
       the discussions of the Safety Advisory Group before any
       decision    affecting      it   is   taken     by     the   certifying
       authority, where possible, representatives of supporters
       should be consulted.


1.3   In most circumstances the certifying authority should
       maintain a separate Advisory Group in respect of each
       designated football ground for which it is responsible.
       However, where there could be a substantial overlap of
       membership, it may be appropriate for one Advisory
       Committee to cover more than one ground provided that the
       attendance is adjusted according to which ground is under
       consideration,   and provided    that            each       ground   is
       considered on its individual merits.
L.4   In accordance with its standing orders, a certifying
       authority may delegate decisions relating to safety
      certificates to a committee or to particular officers of
      the    authority.     It   should      not delegate     its    decision
      taking functions to any outside body or authority.               While
      it may be acceptable for such functions to be vested in
      the officer who acts as chairman of the Safety Advisory
      Group, the group as such cannot exercise the certifying
      authority's decision making powers.           (These points do not
      apply    to   operational    policing     matters      which   are   the
      responsibility      of the     Chief    Officer   of    Police   -   see
      paragraph 6.5 below.)

1.5   Given that the administrative structure varies from one
       certifying authority to another, the FLA takes no view as
       to which should be the most appropriate Department for
       safety certification provided that this can be shown to
       have related responsibilities.   This Department should
       work closely with others with an interest.


The certification process

1.6    The safety certificate should be issued to the club as a
       whole rather than to a named individual within the club.
       In the event that any entity other than the club                     is
       responsible for the safety and repair of the structure of
       the    ground,   it may be necessary        to   issue the      safety
       certificate      jointly to    such entity together with the
       club.

1.7    The task of the certifying authority does not end with
        the issue of the safety certificate.   As reguired by
       Section 10B of the 1975 Act,            every safety certificate
       should be reviewed at least once a year.                In order that
       this may be undertaken satisfactorily, the certifying
       authority must monitor the club's observance of the terms
       and conditions of the safety certificate, in particular
on match days.       The certifying authority must ensure, by
means     of    periodic    inspections,         that    the   terms   and
conditions       remain    appropriate      in    the     light   of   any
developments at the football ground.                While the Police,
Fire Service, Ambulance Service and Building Authority
will need to monitor the club's performance on matters
which concern them, the overall responsibility remains
with the certifying authority.           This task is not part of
the functions of the FLA,


While changes in the safety certificate should be
determined by the certifying authority, in many cases
these will be in response to improvements or alterations
to structures or procedures proposed by the certificate
holder.        Paragraph 2 .1 .d below requires any changes of
circumstance to be notified to the certifying authority
in writing within a given period.                It follows that the
certifying authority must respond to any application in
a reasonable time.


The FLA considers that a safety certificate should be
replaced, with such amendments as may be necessary, every
12 months, preferably not during the football season.
Accordingly, any safety certificate more than 12 months
old should be replaced at the next                  annual review or
during    the     next    close   season.         (The    form    of   the
certificate is discussed further in ns-ranraphs 2 .1- 2.5
below .)
2.    THE SAFETY CERTIFICATE


Format of the certificate


2.1     The FLA recommends that all safety certificates should be
        issued in modular form. It advises that a modular safety
        certificate should comprise a short covering document
        stating that this is a safety certificate issued by the
       certifying authority concerned under the Safety of Sports
       Grounds Act 1975. This cover sheet should:


           a.   identify the holder of the safety certificate who
                is responsible for complying with it;


           b.   specify in general terms the activities (for
                example sport, concerts and public meetings)
                covered by the safety certificate;


           c.   require compliance with the terms and conditions
                of the safety certificate;


           d.   require   the    holder    to   notify   any    change    of
                circumstances to the certifying authority in
                writing within a specified period (see also
                paragraph 9 -6 below); and


           e.   state   that    the   safety    certificate     does     not
                invalidate      any   statutory    obligation    upon    the
                holder.


2.2     It is recommended that this covering document should be
        backed by the core section of the safety certificate
        which should comprise a general statement of the duties
        laid upon the certificate holder.   These duties should
        then be spelt out in such detail as is necessary in a
        series of schedules,   each schedule relating to a
        particular topic.       Sections    3-15   of these     guidelines
       cover the various matters which the FLA considers should
       each be the subject of a general duty supplemented by a
       separate schedule.            These proposals are summarised in
       Annex A .


2.3    Certifying authorities may consider                      it appropriate to
       include two further schedules: one of definitions, the
       other specifying what ancillary activities, for example
       the        sale   of    tickets,          programmes,       souvenirs     and
       refreshments, the provision of incidental entertainment,
       the provision of news or comment or other unspecified
       activities notified to and approved by the certifying
       authority are covered by the certificate.


2.4    It is essential that a safety certificate is both easy to
       follow and complete within itself.                       Thus the detailed
       requirements of the safety certificate should be set out
       in the certificate itself and not in other documents.
       Except On operational policing matters                      (see paragraph
       6.5), general provisions to the effect that tasks must be
       undertaken        to    the   satisfaction          of     the   certifying
       authority; the Chief Officer of Police, the Chief Fire
       Officer or any other person,      should be avoided.
       Statements of intent or any other documents referred to
       in the safety certificate should be kept with it at all
       times.


Amendments to the certificate


2.5    It    is    inappropriate     for     a    safety   certificate      to    be
      amended by means of the minutes of a Safety Advisory
      Group or any other meeting.                  All amendments should be
      notified formally to the certificate holder by the
      certifying authority in writing. With a modular safety
      certificate,        it   should    be possible        to    attach   to    the
      written notice a suitably amended replacement page or
      schedule.          Using modern word processing               equipment     it


                                        10
should not be difficult to store the text of a safety
certificate in such a manner that it can be retrieved,
amended and reissued.

One     of   the    main     advantages      of   a   modular    safety
certificate arises when it is due for replacement.                   At
this stage,        it should be sufficient for the certifying
authority to issue a new covering document, a replacement
schedule     of work to       be   done     (see paragraph 9.7)      and
replacements        for   any schedules      being    amended.     These
could be integrated with the unamended schedules to the
earlier safety certificate in a loose leaf folder.                    To
avoid    confusion,        pages   should    be   numbered   and    each
amendment page should be suitably identified.
3.    RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAFETY


The person responsible


3•l    The     safety       certificate        should      make        it    clear       that
       responsibility for the safety of spectators lies with the
       certificate holder (ie the club) and not with the police
       or    certifying        authority.          The     core    section         of    the
       certificate          must    require      the     club     to        designate     an
       individual       in     a   position      of      authority          who   will    be
       responsible for its safety policy and its implementation.
       This person must be required to appoint and set out in
       writing the duties of a safety officer (who may be him or
       herself) to take day to day responsibility for safety
       matters.


3.2    The core section of the safety certificate should lay
       upon the holder a general duty to take such precautions
       as    might     be    necessary     for     the    reasonable          safety      of
       spectators. This should include an obligation to produce
       a     written        statement     of     safety        policy.            Further
       requirements (see below) should be set out in a schedule
       to the safety certificate.                  (For the responsibility of
       the safety certificate holder for tests and records see
       Sections 14 and 15 below.)


Contingency plans


3*3    The   safety     certificate holder             should be        charged with
       producing        contingency        plans         for      emergencies,            in
       conjunction with            the   Police,      Fire     Service,        Ambulance
       Service,      local     authorities       and      others       as     necessary.
       These      should        cover      all        reasonably             foreseeable
       contingencies up to and including the need for a total or
       partial evacuation of the ground,                  in such plans specific
       tasks should be assigned to named individuals or their
      nominated deputies.            Copies of contingency plans should
      be required to be kept readily available.                        Appropriate
      extracts from plans and/or emergency instructions should
      be provided to those assigned tasks under the plans.
      Certifying authorities may wish to prescribe what safety
      instructions      and/or        ground        rules     should     be    kept
      prominently  displayed  and  where.     (For  various
      requirements on the contents of contingency plans see
      paragraphs 3.7. 5.11. 8.9. 10.5, 11.14,— 12_._4_t— 12. 6,— 12 -.9
      and 13.2 below.)

3.4   The safety certificate should spell out the criteria for
      the club to inform the Police, Fire Service, Ambulance
      Service and certifying authority of forthcoming events,
      in particular the period of notice that should be given
      for various types of event.                   It should       lay upon the
      certificate holder a requirement to consult the police
      and other emergency services about the arrangements for
      individual     events,     in    particular           about   whether    they
      should be made all ticket (see also paragraph 4.7 below) .


control and communications

3.5   The safety certificate should lay down how the safety
      officer is to be identified and contacted while
       spectators are in the ground (when he or she should have
       no other duties)        and his or her post in an emergency
       which   should    normally       be     in    the     control    room    (see
       paragraph 6.10 below).

3.6    The certificate should specify the location of emergency
       telephones (including any direct lines to the emergency
       services).       This   should be either a room permanently
       staffed by the club and in direct communication with the
       control room or the control room itself.      Where the
       control and enunciator panel for automatic and manual
       fire alarm systems is located in an area that is not
       staffed during a match, the certificate should require
      there to be a repeater board in the same location as the
      emergency telephones.


3.7   The club should be required to provide and maintain a
      public address system to a prescribed specification (set
      out in an appendix to the safety certificate) capable of
      being heard in all parts of the ground, including when
      necessary the playing area.               This should be capable of
      being    overridden     from       the    police      control     room    (see
      paragraph     6.10     below).            The     certificate         holder's
      contingency plans should cover the eventuality of a power
      failure affecting the public address system.


3.8   The certifying authority may wish to prescribe standard
      emergency announcements to staff and/or stewards and the
      public in the safety certificate.                 The wording of these,
      and the circumstances in which they should be used should
      be set out in an appendix to the safety certificate.
      Where    appropriate     it    may       wish   to      specify   means     of
      communication    between       the       safety      officer    and    others
      having    a   safety     role       during        the    match.          Where
      appropriate, this could be supplemented by a requirement
      to provide loud hailers for senior stewards.

4.     SPECTATORS


WinnViP’T-s and disposition

4.1     The safety certificate must prescribe                          the maximum
         capacity ofthe football ground and of                         each of its
         constituent          parts.      The    core      section    of   the    safety
         certificate should impose two general duties upon the
         certificate holder, namely:

            a.      to ensure that the capacities specified in the
                    related schedule are not exceeded; and


            jj,     to        ensure     that     the       various    measures       for
                    controlling crowds prescribed in the schedule are
                    observed.

4.2     This schedule should record the maximum permitted total
         capacity        of    the     ground.        It    should contain    a   table
         setting out the maximum permitted capacity of each stand
         or enclosure within the ground.        These should be
         calculated in accordance with the requirements of the
         Green Guide and then be reduced if necessary to reflect
         local    circumstances.                These      calculations      should    be
         recorded        in writing as should any departure from the
         Green    Guide.             Reasons     for       reduced capacities      could
          include the number and capacity of exit routes and gates
          (see paragraph 7.2 below), structural or design defects
          (see paragraph 9.8 below), inadequate maintenance or a
          lack of suitable procedures for handling spectators but
          not a policy decision by the certifying authority to
          require        the    conversion       of     standing accommodation         to
          seating.        (This is for the FLA to implement through the
          licensing scheme.)

 4.3      Where  appropriate, the table should indicate the
          categories of spectators to be accommodated in a
       particular area.            Any accommodation set aside for the
       disabled should be            identified.        These    allocations    of
       accommodation should be  set out  in the  general
       description of the ground attached to the safety
       certificate (see paragraph 9.5 below).


4.4    The FLA considers it desirable that the segregation of
       home    and    away    fans     should     be    phased    out   wherever
       possible.      It is accepted, however, that this cannot yet
       be achieved for all matches at all football grounds.
       Accordingly, the certificate holder should be required to
       provide, where necessary, for the segregation of home and
       away supporters.  These arrangements should be set down
       in writing after having been agreed with the police (see
       paragraph 6.7 below).


4.5    The safety certificate should specify the location of any
       press and media facilities other than reporters 1 seats in
       the stand. Such facilities might include television and
       radio commentary points, camera gantries and the location
       of   outside    broadcast vans.            It    should   lay    down,   if
       appropriate, means for identifying journalists and others
       authorised by the club to have access to the public or
       playing areas of the ground.

Entry of spectators


4.6   The certificate holder should be placed under a duty to
       issue no more tickets (including season tickets) for, and
      admit no m o r e spectators to, any area than is specified
      in    the     table.     This     should     be    supplemented      by    a
      requirement to monitor the number of spectators entering
      each section of the ground.    The formulation of this
      requirement may depend upon the capacity of the ground
      and     the    number   of     entrances.         Where    this    can    be
      justified, certifying authorities may wish to require the
a •
J            installation, and prescribe the method of operation, of
             an electronic spectator counting system.


      4.7    Where a match has been made all ticket (see paragraph 3,4
             above), the safety certificate may require the holder not
             to admit spectators who have not bought tickets before
             the day.

      4.8    The safety certificate should record, by reference to an
             attached plan (see paragraph 9.5 below), the location of
             each turnstile or entrance point and the area to which it
             gives access.     (For the parallel requirement for exit
             points see paragraph 7.2 below.)       Each turnstile should
             be required to be clearly identified.

      4.9    It should be specified in the safety certificate that all
             tickets should indicate which entrance is to be used. In
             the case of larger grounds, the certifying authority may
             wish to require tickets for different          areas to be of
             different colours - to match coloured signs displayed at
             the appropriate entrances. A requirement that the ticket
             bear an outline plan of the ground may be appropriate.
             The safety certificate should provide for the retained
             ticket stub to contain sufficient information to guide
             spectators to their places once inside the ground.


      4.10   All entrances both to the ground and to each seated or
              standing area and any routes to them should be marked in
              a manner that can be understood by spectators who are
              unfamiliar   with   the    ground*    Where    necessary   the
              certifying     authority     should   lay     down   detailed
              requirements in the safety certificate.       (For exit signs
              see paragraph 7.6 below.)




                                         17
5.    STEWARDING


Provision of stewards


5.1    In the core section of the safety certificate the holder
       should be placed under a duty to provide stewards in the
       number, to the specifications, and for the purposes
       detailed in the related schedule.                   These stewards could
       either be directly employed by the club or provided by a
       specialist undertaking or a combination of the two.
       Whatever their source, the club will remain responsible
       for their performance and conduct.


5.2    The certificate holder should be required to designate a
       chief steward.         He or she should appoint a deputy and
       senior   stewards       as    necessary       to    supervise     groups      of
       stewards    in    particular         parts     of    the    ground.          The
       certificate      holder       should    be    required     to    maintain      a
       register of stewards in which should be recorded their
       attendance and post as well as their training and
       qualifications         (see     paragraphs          5.11-5.12     and       15.4
       below).


5.3    The   certifying       authority       may    specify      the   number      of
       stewards    to    be    provided        and    where    they      should     be
       stationed in as much detail as, in consultation with the
       club and the police, it considers necessary.                          In doing
       so, certifying authorities should be alert to the need to
       encourage clubs to maximise the number and effectiveness
       of their stewards in order that the police presence may
       be reduced to a minimum.                Thus where a club has yet
       sufficiently      to    develop        its    stewarding,        it   may    be
       necessary to specify the number of posts to be filled
       either by stewards or police officers without specifying
       the number of stewards (see also paragraph 6.2 below).




                                       IS
a •
      s.4   Once a club is capable of providing all its own stewards
            and     relies      on    the    police       merely       for    public       order
            functions,  it should be possible for the safety
            certificate to list both the posts to be staffed and the
            number or, more likely, the minimum number of stewards to
            be provided.             Except in the case of stewards staffing
            turnstiles, exit gates or other fixed posts, the number
            required could be related to the anticipated crowd size
             and/or the category of match as determined by the police
             in consultation with the club (see paragraph 6.7 below).


      Tasks of stewards

      5.5   The safety certificate should prescribe in general terms
             the tasks of stewards.                While these may vary slightly
             from      ground to      ground,      the       stewards
                                                          basic    duties      of
             should be to enforce the club's safety policy and ground
             regulations. Specific duties would include:


                  a.     controlling        or    directing        spectators        who     are
                         entering or leaving the ground to help achieve an
                         even flow of people in, to and from the viewing
                         areas;


                  b.     monitoring crowd conditions so as to ensure the
                         safe    dispersal■ of           spectators      on    terraces       or
                         viewing        slopes          and      the     prevention           of
                         overcrowding;


                  c.     patrolling         the        ground    to     deal     with        any
                         emergencies,        raising the alarm and taking the
                         necessary immediate action;


                  d.     staffing      entrances,        exits    and other         strategic
                         points, especially exit gates and doors which are
                         not continuously open while the ground is in use;

          e.     searching spectators (under ground regulations
                 properly drawn to their attention);
                                                                                   t
          f.     assisting the police as appropriate to ensure the
                 safety and control         of members
                 before, during and after an event; and
                                                           of the public,          I
          g.     undertaking specific duties in the event of an
                 emergency or as directed by the safety officer.

5.6    The safety certificate should require the deployment of
       a steward on the perimeter track in front of each self-
      contained standing enclosure or area.    His or her sole
      duty should be to check crowd conditions in that area for
      possible overcrowding or distress throughout the period
      that the area is occupied by spectators.           This
      requirement need not apply to any enclosure or standing
                                                                                   I
      area where the spectators present, or reasonably expected
      to be present, during a particular match do not exceed
      one-third of the area1s permitted maximum capacity or
      2 ,000, whichever is the lower.

5.7   The safety certificate must state explicitly that every
      exit     from   the   ground    and   every   gate   in    any   pitch
      perimeter fence or any radial fence, unless secured in
      the open position (see paragraph 7.3 below), must be
      permanently staffed by a steward while spectators are in
      the ground (see also paragraph 8.8 below).                The steward
      should be charged with watching the gate and spectators
      near it at all times.   A steward in charge of a pitch
      perimeter gate is not there to watch the match.

5.3   Stewards staffing exits or gates must remain by them at
      all times unless relieved by a colleague or a police
      officer.    Stewards manning other posts may not leave them
                                                                                   £

                                                                                   I
                                     20
       steward, except in accordance with established emergency
       procedures.


qualifications of stewards


5.9    The safety certificate should specify that all stewards
       should be fit, active and robust and capable of carrying
       out their duties.               They should be aged at least 18 and
       normally be no older than 55, though a higher age limit
       could       be     acceptable         for   particular       posts      at    the
       discretion of the certifying authority.


5.10   stewards should be required to be neatly dressed with a
       clearly      visible        means     of    identification,       such       as   a
       brightly         coloured        surcoat    or    tabard.        This     should
       identify         the   function       performed      by    its   wearer,      for
       example by the use of different colours or designs for
       senior       stewards           and   stewards      performing       different
       functions.         For turnstile operators, a suitable badge or
       identification label might be sufficient.


5.11   It should be a requirement of the safety certificate that
       no steward, whether directly employed or supplied by an
       agency,          should    be     deployed       unaccompanied      without       a
       preliminary period of training both in his or her duties
       and   in     safety       procedures,       including     fire   safety       (see
       paragraph 11.3 below)- All crowd control stewards should
       be given training in basic first aid.                     Refresher training
       should be provided at regular intervals to be determined
       by    the    certifying           authority      having    regard    to      local
       circumstances.             In addition,          in consultation with the
       emergency services, the certifying authority may require
       the     carrying          out    of   evacuation      exercises      or      other
       emergency drills (see paragraph 3.3 above).        Where
       schemes for stewards to obtain formal qualifications are
       available or in force, certifying authorities may require
       all stewards to be duly qualified before they take up post.
The certificate holder should be required to ensure that
every steward is briefed about his or her duties before
every match.    This briefing should cover both general
responsibilities and duties in the event of an emergency.
Each steward should be issued with, should be familiar
with, and should carry at all times a copy of the safety
instructions applicable to his or her post.     This should
include   an   outline   plan   of   the   football   ground
identifying the various areas.       Instructions should be
laid down governing assistance to, or the evacuation of,
disabled spectators.
Division of responsibility

6.1    The core section of the safety certificate should impose
       upon    the     certificate    holder    a   general   obligation     to
       comply with the requirements on policing set out in the
       related schedule*          This should supplement the statement
       in the core        document that the         certificate holder is
       responsible        for   the  safety          of  spectators   (see
       paragraph 3.1 above).          The task of the police should be
       to maintain public order and to prevent the commission of
       offences.


6.2   The schedule to the certificate should require the club
       to discuss with the police the division of responsibility
       between club and police.     Among the matters covered
       should be whether particular posts are to be staffed by
       stewards or police officers (see paragraph 5*3 above).


6.3   The     safety    certificate      should require    the    outcome   of
       these discussions,         including any areas of disagreement,
       to be recorded in a statement of intent; this should be
       held with the safety certificate               (see para erraph 2 . 4 ) .
       This statement of intent should be a management statement
       not a legal document.


6.4   Also for discussion should be any circumstances under
       which the police, because of their greater experience or
       better communications, should be able to take over
       operational control, for example of a major incident,
       even if no public order considerations arise.  There
       should be an agreed procedure,     written into the
       contingency       plans,    for    the   senior   police   officer    to
       notify the safety officer that the police are assuming
       control and that all club staff and stewards should act
       as directed by the police.
order


The schedule to the safety certificate should lay upon
the holder a duty to comply with the requirements of the
Chief Officer of Police or his representative in respect
of the attendance and deployment of however many police
officers he or she considers necessary for ensuring the
orderly     behaviour    of    spectators.    This   being    an
operational police matter, the decision as to the number
of officers used should be entirely for the police and
not for the certifying authority (see paragraph 1.4
above) .


For the same reasons the certificate holder should be
required to comply with any operational instruction from
the senior police officer present that may be necessary
for the preservation of public order or, after notice has
been given as set out in paragraph 6.3 above,          for any
other reason.     Such instructions could include delaying
the start of the match, halting play or evacuating part
or all of the ground.


As    indicated above,   the   certificate holder    should be
required to discuss with the      police,      recording the
outcome in writing, arrangements for:


     a.   the   ticketing   and  other   arrangements        for
           particular events <paragraph 3.4\;


     b.   the   arrangements     for    the   segregation    of
          spectators at particular matches (Paragraph 4.4);


     c.   the categorisation of matches as high, medium or
          low risk (paragraph 5.41; and also


     d.   the    operational control of any perimeter        or
           radial fences (see paragraph 8.6 below).
6.8    The safety certificate should impose requirements that
       drinks or other refreshments should be sold in soft
       materials such as paper or soft plastics; Exceptions
       could be made, where appropriate, in the light of local
       circumstances,    for example for restaurants or private
       boxes.    Restrictions on bringing glass or                           metal
       containers into the ground could be imposed                           where
       appropriate.


6.9    Certifying     authorities       may,      where    necessary,        after
       consulting the emergency services and the football club,
       impose restrictions on parking on club premises in order
       to provide unimpeded access or for other reasonable
       purposes.  Any restrictions should be spelt out in as
       much detail as practicable in the safety certificate.


Command and control facilities


6.10   The    certificate     holder        should    be   required     in     the
       certificate to provide a control room which should:


             a,   have a good view of the whole pitch and of the
                  spectator area surrounding it;


             b.   accommodate         the      necessary       communications
                  equipment     and    CCTV       monitors    and   the      staff
                  required for their operation or supervision; and


             c*   be able to serve as a command post in the event
                  of an emergency.


6.11   The certifying authority may lay down requirements as to
       the appointment of the control room, for instance sound
       proofing,     heating     and        furnishing.       The   certifying
       authority should ensure that all such requirements are
       reasonably       necessary           and      proper    given         local
       circumstances.


                                       25
6.12   Unless this can be shown to be unnecessary in view of the
       layout and capacity of the football ground, the safety
       certificate      should    require         the     installation       and
       maintenance of CCTV        (together with an emergency power
       supply    -   see paragraph        10.8   below)   to monitor       crowd
       densities and the safety of spectators both in viewing
       areas and in passageways and exits.                  The requirement
       should be set out in detail in an appendix to the safety
       certificate.     Responsibility for determining the level of
       provision for spectator safety,             and for ensuring that
       this     is   reasonable   and       necessary,     rests    with    the
       certifying authority which should take into account the
       views    of   the   police,        expressed     through    the   Safety
       Advisory Group, and guidance issued by the Home Office.




                                     26
7.    EXIT ROUTES AND GATES


General requirements

7.1     The core section of the safety certificate must lay upon
        the certificate holder a general duty to ensure that all
        means of ingress and egress are maintained in good repair
        and    condition     and    unobstructed.         Further     detailed
        requirements should be set out in a related schedule.


7.2    This schedule should record the location of each exit
        point,   including emergency exits,           by reference        to an
        attached plan (see paragraph 9.5 below) .                 it should be
        made clear which areas are served by which exit points.
        (This requirement parallels that for entrance points -
        see paragraph 4.8 above.) The certificate should specify
        the    required     width    of   each     exit   gate     and,   where
        appropriate, that of gangways or passageways.               The number
        and capacity of exit routes              and gates   is one of the
        factors that must be taken into account in determining
        the permitted capacity of the football ground and its
        various enclosures (see paragraph 4.2 above).


Exit gates

7-3    The    certificate    should require that          every    exit point
        listed should be available for use in an emergency at any
        time when the part of the ground which it serves (or from
        which spectators may gain access to it) is in use.                   If
        not secured in the open position, every such exit point
        should be continually staffed by a steward at all times
        when spectators are in the ground.                (This requirement
        could be relaxed,          at the discretion of the certifying
        authority,   in respect of doors opened by means of push
        bars provided that these are otherwise unlocked.)                   The
        steward should be responsible for opening the gate
       immediately    in    an   emergency.     A   record   of    any   such
       occurrences should be kept.


7.4   Notwithstanding this, while spectators are in the               ground
       any door or gate forming part of an exit route must be
       prohibited from being locked or fastened unless it can
       easily and immediately be opened in an outwards direction
       without the use of a key in an emergency.          Electronically
       controlled gates should not be kept in the fully locked
       position while spectators are in the ground. Sliding or
       inward opening doors or gates are not acceptable.


7.5   The safety certificate should require all exit doors and
       gates to be secured in the fully open position at a given
       time shortly before the end of the match.             There should
       be arrangements for spectators who wish to leave before
       this time to be directed to appropriate exit points which
       can   be   controlled     so   as   to prevent   other     spectators
       gaining unauthorised entry.           Such exit points should be
       clearly marked on the ground plan             (see paragraph 7.2
       above).


7.6    As with entrances (see paragraph 4.10 above) all exits
       and   exit routes should be marked in a manner that can be
       understood by       spectators who     are unfamiliar with        the
       ground.    The certifying authority should prescribe
       whatever signs it considers necessary for this purpose.
       These should be placed so that they are visible without
       causing any obstruction.        The certifying authority should
       require the removal of any misleading signs.


Gangways and passageways


7.7    In addition to the general duty set out in paragraph 7.1
      above, a requirement should be laid upon the certificate
      holder in the schedule to ensure that all exit routes,
      gangways, stairways and access points for emergency
vehicles are kept free of obstructions, including stores,
litter, ice and snow, at all times when the ground is in
use by spectators. Furthermore, no temporary structures
should be permitted in such areas*               (For further detailed
requirements as to litter see paragraph 11.10 below.)


The certificate should require all gangways and stairways
to be kept clear of spectators.                  Gangways on terraces
should     be    painted    in   a     conspicuous     colour;    stepped
gangways        in   seating     areas     should     have   conspicuous
nosings.

All   steps      and   stairways       should    be    required    to   be
maintained with even and non slip surfaces and should be
adequately       drained.        Any     stair   coverings    should    be
secured and maintained so as not to cause any hazard to
people using the stairs.  Every enclosed or partly
enclosed staircase or corridor should be of fire
resistant construction.              (For further fire precautions
see paragraphs 11.4— 11.10 below.)
8.    PERIMETER AND RADIAL FENCES


General principles


8.1     The FLA regards perimeter and radial fencing to segregate
        spectators    as undesirable           in principle.            It    accepts,
       however, that such fences may have to be maintained as a
       necessary      evil   in      some     parts     of     some   grounds,        in
       particular those with large standing areas and/or poor
       stewarding,     for     the     time    being.         Fencing     should      be
       installed or retained only where a positive need for it
       can be shown.


8.2    Final     responsibility        for    determining       whether       fencing
       should be required at a ground                   should rest with the
       certifying     authority,        acting    upon       the   advice      of    the
       Safety Advisory Group            (see paragraph l .2 above).                  The
       need for fencing        (in particular in front of or around
       seated areas and family enclosures) should be Kept under
       regular review.


8.3    Where   fencing is installed,            it is preferable that                it
       should be of such a design that it can be removed
       whenever it is not required. The maximum height of any
       fence and the minimum width of any gate or opening should
       be   as     specified      in    the     Green        Guide.          Under   no
       circumstances should any fence have an overhang or be
       topped with spikes or barbed wire.


Safety precautions


8.4    The core section of the safety certificate covering a
       ground where there is perimeter and/or radial fencing
       should lay upon the certificate holder a general duty to
       maintain it and supervise its use in such a way that
       spectators are not put at risk.                Certifying authorities
       could combine     this     general       requirement        with      those   on
entry    and   exit    routes      (see paragraph           7.1    above ) , on
structural       safety     (see    paragraph 9.1           below)       and     on
electrical      and mechanical        safety         (see   paragraph          10.1
below)    into    two     general     requirements.               First,       the
certificate holder should ensure that all the buildings,
structures       and      installations         referred          to     in    the
certificate are maintained in such condition that they
fulfil safely their required functions.                       Secondly, the
certificate holder should control their use in such a
manner that spectators are not put at risk.                       Each set of
detailed       requirements        should       be    set     out        in    the
appropr iate schedule.


As with entrances and exits (see paragraphs 4.8 and 7.2
above), the location of all perimeter and radial fences
and of every gate in each fence should be shown on the
attached plan.


As   indicated     in paragraph       6.7    above,         the   certificate
holder should be required to discuss with the police the
arrangements      for the       control     of perimeter           and      radial
fences while spectators are in the ground because of the
public    order    implications.          The    conclusions           of     these
discussions should be set down in the statement of intent
to be kept with the safety certificate (see paragraph 6.3
above). These conclusions should not override the safety
requirements       which    remain    the       responsibility           of     the
safety certificate holder (see paragraph 3.1 above) and
not of the police.


The safety certificate should require every gate in a
perimeter or radial fence to be painted in a distinctive
colour and to be identified as an emergency exit.                             Under
no   circumstances        should    exit    through         these      gates     be
impeded by advertising boards or other obstruction.                            Each
gate should be marked with its number, to a specified
size and design, which should correspond with the number
marked on the plan.             This number should be visible from
both sides of the gate whether it be open or closed.


All pitch perimeter gates should be required to be kept
unlocked whenever the area of the ground behind them is
occupied     by    spectators*          Unless   the    police    direct
otherwise on public order grounds, they should be left
open.    The same requirement should apply to gates in all
radial    fences.          As   indicated   in paragraph    5.7 above,
every    gate     in   a    perimeter   or    radial    fence    must   be
permanently staffed by a steward while spectators are in
the ground.


The     safety    certificate        should   specify    what    cutting
equipment should be provided by the certificate holder to
permit the        immediate removal         of perimeter    fencing     in
order to release any trapped spectators.                The location of
this equipment, the identity and location of the staff
trained to use it and the procedures for directing them
to the right place when needed should be required to be
included in the certificate holder’s contingency plans
(see paragraph 3.3 above).
9.    STRUCTURAL SAFETY


Maintenance and repairs

9.1     The certificate holder should be placed under a general
        duty (set out in the core section of the safety
        certificate)     to     ensure    that    all    the    buildings       and
        structures in the ground are maintained in such condition
        that they safely fulfil their required                  function.       As
        indicated in paragraph 8.4 above, this core requirement
        could be combined with those on entry and exit routes,
        perimeter     and     lateral     fencing       and    electrical       and
        mechanical     safety     (see    paragraphs 7.1.        8.4     and   10.1
        respectively).

9.2    The related schedule on structural safety should list the
        various buildings and structures covered by the safety
        certificate     for    example     stands,      terraces,       structural
        staircases     and    walkways,     floodlight        towers,     external
        walls   and gates,      internal walls,         perimeter       or   radial
        fences, crush barriers and hand rails on staircases.                    The
        certificate holder        should be required           to   ensure that
        these   are provided      and maintained         in accordance with
        current British Standards and/or codes of practice and in
        accordance with any test certificate or other proof of
        adequacy supplied to the certifying authority prior to
        the issue of the safety certificate.


9.3    These provisions should be supplemented by the testing
        and certification requirements set out in Sections 14 and
        15 of these guidelines.          The certificate holder should be
        required to ensure that all glass in doors, windows,
        partitions and fittings in areas accessible to spectators
        should be maintained in a sound and proper condition.
        Other   requirements       in    like    vein   may    be   inserted     by
        certifying authorities as required.
9.4   The certificate should require the holder to take all
      reasonable          precautions             to     prevent        litter,           debris,
      building         materials             and        potential          missiles             from
      accumulating in the ground.                       Any such materials should be
      required       to    be    removed           as    soon    as     possible.               (For
      detailed       requirements             in        respect       of    gangways             and
      passageways, machine and plant rooms, and store rooms see
      paragraphs 7.7. 10.6 and 11.10 respectively.)


9.5   The    buildings          and     structures             listed      in       the    safety
      certificate should be shown in the attached plan or plans
      (see paragraphs 4.8 and 7.2 above).                         (For requirements to
      show    fire     detection            and    fire       fighting      equipment            see
      paragraph 11.13 below.)                      Such plan or plans should be
      architects'         drawings          of sufficient          scale        for       all    the
      features       listed      to     be    identifiable.                They      should       be
      accompanied          by    a     brief       general       description              of     the
      structures of the football ground.                         This should include,
      where appropriate, the categories of spectator for which
      particular areas are set aside (see paragraph 4.3 above).


9.6   Paragraph 2.1.d above indicated that the covering note to
      the    safety       certificate         should          lay upon      the       holder       a
      general duty to notify any changes of circumstance to the
      certifying          authority          in    writing       within         a     specified
      period.     This should be supplemented by a requirement
      that no alteration or addition should be made to the
      structure or fittings of the football ground,                                       whether
      temporarily or permanently, without the prior consent in
      writing     of       the       certifying authority.                      Since           this
      provision        should         apply         to heating, lighting                   and
      ventilation          as        well     as        to     buildings            and     other
      installations,            it    should       be        cross-referenced             in     the
      schedule on electrical                       and mechanical            safety   (see
      paragraph 10.3  below).                        Notice   of            any   proposed
      alterations,         accompanied              by full       details ,and,             where
      appropriate, plans or drawings,                         should be given to the


                                             34                                                        E
                                                                                                       E
      certifying authority              in writing.    As indicated in
      paragraph 1.8 above,              the certifying authority should
      respond in a reasonable time.               Certifying authorities may
      wish   to    make     it     clear       that    these     requirements           are
      additional to,        and not a substitute for,                       requirements
      under building or planning legislation.


9.7   The schedule to the safety certificate should lay a duty
      upon the certificate holder to carry out to the required
      standard any repairs or maintenance deemed necessary by
      the    certifying          authority       to     ensure        the     safety     of
      spectators.        This should apply both to requirements set
      out    in a separate         schedule to the              replacement         safety
      certificate         (see     paragraph          3 -6    above)        and    to   any
      necessary and proper requirements notified to the holder
      in writing by the certifying authority at any other time.
      The holder should be required to comply with any written
      requirement     from        the    certifying          authority       as to      time
      scale or any written instruction to close the appropriate
      area    of   the     ground       pending        completion        of       the   work
      specified.           In      attaching          any      such     requirements,
      certifying authorities, save in cases of imminent danger,
      should consult the Safety Advisory Group, give as much
      notice as possible and prescribe reasonable time scales
      and restrictions.


Standing and seating

9,8    As indicated in paragraph 4 ■2 above, the certifying
       authority should take structural or design defects into
       account in determining the capacity of any standing area.
       If it considers spectator safety to be at risk it may
       require particular areas to be closed unless or until the
       necessary     remedial           work    has      been    undertaken.              In
       determining       the     adequacy of          a design,        the    certifying
       authority should be guided by the Green Guide and other
       published standards, including those produced by the
       Football Stadia Advisory Design Council, but should apply
       these with discretion.           Thus small departures from the
       dimensions recommended in the Green Guide (for example in
       the     height    of    crush   barriers)       can   be    tolerated    in
       existing structures          if they do not           imperil   spectator
       safety.     Each departure from the standards laid down in
       the Green Guide should be capable of being justified on
       its individual merit with the reasons being recorded in
       writing.


9.9    The same general principles should apply to seating as to
       standing areas.   Thus the safety certificate should
       charge the holder with ensuring that all seating is
       securely fixed, that seats are suitably numbered and that
       damaged seats are promptly repaired or replaced.                   While
       the design and layout of the seating is primarily for the
       certificate holder, the certifying authority may require
       such remedial work as it considers necessary to ensure
       spectator safety.           It may direct the certificate holder
       to take out of use any seat or area of seating which, in
       its opinion,       constitutes a hazard, unless or until the
       necessary improvements are effected.

Temporary structures


9.10   No distinction should be drawn on safety grounds between
       permanent       and temporary structures          or fittings.          The
       requirement laid upon the certificate holder to seek the
       consent    of    the   certifying     authority       for   any proposed
       alteration or addition to the structures or fittings of
       the ground (see paragraph 9.6 above) should be echoed by
       a   similar      requirement    in    respect    of   the   erection     or
       installation of any temporary structures or fittings.
       These could range from temporary stands to portacabins,
       sales     kiosks       or   stalls,     marquees       or    substantial
       decorative arrangements.             The requirements should cover
       advertising boards which should not impede exit on to the
pitch   in an emergency     (see paragraph     8.7    above); nor
should they restrict spectators' view.


The safety certificate should require that all temporary
structures   should    be   designed     and     constructed     in
accordance with current British Standards and Codes of
Practice.     They    should   not     present    a     danger   to
spectators, should not obstruct any entry or exit route
and should, as far as practicable, be protected against
misuse by spectators,       An authorised competent person
should be responsible for their erection,             safe use and
eventual removal.     Certifying authorities may prescribe
additional fire precautions in respect of such structures
(see paragraph 11.5 below).
10.    ELECTRICAL AND MECHANICAL SAFETY


General safety requirements


10.1    The core section of the safety certificate should place
        the     certificate         holder        under     a duty          to    maintain    and
        operate all electrical and mechanical installations to
        such standards and in such a manner that they safely
        fulfil         their    required          functions.            As        indicated     in
        paragraph        8.4    above,          this    core     requirement          could    be
        combined with those on entry and exit routes, perimeter
        and      radial         fencing          and      structural              safety      (see
        paragraphs 7.1, 8.4 and 9.1 above respectively).


10.2    The schedule on electrical and mechanical safety should
        elaborate        this       general        duty     by    requiring           that     (as
        specified         in        the      Green        Guide)            all      electrical
        installations, including temporary installations, should
        be      maintained          in      accordance           with        all      statutory
        Regulations        and      with        the    Regulations           for     Electrical
        Installations published by the Institution of Electrical
        Engineers.             In     like        manner,        all     lifts,       boilers,
        generators        and       other       plant     should       be        maintained    in
        accordance        with       the     appropriate          published          standards
        and/or manufacturers' instructions.                            These requirements
        should be further supplemented by the detailed provisions
        set out below.


10.3    As indicated in paragraph 9.6 above, no alteration should
        be     made,    whether       temporarily          or    permanently,           to    the
        heating,        lighting      or    ventilation          of     any part        of    the
        ground to which spectators have access without the prior
        consent of the certifying authority.                            The location and
        protection        of     cabling          for     temporary              installations
        (including television cameras) should require the prior
        agreement of the certifying authority.                                   The erection,
        use,     disconnection            and     dismantling          of    all     temporary


                                             38
installations must be supervised by a competent person
approved by the certifying authority.

The certificate holder should be required to ensure that,
so   far   as     is    practicable,   all    electric     cables   and
conductors       should    be    inaccessible    to   spectators    and
enclosed in a suitable protective covering.                  Wherever
possible, all controls, including light switches, should
be in areas to which spectators do not have access.


The safety certificate should require the certificate
holder     to    take    the    necessary    precautions    against   a
mechanical or electrical failure when spectators are in
the ground.       The requirements should be tailored to local
circumstances; for example, a qualified electrician may
be required to be present whenever floodlights are in use
or whenever exit routes are illuminated by artificial
lighting        (see paragraph 10.7 below).           The certificate
should require that this electrician should have ready
access to the necessary circuit diagrams, which should be
required to be kept or displayed in a prescribed suitable
location.         The identity of the staff concerned and a
description of their functions should be required to be
included in the certificate holder's contingency plans
(see paragraph 3.3 above).


The certificate holder should be required to ensure that
there is unimpeded access to all boiler, generator, plant
and lift motor rooms and all other areas with electrical
or mechanical installations, both for routine maintenance
and in emergencies.             All such rooms or areas, together
with all electrical intakes,            should be required to be
kept free of stores, goods, litter or other obstructions.
(For restrictions  on the    storage of  combustible,
flammable or corrosive materials see paragraphs 11.8-
11.10 below.)
Lighting and ventilation

10.7    The certificate holder should be required to ensure that
         artificial lighting of a sufficient standard is provided
        in every stairway, gangway, passageway and corridor or
        any area to which spectators or staff have access to
        enable them to leave the football ground safely.                       This
        should be switched on in any place and at any time where
        the level of day light is inadequate save when the ground
        or the area concerned is empty.


10.8    There should be a requirement to provide and maintain, to
        the appropriate British Standard, emergency lighting for
        use   in   the    event    of a       failure   of   either    the normal
        artificial       lighting       or    the    main    electricity     supply
        (including       the   floodlights          illuminating      the   playing
        area).     The specifications for this emergency lighting
        and its power source should be laid down in an appendix
        in    as much     detail    as       reasonably practicable.          (This
        emergency power source should also be sufficient to power
        the public address system (see paragraph 3■7 above), the
        CCTV (see paragraph 6.12 above), the fire alarms, the
        turnstile monitors, and the facilities in the control
        room and the first aid room.


10.9    In addition, the certificate holder should be required to
        ensure that any mechanical ventilation should be kept
        running    whenever       the    area       concerned   is    occupied   by
        spectators or (during a match) by staff.


10-10   Any gas fittings should be required to be provided and
        maintained       in accordance with current             legislation and
        industry requirements.




                                         40
11-    FIRE SAFETY


Responsibilities of certificate holder


11.1     The core section of the safety certificate must lay upon
         the certificate holder an explicit duty to take all
         practicable         precautions      to     prevent      the    outbreak        and
         spread    of    fire while         spectators      are     in    the       football
         ground.    Alongside this should be a duty to take whatever
         measures       are    practicable          to   ensure     the        safety     of
         spectators      should       a    fire     break   out-          Requirements
         amplifying these general duties should be laid down by
         the certifying authority,                 acting on the advice of the
         Safety    Advisory         Group ,   in    particular      the       Chief     Fire
         Officer,       in    one     or    more     schedules      to        the     safety
         certificate.         Since any fire certificate issued by a Fire
         Authority held by a club does not apply to parts of the
         ground when they are being occupied by spectators,                              the
         certifying authority may need to repeat some of the fire
         certificate requirements in the safety certificate.


11.2     While the general scope of these detailed requirements
         should be common to all safety certificates, there may
         need to be considerable variation in points of detail.
         Specific requirements should be tied to the needs,                               in
         particular      the    physical       structure,      of       the    individual
         football ground-            However, such requirements should not
         be regarded as the limit of the obligation placed upon
         the certificate holder.               It is impossible to prescribe
         requirements         for     every   possible       eventuality             without
         excessive rigidity.              Accordingly, the certificate should
         make it explicit that the general duty on the certificate
         holder includes and is not limited by the specific.


11.3     At grounds with a higher than average fire risk,                                for
         example those with wooden stands, the safety certificate
       may require the holder to deploy additional stewards with
       fire safety responsibilities (see paragraph 5.10 above).


Structures and fittings


11.4   The  safety certificate or the attached plan(s) (see
       paragraph 9.5 above) should indicate clearly what fire
       resistance requirements are laid down by the certifying
       authority.     For example, as indicated in paragraph 7.9
       above,     every enclosed or partly enclosed staircase or
       corridor that may have to be used by staff or spectators
       in    an   emergency    should     be    required      to    be    of    fire
       resistant    construction.         All wall,        floor and       ceiling
       materials in such areas should be of a type approved by
       the    certifying     authority     and      should    not    be    changed
       without     its prior     consent       in writing.          Similarly no
       curtains, hangings, carpets, upholstery, decorations or
       artificial foliage should be installed in areas to which
       spectators     have     access     during      a    match     unless      the
       materials     concerned    are     of    a   type     approved      by   the
       certifying authority.


11.5   The   certifying authority may prescribe                in the      safety
       certificate such requirements as it considers necessary
       to increase the fire resistance of existing structures,
       including     wooden     stands.          Where       appropriate,       the
       certifying authority may require the installation of fire
       doors which must be self closing at all times.                    Such fire
       doors should be shown on the plan attached to the safety
       certificate. As indicated in paragraph 9.10 above, no
       distinction should be drawn between permanent and
       temporary structures.


11.6   In areas that are particularly vulnerable to fire,                        in
       particular     wooden      stands,        enclosed      staircases        or
       corridors and temporary structures such as marquees, the
       certifying authority may require smoking to be prohibited
       on safety grounds.          In such cases the safety certificate
       should require the           display of prominent          "no    smoking"
       signs to an approved design,                possibly supplemented by
       public    address        announcements.          Stewards      should      be
       required to refuse to admit or to eject spectators who
       are smoking.


11.7   In appropriate cases, the certifying authority may lay
       down requirements in respect of the design, materials and
       maintenance of kitchens or food preparation areas.                      These
       could include requirements to ensure that extract duct
       work, cookers and heated cabinets shall be kept clean and
       that all electrical items shall be maintained in a safe
       condition.        (For requirements as to hazardous products
       and fire extinguishers see below.)


Hazardous products


11.8   The safety certificate must provide that no explosive,
       highly flammable or highly combustible materials may be
       stored at the ground without the written consent of the
       certifying authority             and in accordance with          statutory
       requirements.             This     restriction     should        apply     in
       particular to cylinders for the                storage of compressed
       air,   oxygen,     hydrogen or other gases or liquids under
       pressure and to any petroleum products.                   All hazardous
       materials,        including       fertilizers,     weed       killers     and
       paints,       should be stored in a suitable fire resistant
       room     or     storage     area    approved     by     the     certifying
       authority.        The location of all such stores should be
       shown on the plan attached to the safety certificate (see
       paragraph 9.5 above).


11.9   The safety certificate may lay down detailed requirements
       governing the use of liquified petroleum gas                      (LPG)   and
       carbon        dioxide     (002)    in   accordance      with      statutory
       requirements       and     local    need.       These     could     include
        requirements limiting the number of spare cylinders that                          I
        may be held locally and specifying how these shall be
        protected.      Requirements for any tubing or hosing to be
        suitably armoured may be imposed.
                                                                                          I
11.10   The   safety certificate should require that                      all    store
        rooms should be maintained in a clean and tidy condition
        and free of litter and unauthorised combustible material.
        Doors to all such store rooms should be kept locked shut
        while    spectators      are   in     the    ground.         (For    similar
        requirements in respect of gangways and passageways and
        of machine and plant rooms see paragraphs 7.7 and 10.6
        above respectively.)           A    specific provision            should be
        inserted where the ground has a wooden stand with a void
        underneath; this should be required to be kept free of
                                                                                          I)
        litter and debris.        Collected litter and waste material
        should    be   stored,     pending        disposal,     in    a     location
        approved by the certifying authority.             Where appropriate,
        the   safety    certificate         should    require    litter         to   be
        removed as soon as possible during an event.


Alarms and equipment


11.11   The safety certificate should set out, in precise detail,
                                                                                          I
        the specifications and location of all manually operated
        fire alarm points or automatic fire detectors and any
                                                                                          Jj
        emergency telephones.          The required level of provision                    |<
        should   be    determined      by   the     certifying       authority       in
        consultation with the Fire Authority and in the light of
        any statutory requirements.               Where it is necessary to                »
        have a zoned automatic fire detection system, each zone
        should be small enough to be searched in a very short
        time.  As indicated in paragraph 3.6 above, the safety
        certificate should specify the location of control panels                         Jj
        for all alarms and detectors.

                                                                                          I
11.12   The safety certificate should prescribe the type and
        location of all first aid fire fighting equipment and
        fixed fire fighting installations.                All extinguishers and
        hose       reels   must     comply     with   and    be    maintained        in
        accordance with current British Standards.                  Extinguishers
        should be required to be sited in conspicuous positions
        at   an     appropriate       height.      They     must    not     cause    an
        obstruction.        Instructions for using fire extinguishers
        and hose reels should be displayed on or adjacent to the
        equipment in a form prescribed in the safety certificate.


11.13   The location of all fire fighting equipment,                        together
        with that of fire alarms, smoke detectors and emergency
        telephones,        should be recorded on one or more detailed
        plans       attached        to   the     safety      certificate            (see
        paragraph 9.5 above).                These plans should           incorporate
        standard symbols            for features      extinguishers and         other
        devices.      A key to the symbols used should be attached to
        the plans.


Procedures


11.14   As     indicated       in     paragraphs      3.3    and     5.11      above,
        responsibility for procedures and for the training of
        stewards and staff to observe them rests with the holder
        of the safety certificate.               Procedures for sounding the
        alarm and for tackling fires must be set down in writing
        in the contingency plans (see paragraph 3.3 above) after
        having been approved by the certifying authority*


11.15   These procedures,            which    stewards    and     staff    should be
        trained to observe, should include:


             a.      the action to be taken on discovering a fire;


             to.     the method of calling the fire brigade;
           c-   the   method    of   operating    fire        alarms    and   the
                procedures to be followed;


           d.   operation of the internal emergency telephones;


           e.   the correct use of fire fighting equipment?


           f.   the marshalling of spectators and evacuation of
                the ground; and


           g.   the   maintenance       of     escape        routes    free   of
                obstruction.


11.16   Where the ground has an automatic fire detector system
        and it has been agreed by the certifying authority that,
        in the event of an alarm being sounded, a check of the
        area will be made before deciding whether it should be
        evacuated, the procedures and time scales permitted for
        any search should be defined in the certificate and a
        record of all alarms required to be kept.


11.17   The safety certificate should require all stewards and
        staff to be familiar with the positions                  of emergency
        telephones,   fire     alarm    call    points,        fire     fighting
        equipment, assembly points, escape routes and fire doors.
        Appropriate extracts from emergency instructions should
        be required to be carried by all stewards; copies should
        be required to be displayed in locations, not normally
        visible by    spectators,      determined       by    the     certifying
        authority.
12.    FIRST AID AND MEDICAL MATTERS


Introduction


12.1    The core section of the safety certificate should lay
        upon the certificate holder a general duty to provide
         first aid and medical staff, equipment,                  facilities and
         accommodation       as    specified     in   the    related    schedule.
         While   the   topics       covered by    this      schedule    should   be
         common to all safety certificates, the precise level of
         provision will be determined by the capacity and likely
         crowd size at the ground concerned.


12.2    In laying down its detailed requirements, the certifying
         authority should consult the Ambulance Service in the
         context of the safety Advisory Group (see paragraph 1.2
         above).


First aid facilities


12.3     The   safety certificate should require the                   certificate
         holder to provide a first aid room of a suitable size (to
         be determined by the certifying authority).                   This should
         be readily accessible to staff and spectators (including
         stretcher-borne casualties) from all parts of the ground
         as well as to ambulances.            Its location should be clearly
         signposted as specified by the certifying authority.


12.4     At larger football grounds,             depending on the size and
         location of the first aid room, one or more further or
         auxiliary first aid rooms or posts might appropriately be
         required.     In         addition,     the    certificate         holder's
         contingency     plans       (see     paragraph     3.3   above)     should
         identify one or more areas which can promptly be made
         available for the treatment of casualties in the event of
         a   large   scale    incident,       together with procedures           for
         bringing this area into use.
12.5   All first aid rooms should be required to be adequately
       furnished,     lit,      ventilated,      heated and disinfected              in
       accordance with requirements laid down by the certifying
       authority.        All surfaces should be capable of being kept
       clean and the certificate holder should be required to
       ensure     that     appropriate        standards        of     hygiene       are
       maintained.        Suitable facilities for washing and for the
       disposal of waste should be required.                        All first aid
       facilities     should be        designated      as no        smoking      areas.
       They     should    be    equipped    with   a     first      aid   pack,     the
       contents of which should be laid down as an appendix to
       the schedule by the certifying authority.                     Similarly the
       safety certificate should prescribe what equipment and
       drugs should be held by,             or on behalf            of,   the crowd
       doctor (see paragraph 12.8 below).


12.6   First aid rooms should have direct communications with
       the    club   safety      officer    and    the     control        room     (see
       paragraph 3.6 above).   Procedures for contacting the
       emergency services and details of local hospitals with
       accident and emergency departments should be included in
       the certificate holder's contingency plans and displayed
       in the first aid room (see paragraph 3.3 above).


Personnel


12.7   The safety certificate should require the certificate
       holder to provide a specified number of suitably trained
       first aid personnel for each event covered by the safety
       certificate.        This number should be determined by the
       certifying authority according to local need but should
       be minimum of one per 1,000 anticipated spectators or
       three,    whichever       is the greater.          These      first aiders
       should have no other function to perform.                      Their number
       should not include stewards trained in basic first aid
       (see paragraph          5.11   above) .     For   the     purpose of        the
       safety certificate, suitably trained should be defined as

a     12.8
              Society standard Certificate in First Aid.


              The safety certificate should require the certificate
              holder to arrange the presence frost one hour before the
              match until half an hour after it of a doctor trained in
              accident    and    emergency         care   (the    "crowd         doctor")     to
              provide medical care to spectators.                  The location of the
              crowd doctor should be known at all times to the senxor
              first aid and ambulance staff, the club safety officer
              and the senior police officer present, in order that they
              may contact him or her at any time.                       The crowd doctor
              should be provided with an identifying surcoat or tabard.


      12.9    When the number of            spectators expected to be present is
              small (say under 2,000) the certificate holder may be
              permitted to have a doctor trained in accident and
              emergency are on call.               This doctor must be capable of
              being on the scene within a maximum of ten minutes. This
              doctor, at the discretion of the certifying authority,
              may be the football club's team doctor, provided that he
              or   she   is    suitably      qualified.          The    arrangements         for
              calling in the crowd doctor should be set out in the
              certificate holder's contingency plans (see paragraph. 3.3
              above); copies          of     the     appropriate        extract         should be
              provided to senior            first aid and ambulance staff and be
              kept   to hand         in the    control     room        (see paragraph 3.6
               above).

      12.10    The safety certificate should prescribe the number of
               ambulances      which       should    be   present       at       the    football
               ground, depending upon the size of the anticipated crowd.
               Ambulances      may    be     provided     either       by    the       statutory
               ambulance service or, with the approval of the Ambulance
               Authority,       by      a     voluntary      body           or         commercial
               organisation.

12.11   The     detailed   requirements   of    the   safety   certificate   I
        should encompass not merely the number of ambulances but
        where they should be stationed, where the ambulance staff
        should be deployed (ie with their vehicles) and the means
        of    communicating between the        ambulances   and the club
        safety officer, control room, crowd doctor and first aid
        room.

13.    AMENITIES FOR SPECTATORS


General principles


13.1    Issues     relating      to      the   provision           of    amenities       for
         spectators    have        not    been        seen    as       having    a   safety
         dimension    and     have       not   tended        to    feature      in   safety
         certificates.       This Section distinguishes between amenity
         issues which are safety related and which may properly be
         covered in safety certificates and those which fall to
         the FLA to tackle in its licences under the provisions of
         the Football Spectators Act 1989.


13.2    As   indicated        in      paragraph         4.2       above,        certifying
         authorities       may   restrict        standing         capacity      on   safety
         grounds     but     should      not     do     so    solely       in    order     to
         accelerate    the       introduction          of     seating      in    the     area
         concerned.        Somewhat similar considerations apply to the
         provision of facilities for disabled spectators.                                The
         safety certificate           should not be used to require the
         provision of such facilities except on safety grounds
         (though they may be required under other provisions).
         However,     when       such      facilities             are    provided,        the
         certifying authority should use the safety certificate to
         require them to be so designed and maintained that they
         are suitable and safe for their designated purpose.                             This
         requirement   should   extend  beyond   the   facilities
         themselves to encompass suitably located toilets for the
         disabled, entrance and exit routes and arrangements for
         the safe evacuation of the disabled.                           These should be
         covered in the certificate holder's                           contingency plans
         (see paragraph 3.3 above).


13.3    Issues     relating      to    the     provision          of    facilities       for
         visiting supporters should be dealt with in like manner.
         While it is wrong for there to be discrimination against
         visiting supporters, this is a matter for the FLA and not
       the safety certificate, except in so far as safety issues
       may arise.


Lavatories


13.4   The FLA is satisfied that issues relating to the number
       and condition of lavatories at football grounds have a
       sufficient       safety   dimension        to      warrant     inclusion      in
       safety     certificates.         A    lack      of     adequate    facilities
       encourages spectators to urinate in inappropriate places
       which can be both a safety and a public health hazard.
       Furthermore,       inadequate         or   insufficient           facilities,
       particularly if badly sited, can lead to congestion or
       blocking of exits, gangways or passageways.


13.5   Certifying       authorities      should        lay     down   two    sets    of
       requirements in safety certificates, either in a separate
       schedule or in that on structural safety (see Section 9
       above). First, the certificate holder should be required
       to maintain all lavatories and urinals, together with the
       associated washing facilities which should be provided,
       in a clean and hygienic condition                      (in accordance with
       general public health requirements). All such facilities
       should be required to be adequately drained,                          lit and
       ventilated.


13.6   Secondly,    certificate       holders         should     be   required       to
       provide     inside    the    ground        a      sufficient      number      of
       lavatories and/or urinals in locations readily accessible
       to spectators.       Given that use of the lavatories will be
       concentrated during certain limited periods, the number
       required should be determined on the same basis as for
       theatres    or    other   such       places       of   entertainment.          A
       sufficient number of lavatories should be included for
       female spectators.        Each distinct section of the ground,
       including any area set aside for visiting supporters,
       should    have   unimpeded     access        to      sufficient      male    and


                                    52
       female lavatories.         These should be sited so that any
       queues   will    not    block   entrances,           exits,    gangways       or
       passageways.


Catering

13.7   On catering, the issues that fall within the scope of the
       safety   certificate       arise    mainly       in    relation        to    the
       surroundings     rather     than    to    the    product.            Thus,    as
       indicated in paragraphs 6.8,             7.7.    9.10 and 11.7 above
       respectively,          certifying        authorities           may      impose
       requirements on drinks containers,                   on keeping gangways
       clear and   litter free, on the safety                  of structures and
       fittings,   and on fire safety.             There is also a safety
       dimension of a kind to food preparation and service but
       this is probably more appropriately tackled under normal
       environmental      health       legislation            and      procedures.
       Similarly, any bars serving alcohol would be covered by
       the general licensing law.


13.8   Decisions   as    to      the quantity,      range       and    quality        of
       refreshments to be provided are essentially a matter for
       the   football    clubs    concerned.           While    these       may     have
       significant impact on spectators'                enjoyment,          and hence
       their mood, the link with safety is too tenuous for them
       to fall within the purview of the safety certificate.
       The same is true of the commercial    arrangements for
       providing   refreshments        (whether        by    the     football       club
       itself, by contract or by franchise).
14.    INSPECTIONS AND TESTS


The need for inspections and tests


14.1     inspections and tests, along with the keeping of records
         (see Section 15 below), are an essential part of the
         safety   certification        process.          They    ensure       that    the
         safety requirements of the certifying authority (as set
         out in Sections 3-13 above) are not merely stated but are
        complied with continuously.               The FLA considers that these
        mechanisms       are     so    important         that    they       should     be
        prescribed in detail in separate sections of the safety
        certificate so that there is no danger of their being
         lost to sight among other details.


14.2    The core section of the safety certificate should lay
        upon    the certificate holder              a duty      to    carry    out    and
        record    the     results       of    the       inspections         and    tests
        prescribed in the related schedule.                      All the required
         inspections and tests, even if referred to elsewhere in
        the    safety    certificate,        should       be    set    out    in     this
         schedule.      If necessary, they should be cross referenced
        to other parts of the safety certificate.


14.3    The core section should require inspections and tests to
        be carried out at least as frequently as specified by the
        certifying authority in the schedule.                        All such tests
        should    be    carried       out    by    a    suitably       qualified       or
        competent person.


14.4    The    inspections and tests required will                     vary to some
        extent between         football grounds,          depending upon their
        design    and    structure.          The       lists    in    the    following
        paragraphs      should not be regarded as either exact or
        comprehensive.         Broadly speaking, every matter covered by
        the safety certificate should be subject to inspection
        and testing.        Where British Standards,                  manufacturers'


                                        54
       instructions or comparable trade standards for testing
       exist, these should be followed.


Match-related checks

14,5   The following should be required to be inspected or
       tested (and any necessary remedial action taken) before
       every event to which spectators are admitted:


          a.    the general fabric of the ground, in particular
                terraces,     seats and crush barriers, for signs of
                damage,       corrosion     or      deformation         (see
                paragraphs 7.9r 9.2 and 9.8-9.9) ;


          b.    all gangways, passageways and exit routes, for
                obstructions,, damaged or malfunctioning fire
                doors, hazards under foot, missing or damaged
                signs or other impediments to their safe use (see
                paragraphs 7.7-7.8 and 11.5) ;


          c.    all    exit   doors   and gates     (including those       in
                perimeter or radial fences) whether manually               or
                electronically operated           and the      equipment   for
                cutting the perimeter fence in an emergency (see
                paragraphs 7.1. 7.3, 8.4 and 8.9);


          d.    all turnstiles and entry monitoring devices (see
                paragraphs 4.6 and 7.1);


          e.    all areas to which spectators have               access,   for
                litter, debris, building materials or potential
                missiles (see paragraph 9.4);


           f.   all voids beneath wooden stands, all kitchens and
                food    preparation     areas      and   all    other   areas
                particularly vulnerable to fire, for combustible
                materials or other hazards (see paragraph 11.10) ;
          g.   all machine and plant rooms and all store rooms,
                for    litter,     waste       or     unauthorised      hazardous
               products (see paragraphs 10.6 and 11.8-11.10);


          h.   each generator, all artificial lighting expected
               to     be   used    during       the    event,    all    emergency
                lighting     and    any       mechanical    ventilation      (see
               paragraphs 10.7-10.9);


          j.   all communication systems,                including emergency
               telephones, public address systems, portable
               radios and loud hailers and all CCTV equipment
                (see paragraphs 3.6-3.8 and 6.12);


          k.   the     operation         of     all     fire     alarms      (see
               paragraph 11.11);


          1.   that the required fire fighting equipment is in
               position       and         available        for         use   (see
               paragraph 11.12);


          m.   first aid rooms and the equipment and supplies
               held there (see paragraphs 12.5-12.61; and


          n.   all toilets and urinals for damage, blockages and
               lack of paper etc (see paragraph 13.5).


14.6   In addition the certificate holder should be required to
       check that stewards are briefed,                equipped, dressed and
       deployed as specified in the safety certificate and that
       the necessary first aiders and crowd doctor are present
       and in post    (see paragraphs 5.3.    5.10.  5-12 and
       12.7-12.8) .


14.7   The various checks for damage,               debris and litter        (see
       paragraphs 14.5a. b. e. f and n ) should be required to be



                                    56                                              I
                                                                                    I
       repeated as soon as practicable after each occasion on
       which spectators have been admitted to the ground.


professional inspections

14.S   Xn addition to the inspections and tests set out above,
       which should be carried out by the certificate holder's
       staff, various other inspections need to be carried out,
       albeit at less frequent intervals, by suitably qualified
       professionals or technicians in accordance with British
       Standards     or   equivalent        trade    standards.            These
       inspections and tests should cover, among other things:


          a.   all generators (to the frequency required in the
               appropriate British Standard);


          b.   all    fire   extinguishers          and   hose     reels      (in
               accordance with British Standards);


          c.   any passenger lifts or escalators                 (every three
               months);


          d.   all     emergency     lighting        generators      and     any
               lighting batteries (every six months);


          e.   any     electronic      locking       systems       (every    six
               months);


          f.   any     perimeter       or     radial      fences     and      all
               balustrades and handrails (annually);


          g.   the detailed condition of all standing surfaces,
               seats, stairs, ramps, doors and gates (including
               their      posts)    and     boundary      or     other      walls
               accessible to the public (annually);
           h.   all boilers, calorifiers and related plant or
                 machinery (annually);


           j.   all    fire   alarms     and   fire    detection     equipment
                 (annually     -   not    be   confused       with   the    test
                mentioned in paragraph 14.5i above);


           k.   all public address and CCTV systems (annually);


           1.   a 25% representative sample of crush barriers and
                other    structural       crowd       control    barriers     in
                accordance with the procedures and requirements
                laid down in the Green Guide, which it may be
                appropriate to repeat in               an   appendix   to    the
                schedule (annually); and


           m.   all electrical installations (every five years).


14.9    In addition,    the safety certificate should require the
        carrying out of a structural appraisal of the fabric of
        the ground every 12 months.


14.10   The certifying authority may also, on the advice of the
        Safety Advisory Group, require the certificate holder to
        test his or her contingency plans, including a partial or
        total evacuation of the           ground      as    appropriate     (see
        paragraph 5.11 above).




                                   58
15.    RECORDS TO BE KEPT


The need for records


15.1    As stated in paragraph 14.1 above,                        the maintenance of
         full      records        is     an     essential       part   of       the    safety
         certification process.                 The quality of a club's records
         is, along with that of its written statement of safety
         policy (see paragraph 3,2 above ) , a strong indication of
         the importance that safety is given within the club's
         culture.         The core section of the safety certificate must
         require the certificate holder to maintain, and to make
         available          for    inspection        as     required,       the       records
         specified in the related schedule.                       As with inspections
         and tests, it is important that all the requirements to
         maintain records should be drawn together into a single
         schedule for ease of reference,


15.2    These records fall into two groups:


              a.     those maintained by the                    club   on   a    continuing
                     basis; and


              b.     records           or     certificates        submitted           to    the
                         certifying authority at periodic intervals.


15.3    As with the lists in Section 14, the lists in the
         following paragraphs of records to be kept should not be
         regarded          as     exact       or   comprehensive.                Certifying
         authorities will need to add to them or                            (more rarely)
         make        deletions           from      them      according           to        local
         circumstances.


Internal records


15.4    Full records should be required to be kept for six years
         of        all      the        inspections        and     tests         listed        in
paragraphs 14.5.      14.7    and   14.8a-c   above   (which   are
accordingly not repeated here).           In addition, the safety
certificate   should require        the   certificate holder    to
maintain records of the following:


   a.   the number of spectators admitted to the football
        ground and to each area of the ground on each
        occasion (see paragraph 4.21;


   b.   any accident or incident causing injury             (other
        than a play injury) while spectators are in the
        ground;


   c.   all   first    aid    or    medical   treatment   provided
        during, or in connection with, any event to which
        the public are admitted;


   d.   the names, posts and duties of each steward on
        duty on each occasion (see paragraph 5.21;


   e.   the pre-match briefings and all training given to
        stewards (see paragraphs 5.2 and 5.12);


  f.    the numbers and posts of all first aiders present
        on each occasion and the attendance of the crowd
        doctor (see paragraphs 12.7-12.8);


  g.    all emergency drills or evacuation exercises (see
        paragraphs 5.11 and 14.101;


  h.    any non-routine opening of any exit door or gate
        (see paragraph 7.31;


  j.    any assumption of overall control by the police
        (see paragraph 6.41;




                             60
         k.      any defects relating to the safety of the
                 football gxound, whether coming to light during
                 testing       or    inspection        or   at    any    other    time,
                 together with the remedial action taken;


          1.     all maintenance work and improvements carried out
                  at    the    football       ground     (except work          relating
                  solely to the playing surface); and


         m.       all     alarms         sounded    by      the    automatic          fire
                  detection system (see paragraph 11.16).


15.5   All these records should be required to be kept fully up
       to date in a tamper-proof form.                   They should be kept in
       specified        places      at    the    club's     offices       or    ground,
       normally all together, along with a copy of the safety
       certificate and its related documentation. They should
       be readily available for inspection by representatives of
       the certifying authority or the FLA.


Submissions to the certifying authority


15.6   The     safety    certificate          holder     should    be     required      to
       submit     to    the     certifying        authority       such    documentary
       evidence as that authority deems necessary to demonstrate
       that the ground is in a safe condition, that the required
       major    inspections         have been carried out                and that any
       defects have        been remedied.              The various        reports      and
       certificates           should     be     prepared     or    agreed        by    the
       qualified professional or technician who has undertaken
       the inspection concerned.                  Unless otherwise specified,
       these     certificates          should normally be          required to          be
       submitted every 12 months.


15.7   Subject     to    the     caveats        in paragraph      15,3     above,      the
       following returns to the certifying authority should be
       required under the terms of the safety certificate:
a certificate showing the design,                  loading and
factors of safety in respect of all the
structures listed in the safety certificate (see
paragraph 9.2 above)         to certify that they are
capable of fulfilling their function;


a   certificate          stating     that     the     required
structural       appraisal    of     the     fabric     of     the
football ground         (see paragraph 14.9 above)             has
been carried out); this should be accompanied by
a report showing what maintenance and/or remedial
work is required and/or planned; and


certificates of inspection relating to the lifts;
electronic locking systems; emergency lighting

without           any     difficulty,                 because            the       queues       were      quite       orderly.            I

han ded my          ticket           in at          the       turnstile            and     was      handed       back       the    stub.

there       was    s till         plenty          of    room,       and you           could walk             around          if y o u

wanted       to.        There         wa s     no      surge       in P e n s    A     and       4,    the     area         was       j am

kick-off          time       I noticed              t ha t    fans      /n the         area       behind          the       goal       were

I also       saw a trickle                   of     people         trying        to    get       over       the    front          fence.

There       were       Police         on the           pitch       side     of    the       fencing,           initially               pushing

them    back and             preventing                them     climbing          over,          they       were       treating              the

incident          as    a    pitch          invasion,          but      because            I had       been       in t h e s e         pens a n d

realised          it was          cr o w d e d ,       I knew       that     it w a s n ' t           any    invasion.                 I had

sometime,          say a b o u t         five      minutes.            There         was        a    lot       of    confusion                behind

the      goal     on the        part       of    the    Police.              Some      had          now     started            to    help

people       e sc a p e ,    whilst          others         thought          it w a s       a       pitch       invasion.                 At       the

back,       lots     of     p eo p l e     were       being        lifted       up     into          the S t a n d .            At a b o u t

this      po int     I noticed a Police                       Officer         run o n t o            the       pitch,          speak          to    the

referee,          and     the     g a me     was      halted and             the     players              were       taken          off       the

pit ch.         There       was      no a u d i b l e       public        announcement                    at    this       p o in t       as       to

what     was      happening.               There       wa s    an    electronic                 score          board       which          I

remembered           was     advertising               holidays           ’P a r i s    £66.00 and Bruges                            £49.00,'

and      I thought          t hi s     could       have       been     exploited                as a m e a n s            of

communication with                     the      crowd,        telling         them      to m o v e             back and ask                   for

medical         assistance.

A l t h o u g h at      this      p o in t      all    I thought             was     that           it was          an    extreme

crush,       but     it d i d n ' t        occur       to me        t ha t    people            were        dying.

In f r o n t      of P e n 4         I remember             seeing        one      supporter                pulling            at    the

front       fencing,         he wa s         stopped          by a     police          officer.                A few m inutes                     later

I sa w      the    s ame     man       pulling         at     the    fence,          only           this       time       he w a s        joined

by tw o      police         officers,            and    they          managed          to       break          the w e l d i n g      a n d pull

the      mesh away          from       the      supports.                  People        appeared               to be       c l i m b i n g out

of    this      area      f r o m all        directions             and      flooding               onto       the       pitch.           People

were      crying,         limping          along,       s om e b e i n g     assisted                by o t h e r          fans.              I

remember          then      seeing         a fan       climb          up o nt o        the          c r o s s b a r of the           goal

I s a w a St         John's          ambulance          drive        onto       the     pitch and                   draw       up    in f r o n t

of    the    goal       where        the     net      had     been.          Looking            at     Pens         3 & 4 at          t h is

               there       was      a    policeman            in s h i r t         sleeves,          kneeling           down     by    this       man.         He

               was     in a      confused              st a t e ,    he was         crying,          and     k ept      playing        with       the

               buttons         of       the m a n ’s s h i r t .              I put rny a r m             round       the     policeman,            stood

               him     up a n d         t oo k    h i m a w a y,       for     s om e     strange           reason        I could          tell     the

               l a rge     m a n was           dead.         I make          this    point          to    say     t hat     t hi s    bobby       looked

               to me       like         he h a d       really        been      stuck       in s o m e w h e r e         trying        to    help,        and

               there's         been a            lot    of    criticism             of    the       po lic e,      but      some      did    get

               involved and                did     g o o d wor k ,           whereas       others          didn't         do the       same.

               At    about       15.50 hours                 (1550),          I walked          b ack      down       the     pitch        towards        the

               West      Stand.            K en n y D A L G I S H was              making       an a n nou nc em en t            over       the     lou d

               speaker.                 When      I got       to     the      terracing             I went        and     leaned against                 one

               of    the      goal       posts.           I n o t i c e d all            the    bodies          had     no w b e e n       removed,           and

               I stood         looking            into       Pens      3 and        4,    at    the       b ent    barrier,           and     the

               broken         fence,             I wa s      stood with                                           a n d we w e r e         asking

               ourselves            why        it h a d      happened.              There       were       tw o    policewomen              standing

               n ext     to    us,        I remember              they were          dressed             smartly,         coats,       trousers           and

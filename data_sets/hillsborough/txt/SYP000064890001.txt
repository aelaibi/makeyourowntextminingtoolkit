Myself       and       others           formed          ar line         on    the      opposite             side       of    the    fence          and

just      been     passed           through.                 He    was       aged      approximately                   25 years          with

heartbeat          and,        as       I did          so,     I was         joined            by a St J o h n s            Ambulanceman

who    to 1 d rne to           gi ve m o u t h            to m o u t h        as      he       rendered          cardiac       rnassage .               I

opened       the       man's            mouth          and    blew          into      him.         I repeated               this    procedure

several         times        a n d was            then       joined          by a n o t h e r         St    Johns       ambulanceman

who    was      carrying            a    cylinder             of       ox y g e n .        He    t o l d me       to    place       a    pipe

from      the     cylinder              into       the       man's          mouth,         which        I did.          The    other          St

Johns       man    continued                 to    give       massage           for        a    short while             longer          before

he    said,       " H e ’s dead,              forget          it."

I closed          the    m a n ’s e y e s              and    walked          back         toward          the    chain       of    officers

passing         bodies        from           the       open       gate.         I joined              the     end      of    the    l ine      and

was    passed          the     body          of a n       elderly            man,aged            about        50 y e a r s .        I carried

the    body       to    the     pitch and                 was      about        to     render           f i rst       aid when          I was

joined       by a m a n         in       civilian             clothing             who         stated       he was          a Doctor.              He

with    him.           I,    therefore,                went        back       t o w ar d */ the        fence        in o r d e r     to

assist       people          over.           By    this           time,       the     crowd      at     the     front        had

of    the    terraces,                beneath          the        railings,           there      was      a    large       amount         of

clothing,          shoes          and       spectacles.                  The       atmosphere           at     this     poin t       was

extremely          tense          with       members              of    the     crowd       shouting           obscenj/ties

towards        us.          We       remained          in t h e / p e n         for    about       10 m i n u t a e        and      then

                 on the video,             located       in the     centre      of the    picture.

                At this        point/I          was   e n g a g e d w i t h the decea s e d Vincent M i c h a e l

                 I can be seen,                along w i t h other      officers,        carrying    the    body o f

                F I T Z S I M M O N S and       placing     him on the       pitch.

                 At    1 5 . 2 1 .49.14        I can be seen        on the      left hand side of the               body, as     you

                 face       the screen,          I am giving        first aid to F I T Z S I M M O N S .

            R e s u s c i t a t i o n was    not    successful and            I placed my uniform jacket

             (raincoat)         over   the b o d y .        I had no further           dealings w ith FITZSIMMONS.

            The      body had been handed to me by other                         police     officers who        had formed

             chain at the Gate               to Pyen^3.

                    m o u s t a c h e who   I rendered first aid to on the                         pitch,   he wore a grey and

                    this man        1 placed my black u n i f o r m tprfee quarter                     length raincoat             over

TAYLOR INQUIRY: WEST MIDLANDS VIDEO

As promised I enclose herewith a copy of the compilation video
of the events at Hillsborough leading to the disaster, prepared
by the West Midlands Police. I trust that it assists you in your
role at the forthcoming seminar to be held at the Emergency
Planning College.

Could I ask you to return the video when you have finished with
it?

           /         I have already made a statement about events at

      Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 and have, I hope, made clear

      my feelings about what happened.                In this statement I deal

      with further matters possibly material to the first phase of

      the ijSnquiry, the functions of the FA and the allocation by

      the FA of the match to Hillsborough,               The FA wish to put in

      considerable further evidence to the second phase of the

      |nquiry dealing with the wider issues.



      The FA



      3,             The FA is a company limited by shares, most of

      which are held by representatives of associations with

      football clubs in England and Wales,               The share capital

      consists of £100 divided into 2,000 shares of 5p each.                 \

      shareholder is not entitled to any dividend, bonus or

      profit.       The FA acts through its Council and Committees.

      The inquiry will have been provided with the FA Handbook

The FA^s Activities



4,          The FA is the governing body of the game of

Association      Football in England and Wales and has been

established as such since 1863,    It sanctions, directly or

through one or more of its affiliated County Football

Associations, in excess of of 2,000 leagues and

competitions.    Best known of these is the the Football

League.    Tha Football Association is governed by a Council,

which is made up of nominees and elected representatives of

various bodies involved in the game including those Clubs in

full membership of the Football Association, County Football

Associations and the Management Committee of the Football

League.    All major decisions including those involving

policy are made by the Council, which meets approximately      6


times a year­



s'          The FA/s major object is to promote the sport of

Association Football in the UK in all its various aspects.

It aims to ensure that the game is played to the highest

possible standards, both in terms of skill and behaviour, by

           present the game to the public in the best possible light.

           It is concerned with raising standards through the

           organisation of coaching and other educational activities

           and encourages early participation by children in football

           through grants and loans.

         ^TA Cup^and an annual charity match called the Football

           7,          The   FA is responsible for all arrangements

           concerning teams representing England at all levels,

           (senior, "B", under 2 1 ,        semi-professional and youth).         It is

          responsible through the County Football Associations for the

          recruitment and promotion of referees and operates a referee

          training programme within its coaching activities.                 It

          enforces the Laws of the Game.               In conjunction with the

          Football League it controls the broadcasting aad- tal-av4aion-

    <     of all football matches in England,

organisations, in particular television,                 This income is put

both here and abroad, the FA now employs three experienced

The FA Cup



10,          Briefly, the FA Cup fful~l— name— 3>the -PA- eha-lleftg-o-

Oap'COmpetition'*^ is a knock-out competition in which
                             A       it*    fo J * d
opposing teams are decided by lefe* and (prior to the

semi-final)    the matches are played on the grounds of the

taams whose names are drawn first.                The FA can order a tie

to be played elsewhere,         The major teams ( the Football

League teams) are brought into the competition only in the

Third Round.       CAt   later stages there may be smaller

^rson-League" clubs which have survived.               There are therefore

on occasion ties in which a large established club must play
                                  Job 28315L




 a very small one on the small club's groundf| The contest

 between the smaller and larger clubs (with the chance of the

 smaller winning on the day) is widely held to be one of the

main attractions of the FA Cup.



11.         The final of the FA Cup is played at Wembley

Stadium in London,       Semi-finals are played on neutral

grounds (ie on the ground of a club not connected with

either contestant).



12.         Most Cup ties are keenly followed by the fans of

the clubs involved and semi-finals are big occasions in the

football year often with a great demand for tickets.

                  The      problem in modern times has been the necessity to

                  segregate rival supporters both at tha match and while

                  substantial planning wc co-operation with the local police,



                  17.          The FA, therefore; having chosen two staging clubs

                  (and clubs for possible replays) does not seek to control
         tha direct organisation of a semi-final tis (in the sense of

         police provision, crowd control, medical support, ate) which

         ara dealt with by the staging club,                               We are not equipped in

         terms of staff and local knowledge to deal with these

         matters, and I think it would be unwise, and would only

         cause confusion, if the FA became involved in them.v j^-eee*

          there both for Cup Finals and International Matches (as well

          as many non-football events),



          Ticket Allocation



          20,         The purpose of Rule 26(b), which provides that

          subject to variation by the FA each competing club should

          have 50% of the tickets sold, is that there should not be a

          !!home ground" atmosphere for one club from obtaining a

          markedly greater number of tickets <            In practice the

      the basis of the replies giving relevant details of the 13

      grounds (page ___).         We do sometimes get representations

      from a club asking to be considered, since it is a matter of

      prestige and financial benefit to stage a semi-final tie,

                        that the police would require the allocation to remain as

                        last year in order to avoid a clash of rival supporters

23,         vtfe did n6t feel that Liverpool's point outweighed^
                                                                 A
the reasons for staging the tis at Hillsborough^ The        ^

factors on which I would place weight in deciding venue, and

which I understand from FA staff and committee members are

considered significant, are as follows (not in any order of

importance):



(i)      Geography, not only of tha two clubs but of travel

routes (hooliganism an route can be a problem)



(ii)     Capacity,   This tie needed a big ground and

Hillsborough is one of the largest, holding 6,000 more that

villa Park.



(iii)    Experience as a staging club.     Obviously Sheffield

Wednesday are very experienced.



(iv)     Security at the ground.    Mr Evans' report had been

favourable in the previous year.



(t )     Whether the club was playing at home in the League

on tha day of the tia and would have to postpone the League

natch.   This is not of any grsat weight, and ^»e4ed Aston

    Villa , Sheffield Wednesday and Manchester United were all

    playing at home,



     (vi)      Whether the venue was that of a "top 5° club.    The

    top five are Liverpool , Ever ton, Manchester United, 9p«ars

    and Arsenal, which are believed to be the*'richest clubs,*

    There is a feeling that they do not need tha profit from

    staging a tie, which would be of greater importance to a

    lesser club.



    (vii)      the feeling that it was better not to play a tie in

    the home city of one of the competing clubs, ag a tie

    involving Liverpool at Everton.      It gives 51home advantage11

    from a travelling point of view, and the last three

    instances (Wolves-Spurs replay at Highbury (Arsenal) in

    1981, Liverpool-Manchester United at Goodison Park (Sverton)

    in 1985 and the same tie replay at Main Road (Manchester

    City^ in 1985) all involved crowd trouble with, in two of

    the ties, damage to local residential areas,



    29          I knew that Mr Jack Wiseman would attend the

    meeting and that the Committee would seek his advice,       Ha is

    Chairman of tha Matches and Grounds Committee (since 1980)

    and has great experience.    His recommendation is usually

    adopted,    I spoke to him a few moments before the meeting

    began at 11.30.    He told me he favoured Villa Park and

    Hillsborough because last year had gone well.      I told him
                                  Job 28 315L




      about the point raised by Liverpool that they would again

      gat less tickff?. Hs indicated that this did not change his

      view.



      30,        At about 11,30am the Challenge Cup Committee met

      with Mr Ernest Brown in the chair,        A copy of relevant parts

      were raised,   Mr Wiseman's advice was sought, and Villa Park

      was immediately agreed for the Everton tie.            One member

      raised Manchester, and on request Mr Clark indicated that it

      was the turn of Manchester United of the two Manchester

      clubs.   I believe that the main point which prevailed with

      members, some of whom I believe had attended Hillsborough in

      19887 was that the identical tie had been well handled then.

      There was no dissent to allocation of the tie to

     Hillsborough and the replay to Old Trafford.             I did not

      S2.        Immediately afterwards Mr Clark was instructed to

     contact the clubs involved as soon as possible, which I

     understand ha did.     He later sent the arrangements booklet

      for 1988/9 in the normal way.       As I have said the FA did not

     participate in any meetings about the arrangements at

     dillsborough (or Villa Park) and were not copied with

     documents concerning arrangements.

                   33,           ainca the tragedy I have heard criticism of tha

                   choice of Hillsborough for tha tie.        In view of what has

                  happened, I do not want to speak of ’’right” or "wrong”

                  choices7 but I do think that it was natural to allocate the

                  tie to Hillsborough as a respect, of the previous year.           It

                  is particularly shocking for me and I believa many people

                  involved in organising major football matches that this

                  should have occurred at an all-ticket match on a ground

                  where so many previous big matches had been played,

Pe    1564      Mace       (E2>      was    shown also          to beon serial             5,    but           he a d v i s e d       me

that      his number          had been             placed      in a n o t h e r serial         as well,           and     that

his duties           in the          other       serial       i n c luded traffic              duties.          In the

 circumstances,              I agreed            that      he s h o u l d    remain w i t h the           other        serial,

a n d that my serial                  would        continue w i t h nine men.

Serial       5 were        scheduled             for duties            on the Wes t        aide        of the       official
                                                                                           w     '

Beal      supervising,

After      the general               briefing,            we were       p r o v i d e d with a light              packed

meal,      w h i c h was      consumed             in the N o r t h Stand.               The     serial         and myself

were      then j oied         by      Inspector Harvey,                  who     gave     us a more        direct

briefing,         which was            specific            to the       duties a l l o c a t e d to my serial.

We d e p l o y e d to the             car       park at about             11.20 a.m.           (Inspector H a r v e y was

aware      of the fact               that the            serial    was an officer               short).

The    duties       for my serial                 effectively            split      them,       for the         p r e -match

phase      of the operation,                     into three            groups.        These were          s u p e r v i s i o n of

the BBC        television             v e h i c l e s and equipment,                supervision           of turnstiles

The    television            vehic l e s         etc.      were    parked w i t h i n the official                      car

F-airclough)             were     g i v e n this duty.             The    remaining      six    officers        split

into     two groups              of three,        were      g iven the      previ o u s l y d e s c r i b e d

t u r n s t i l e duties.

Sergeant £ 6 6 Jacques                   (Serial       4)    had     responsibility         in the pre--m«tc*h

Eve n w h e n we          deployed        there were           several      people      in the       official       car

park area.               The     sterile area was              established           by serial       6 by placing

barri e r s ac r o s s           the w i d t h    of the       car    park at the extreme west                  corner

of the S o u t h Stand,                 a n d by a further            row of barriers at the L e p pings

that     there were              numbers       of Li v e r p o o l    fans using the           car    park as a

th o r o u g h f a r e    to get        to the L e p p i n g s Lane         e n t rances    from the N o r t h

side     of the ground.                  Such     people were            from then on d i r e c t e d around

the outside              of the g r o u n d via P e n i s t o n e R o a d North,               P a r k s i d e Road,

Catchbar        Lane       to L e p p i n g s Lane.            It was also           evident at       that stage

that     there were              fans    present mainly,              if not e x c l u s i v e l y    from

L iverpool,         who        did not      have     p o s s e s s i o n of m a t c h tickets.          Some     said

they had tick e t s a v a i l a b l e              to them and a w a i t i n g          collection,          from

dive r s e     venues          such as      the ticket          office,       from the      players       entrance,

As    time     p rogressed,          Liverpool         fans     still      continued to try and get

t h r o u g h the official             car    p#rk from the P e n i s t o n e R o a d end to Leppiftgs

section.           So     far as my own serial                wer e      concerned,         there was          very

little       required          in the form of direct                  supervision.               T h e y were at the

tickets        ready.          V e r y few    problems were              presented.           The   o f f icers       on

serial       6 had s l i g h t l y more            of a problem,           in that         it fell       to them to

official           car    park was not           to be treat as a t h o r o u g h f a r e .

(So far as           this asp e c t        of the mat t e r         is    concerned,          my o p i n i o n    is that

man y of the L i v e r p o o l            fans     I spoke w i t h were well a ware                     of the     layout

of the H i l l s b o r o u g h        stadium,        probably        from     previous          visits    to the

ground,       and that m a t c h tickets                 sh o w e d a plan of the ground,                      clearly

indicating           the     p r o b a b i l i t y of a route via the               car     park).

By about 2 . 3 0            p.m.    my serial        was at       its busiest,            with a        constant

s t r e a m of fans          seek i n g    admission.           Q u e u e i n g was minimal.              I doubt          if

anyone       queued for            longer     than a minute,             w i t h the queues             only     reaching

a b o u t 8 to 10 persons at their                       longest.

Theresas,                  around S.30        p.m.       I believe,         a radio m e s s a g e       passed to „

this was            due to         increased        crowd noise           or a technical              problem,       1 am

not    easily unders t o o d .                 The       qual i t y of the           radio     was     so    poor at one

stage        I    ind i c a t e d to a female               officer who was               on duty      inside       the

aware whether                 or not      the m e s s a g e was          passed on.

    references          to the m a t t e r     could be pic k e d out.

    8 officers          u s e d this     route).

    F r o m this time,          I r e m a i n e d at     the    b a r riers at the end of the S o u t h

    Stand.          There was         still    a       considerable           number       of Liv e r p o o l     fans

    trying      to get        through       the sterile area,              and whilst m a n y had

    previously          been r e - d i r e c t e d w i t h o u t    too m u c h of a problem,              an

    i ncreasing         numb/r     now were a r g u m e n t a t i v e       about     having      to seek an

    alternative          ramte a r o u n d the ground.                 It was also a p p a r e n t         that the

    majority o f A h e s e          later arrivals,             had been consuming alcohol.

£   I can c o y i rm that at              this t i m e , I J i e a ^ r a ^ j r a d i ^ b r ^ o a ^ c a r ^ ^ q u e ^ t i ^ g

    that    the m a t c h k i c k off         be   put    back.        I cannot       identify who made the

    request,       or say w h e t h e r       the t r a n s m i s s i o n was a c k n o w l e d g e d    by

    control.         I do      r e c ollect think i n g         that the          request was       late,       and that

    by that         stage the         players may well             have    been     ready to go on the

    pitch.          I had no view           of the       pitch,      but had not heard the               loud cheer

    that    n o r m a l l y heralds       the entry of the                players     onto    the ground.              I

    also    recollect         thinking,        without         considering         the    public     order

    s i t u a t i o n that    had developed,             that      it w o u l d   be unfair       to d elay the

    m a t c h to a l l o w the        latecomers         to gai n entry,           after all,        the m a j o r i t y

    had a r r i v e d    in good time and had t a k e n their                       places     in the ground.

    At that      time      I was      also a w a r e     of the       fact that Police C o n s t a b l e s

    Craigie,       F a i r c l o u g h and W i c k e n    had      left    their duties         in the        vicinity

due to the          number        of fans       on the       pitch that          it was    impracticable             to

a n d d i r e c t e d me     towa r d s      the goal        mouth.        I looked towards           the goal

mouth.        I could see            that      both P o l i c e O f f i c e r s and fans were               climbing

onto     the fence,           it took me           some w h i l e    to    realise     that     people were

being     lifted over             the    top of the          fence    into the playing area.                    Some

of the o f f icers w e r e              ges t u r i n g    for    people    to move a w a y      from the

fence,      in retrospect,               I now realise             that    these gestures were for

people at the              back     to move        back     to     relieve       pressure.      Whi l s t    this was

h a p pening      objects were             being     th r o w n from the terracing               towards        the

people at the fence.                     I have a r e c o l l e c t i o n of one offi c e r              being hit

by an object              that    disintegrated,             I assumed          it to be a pie.           I found

the whole         situation          very      i ncongruous and            difficult       to assess.           I

f ormed the o p i n i o n          that what         I had e n v i s a g e d earlier          had    in fact

occurred,         i.e.      there       had been a n o u t b r e a k        of fighting        on the

terraces,        which       had     resulted        in a number           of    people    sustaining

injuries.          The      fence was         very        crowded behind the goal.                  I watched            the

crowd for a short                 time     to try and a s s e s s          the    situation,        and saw no

rea s o n at that           stage       to go any nearer             the fence.           I m o v e d to the

             vast m a j o r i t y of the        late a r r i v a l s        had been drinking,              and that the

             quite     hostile at        times.            Eve n w h e n    o f f i c e r s were    trying          to treat          some

             To a certain         extent,       I can u n d e r s t a n d       that      sort of      reaction,               but the

             attitude        of those who         intended          to express           their disapp r o v a l               of the

             policing        of the m a t c h     never a p p e a r e d        to be d i m i n i s h e d by the scale of

             what     had occurred,          even though the extent                      of the t r a g e d y was              quite

             obvious      to the m a j o r i t y          of fans.

             I had     little     contact w i t h any of the                   stewards at any stage                         in the

DAVID KENNETH HODGETT,     Police Sergeant 1084,      'El' sub-division.


Incident at Hillsborough Football stadium,     15th April, 1989.


At 8-30am on Saturday 15th April, 1989,     I paraded for duty at Hackenthorpe
Police Station, in connection with duties for the F A Cup Semi-Final football
match at Hillsborough stadium, between Liverpool nad Nottingham Forest.


The majority of officers on ray serial were also from 'El' sub-division, and
once they had assembled,    we travelled by hiredbus,      arriving at the stadium
shortly aftep 9-00am.


When all the officers involved had arrived, we assembled in the North Stand,
for the pre-match briefing, which started on time, shortly before lO-OOam.
We were addressed at that stage by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield,          Inspector
Sewell,   Deteffitive Sergeant Charlesworth (and possibly one other officer,
Chief Inspector Beal).        My duties were in charge of Serial no. 5,       of whibh
I had had previous written advice.        The officers on my serial were as follows:-
(All stationed at'It*’unless otherwise stated)         PC 596 Smith,   PC 933 Botley,
Pc 499 Cartwright,     PC 769 Mutch,   PC 3131 Lewis,     PC 851 Wicken,   PC 1535
Fairclough,     PC 2512 Craigie and PC 1177 Davies (E2 sub div).        PC 1564
Mace (E2) was shown also to be on serial 5,         but he advised me that his number
had been placed in another serial as well,      and that his duties in the other serial
included traffic duties.      In the circumstances, I agreed that he should remain
with the other serial, and that my serial would continue with 9 men.


Serial 5 were scheduled for duties on the West side of the Official Car Park,
in Sector la,     with Inspector Harvey (HQs) and Chief Inspector Beal supervising.


After the general briefing,     we were provided with a light packed meal,        which
was consumed in the North Stand.       The Serial and myself were then joined by
Inspector Harvey,     who gave us a more direct briefing,      which was specific to
the duties allocated to my serial.      We deployed to the Car Park at about ll-20am.
(Inspector Harvey was aware of the fact that the serial was an officer short).


The duties for my serial effectively split them, for the pre-match phase of the
operation, into three groups.       These were supervision of the BBC television
vehicles and equipment,     supervision of turnstiles 19-22 (Gate E) and supervision
of turnstiles 23-28 (Gate F     -   possibly D??)


The televisionvehicles etc., were parked within the Official Car Park, just on
                                     -      2     -

the West side of the floodlight pylon situated in the car parkat the corner
where the South and West stands meet.           These vehicles were in an area which
was to be kept sterile and free from fans of either team.          Three of the serial
(PCs Wicken, Craigie & Fairclough) were given this duty.          The reaaining six
officers, split into two groups of three, were given the previously described
turnstile duties.


Sergeant 266 Jacques (Serial 4) had responsibility in the pre-match phase for
the east end of the car park,    and Sergeant 729 Norburn (Serial 6) had responsibility
for maintaining the sterile area on the car park between the South stand and
the west Stand turnstiles.      (I believe a serial or part-serial was also deployed
covering the Directors/Players/Guests/Sponsors/Banqueting areas)


Even when we deployed there were several people in the Official Car park area.
The sterile area was established by Serial 6 by placing barriers across the width
of thfe car park at the extreme west corner of the South stand, and by a further
row of barriers at the Leppings Lane entrance to the Car Park.           The only fans
to be allowed the barriers at the West end of the South stand were those Nottingham
spectators who had green coloured tickets (for uncovered seating) marked Gate E.
With the sterile area enforced, it became apparent that there were numbers of
Liverpool fans using the car park as a thoroughfare to get to the Leppings Lane
entrances from the North side of the ground.          Such people were from then on
directed around the oustide of the ground - via Penistone Road North, Parkside
Road, Catchbar Lane, to Leppings Lane.          It was also evident at that stage that
there were fans present - mainly if not exclusively from Liverpool - who did not
have possession of match tickets.        Some said they had tickets available to them
and awaiting collection -    from diverse venues such as the ticket office -
from the players entrance - from sponsors or stewards, etc..            Some said they
were looking for touts to buy tickets from.           (It should be noted that in the area
I was working, there should have been only Nottingham fans          -   I made a point of
speaking to fans who were obviously Liverpool supporters and who were therfore
at the wrong part of the stadium).


As time progressed,    Liverpool fans still continued to try and get through the
Official Car Park,    from the Penistone Road end to Leppings Lane.        They claimed
to have been directed along this route by the Police, stewards, or gatemen.
Almost all were re-directed as previously described.           A very selective few
were alowed through the sterile area       -    the very old or young, and the infirm,
and then in each case they were escorted from barrier to barrier throughthe
sterile section.      So far as my own serial were concerned,        there was very
little required in the form of direct supervision.           They were at the extreme
end of where Nottingham fans were expected to gain entry and hence the vast
                                         3

majority knew where they were going to and had tickets ready.        Very few problems
were presented.     The officers on serial 6 had slightly more of a problem, in
that it fell to them to maintain the sterile area aftd re-direct fans bound for
Leppings Lane.      I gave them what assistance I could, particularly in filtering
the fans who were allowed past the barrier for gate E.         With Liverpool fans
still trying to get through the car park,       I liased with Sergeant Jacques
and ensured that his serial were    aware that the Official car Park was not
to be treat as a thoroughfare.


(So far as this aspect of the matter is concerned,       my opinion is that many
of the Liverpool fans I spoke with were well aware of the layout of the Hillsborough
stadium, probably from previous visits to the ground       -   and that match tickets
showed a plan of the ground, clearly indicating the probability of a route via the
car park.)


By about 2-30pm,    my serial was at it's busiest, with a constant stream of
fans seeking admission.    Queueing was minimal.     I doubt if anyone queued for
longer than a minute, with the queues only reaching about 8 to 10 persons at
their longest.


Also about this time I recollect looking throughthe 'EA        gate turnstiles to the
North stand, and considering the time I expected to see it very nearly full          -
it was comparatively empty.


There was, around 2-30pm, I beleive, a radio message passed to match control
which outlined that there were a large number of fans around the ground who
did not apparently have tickets.    I also transmitted to match control supporting
this observation.


There was almost constant traffic on the radio at this time, and the radio
traffic, together with a a visit from Detective Superintendent MacKay, drew my
attention to congestion at the Leppings lane entrances.        From my gates, I had
no view of the area in front of the Leppings Lane gates, but Superintendnt
MacKay pointed out the congestion, which I had a partial sight of when I went
just beyond the television vehicles.         Mr MacKay suggested that I make part
of my serial available to support Sergeant Norburn's men on the barriers, if
necessary.     I briefed PC-Craigie accordingly to monitor the situation, and
if appropriate, to take PCs Wicken and Fairclough and give assistance.


Upto this stage radio transmissions had been satisfactory,       but from 2-30pm onwards
the quality of reception deteriorated.       Whether this was due to increased crowd
noise   or a technical problem, I am unaware,    but control transmissions at times
were distorted,poor and not easily understood.       The quality of the radio was so
poor at one stage I indicated to a female officer who was on duty inside the
the ground in the South Stand to relay a message to the Match-Police
Control to ensure they were aware of the radio problem.     I am not aware whether
or not the message was passed on.


From the time I was first made aware of the problems at the Leppings Lane
entrances - I can be no more accurate with the time than estimating it to be
about 2-30pm., there appeared to be almost constant radio traffic about the
matter,     but as I have already said, transmissions were, for some time of a
very poor quality,     but broken references to the matter could be picked out.
Between 2-30pm and 3-00pm (possibly earlier) several mounted officers made
their way from Penistone Road North, through the sterile area, to the Leppings
Lane end.     ( I would estimate that 6 to 8 officers used this route).


From this time, I remained at the barriers at the end of the South Stand.
THere was stilla considerable number of Liverpool fans trying to get through
the sterile area, and whilst many had previously been redirected without too
much of a problem,     an increasing number now were argumentative about having
to seek an alternative route around the ground.      It was also apparent that
the majority of these later-arrivals had been consuming alcohol.


I can confirm that at this time,      I heard a radio broadcast requesting that
the match kick-off be put back.      I cannot identify who made the request, or
say whether the transmission was acknowledged by control.      I do recollect
thinking that the request was late, and that by that stage the players may well
have ben ready to go on the pitch.      I had no view of the pitch, but had not
heard the loud cheer that normally heralds the entry of the players onto the
ground.      I also recollect thinking - without considering the public order
situation that had developed - that it would be unfair to delay the match to allow
the latecomers to gain entry....     after all, the majority had arrived in good time,
and had taken their places in the ground.


At that time I was also aware of     the fact that PCs Craigie, Fairclough and Wicken
had left their duties in the vicinity of the television vehicles.         I assumed
they had acted on their own initiative to join members of serial 6 at the
Leppings Lane barriers.


With kick-off imminent     - for the reasons outlined above I knew the teams were
on the pitch -     I began preparations for Phasell of the match.   This included
my serial having responsibility for the whole of the Official Car Bark
whilst Sergeant Jacques' serial (No 4) took meal, at 3-00pm.        I had the barriers
moved back from the corner of the stand, to a point adjacent to the floodlight
pylon, in order to avoid     congestion as fans left the ground after the match.
I went then to the three officers on the lower gate (F) to ensure that they covered
the east end of the car park,     from where I assumed Sergeant           Jacques'   serial would
be ready to leave for their meal relief.         Radio transmissions were still poor -
and here I was under the overhang of the stand and/or the banquesting suite when
I heard what I believed to be an Inspector on the radio.           He kept repeating himself
about 'trouble(??)' at the gates.      There was a tone of panic in the man's voice
and I recollect, as he repeated himself        again and again, that he sounded what
can be at best described as unprofessional.        There followed a request for the
gates to be opened.     This was also repeated, and it seemed to be queeried,
several times.     I could not discern who made the request...          i.e. I did not know
whether it came from police control, or whether an officer outside wanted the
message relaying to someone within the ground.         I knew that if complied with,
this request would lead to fans without tickets getting access to the ground and
that from that many people would be unable to see properly, andthat therefore                we
were going to have a pblic order situation on the terracing.


I made my way back towards the West end of the car park        -       radio transmissions
still being a problem.      As I reached 'E' gates I was met by an          Inspector whohad
run from the Leppings Lane end of the car park.         He sai d there had been an
instruction for all Police personnell to go to the pitch - I don't recollect
whether he said or that I had assumed that there had been a pitch invasion.
Stewards oper^i the exit     gate and I gained entry to the South Stand.


I could see that there were already many fans on the pitch.             Play was already stopped
and I do not recollect seeing any players still on the field.             I went down onto
the pitch, and climbed over the wall onto the playing area from the South Stand.
I realised immediately that due to the number of fans on the pitch that it was
impracticable to arrest them all, and the first ones I encounteredl tried to
usher back to the terraces.     Their reactions were abnormal - I think that from
previous experiences of pitch invasions, I had expected them to run? off and
avoid capture.      These youths didnot run off.    They appeared bewildered and
confused.    They said people had been injured and directed me towards the goal­
mouth.      I looked towards the goal-mouth.     I could see that both Police Officers
and fans were climbing onto the fence     -    it took me some while to realise that
people wre being lifted over the top of the fence into the playing area.
Some of the officers were gesturing for people to move away from the fence -
in retrospect I now realise that these gestures were for people at the back to
move back to relieve pressure.      Whilst this was happening objects were being
thrown from the terracing towards the people at the fence          -    I have a recollection
of one officer being hit by an object that disintegrated        - I assumed it to be
a pie.     I found the whole situation very incongrous and difficult to assess.
                                      v
I formed the opinion that what I had enisaged earlier had in fact occurred,
i.e. there had been an outbreak of fighting on the terraces, which had resulted
                                              6                                                 J >
in a number of people sustaining injuries.        The fence was very crowded behind
the goal.    I watched the crowd for a short time to try and assess the situation,
and saw no reason at that stage to go any nearer the fence.           I moved to the
penalty area and again tried to move encroaching spectators back to the terracing
but had no sucess whatsoever.        Other officers also were trying to move them,
but more and more were coming onto the pitch and it was obviously a wasted effort.
I was approached by a police Constable whose identity I do not know.         He was
distressed and in a state of shock.       He said there were'dead people'     and    'several
fatalities' on the terracing.        I found whathe said difficult to believe.       I went
towards the fencing - a distance of about 15 to 20 yards - I could see people pressed
against the fence, but due to the numbers of fans and police men standing on the
wall,   and by now the number of casualties laid on the ground,         I could not get
close enough to make out exactly what had happened to the people still behind
the fence.    I looked down around me, in the vicinity of the goal-mouth.           There
were casualties everywhere.     The situation with each one seemed to be the same           -
they had several persons around them, with mouth to mouth and heart massage being
applied to almost all of them.        There were about six such cases within a few feet
of where I stood.      Each one appeared to be dead -       none showed any sign of response
to the treatment being given.        I looked around, to see where I could be of any assistance,
(and I think to see if anyone was alive who required assistance).           I saw a boy,
aged about 12;   he was collapsed but concious and in some        considerable pain. With
others already there     - notably     PC 1828 Metcalfe (El) - I rendered first         aid.
The boy complained of pain in his hips and torso and said he couldn't feel his feet.
He was moving his head and shoulders & responded to stimulous to his feet.             After
he was reassured for some whileas unsucessful efforts were made to locate a stretcher,
PC Metcalfe picked him up and carried him off, cradled in his arms.          (This is theboy
and officer who were photographed and had the picture published in many newspaprs).
I also assisted with other casualties,       and realsiing that none of the constables
had radios tried to monitor the radio transmissions.         By now the whole of the penalty
area - if not the west end of the pitch- was quite literally teeming with spectators.
I had been aware of a couple of incidents where press photographers had been
threatened or attacked by fans as they took pictures: and that several officers
had been told by fans that what had occurred was our responsibility.         The mood of
many spectators, particularly the ones with very minor injuries of the uninjured
was particularly unpleasant,     and their presence was becoming a hinderance, either
directly or indirectly, to the removal of the more seriously injured casualties.
At this stage I was joined by a senior officer and he tolel me to muster as many men
as I could and try to clear the pitch of the 'walking' wounded.         I made a concious
decision to move them towards the North Stand (which was occupied by Liverpool fans)
as opposed to the South Stand.The people on the pitch did not respond           to
instruction, persuasion or even        physical ushering.     Many were obviously       extremely
                                         -    7   -
distressed, looking for friends and relatives from whom thay had become separated.
Others were abusive, insulting and just unwilling to co-operate.
I considered myself in a situation where what I was doing was having little effect.
Suddenly there was a charge of spectators on the pitch towards the East Stand -
the 'Kop' end where the Nottingham Forest standing spectators were assembled.
I am not sure what provoked or brought about the charge.         I had heard a small
group of fit Liverpool spectators on the ground chanting 'Shitty Ground' - this
was directed towards the SouthStand (possibly the directors box).         There seemed to
have been a response, possibly from the Kop, which came immediately before the charge
down the pitch.    There were a large number involved, possibly upto 200, and with the
many other officers on the field, it was quickly stopped and order restored.
With the other officers involved in preventing the charged, I then formed
a cor don accross the width of the pitch at the halfway line.


Whilst I was in this position, efforts to remove casualties continued.         Many were
carried out on advertsisng boards and I could see fatalities as well, these being
carried out with their heads covered.        At the halfway line I could hear radio
tarffic more clearly;     theere was a discussion about the match having been
abandoned and whether or not, or when, that decision should be relayed to the
crowd.      I remained at the halfway line cordon,^during which time, and even after
it was eventaully announced that the match was abandoned, I saw senior officers,
(particularly Chief Superintendent Nesbit) being harangued by spectators.         Once
the crowd cleared,     I endeavoured to regroup the members of my serial.      I located
six of my nine men, but our services were no longer required.          Eventually we were
insftructed to go the the North Stand,       where we had paraded,    for de-brief.
I remeber looking at the stadium clock on the roof of the South Stand as we crossed
the pitch and thinking that the match should still have been in progress at that
time.


We waited in the North Stand for some time        -   eventually Chief Inspector Beal
gave de^breif instructions.     He quoted a figure of dead       ( I recollect 70+).
The number shocked me,    for I had assumed from what I had seen that there were between
20 and 30 fatalities, possibly a few more.            Part of the debrief instruction was
to provide a brief written account of the way each member of the serial had been
involved.    I could not bring myself to write about what had occurred, and the
debrief was completed by PC 2512 Craigie.         We were then instructed to go to
Claywheels Lane traffic depot for transport back to sub-division.


We returned, by bus, to Hackenthorpe.        Serial 5 retired from duty at 7-30pm.
In the early stages of the operation,        the mood of all the fans appeared
to be friendly and amiable,        even though it was apparent from the onset that
many fans were not in possession of tickets.         As time passed by,    it was
obvious that more and more of the fans arriving had been consuming alcohol
prior to coming to the ground.         A rush can obviously be expected the closer
it gets to kick-off time,        but for this match there appeared to be very many
spectators who arrived very late for a match of such importance, where a capcity
crowd was undoubtedly expected.        As outlined earlier in this account, fans were
not allowed access through the car park:        many of the very late arrivals were
argumentative and uncooperative about having toAredirected around the outside
of the ground.      I have no doubt that the vast majority of the late arrivals
had been drinking,     and that the consumption of alcohol no doubt contributed
to the change of mood of some of their number.


After the crush occurred,        the mood of the fans towards the police was quite
hostile at times.    Even when officers were trying to treat some casualties,
they were being hindered by fans verbally abusing them.          To a certain extent,
I can understand that sort of reaction,        but the attitude of those who intended
to express their disapproval of the policing of the match never appeared
to be diminished by the scale of what had occurred,         even though the extent of
the tragedy was quite obvious to the majority of fans.


I had little contact with any of the stewards at any stage in the proceedings,
and was not aware of any of them evading theirduties.


As outlined,     from about 2-30pm onwards,     radio communications were poor and
unsatisfactory.      The radio I was issued with had an ear-piece which was most
uncomforable to wear,     and,     in my opinion,   was poorly designed.


I was not directly involved with the removal of bodies from the area.

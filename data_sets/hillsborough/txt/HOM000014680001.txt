                                                            17 August 1989




Dear Sir,


        I am writing to ask you to use your high office to help our country’s
police force to salvage some credibility after the Hillsborough disaster. During
and since the disaster we have witnessed officers of the South Yorkshire Police
Force displaying arrogance and closemindedness. I lived in Sheffield for seven
years and therefore recognize these typical Yorkshire traits, however, after ninety-
five deaths now is the time to display humility and accountability. Chief
Constable Wright’s employment must be terminated, he is responsible for the
quality and actions of his senior officers. Offers to either resign or be persuaded
to stay are an insult to our intelligence, done in the knowledge that the South
Yorkshire Police Authority like nothing better than to fly in the face of public
opinion. I trust that Her Majesty’s Home Secretary will not follow their lead.




                                 Yours sincerely,




Copies to:   South Yorks Police Authority
             Chief Constable Wright

                 New Football Ground Safety Self Audit


Football clubs are ignoring government guidelines on stadium
safety, risking the lives of thousands of spectators every week,
even after the country's worst sporting disaster at Hillsborough.


"Despite 95 deaths at Hillsborough this year,                                         football ground
safety is still inadequate," says James Tye, Director General of
the British Safety Council.                       "Unless immediate action is taken,
further tragedies are inevitable."


The British Safety Council has released a Football Club Safety
Self Audit,    ased on the "Green Guide".                                This Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds    (1986)           is a voluntary code of practice,                                   the Safety
Council's ten point check list is intended as a additional aid to
professional judgement and common sense.


The ten points are directed at the four types of safety problems
management may encounter:                      trips and falls due to unsafe
structures, mass movement                     of spectators,                 fire, and hooliganism,
which can all be catastrophic.
                                                        /




"Clubs have a duty to take all necessary precautions to safeguard
spectators against accidents.                       The Council's Football Club Safety
Self Audit highlights the vital areas for proper safety'
management," says Mr Tye.

FOOTBALL CLUB SAFETY SELF AUDIT
             Have you appointed a qualified, professional trained safety officer
             and ensured all stewards are trained in safety procedures?

             Have you drawn up a fully operational, written safety policy covering
             stewards, emergency services and spectators?
             Do you always brief stewards, the police and emergency services
             before the beginning of each match and check all communication
             systems?
             Are cleaning, maintenance and repairs, especially of terraces, done
             regularly to safeguard against accidents?
             Is fire equipment in good working order, vandal-proof and easily
             accessible in case of fire?

             Are there enough emergency exits, particularly in covered stands and
             are they clearly signposted?
             Is every wall, railing and barrier safety tested and are perimeter fences
             manned and easily opened in an emergency?
             Are stairways and gangways always kept clear, in good condition and
             well lit?
             Do you use sufficient turnstiles to regulate admittance and keep crowd
             pressures down?
             Are supporters segregated, and the crowd sectioned to minimise the risk
             of serious accidents?

               I am emplo ye d by the                                                         as a P h o t o g r a p h e r a nd   I

               1989    ( 1304-89)           to cover       the Cup Semi        Final     between N o t t i n g h a m Forest

               an d Liverpool.                Just    before     the kick off whe n they tossed up for which

               end to play           I saw that            the Forest were          playing      towards       the Leppings

               Lane    end.        I then          ran with my gear            towards     that end and         positioned

               m ys el f    ten metres            from the      left goalpost          looking       towards      the Leppings

               Lane    Terraces and                close    to Gate 3 in the P er imeter Fence.

               As    I was      sitting           down on my stool          the m a tc h got under way              I could

               hear    t remendous            noise    from the Leppings              Lane    end and all         round the

               ground from           I a s s u m e d the excitement              of the kick off.

               As the       cries and shouts                continued from behind me                 I was aware         that

               there was          something afoot              other    than the       general       excitement.          1   then
                                                                                                                     P AGE
                                                                                                                     3 3649

              turned towards            the   crowd and saw s upporters               faces      crushed against         the

              wire Perimeter            fence    I could d i st in ct ly hear           cries        f rom s upporters    to

              stop the match an d also                general     cries      for help and to get them out

              m e an in g     the s upporters        crushed agai ns t           the fence.

              I initially took some                 photographs       of the general            scene and     in a short

              space of time            people were       coming      over    the    top of the fence and

              collapsing amongst              the    photographers.              I recall      one    lad sat at the

              foot     of the      left hand goal         post and a couple             collapsed        in the side

              netting.          The    game was     still      in progress at         the time.          By this     stage

              could see that Gate 3 was                  open and af Policernan had                  climbed above     the

              opening a nd a p p e a r e d       to be using         his    radio and shouting with others

              to the         crowd to move       back.      I saw bodies           piled up at the         foot of the

              gate.          It was a ro u n d this time         that      the game was         stopped and     I m o ve d

              from the         immediate area.           The    cries      for    help that      I heard as far as            I

              was aware were made               g enerally and not to an              individual.

              I produce         five    photographs       from the u n r e t ou ch ed negatives              that    I took

              at the match.            EX NO           1r I     £,          i, |     ft- and

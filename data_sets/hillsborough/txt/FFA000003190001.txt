           Dear sir,
                      As a keen Liverpool supporter, I was present at the
Hillsbourgh disaster. Although I have strong opinions on what happened and what
should happen in the -future, this is not the reason I ■feel moved to write to
you.
         The reason •for my correspondence is that I strongly believe that it is
time that the -football supporters, in the guise of the Football Supporters
Association, had a stronger say in the future direction of the game.
         For many years the Football authorties have often talked about the
supporters being the most important aspect of the game, however their actions do
not appear to back up these words. In the years I have been going to Football
matches, supporters have always been the poor relations of the game, being
subject to poor facillitiss; herded like cattle into antiquated          grounds; ill
treatment by the authorties as well as being treated as the scapgoats for many
of the games problems. While agreeing that there maybe grounds for such

treatment, it must be remembered that the vast majority of Football spectators
are well behaved and this should be taken into account.
           The present public enquiry will, no doubt, set the course that our
national game will take into the 2ist century and not to take into account the
fans views would be the greatest crime of all.
           Once again I would implore you to involve the F.S.A. in any
dicussions regarding the future of the game.



                            Yours sincerely

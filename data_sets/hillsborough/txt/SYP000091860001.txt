              On S a t u r d a y    15th April      1989    (150489)         I went     together         with[

               tu rn s ti l es     to take    our   seats     in the West S t a n d .

               We    later went       to the    toilet      block at the           back of the s tand and                    looked

               out of the          gate whi ch I now know            to     be Gate     ’C ’ .

               At a r ou n d 2.45      pm <1445)       to 2.50       pm(1450)       I saw s up po r te r s

               climbing      over the turn st il es a nd             being h el pe d down             by P o l i c e m e n and

               t aken to Gate         eC'    to be ejected.

               We the gate was o pe ne d a. few s u p p or t er s                f orced their way t hr o ug h a

               then a lot f o l l ow ed them.The^-e was                 four     or five P o l i c e m e n       inside the

               gate and      I saw one of t h ^ T o l i cemen go               into the          crowd a nd strike             one

               of the s up po rt er s        in>che    f a c e , I am not        certain w he th er          it was with

          ^ his fist or not.The           supporter     st o pp e d s l i g h tl y and then went        on into

             the ground        I cannot describe       the s up p or t er   other    than he was a young

             man     I w ould d escribe    the P o l i c e m a n has   tall and     in u ni f or m but     I am

             not     certain w hether     he had got a helmet           or flat     cap on.

             I w ould       like to say that what       I saw w it h the P o l i c e m a n a s s a u l t i n g   the

             sup po rt er was     quite wrong and       it s ho u ld not have        occurred.

         Dear Mr. Frazer,

         RE DEATH REGISTRATIONS.

         This question is perhaps a ittle early but I think it might be worth
         addressing now.

         You will probably be aware that because the deaths of all the Hillsbrough
         deceased occurred more than a year before the conclusion of the Inquest, it
         will be necessary to submit the forms to the Registrar General for his
         authorisation to effect the registration.

         The registrations themselves will have to be done here in Sheffield and I
         have been in touch with the Superintendent Registrar to try and sort out how
         this can be effected with the minimum amount of inconvenience to the
         families.

         Apparently the normal way of dealing with the matter, where no family member
         attends at the Registrar’s Office but simply the Form REV 99 is received is
         for the Registrar to send a Form 344 (for Social Security purposes) and an
         application form for Death Certificate to the person named on the Inquest
         Certificate (REV99) as having received the Burial or Cremation Order and this
         is accompanied with an explanatory letter.

         It would obviously be possible for this to be done in these cases, but it is
         possible that in some cases, the orders may have been given to more distant
         relatives, rather than perhaps closer ones, because those were the only ones
         we were aware of at the time.

         It has occurred to me that another way of doing this would be for me to
         supply the Registrar with your name and address in your capacity as the
         representative of the Steering Committee, and for all the aforementioned
         documentation in respect of the 95 deceased to be sent to you, and for your
         firm then to distribute these directly to the bereaved or to their respective
         solicitors.

         I would be grateful if you could please let me know whether you would wish me
         to suggest this as the preferred option to the Superintendent Registrar.

Dear Dr Popper

Re:    Hillsborough Inquests

Thank you for your letter dated 22nd October 1990 concerning the procedure
of registration of the deaths of the above.

Unfortunately the Registrar General has no legal authority to effect a
registration of a death and thus the death must be registered in the place
where it occurred. Once the Registrar General has considered the matter
and given his authority for the registrations to proceed, he will forward
the inquest certificates to this office with a single death register to
enter all the deaths of this tragedy.

Normally in the case of an inquest certificate received at this office from
yourself through the post, and no relative is present, the Registrar
effects the registration and sends a form 344 (for Social Security purposes)
and an application form for a death certificate from this office to the
person named on the inquest certificate as having received your order for
burial or cremation, together with an explanatory letter.

I have already nominated a Registrar to effect all the registrations on
receipt of the Registrar General's authority, and, as previously explained,
a letter with the necessary forms would normally be sent to each person
named as having been issued with the burial or cremation order.

However, it may be preferable in this case to forward these documents to
the solicitors acting for the bereaved families as you suggest. Thus if
you could inform me of the names and addresses of these solicitors and for
whom they are acting, I will ensure that the Registrar forwards any
documents to the solicitor concerned.

Thanking you for all your assistance in this matter.

Yours sincerely

         Mr. M. Rigby,
         Superintendent Registrar,
         Register Office,
         Surrey Place,
         Sheffield. SI 1YA.

         Dear Mr. Rigby,

         Re: Hillsborough Inquests.

         Thank you very much indeed for your letter of the 17th of October.
         What is not clear to me is how the death registrations will be dealt with
         after the Registrar General has considered the matter. Will he be issuing
         the certificates direct to the bereaved families or will people have to
         attend at Sheffield to collect them from your office?

         If the Registrar General will issue the certificates direct, (which I think
         probably is the most convenient way) can you please let me know what
         arrangements if any you or he would propose, so that you might know who to
         send them to.

         It might be possible and perhaps most convenient if they were sent to the
         solicitors acting for the bereaved familes, because that would just be one
         address but no doubt you will consider this point.

         Yours sincerely,




         S.L.Popper,
         H.M.Coroner.

Dear Dr. Popper,

Re:         Hillsborough Inquests

With reference to your letter dated 12th October 1990 regarding the above,
it will be necessary to report all ninety-five deaths to the Registrar
General by the reason of their occurrence over one year ago.

I have consulted with the Registrar General and he has agreed that it
would be in order for you to forward all ninety-five Inquest Certificates
to him direct rather than initially forwarding them to this office.

The Registrar General has asked me to inform you that when you forward
these certificates to him that you mark the outside of the envelope with
the reference M&G90/3865D and address it to:
The Registrar General
General Register Office
St Catherine's House
10 Kingsway
LONDON
WC2B 6JP

He will then consider the matter.

I must point out that any envelopes received at that address with no
reference on them are sent to the Registrar General's office in Southport
for attention.

I hope this reply is to your satisfaction as I am, like yourself, anxious
that there is no delay in dealing with the registration process in order
to alleviate any further distress to relatives.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Yours faithfully,




Superintendent Registrar

I spoke to Mr. Rigby at the Registry Office.       I told him that I
anticipated that when the Inquestswas completed there would be
95 people queuing for certificates.       Had he considered how he
would be dealing with this?       I suggested that it might be possible
to pre-tpare the certificates.      He said he didn’t think that that
would be allowed but that he would take it up with the people
in London.   He said that he realised that there would be a problem.
I said that I thought that the people would be very cross if they-
couldn’t get their certificates straightaway, but that this was
really their problem and not mine.

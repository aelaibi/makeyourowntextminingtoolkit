REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE




FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS FACING A DISCIPLINARY HEARING
ARISING FROM THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER



1     Matter for Consideration

1.1    To consider an ex gratia payment of £5,000 from the Municipal Mutual
       Insurance Company Limited to an officer facing a disciplinary hearing
       as a result of the Hillsborough Disaster.

2     Background Information

2.1   In December 1990, the Authority granted     financial support to six
      officers, including Superintendent Murray in connection with their
      legal representation at the Hillsborough Inquest.

2.2   The terms of the agreement were such that any of the Superintendents
       subject  of disciplinary proceedings would be allowed to retain
      £10,000 exclusive of VAT from the insurance cover which they had
       taken out via the Superintendents' Association.

2.3   Superintendent Murray is now subject to disciplinary proceedings
      which will take the form of a Tribunal chaired by Mr John Newing,
      Chief Constable of the Derbyshire Constabulary sitting with two
      members of the Police Complaints Authority.     The officer is entitled
       to legal representation and he has intimated that he would wish to be
       so r e p r e s e n t e d . It is anticipated that the cost of legal
       representation may well exceed the £10,000 available to the officer.

2.4   At the meeting of the Authority held on 30 August 1991, a request for
       additional financial assistance to the officer was rejected.

2.5   On 2 November 1990, the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company intimated
       that it would be prepared to make an ex gratia payment to any of the
       S u p e r i n t e n d e n t s who face disciplinary proceedings following the
       Hillsborough Disaster.              The provision of the funding was conditional
       upon:-

       (a)   the officers having spent all the £50,000 insurance cover;

       (b)   the Authority agreeing to the officer receiving the payment.

2.6   The above offer was made orally on 2 November and in order to confirm
       the agreement,      on 18 July 1991, the Chief     Constable wrote to
       Municipal Mutual Insurance Company to ascertain that thisoffer was
       still available   (see letter  at   Appendix 'A').   The Company replied in
       the affirmative   (see letter at    Appendix ’B ’).
  3     Financial Implications

  3.1   There are no financial implications   forthe Authority.

  4     Recommendation

  4.1   The Authority is recommended     toapprove   the   ex   gratia   payment
         respect of Superintendent Murray.

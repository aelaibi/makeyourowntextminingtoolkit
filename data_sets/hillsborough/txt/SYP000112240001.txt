           a gg re ss iv e       and    very hostile           I felt more          towards    us.     However,          I did

           not feel         un e a s y as       this    is usual         practice.        I have a t t e n d e d many

           injured were            being        carried away.

           Apart        from the        number     of deaths and bo d i l y              injuries     it a p p e a r e d to be

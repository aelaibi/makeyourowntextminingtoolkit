It was after liidday b e f o r e they were                      opened.      B e t w e e n the     opening          of

the    t urnstiles and about S . 30                   pm the N o t t i n g h a m Forest      suppo r t e r s

fi l tered        into the gr o u n d without               large queues      being     formed.           T h e r e was

no    public       disorder.           It was     obvious      however      that many fans            had been

d r i nking and many were                in a boistrous           mood.     Numerous        fans      tried to

enter     the ground wit h              cans     of alcohol,       all    were    c o n f i s c a t e d and

disposed          of.      Several      soft     drink      cans and     large    banners were            also

confiscated.               One   of my officers a rr e s t e d one man who w as                    obviously

too drunk          to be a ll o w e d        in the ground.          Several     ticket      touts were

m o v e d on and          I v e r b a l l y w ar n e d one    not to sell        tickets     allocated             to

the N o t t i n g h a m Forest          end to a Liverpool             Supporter.

From 2 . 3 0       pm onwards          the     crowd star t e d to build up outside                   the

m i ll i n g ar o u n d without          tickets,        hoping    either     to buy one         or

gain entry to the ground by some way.

wanted        the    turnstile       closed so that           no one       could    cause        trouble      a fter       I

I then took my serial                   into   the Spion H o p down to the front and                       through

a metal          gate onto       the    pitch.      There was        plenty of       room at        the front          of

the S p i o n Hop and our ac c e s s               to the      pitch was      easily gained.

I looked across                the L e p p i ng s Lane       end and saw an         increasing         number         of

side of the goal.           The players and referee had left the Ditch.

To g e t h e r    with other        o f f icers    I walked a c r o s s      the    pitch to the L e p p i n g s

Lane     end.          On arrival       I saw that       the fan/      in the       centre     pen w e re        in

serious          trouble witjq ma/iy being crushejjr.    I first saw the ones at                                  the

front.           They were pressed up a g a i nst/'t he wire f e n c i n g . Some had

their      eyes        shut,    some were      going     blue,      some were       trying     to    protect

others,          all were       in a very distr e s s e d          state.     Immediately           behind       the

ones at          the front,       who were ma i n l y still           on their       feet    there appears*

to be a heap of bodies                   on top of each other.

I. saw several            police       offi c e r s and a few        civilians       on the fencing

trying        to assist         people    over     the top onto        the    pitch.,

I saw fans             '/X, the rear of the terracing being l ifted on to the stand

above.        Mne       fans at the       rear     however      in the m a i n were         just     s t a nding

there     ground and making               no effort       to move      out    of the     enclosure         to

release          the    pressure.

To g ether        with other        officers       from my serial           I went    to the        fenc i n g    to

give what          I a s s is ta nc e    I could.        1 stood on the            boundary wall         up

a g ai ns t      the fencing        I s ho u t e d to the fans at            the    rear to move          back        to

relieve          te pressure at          the front.          T h e # didn't take any notice.                     In

Comp a n y w ith othe r offic e r s               I ass ijfX e d one y o u t h over         the     fence.        He

was    shaky and          in a state        of s h o t \<.    He   did not appear           to foe s e r i o u s l y

hurt     he had been            lucky to be mn top of the               pile       of fallen        people.

I then        saw that a ytetai g a t ^ to the                rear    of the goal        netting        was

  to    revive      the youth.

  I d e c i d e d at this         point      that    things were         getting a bit             chaotic.

  P e o pl e were mill i n g around.                 Some were        crying avid in a d i s t r e s s e d

  state.         Most    police       o f f ic ers were       either     employed       on r e covering               people

  from the        crowd or trying             to a d minister         first    aid to people               lying          on

  the    pitch.         Some    supp o r t e r s    were    becoming      very aggressive,                 b laming            the

  police       for what had happened.                    This o b v i o u s l y didn't         help the             rescue

  p o s i t iv el y help.

  There were           so many     people         on the    pitch by this            time    it was        becoming

  very    con g e s t e d near        to the goal          ar e/r\     I d e c i d e d that there were

  I m o v ed a w a y from the           fence and began to               circulate          ar o u n d    the       people

  lying        on the    pitch.        1 ch ecked to make              sure   everyone who               could       be

  h e l p e d was      receiving a t te ntion.              I inst r u c t e d one      or two fans                 on how

  to    resusc i t a t e who were            not doing        it properly.

pulling atT^tfhs^f erice.               We   started to and someone              shouted,    " H e ’s dead".

We    pulled     the f e n ^      and    it started snapping;             it     folded and    I held it

back while        they    pas^eNd a body t h r o u gh the fence                  to the Police on the

the    lads     look for his        brother;          we had left of our own a c co r d at that

I thought        the kick-ofrf should have                been delayed due to the a mo u nt             of

people,       and that      the    crowd should have             been org an is ed better        outside

P olice    or stewards         to keep fans            going down the          tunnel,   and that     they

should have acted quicker when it did'^trappen,

                          HILLSBOROUGH JUDICIAL INQUIRY


                                  INTRODUCTION



The video schedules have all been prepared by the West Midlands Police
Video/Photographic Section of the Hillsborough Judicial Inquiry for the purpose
of assisting the work of the section. They only include salient points and not
detailed descriptions and should only be used as a guide to the content of the
tape. The following points are included to assist in their understanding.

1.        Reference numbers have been derived from the initials of the
           cameraman operating the video camera in most cases. Other reference
          numbers have been derived from the initials of the person compiling
           the tape where relevant and others have been derived dependent on
           their sources.

2.        Database time is that time shown on the video tape and displayed on
           the screen.

3.        Real time is the length of time into the tape from the beginning of
           it, calculated on real time video machines.

4.        There are two formats of video tape used, U-matic and VHS and this
          merely describes the physical nature of the tape used. U-matic
           tapes are of 1 hours duration, VHS tapes vary.

5.        The following serves as a brief guide to some of the more extensive
          video tapes scheduled:-

           MAP                BBC TV footage.

dependant on whether it is a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd generation copy.

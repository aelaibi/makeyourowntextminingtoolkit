      ntorni ng .

      There         was      no    trouble          at    the    pub at            t h is     time.

      Because           of    the       early       hour       the    licensee               opened          up    some       must       have    had

      th e    opportunity                to    drink       alcohol            for       about       5    hou r s .

      That        was       the    only       pub we       passed            on    our       way    home.

      My     brother          and       me    loaded       f ou r     or      five       trailer             load s      of    rubbish and

      took        it    to    the       tip    four       or    f iv e       times       in th e         n e xt     two       hours       and    on all

      occasions              I saw       supporters             drinking            alcohol             outside          the      Five     Archers

      Public           House.

      The     number          of       cars    on    this       car      park       increased                every       t ime      we    passed       the

      pub     but       I could          not       see    how    many         w e r e in          the    pub.

      After         taking         the       last    load       of       r u b b i s h at         about      IS m i d - d a y ,       me    and       my

      by     the       football          ground          during       this         t ime      and       so    I did       not       see    any    build

      About         f ive     past       3    ( p Q 5 ) t hat         afternoon               I needed             some       materials          for

      the     work          I was       doing       and    me    and         my    brother          drove          in his         car     down

      The     main          Leppings          Ln    entrance             to       the    ground          is s l i g h t l y       to the        right

      of     t he      junction          with                            Rd,       on    the       opposite             side      of L e p p i n g s       Ln.

      When        we    got       to L e p p i n g s      Ln    apd      I    saw what             I believe             to    be    between          one

      and     two       thousand             supporters/ stretching                          around          the    main       entrance

      towards           the       roadway.

      They        seemed          to    be    trying       to    get         into       the       match.

      I could           not       see    if    the       gates       were         open       or    cl o s e d .

      There         was      no    trouble          or    disorder            &&    far       as     I could            see    at    this       time.

      I could           see a b o u t         twenty       policemen               on    foot       or       horseback           around         the

      As     fa r      as    I could          see    at    this       time,         the       Police          were       not      having        any

In m y      opinion       there          were       considerably               more      supporters                   in the a r e a

after       kick-off          time       than       normal        match        days.

Normally          most    are       inside          the     ground        by    t h at     time.

I do       not    know what             the    situation           wa s    at    the      same        match           last      y ear,      as

we    w e re a w a y     from       home.

We    turned       left       into       Leppings           Ln    drove        into      P e n i s t on e        Rd    turning         r i gh t

and     went      down    in       front       of     the    football           ground.

At    Penistone          Rd    side       at       t hi s   time       I believe             all      gates were                closed       and

between          100 a n d     200       supporters              were     talking            to      p o l i c e in the a r e a .

There       was    no    trouble          there.            Me a n d      my    brother             went     to       various         stores

towards          Sheffield          City       Centre        a n d we      drove         backalong                Middlewood               Rd,

le ft      into H o m e       Ln    to    a    builders           merchants           where          Ib o u g h t       s ome    items

and     then      drove       back       along        Middlewood           Rd.        A Police             Officer            was     at    the

junction          of M i d d l e w o o d       Rd     and    Catchbar           Ln.        He       was    on a m o t o r           bike       and

directing          traffic          sending           us    straight           along      Mi ddle wood Rd                 and       stopping

us    going       down Leppings                Ln.

So    we    parked       up    in M i d d 1 e w o o d        Rd.        This     was      about           3 . 2 0 prn.

Me    and    my    brother          left       the      car a n d       walked        back          into     Leppings            Ln a n d

were       met    by t h o u s a n d s        of    people        in    the     roadway and                footpaths             a n d at

t h e g r o u n d e n t r a n c e ,,

They       were    mostly          football           supporters,              I believe             most        were     Liverpool

supporters.

I saw       two    uniformed             police         officers          standing          on       the     edge        of     the

footpath          in L e p p i n g s      Ln       about     20 yards           from      the        junction with

C a t c h pole     Ln.

These       two    officers             just       stood     there        and    were       taking           a    lot     of     verbal

abuse       from     a   lot       of    supporters              who    were     using          a    lot     of       swear      words         to

them       and    shouting          that       it w a s      Yorkshires            fault            it h a d all          happened.

I di d not         know       at    thi s      I iine w h a t      had     happened.

                                                                                                                                        5753

There       was       no    fighting          as       such,    just       a bit          of    pushing            and a       l o ad    of

shout in g .

I also       saw a          policeman             on    horse       back       in    the       d r i v e w a y at        the    Leppings

Ln,     He       was       right       in the          middle       of    t hi s     large        crowd.

People       were          spitting          at    him and          his    horse          and     s w e a r iryq a n d         stout i ntL-

abuse       at    him,                                                                                    /

This      officer           was       heavily          surrounded          by       the    crowd/ .

There       were       other          police       officers          on    f o ot     and       on     horse        b ac k     around         the

area      in a m o n g s t        the       crowd,        they were            just       standing            there       as    if      in

shock.

Me    and    my       brother          managed          to    get    through          the       crowd and            went       home.

We    did    not       return          to    the       area    around          Leppings           Ln    u n ti l     about        6pm

(18 0 0 )    when          I went       with my           brother         to    get       his     car.

By    this       time       it w a s        quiet       in L e p p i n g s      Ln.

Neither          me    nor       my    brother          we re a s s a u l t e d       or       abused         as    we    made       our w a y

home    through             the       crowd.

I would          like       to    say       that       on m a t c h e s    normally             the     po lice ,         as    far      as    I

am    concerned,             do       a good       job and are             very       courteous,               w el l     99%     of     the

t ime .

I did       not       see    really          how       the    police       handled             the     match        on the        13 A p r i l

1989      (150489),

I say       t hat      the       police       do a g o o d          job    on m a t c h         days.

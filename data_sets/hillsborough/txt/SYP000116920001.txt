                      I commenced duty at              0830 on Saturday 15 April      19S9 at El,

                      Na e ke nth or pe. where         I joined   colleagues to form Serial    13, under     the

                      direct command of Police Sergeant 2001 Burmart,                   We arrived as a

                      serial at Hillsborough Football Ground at 0930 and attended the

                      general     briefi ng at         1000 hours given b y Chief Superintendent

                      Duckenfie1d .        Meal   times     for out serial was set at 1500 hours and we

                      were    provided with a snack meal                immediately following briefing.



                      We made our way to the West Stand to take u.p our designated positions

                      at   1115 in plenty of time before the opening of the ground to the

                      p u b 1 i c a t 1200 n o o n .



                      Together with Police Constable                10 Mercer,    I went to Gangway U in the

                      West Stand at the Leppings Lane end.                   Our position was to the left of

                      the goal when looking at the pitch?                  almost directly above gate 2 in
                                                                                                                                  PAGE

the     perimeter          fence.



Our duties wer e                to:-



•1)                S top       fans     climbing           over       the      fence        separating            the     north end

of     the s tand from the                   raised s e c t i o n of t e rracing                         (overlooking             gates

6 and 7         in the         perimeter           fence)



2.                 Prevent        fans        from throwing               items from the stand onto                            the

pitch,        or onto          fans below.



3.                 Supervise            the     use       of     the     e m e r g e n c y gate s i t u a t e d at               the

front       corner        of    the N o r t h end of the West S t a n d .                                 (above gat $ t.} i n

the     pelmeter          fence).            Two      stewards wer e also                      near to the             gate      (one      ii

training).



At this         time       (and up to            phase two)              there were only eleven                          officers

(Serial         13 c o n s i s t e d       of    12 officers,                 plus S e r g e a n t » but was                 depleted

by one due            to illness)               in the West Stand,                       w hich has a capacity of

about       three       thousand           five       hundred.,            At     phase        two,      we were         to be

r e l ieved       by Serial           16 to go for meal                       (three         o'clock).



The     times       listed h e reafter                  are as a c c u r a t e as                I can mak e          them,             — I

           youths      seen at the          rear       of    the    raised t e r racing       climbing

           removing        the    barbed wire.               Moving    thro u g h the      crowds at

           this    time,       in an effort            to stop those w i s h i n g         to climb over

           the    fence,       it was obvious               that    large    numbers     had been

           Looking        down onto the -terracing,                   it was    obvious       that the

           c b n t r © s e c tions were        o v e r crowded.         F e r sons were       c l imbing

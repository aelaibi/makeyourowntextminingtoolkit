  Senior Sub Divisional Clerk

  South Yorkshire Police



  I am employed as Senior Sub Divisional Clerk at Hammerton Road Police

  Station and have held this post since January 1986.

  Over the last eight years,          I have worked on numerous major football

  matches and carried out my duties either at Hammexton. Road Police

  Station or the Sheffield Wedn e s d a y Football Ground.

^^At   the 1988 Semi Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest,                       I

  worked in the police caravan dealing with property confiscated from

  Liverpool supporters.           This year I was asked if I had any preference

  to which side I would like to work on, and I chose to do the

  Nottingham Forest property, due to it being very quiet last year.

  At 9.30 am on Saturday 15 April 1989,              I commenced duty at the

  Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground and took up position in the                         'Owls

  Shop'   dealing with c o n f i s c a t e d .p r o p e r t y , together with Police

  Constable 3063 Marshall.           It wasn't particularly busy property wise,

^so    we kept ourselves busy talking to the Nottingham Forest fans, who

  in my opinion,          didn't appear to have had too much to drink.                 They

  were in a jovial and carnival mood.

  At approximately 2.50 pm the majority of fans had taken up their

  places in the ground.

  Police Constable Marshall and I were in possession of a personal

  radio and we were listening for any instructions                  that we might

  receive.
At 3-02 pm it seemed as though all hell had let loose.                                        Polic-e Constable

Marshall       and I couldn't            quite     understand what was              happening.             We could

hear Police Sergeant 616 Goddard shouting and asking for the match to be

stopped.        We could not make out what was happening at all.                                   Then we heard

over the personal radio that there were dead people which came as a shock

to us both.          We stood and listened to everything that was going off but I

cannot       remember       details      of    what     was    actually         said    over       the      personal

radio.

The Nottingham Forest fans                    started milling around again and kept asking

us if the match would be called off and we said we thought it would be.

At    approximately          4.30   p.m.       Police     Constable        Ryan     made      an     announcement

over     the     tannoy      that     the      match     had     been      called       off    and       would     all

spectators please remain in their seats to enable the emergency services

to gain access to and egress from the ground.

In my     view       the   supporters         did not     take       any notice        of Police           Constable

Ryan's       instructions.            Everybody         started       moving      away        from    inside       the

ground.         By     approximately          5.00     p.m.     the     Nottingham         Forest          fans    had

evacuated the ground.

Police Constable Marshall                 stayed in the             caravan until        5-15 p.m.          in case

any latecomers wanted'their property.

At    approximately          5-20   p.m.      we   made       our    way   to    the    gymnasium           to    seek

permission from either Chief Inspector Beal or Inspector Sewell to return

to Hammerton Road Police Station.

As we were stood near to the gymnasium I turned just as bodies were being

brought out of one of the emergency services vehicles into the gymnasium.

I    stood     for    a    minute   in    deep     shock       and    realised      I    must        get    back    to

Hammerton Road Police Station to deal with whatever I could as I knew an

incident room would have to be set up.
I approached Inspector Sewell and he instructed Police Constable Marshall

and    myself     to       return    to    Hammerton       Road   Police       Station      to    deal     with

relatives and friends of supporters who might be missing.

I     arrived    back        at     Hammerton      Road     Police   Station        at      approximately

5.50    p.m.          My    first     duties    were       to   gather    as    much     stationery         and

equipment       for    use    in    the    incident    room.      I then       checked whether           other

civilians would be available                   to work longer hours and make arrangements

for reliefs for the switchboard and on the enquiry desk.

I   took   it    upon       myself    to    open    the    canteen   in    order       to   make     tea    for

friends and relatives of the missing supporters.

From approximately 7.30 p.m. onwards, I carried out duties on the enquiry

desk    dealing        with   people       trying     to   contact   relatives         and       friends    and

advising them which hospital to contact.

I remained at Hammerton Road Police Station until 11.00 p.m. carrying out

duties that were required of me.

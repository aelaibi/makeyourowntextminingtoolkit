Whilst           on t h i s    Phase        several          supporters            were       seen        trying           to    swap

tickets.               One    man was          surrounded             by a b o u t      6    supporters               on    the      pet r o l

station           forecourt.              Together           with         another       Officer           Y attended               in     case

of    trouble           and     found       a man         selling          a ticket          for/thirty-five                     pou n d s .

The    ticket           sold,       the     people         parted          company. ^ B e i n g              at    t his        l o c a t i o n we

had    quite           a few       fans     from         both    sides          wanting       to       ’s w a p ’ .        Two     vehicles,

one    a dark           Ford       Granada          MK2 and          I believe          a Capri,             stopped            and asked

for    the        location          of a       pub,       which       I wa s      told was             towards         Wadsley            Bridge

on    the        right.        The       men    said       t hat      they were             meeting          someone            with

tickets.

I. a l s o       saw    several          f a ns,     mainly          1S--30 y e a r s ,       carrying             4-packs           of    beer/

lager        and       drinking          w hilst         walking          towards       the       Ground.

I heard a message                    over       my       personal          radio       about       a    public, hou s e ,               Not t s .

Forest           side,       being       wrecked          and a ss is tan ce            cal l e d ,      w h i c h was           dealt        with

and    calls           to    two    separate             pubs    to       do w i t h    supporters                drinking           outside

the    public           houses.

Shortly           before       3    pm    (1500          hrs),       I heard a message                    to      close         Leppings

Ln,    due        to    the    volume          of    people          outside       the       turnstiles.                   The     r o a d was

subsequently                 closed       by O f f i c e r s         on    the    actual          roundabout               duty.

About        3    pm    (1500      hrs)        our       serial       gathered          on    the       corner         of L e p p i n g s

time    I heard a mes                      e that          there          was    crushing          at    the        ates         and      c o uld

Over       next       fe w minutes' s e v e r a l                 message's          from,        I believe         a

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t , were             made       to     be a l l o w e d       to    open     the     gate.          All

refused,             u n til      the    last        message           t hat       was,      "If we        d o n ’t get       these      gates

the       gates".

It w a s        obvious           that     something              was       wrong       at    these        gates    and       our

Inspector             decided           to a t t e n d         the G r o u n d ,        bringing           into    effect        Phase        2

As    a    serial          we a t t e n d e d        the       gXtes        a nd    I saw       several/tlorses               and a      few

supporters,                s o me    100 at          n u rs t.      We w e r e       requestejyto              cordon         off    the

quite       a f e w P o l i c e ^officers                      there        at     this      time.

An ambulance                 was     called          for,         to       this    gate.         Upon       its a r r i v a l ,     a couple

of m i n u t e s        later,          the      driver and attendant                          did    not     seem      to    know what

was       happening,              stopping           on    the      r oa d       outside.            Further       call       made      for

ambulance             and      it w e n t       into       the      entrance            to    position marked                 K J L1.      As

the       supporters              outside        were          extremely            quiet,        I turned         to w a t c h      the

ambulance.                 I saw        two      p e o p l e led into               the      back     of    the    vehicle.

Another          ambulance              was      c alled a nd I was                  sti l l       watching        a m b u l a n c e No.          1.

I saw a y outh                 carried          to     the       rear       of     this      vehicle,        thrown       on the         floor

and       jumped        upon.           I thought              he wa s       fighting           and was        being         restrained.

into       the       b ack     of    this       vehicle           and       I saw 3          people        working       on    him,

trying          to    save        his    life.            I said           to PC     WELCH,         standing        next       to me,

crowded          with       bodies          I had       to    stand        on     people          l aid    behind        the      goal

mouth.           We    b ent      down       to w o r k       on     t his      person,           w hen we were            told        to

leave       it    by       the man          in the       jumper          and     trousers,            whom        I b e l i e v e d was        a

doctor.

I    was    then       told       to      stand        in the        terrace          with        other Officers.                  I looked

around       but       could          not    find any             of m y     serial.              I left      the       terrace         and

walked       onto          the    field.           I was          s h o u t e d at      by g r o u p s       of    fans,        who     blamed

me    personally                for    opening          the       gat e.        Several           youths      walked        to me a n d

showed       me       tickets          that       had    not       been      checked.

Obviously             these       were       the       people        pushing          at     the     (jates       before        th e    game

started,          but       I said          nothing          as    they were            alr&ady           in f i g h t i n g      mood.        I

did    find myself                arguing          at    one       stage        w i t h jk    youth.          He w a s      with        two    or

three       others.              He w a s        shouting          about        the     line       of P o l i c e       across         the

halfway          line       and       the    fact       t hat      supporters               were     carrying           dead      to    the

gym.        The y o u th was                ushered          away      by a n      older          man,     s t ill      a Liverpool

supporter.                 I was       then       aware       that       I had        become         the     centre        of

attraction             for       about       a    dozen       supporters,               some       trying         to    calm      the

situation,             others          shouting.              I then         felt       a    p ush    in the           back?      I turned

to    find       PC    McF A R L A N E       and       another,          unknown,            Officer         stood       by m y        side.

We    then withdrew                   from       the    confrontation.

A Superintendent                      was    now walking              around          the     field,         asking        Officers           to

try    to    clear          the       field       if w e      could,         without          incident.                Anyone      not

wanting          to    leave          should       be    just        left.         We       did    this      duty       u n til    the

message          over       the       speakers          said       the     game       was     postponed and would

supporters             leave          the    stadium          in a n       orderly           manner.          Together            with

PC    McF A R L A N E , I left               the       Ground        via L e p p i n g s          Ln and w a l k ed         back        to    the

roundabout             for       Phase       3.

Some       two    or       three       minutes          later        we w e r e       joined         by P S A S H T O N         and     the

remainder             of    the       serial.

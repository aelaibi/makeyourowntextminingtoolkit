We    arrived           in S h e f f i e l d           at       about       1.4 5       pm    (1345)          and     parked           both          cars

As    we    walked         into           Lappings              L n we      went        to    go       to a    c hi p       shop       near          to   the

who    said        there         were          to o    many       people           outside.

We    then       started             to    queue           up    to    e n t er     the       t e r r a c e s N , u r n s t i 1 es at                about

about       20     people            in f r o n t          of    us.        There        was       a    police        officer              on    each

queue      was     taking along           time      to move.           We    had to wait       for about          five       to

ten minutes            and     I have     been      in    larger       queues w h i c h have         taken half             the

time     to move.            I could see about              thirty          police    officers       in the area

around       the t u r n s t i l e s    including a p p r o x i m a t e l y          four mounted.          They were

not d i r ecting          though as at             the    time    I ente r e d everyone            was

making        there way         into    the ground without                   difficulty.

I cannot         remember        seeing any stewards                   outside       the ground.

We    had no d i f f i c u l t y       in finding          the    turnstile we had to enter through

because       we       had been so m a n y times                before.        We    had no d i f f i c u l t y    in

entering.

We all        entered        thro u g h the        t urnstiles and at               this    time   I saw no gates

open and did             not    see any u n a u t h o r i s e d        entry to the ground.

I handed my ticket                 into      the    ground, and         retained the          stub.      I have

        early 's4<age a number                   of    people         had begun             to    climb out         of    pen 4 at       the

Police       Officers         sl o w l y    increased and            freed the fans along               the     running

track.         More      people      c o ntinued to climb over and the                      number       of fans

i n creased        to the      point where            because        of sheer       numbers      they moved          onto

the    grass and a r o u n d           by the North             Stand.       Until at about 3.05               pm

Once     the game was            s t o p p e d the      number       of fans was       such that         they

e n c r o a c h e d more and more              onto    the    pitch and         I saw a number           of     police

o f f icers       f o r cibly d r a gging         people      off     the    pitch    in the      corner are a

f ormed      by the West and Nor-1h Stands .                          By this       t ime there were           swarms

of    people       coming      over        the front       of the fencing and the                 side fencing.

A number          of    people      climbed from Pen 4 into Pe n 5 and began to move

out    of    pen 5 onto          the       pitch via         the     e m e r g e n c y door at    the    front.

T here was a polcie                 officer       standing at          the gate and he            let a number of

people       out       onto   the    pitch.         However        he then      closed the        gate    for       some

unknown        reason and tried                to keep       people        in Pen 5„

A fter      about       two minu t e s       this     gate was        opened again

 by a policeman,                  1 d o n ’t know        if it was       the same        officer,        and    people

 moved        out       of    pen 3 onto         the   pitch.

 This was about                 3.10      pm    (1510)    and we now realised that                     people were

 being        hurt.           Fans      that    climbed over          into   pen 6     by us were         sitting       down

 and v i s i b l y distressed.                    A number       of the      fans who      had    climbed from Pen

 At     this    time \ here              were a numbe\          of    police    officers within               pen 5

 were     doing.

 This     Pen 5 then began                     to fill    up itself and          I. was    becoming more              of a

 and so        I climbed out               into Pe n 6.          At this       point     I could see a police

 officer at the e m e r g e n c y gate                    in pen 5 helping             people who were            visibly

 also a fan on the                      pitch side       of the gate         helping.         I then saw a police

I. said to        him,      " W e ’re trainee       nurses,      we     want     to help,"         He just

looked at         us and       Ihad to repeat            this a number          of times.         I     then said,

"Look w e ’re trained               in r e s u s c i t a t i o n were    can we help,"           He then said

n othing and          inclined       his     head to the       pitch and said,             ''Help

yourselves."             I d o n ’t know       if the      pol i c e m a n was     in shock himself.

There        was a whole        row of bodies            of o b v i o u s l y dead or dieing            people.

One     or two       of who m had jumpers             or shirts         over    there    faces.

I then went           to the      nearest      person who wasn't               being a t t e n d e d    to and had

not     been    covered over.

He was a white              lad w i t h fair short          hair,       in his early teens wearing

jeans and         either a red or white T shirt,                        thin build.          There was         no one

w:i.th hirn at all.

I went        to this       lad and        first   of all     checked his groin for any stains,

because        if he had died w ith either a full                        bladder      or bowel         he w ould of

either        u r i nated    or defecated,            There was         no stain of the          groin area

I. then pulled           his hsTaStN^ip^hi ch was             lying      on its side.          At      this    point,

I saw either an a m b u 1ance man or fireman,                            though he was          not wearing

the y e l l o w      trousers       that     1 saw other       fire m e n wearing,          walk       passed.          1

called to him and said,                     " I ’m not    p r e pared to       let this     guy go are

you."         He said       "No."      I said,      "Do you want          to do      cardiac mas s a g e . "

He     said,    "I'll       do m o u t h    to mouth."s

One     of them knelt           down       on the other       side      from me and the other                 one

came     round my side.              I got     up to      let him       past.      As he bent          down I went

to     see    if there was anyone              else      unattended,

               I then w a l k e d behind            the goal       past a few bodies.                 I looked at their

               chests      to see       if there was any sign                 of breathing          but       there was        none,

               T h e n on the far side              of the       goal   on the S o u t h Stand side                  I saw a        lad

               kn e e l i n g    by a girl       who a pp e a r e d     to be his        girlfriend.           He was

               shouting,          "Don't     let her       be d e a d . ”     Over and       over a gain and then he

               looked at me and              shouted,       "Tell me she's             not    dead."

               I then knelt          down by her           legs and         reached up to her wrist and                      took        he

               pulse.           I couldn't       feel a     pulse.          The    lad was      still     knelt       by her        body

               and    I couldn't          get    to the     far side         of her      because      there were            other

               bodies.

               I t h ere fore       bodily       pushed him aside             and he      then stood up out of my

               way.      He was        c o n t i n u a l l y shouting       louder     to the effect            of    'Don't        let

               her    be d e a d . '

               I then       checked her m o u t h          for false         teeth or vomit           but      it was       clear,

               then     commenced         both m o u t h    to m outh        r e s u s c i t a t i o n with    cardiac massage

               a m b u 1ance m a n .       I said to him           “Can you do           resuscitation. 11             He    nodded,

               said,      "Can you. do          it by yours e l f . "

               He a g a i n      nodded with o u t       saying a n y thing and              took a step towards                   her.

               The    boy f r i e n d or brother           was    still      by her      screaming.

               I then got          up and went         to see      if there was anyone                else      unattended.

dark     brown        long    curly h a i r.        He was       lying        on the ground w ith                 people

milling        ar o u n d him but        not      helping.

I could see            that     his

                                                                               His       red shirt         had been

rolled up to            the top of his             chest.        It a p p e a r e d       to be a Liverpool

shirt      but    I cannot        be    certain as         it was       rolled up.

The man had

                       I then      put rriy head on his              chest and            couId feel         no heart

beat.            got as much                                                                    as    I could and         then

put     his    head back         in a straight            position and              began m outh to m outh w i t h

alternate         ca r diac m a s s a g e .        I c o ntinued this               for what          seemed an

eternity*.            I cannot        say how      long.       But    got      no       result at all.

T h e r e was     no blood on a n y of the                 bodies and after a long time,                             I

nothi n g .

I then stop p e d trying                to revive         the man and            looked around, the scene

a nd    realised        it was        hopeless.                           \         j     /)         I

I then        left     the man a n d       saw a number           of fans           pulling down the

advertising            hoarding and using              it as m a k e s h i f t           stretchers.             I saw two

guys     on the        far    side     of the goals         then P e n 4 side,                  trying      to    lift    one

man     I then went           over a n d helped           them    carry him tothe far                     side      of    the

pitch where            the a m b u l a n c e s    were waiting.

The man was            in his e arly twenties,                 slim build wearing                    jeans and a

b u I k y c:o a t .

We     then    put     the m a k e s h i f t     s t retcher     down    some           other    people      got him off

the     s t r e t c h e r and    then sorne amb u l a n c e men               carne over to look                 at h i m .

 We     then     ran back w i t h        the      hoarding.

At    this     time     there was a lot of              people wit h a d v e r t i s i n g                   hoardings and

a    lot of      c o nfusion        in the    corner area             formed by the West S tand and

S o u t h Stand.

People       were     getting        in each others way and                         the    police       tried to form

two    cordons        with h o ardings         to allow a gap and easy access                                  for   the

rnake s h i f t stretchers.

We    then     put    down the        hoard i n g we     had brought                     back and \          then went        over

to a group           in frorrt of the goal              on the south stand side. \ a                             man had

already        been     loaded onto          hoarding- and            I then             picked up the front with

it beh i n d my back and we                  ran across        nL o          the    far side.

1 cannot         describe       this man.

We then        put him onto the              gr o u n d and     returned the hoarding                          to the West

Stand    end where            the    police     put    it on     its side and used                       it to form a

cordori for          clearer        access.

1 then       returned to the            eme r g e n c y gate          in Pe n 5, went               in and then

I cannot         say what       time we       left the gr o u n d but                     it was about          five

minutes        after a loud speaker a n n o u n c e m e n t                        saying       there    had been a

The     delays      on the       roads on the way          to the game were                  far        heavier            than I

e x p e c t e d and most         other     people.         At    the     two      delays      I was          involved       in

on the      far     s i de of M a n c h e s t e r and G 1o s s o p , the re were

expected          them to     inform       the     police at S h e f f i e l d          to expect a large

number      of     people     to be       late.      The       roads    near       to the      ground were             not

b l o c k e d off as       they are at           other     grounds,         where we          parked          in Ferr i b y

Rd     is only a short            distance        from     the ground,             and though it made                  us

easier      for     us    it allows          a    lot of people          to get        near    the ground without

tickets       very easily.          When        I have     been to grounds abroad,                           people    have

been     stopped on foot a w a y                from the ground and. checked for                              their

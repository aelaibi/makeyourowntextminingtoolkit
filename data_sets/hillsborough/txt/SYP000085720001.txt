                    was     reasonably           clear,       the   weather was           dry and sunny.

                    On arrival          at      the stad iu m there was                no one     there   to meet      us w h i c h    I

                 I ran down the                road to the end of the stadium where                                  the    police

                 a iia r s ha 11.

                 I proceeded onto                    the   pitch the         crowd had not m oved at all.                       The    pitch

                 Once     on the        pitch          I asked several            police         officers who was             in charge

                 and where            the    casualties were               being m oved              to - they       couldn't    tell me.

                 It was       clear         to see that          no rescues as such                       needed doing,       but bodies

                 and    casualties             obviously         needed        removortf from the scene.                      I gave my

                 I spoke       briefly to S t at io n Officer SWAIN who                                    informed me he was          having

                 d if f i c u l t y    in getting             to 'Una    incident.              I informed him I was at the

                 actual       incident.                It wars obvious          to me we were going to need more

                 men than the               initial        turnout and there w ou ld be an urgent                             need for

                 resuscitators.                      1 then    lost     contact with him and my own drivers,                            I

                 sent a Liverpool                    fan with a message               to my drivers                to make    pumps    10,

                 this he did,               but       in the mea n time S t at io n Officer SWAIN had a lr ea dy

                 sent     the message.

At    this    point       I contacted Frn                  the driver of Central            1 and asked

proceeded to try to get the most                      urgent      cases trajjj^ported to this

casualty handling area,                 a p p r ox i ma t el y 20 J ^ r 3 0    persons were

approx imately            10 persons were        t^Sfken off the field by ambulance.

At    this    stage Fire me n from Dsse-riall and R i ng i n g l o w were arriving and

giving       first aid.         This was also         the time when ADO R Q BJ Q HN S / a r r i v e d on

been set up           in the    gym but there was a shortage                    of a mbulances - the

number       of serious         casualties was quite            low at this stage and the

decision was made              to    remove the      remainder       to the gym,        and discontinue

 RE«        DEFENDANTS   PSYCHIATRIC REPORTS - BULLETIN          19A

 If you have clients suffering from PTSD you will/ in the^normal
 course of events, have been asked for facilities for medical
 examination by the MMI.
 One of the Consultants whom they are using is a Dr.' Johnstone of
 Manchester and over the last few weeks we have been contacted by a _
 number of Solicitors giving instances of clients who have been upset
 and affected by Dr Johnstone's attitude during the examinations.
  As this clearly is not a "one off" we have told the MMI that we are
  advising all members not to agree to clients being examined by Dr
  Johnstone although no objection will obviously be taken to         : _
  examinations by any other Psychiatrist instructed by the Insur           ,
  those examinations to be on the . us-ual^.terms ■naroly toat-t o e     _
  appointment is made through the Solicitors and that the Solicitors
  are supplied with a copy of the report if the MMI intend to rely upon
 .it. ■
 I draw this m a t t e r to you attention and if you are given a n _ _ .
 appointment with Dr Johnstone for one of your clients, the MMI will
 be expecting a refusal.
  Every good wish to you for Christmas and the New Year.

  Yours sincerely,

  MISS E M STEEL

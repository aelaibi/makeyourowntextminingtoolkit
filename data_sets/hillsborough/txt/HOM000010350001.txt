       HILLSBOROUGH   -   ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION

       SCOPE FOR AMENDING THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL

       Mr Turney (who is in North America until 17 May) asked me to
       follow up with you the thoughts in the fifth paragraph of the
       record of the Home Secretary's meeting on 24 April. We were
       asked there to discuss with DOE the possibility of the Football
       Spectators Bill being amended so that the requirement for all
       seated accommodation could be built into the safety arrangements
       which fall under the Home Office umbrella of the Safety of Sports
       Grounds Act 1975, rather than in the licenceto be issued under
       the Bill by DOE.

       2. In fact Mr Mould and I had raised this issue in a preliminary
       way with DOE officials at a meeting on 21 April to discuss their
       ideas about consultations with the football authorities on the
       concept of all seated accommodation.

       3. At the meeting DOE reiterated that their Bill would be
       amended so that a requirement that spectators should be seated
       could be put in the licences to be issued by the Secretary of
       State for the Environment (or his nominee); the main purpose of
       the licences will be to require clubs to implement a football
       membership scheme.

       4. We suggested to DOE that logically and practically it would
       make more sense for the requirement for all seated accommodation
       to be within the context of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
       1975, and we asked whether the Bill could be amended to allow
       this.

       5. DOE undertook to consult their legal advisers.    The answer
       we have received is negative. We have been told that Parlia­
       mentary Counsel's view is that the House authorities, who had
       bent over backwards to accommodate the Government's wish to amend
       the Bill to build in the all seated requirement, would be very
       unlikely to agree that the Bill should amend the 1975 Act because
       such a change would not be based on the present structure of the
       Bill, whereas the amendment already envisaged would be. We were
       told that Parliamentary Counsel would not wish to consult the
       House authorities again.

       6. Mr Turney's view is that, in the light of what was said at
       the Home Secretary's meeting on 24 April, the Home Office should
       now press Parliamentary Counsel, either direct or through tSSE^s
                                        l

       legal advisers, to ascertain from the House authorities whether
       the Football Spectators Bill could be used to amend the 1975 Act.
       He would be grateful if you would pursue the point. If you were
       to decide to go direct to Parliamentary Counsel we would need to
       tell DOE what we were doing.

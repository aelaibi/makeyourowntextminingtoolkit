      HILLSBOROUGH:     CORRESPONDENCE FROM MR PATNICK OBE MP
      As requested a draft reply is enclosed for Mr Patten's signature
      to the attached correspondence from Mr Patnick MP.

      2.   The Government have already welcomed the thoroughness of the
#     Interim Report and Mr Patnick concedes that it does not gloss
      over the causes of the events which took place on that fateful
      day. Whilst the main criticism of the report is levelled at the
      police, they are not the only ones who are criticised.         Both
      Sheffield City Council and the football club (together with the
      club's professional advisers) are the subject of criticism.     Nor
      does the report overlook contributory factors such as the
      behaviour of fans outside the ground.       It will probably be as
      well to comment on these in a general way in reply Mr Patnick.
      It seems unnecessary however     nnmmpi^t in detail on the list of
      individual points raised by              some of which appear to be
      rhetoric.

      3.   The cost of the Inquiry is being met by the Government.   It
      is the police investigation costs which are probably giving rise
      to              ^   ~
                      displeasure.  —            . . . .the position on
                                    The draft explains
      this.

      4.   The Inquiry has already said that it will be addressing
      wider, longer term issues such as perimeter fencing and pre-match
      drinking by football fans in the Final Report.        As for the
      constituent's comments about a disaster fund (to which the
      Government contributed), the tragedy touched the whole nation
      whose sympathy manifested itself by way of voluntary donations
      for the families of victims.
      5.      A draft reply is attached.

 I am now receiving various letters and I enclose one of
 these to you, which are creating the impression that "a
 whitewash" was the outcome of the Hillsborough disaster
 enquiry.    I know this not to be the case, and that work
 is still proceeding on this, but I have, to report that the
 feeling in Sheffield is running pretty high that South Yorkshire
 Police are a good police force and that they are not responsible
 for the tragedy that occurred.

 I did feel it was my duty to inform you of the situation
 and just enclose, as I stated previously, one sample letter.

               LETTER DRAFTED FOR SIGNATURE BY ...MR PATTEN.........
                                                  (NAME OF SIGNATORY)

               Thank you for your letter of 29 August to the Home Secretary
               with this one from :_______________ as an example of the
               feeling in Sheffield following the findings of the Interim
               Report of the Hillsborough Inquiry.

               As you say, any suggestion that the outcome of the Inquiry
               has glossed over the causes of the terrible events of that
               day is quite wrong.      The Inquiry did not set out to
               apportion blame for what happened but to find out the causes
               and make recommendations to prevent such an accident from
               happening again.   Although the police were criticised the
               Interim Report highlights several other contributory factors
               which led to the accident, for example the absence of an
               authorised maximum capacity for the pens, the layout of the
               crush barriers    and   inadequate   signs and ticketing.
               Criticism was not therefore confined solely to the police.

               The Report also concluded that a substantial minority of
               fans who had had too much to drink aggravated the problems
               outside the ground but that the evidence did not suggest
               that there was a very significant number of ticketless fans.
               The problems of pre-match drinking and fans without tickets
which will be considered in the second stage of the Inquiry
which is now addressing the more general, long term issues
of safety at sports events.


The immediate costs of the Hillsborough Inquiry will be met
in full by the Government.  With regard to the costs of the
investigations undertaken by the West Midlands police,
although their results were made available to Lord Justice
Taylor they were originally started at the initiative of the
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire as they concerned the
policing of his area.   In addition to the investigation of
policing and related events on the day, the investigations
by West Midlands police are necessary for the presentation
of evidence to the coroner's inquests, complaints and
discipline matters and, more recently, from allegations of
criminal liability.


The Government by way of police specific grant at 51% plus
block grant already pays a sizeable proportion of the costs
of policing in South Yorkshire.     However, in view of the
exceptional and unforeseen circumstances of the Hillsborough
tragedy, the Government has offered the South Yorkshire
Police Authority an additional special payment from central
funds to assist them with the additional costs they now face
in respect of the work carried out on their behalf by the
West Midlands police.


Finally,   the disaster fund,     to which the Government
contributed, was set up to receive donations from the public
wishing to express their sympathy for the family and friends
of victims of a national disaster.

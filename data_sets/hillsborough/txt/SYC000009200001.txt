        Dear Sirs,                        f

        Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990,


        If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
        of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
        on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
        due course.

        I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
        evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
        coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
        inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

        Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
        under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
        witnesses who wish to give evidence. I am at present engaged in considering
        this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

        Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
        to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
        appropriate details of any witness orwitnesses whom you would like me to
        consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

       May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
       attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

        I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
        names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
        to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

       I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
       heard from you by the end of'S^p-C^nber I will assume you have no names to
       submit.

       Yo^rs faithfully,




S I M M H.jf.£6roner.

Dear        oirs,

Re: GARY COLLINS (deceased) Bo.46*

I refer to my letter Reference SLP/JT/H/OO3 to which I have
not yet had a reply.

Nevertheless, I have written to you in accordance with the
terms of letter Reference SLP/JT/H/006 which is attached
hereto.

If for any reason you do not represent the bereaved family
or are unable to communicate with them, I would be grateful
if you could please let me know by return, so that I may
then if possible get in touch with a representative member
of the family.

I would also be obliged if I could have your reply to my
letter Reference SLP/JT/H/003 as soon as possible.


Yours faithfully,

Dear sirs,

R®! GARY GOIiLUi'S (deceased) Ho. 8                           £,
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner

  Dear Dr. Popper,

  Hillsborough Disaster
  Gary Collins (Deceased)

  Further to my telephone conversation with your secretary today, I
  would like to request on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. J. Collins that you
  make available a copy of the Post Mortem Report on Gary Collins.

  I have made arrangements with Mr. Philip Simms, A.E.D. Consultant at
  Walton Hospital, Liverpool, for him to take Mr. and Mrs. Collins
  through the Report and explain it to them, and I would, therefore,
  be grateful if you would forward the Report directly to Mr. Simms.

  His address is:                     Mr. Philip Simms,
                                      Consultant A.E.D.,
                                      Walton Hospital,
                                      Rice Lane,
                                      Liverpool,  L9 1AE,


  Yours sincerely,

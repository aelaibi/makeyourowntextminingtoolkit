North StaneNand           r eturned a short          time     later      t el ling us to go onto the

pitch.                   n.


As we went onto           t h e S ^ l a ^ i ng surf ac e   I could see that the                 crowd at the

L e p p i ng s Lane     end had       invaded the      pitch a nd the goal at that                     end was

not e asily visible.

We w a l k e d towards         this a r ea and on doing so,               saw several           persons          being

c ar ried a w ay on m ak e s h i f t      stretchers,        these      being a d v e r t i s i n g

hoardings.         We were        trven i nstructed to form a cordon a c ro s s                       the half

way    line to ensure           the faHs^ from the L e ppings Lane end did not get

close    to the o pposing             fans on the S p i o n Hop.

A fter a while          it became o b v i o u s \ h a t     s omet hi ng      seri ou s had h ap p en e d at

the Le pp in gs Lane           end,    so together ^ ^ h          PC FRY,       I went      towards         that

end.     On    reaching        the goal m outh       I could see various                people        laid on

the    ground and other            persons and       police       o ff ic er s a d m i n i s t e r i n g    first

aid.     There was also an amb ul an ce                there.        There was a great                deal       of

fans w a n d er in g around,           some   crying,      some    in a daze and some a p p e a r e d

to be the worse           for drink.          W ith PC FRY        I spoke       to one y o u th who

appeared       in a state         of shock     to a s c e r t a i n what      had h a p p e ne d but got no

At this stage           ifN^as       still       not   cheeriftg- that       persons        had    perished.           It

was at this           point    thabvPC \FRY and m y se lf were                 i ns tr u ct e d to return to

the    h alfway       line where          the    line was      still    being     held,         'he N o t t i n g h a m

made a charge           t owards         the Kop s ho u ti n g and s w ea ri ng at them.                   We held

the    line arid did not             permit        them to     pass.

piled on the a ccess               road at the           reX(; a nd    it became         clearer what           had

happened.

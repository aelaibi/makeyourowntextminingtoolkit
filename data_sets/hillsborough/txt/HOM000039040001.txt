                        These Further Submissions address specific points on the significance of the video
                1.
                        evidence. In order to appreciate the significance of this evidence, the extent to which
                            the the Coroner invited the jury to make findings contrary to those made by Lord
                            Taylor must be appreciated.       This can only be done by carefully comparing his

                            summing - up with Lord Taylor’s Keport.


                            Tht.           nf the « -« prior to 2.53pm The argument that the video evidence is
                2.
                            irrelevant, because the police had good views from the control box and the pens were
                            full at 2.52pm (as Lord Taylor found) does not withstand careful analysis ot the
                            evidence given a. the In v ests. The police’s evidence would plainly have given the
                            jury the impression that they could not see properly out of the Control Box windows,
                             and they were therefore no, to blame for no, noticing that the terraces were

                             overcrowded. The following should be noted:

                                O         Just lei me show you a photograph ... as regards the aaitre pens you
                                          could not .suggest, could you, that roupd about 10 - to - 3       Uut «
                                          was clear and obvious just by looking at the terrace that the cent e
                                          pens coukt not possibly have room for a large number of further
                                          people, that is right, isn’t it 1 A. Looking at this ... I think we have
                                           tobear in mind that I was in the Control Box, I was standing toward
                                           the back of that Control Box and as a result my view from that Con tro
                                           Box across those terraces was not necessarily as good as that
                                           photograph suggests ...



                                 The police o ffic ers repeatedly said that their view out o f the window was
                      (ii)

                                 obscured by the angle at whtch the box looked onto the terraces. Sergeant

                                 Goddard said that it was easier to assess Pen I than the other pens because of

                                 the angle of the Control Box and its distance away from the pens.             The

                                 police’s evidence is summarised in this exchange between the Coroner and

                                     Sergeant Goddard (£££ p50):



                                            0        h it correct, Sergeant Goddard, your evidence is that the view
                                                     ot the terraces and indeed other parts of the ground trom Uk
                                                     Control Room is limited because of angle, distance and location
                                                     7 A. It does have its limitations, sir, yes.



                                     The Coroner specifically referred to the police’s excuses in his summing - up

                                      (5 SS Day 77, Summing - up, p!27). This explanation has been repeated by

                                      South Yorkshire Police as recently as January 1997 t o Answer to Question

                                      4 posed by the Home Office on 20th December 1997).



                                      The jury’s own view of the terraces must be judged in the light of this
              (iii)
                                      evidence. I,           be assumed that the jury concluded the officers would

                              Control Box.        This conclusion would have been contrary u. the officers'

                              testimony.



                              On several occasions the Coroner specifically invited the jury u, conclude that
               (iv)
                              the pens were not full at 2.52pm and. by implication, that the police were no,

                               at fault in failing to block off tbe entrances to the pens because they would

                               have been entitled to assume that there was space in the pens. He consistently

                               emphasised ,l,c evidence (such as the batting around of a balloon) which

                               pointed to 'normal crowd behav.our', and diminished the evidence that Had led

                               Lord Taylor to conclude that the terraces were full.           The following ire a

                                selection of quotes from the summing up:



                                   (a)       "However the evidence is, 1 think, reasonably clear that at eight

                                             minuies to, which is the time when gate C was opened ... the centre

                                             pens certainly were not empty but were no, necessarily .so full, and

                                             indeed, ,hey had been playing w„h beach balls and various other

                                             things in those pens shortly before that.” (Day 77, pl28)

                                              pen correctly then the distressing situation did not occur until the

                                              players came out onto the pitch or later, or from there onward" (Bay


                                              77, p55).



                                     (c)       "The majority appeared to be distressed around the time

                         He explicitly invitee! the jury to conclude that the terraces were not full at

                         2.52pm. In so domy, he directed the jury to reach a factual conclusion which

                          was in dircct conflict with conclusions reached by 1,ord Taylor, who found as

                          a fact that the terraces were over - full at 2.52pm. That the Coroner had the

                          freedom to distort the evidence in this way ; remains a matter of extreme

                          frustration for the families of the deceased.

                     events of the day.



        4.           ncs Duckcnfield and       l>S M urray As indicated in earlier submissions, DS Murray

                     did say that if he bad had a belter view then his decisions would Imve been difierenl.

                     The question of whether ihe cameras/monitors were functioning is therefore highly

                     relevant. The HFSG's earlier submissions have demonstrated that the cameras were

                     working and were being used by the police. There is now no doubt that the police

                      used the alleged deficiencies in the cameras to justify their own failures.



            5.        in his evidence to Lord Taylor Mr Duckenfield admitted that he was concerned about

                      the disparity in the numbers of supporters in the centre pens compared with the

                      numbers in the side pens. This caused him to request that a tannoy announcement be

                       made asking supporters u< move forward (Day 8, p9 - 14).



             6.        A, the inquest, however. Mr Duckenfield said that he noticed no dispar,ty between

                       the central and the side pens (12 March, p60B). In response to a question from the

                       coroner he said that after the gate had been opened He noticed no disparity between

                       the centre and the sule pen, and that ’All I saw Was normal,ty".           The evidence

                        relating to Mr Duckenf,eld's .annoy requests for supporters in pens 3 and 4 to move

                        forward was vague (12 March. p52B) and .he jury Would not have been certain as to

                        whether any such requests were given.'




                     'One of the major flaws of                  ‘^   . ^     “ lo w * S S lS p * o T L e m * from


                 K      l T                                                     .he jury were no, aware of the
                 discrepancies in the evidence ot key witnesses.

  S.      •*"




                7.       II is significant that the utnnoy announcement ordered by Mr Duckenfield coincides

                         with a shot from Camera 5 at 14.18.07 (shown on the-footage supplied by Yorkshire

                         TV), which shows young people standing in space at the front of the U ppings U i*

                         terraccs. It would therefore appear that the tannoy .announcement was made as a

                         result of what had been observed on the video, and that Mr Duckcnfield was, in fact,

                         using the cameras to assess crowd build • up inside the ground.

             POLICE CONSTABLE           1368



             At 8 , 0 0 a.tfu on S a t u r d a y    15 April         1989,    I commenced duty           in uniform

             at B a r n s l e y Po l i c e Station.



              I was    briefed by Police S e r g e a n t 2 3 7 9 Swift who was                   the S e r g e a n t    in

              charge    of my Serial No.           16.     We w ere        informed that our duties w o u l d

             consist of        public order        patrols at the M i d l a n d R a i l w a y Station,

             S heffield,        All    officer s    of Serial           16 then went      by traTisTlT van to

             W est Bar Police Station,              Sheffield,           for briefing at 9 . 0 0 a.m.



             We were      brie f e d by Chief       Inspector King            in West Bar G y m at 9. 0 0 a.m.



             A f t e r w a r d s we were   issued     radios,        one   b e t w e e n two officers.           I was
                                                                                                                             /

    T        radio.      We    left W e s t Bar about 9 . 4 0 a.m.               Our Serial       a r r i v e d on f^bt

             at M i d l a n d S t a t i o n at   bout 9.5 0 a.m.           T here we joined two or three

             other S e r i a l s who were also           d e p l o y e d on public order          duty.         The
                                                                                                         PAGE      2
                                                                                                         R9S

' inst r u c t i o n s ■g i v e n to us at briefing were to the effect                       that all

Liverpool and Notts Forest                      s u p p o r t e r s w o u l d be d i r e c t e d from the

trains t o ; s e p a r a t e    ends, of the station,                Where the-y w o u l d      board

special       buses w h i c h w ould t r ansport              them to Hillsborough.               Officers

w ould a c c o m p a n y them on the buses                 to the ground and            return on the

empty bus        to    repeat    the journey.



Our serial,           however,      did not get          involved          in this   particular      duty as

we were       i n structed      to take         control     of the station exits and try to

establish which           football        club s u p p o r t e r s were        from their       respective

clubs.        The senior        officer         giving     this    instru c t i o n was Chief

Inspector King who a t t e n d e d at the s t a t i o n                     personally.



It was a p p a r e n t    that      not many s u p p o r t e r s were          t ravelling      by rail,

either       from Liv e r p o o l    or Nottingham.



Those    that     did pass       thro u g h the ticket             barriers were good humoured

and   co-ope r a t e d    fairly well w i t h P o l i c e            instructions and guidance               to

the r e l e v a n t buses.          There were         some,      however,      that a v o i d e d stating

that they w ere          in S h e f f i e l d    for the semi-final             match.



I. did not witn e s s an y public                  order    incidents at the            railway station,

I did not see a n y o n e           in a d r u n k e n state         or in poss e s s i o n of any

o f f e n s i v e weapons,      p rohibited a r t i c l e s        or alcohol.



I did not        conduct any         personal         searches       of people at        that    location.



At 2 . 4 0    p.m.    m y s e l f and Serial          16 O f f i c e r s   boarded a S h e f f i e l d   city

double       decker     bus,    together w i t h other             serial      officers.        We were     then

i n s t r u c t e d to i fave |he' railway s t ^ y y t and a t t e n d at                 the
                 '..     ■                      •                                                         '.p a g e   :
       v;                                                                              R9S     ■

H i l l s b o r o u g h football        grourifd, a g a i n to be g iven -further             instruction.



As we travel led from, the                 railway stat i o n         t h r o u g h the C i t y an d out

onto     the m a i n         roads,    towards Hiilsborouigh,           traffic Was m o d e r a t e at

that     time and an odd football                   s u pporter    could be seen making                  his way

on foot       towards the ground.



I o b s e r v e d a few supp o r t e r s        in p o s s e s s i o n of   cans of beer/lager.

T hey a p p e a r e d        good humoured.



As we got         closer to the ground,                say a r o u n d the M i d d l e w o o d Road area,

near     to H a m m e r t o n Roa d Police Station,               I saw large groups               of

s upporters,           some of w hom were           o b v i o u s l y drunk going       towards         the

g round on foot.



T hey were w a l k i n g         on both sides         of M i d d l e w o o d Road,     some w a n d e r i n g

into the        roadway.          At    this   point    there was       quite a heavy traffic

build up.          We m o v e d slowly towards             the gr o u n d and turned            right         into

L e p pings Lane.             As we did so       I could see a large ga t h e r i n g               of

supporters         heading        for the ground.



T here was a lot of shouting and singing.                              It was at this          point          that

the big m a t c h a t m o s p h e r e      became      obvious.       As we drove towards                 the

ground       the driver          of the bus had to take great                 care as        people       filled

the    roadway.



As we       neared the L e p p i n g s Lane         end of     the ground,            I could see Police

Officers       on foot and two m o u n t e d            o f f icers   near    to the      large         blue gate

by the L e p p i n g s        Lane     turnstiles.       T here a p p e a r e d to be hundreds                 of

s u p p o r t e r s at   that     location,     all    o b v i o u s l y wait i n g   to get       inside       the
                                                                                                        PAGE    4

ground.         There was a lot of shouting,                       all   supporters s e e m e d to be

ma k i n g    their w a y towards          that sp^ill a rea outside               the ground.



1 remember         comme n t i n g    to 4 * c o l l e a g u e    that- they w o u l d never get that,1

lot    in the ground.



As we        passed L e p p i n g s Lane we were             contin u a l l y    confronted     by

supp o r t e r s mak i n g    their way towards                  the L e p p i n g s Lane   turnstiles.

These must         have    n u m b e r e d tho u s a n d s   by this       point and a g a i n the driver

of our bus had to take                  great     care to a v o i d any          p edestrians     being

k n o c k e d down.       Some    of the fans           punched the          sides of the bus,          some

shouted abuse,            others      just     chanted a n d sang.



I remember         that while         on public order               duty at the R a i l w a y Station,

all    radio      transmissions apeared                 cont r o l l e d an d    calm.      A noticeable

change        in radio     transmissions            became a p p a r e n t from about 8.4 3             p.m.

onwards.



A   lot of the t r a n s m i s s i o n s wer6           con n e c t e d W ith the s i t u a t i o n outside

the L e p p i n g s L ane     end of the ground as                   calls    for further a s s i s t a n c e

were m a d e .



I do not        recall     e x a c t l y what was        said at         that time    or by w h i c h

off i cer(s).



As we got to the small                  roundabout at the j u n ction wit h P e n i s t o n e

Road,        I could still        see    hundreds of s u p p o r t e r s making             their way to

the L e p p i n g s Lane      end.



T h e n we turned         right      into P e n i s t o n e R o a d a n d right a g a i n      into the
                                                                                                      PAGE        5
                                                                                                      R98

ground by the N o r t h St^rtd,



T h e r e we a l l e n t e r e d the gyro to a wait            further      deployment



A fter    only a couple            of minutes <or‘ so         I remember         hearing a radio

transmission          requ e s t i n g any a v a i l a b l e S e r g e a n t s   to report    i mmediately

to a Senior O f f i c e r at the gym.



I then saw Po l i c e S e r g e a n t Swift a p p r o a c h a Senior                officer an d almost

immediately          I heard the officer             say something           like all you lads             to

the West Stand.



We then w a l k e d        out of the gym and all              our serial w a l k e d onto           the

track      in front        of the N o r t h Stand.          I could see that the             ground was

p a c k e d wit h supporters.             The kop was         full,     as were     both N o r t h and

S o u t h Stands.



In front        of me      I could see the West Stand.                    I saw Police O f f icers

lining the         perimeter        track.      I could not say how many but                  I was able

to see onto          the    pitch.       At that time         the two teams were           on the      p i t ch

but the m a t c h had not s t a rted.                This w o u l d be about 2.55            p .m.



As   I passed the N o r t h S t a n d and turned                 left to walk towards            the West

Stand,      I could see a small              number      of officers stood a w a y           from the

perimeter        fence w h i c h enclosed           the s t a nding area b e n e a t h the West

Stand.



My s e l f and other m e m b e r s        of my serial         w a l k e d up towards      the go«^L^mcmth

are a on the track.                As   I walked     in front of the fence,               I could see

that     the s u p p o r t e r s   behind    it w e r e s q u a s h e d and      packed   in like
                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                   R98

             sardines.                                    _



             The    e v a c u a t i o n gates     from this a r e a were all         closed at this time.



             1 s t o p p e d behind the goal and f aced the                  fans.      W i t h me at that time

    vU       was P olice S e r g e a n t 2 3 7 9 Swift,          P o l i c e C o n s t a b l e 42 Hobson,    Police

     0£r     C o n s t a b l e 3 1 9 8 Akred;
                                     _
                                                    There were       other   Officers,      but   I cannot         recall

             their     names.



             r recall.saying              to Po l i c e S e r g e a n t S w i f t we've got to get these gates

             open and        let the       s u pporters   out.



             At this        point    panic seemed to take             over a certain extent.                No

             instru c t i o n was         given to open these           gates,    but   it was    o b v i o u s l y the

             correct        course      of action,     the r e f o r e w i t h the above     four    named

             officers we op e n e d the gate at CN4.



             As    I a r r i v e d at     that    location    (C N 4 ) I could hear       loud cries         to    'get

             us out*.            I have    never seen as m a n y        people    crammed    into an are a such

             as t h a t .

<3rsc
             I recall        seeing a lad of about 8-1 0 y e a r s               of age at     the very front             of
Go*0nr<jy£

^            fence.         He    could not move or speak.              A s u pporter     stood d i r e c t l y

r)AD /C      behind him,           spoke    to me    in a calm but t e r r i f i e d manner,         "Get this

             little     lad out".           I a p p e a s e d him b r i e f l y and together,       after        talking

             to the     lad an d this            supporter,    we got    the boy awa y from the              fence

             onto    the floor w h e r e we m a n a g e d to w e d g e        himself     betw e e n this m a m ’s

             legs by sitting              on the floor       under   the metal       framework      supporting        the

             fenc^.         L b e l i e v e d he was at the safest           possible     place     for the        time
    being.        I then s t a r t e d to           pull s u p p o r t e r s   from the     crowd t h r o u g h the

    na r r o w gate at CNA.



    Th e    crowd were         packed s o t i g ht tb4t we               could on l ^ j i ^ t ^ J ^ T e m ^ o ^ ^ n e   at

    a time.         Some m a n a g e d to climb on top of their mates an d                             roll    over

    the     crowd and fall             out head or feet             first.       All    the time       the    crowd

    were     shouting,         get us out,           tear down the fence and also abuse                        towards

    the Po lice Officers.



    I also      remember         some suppo r t e r s        shout i n g       'stop the    game'      repeatedly.

    It was only at             that      time that         I r e a lised the game had started.



    As     I looked       into the         same     crowd    I could see          people w e d g e d    between

    others who         looked a p p a r e n t l y dead.



    A f t e r a few m i n u t e s        of working         to get      people out       I recall       the first

    m a n we got       out who a p p e a r e d dead.              We    laid him on the ground                behind

    the goal.          He was a w h i t e man a p p r o x i m a t e l y 25 years,                5*9"~5'10",

    heavy build,           tee-shirt,             jeans    (short      hair).      I assisted       two other

f   o f f icers     (n a m e s / n u m b e r s    unknown)     in an effort         to revive        him but he

    looked dead.             First Aid officers                then took        over.      I returned to Gate

    CN4.      Again       I assisted             officers Akred,         Swift and others.              Another

    y o u t h was    passed       thro u g h the gate.              I took      this y o u t h onto      the    pitch

    w i t h a not h e r    officer.              As we    laid him down         I saw the gr o u n d         covered

    wi t h bodies.          All a p p a r e n t l y dead.



    P e o p l e were w a l k i n g a r o u n d       crying,      screaming,        panicking,         hysterical.           ,



    I remember         noticing         that this y o u t h had been sick.                    I laid him down

    and assisted another                  officer w i t h m o u t h to m o u t h and heart m#ssage^

We    m a n a g e d to piimp more vomit            out    of his stomach.             We were a s s i s t e d

a short     time     later      by a c i v ilian who         stated he was a doctor.                 I could

‘not feel any        pulse On this youth,                 I remember the doctor had

s u s t a i n e d a cut   to his hea d as blood was                running down his            face.



The doctor a s s i s t e d m y s e l f and a n o t h e r man who a p p e a r e d            on the

scene.      A p p a r e n t l y this second        c i v ilian was also a doctor.



After a few m i n u t e s        I felt a weak           pulse a p p arent     in the youth.           Heart

m a s s a g e and m o u t h    to m outh were       con t i n u e d an d even t u a l l y    two fire

o f f icers a p p e a r e d with oxygen equipment.



Other     supporters          came to out aid an d           it was     decided that         this y outh

 could    possibly        be saved.          We then     placed him on one of the billboards

 ri p p e d away from the side of the gr o u n d by the                     s upporters and others,

 to be used as a stretcher.



T h e y o uth was     laid on the board an d we                 carried him towards ambu l a n c e s

w h i c h were    stationed       in the       pass a g e w a y betw e e n the N o r t h S t a n d and

S p i o n Hop.



The y o u t h was     there      left    in the     care     of the doctors and amb u l a n c e

staff.       I can descr i b e        this y o u t h as about         18-20 years,          white male,

5 ’6 " , slim,     fair       hair,   light     trousers,       T/Shirt.       I then       returned to

the West S t a n d an d a g a i n a s s i s t e d        colleagues      to evacuate         supporters.



B y the time       I r e t urned      I would      say about a quarter of the                  pitch was

occupied        by dead bodies          or    pesons     s e r i o u s l y injured.

noticed Police              officers at the back                 of the      supporters         that remained

inside           the s t a nding a r e a of the West Stand.                    Gaps     began to appear and

some ’s u p p o r t e r s were able to leave as they entered back, t h r o u g h the

tunnel           from Leppitigs Larie.



1 recall              shouting     to the supporters,             go back,       look behind you,           you

can get out.              .But. a lot took no notice at all.                        The y simply      panicked

a n d kept            pushing     forward.



One       s u pporter was w e d g e d between the                 floor      inside the s t a nding area

an d the track.                 His legs were trap p e d under                the volume        of bodies and

his       torso was        half      out of the gateway.                E v e n u a l l y we got   him out.

All       efforts were            h a m p e r e d due to the      fact that       the gates were           too

small          in both size and number.                    I saw some        supporters and Police

Officers              lit e r a l l y tearing and kicking at a part of this                        fence    in

o rder         to get a     female       fan out.         The    fence wire e v e n t u a l l y became

d e t a c h e d from       its m o u n t i n g     frame and numerous            fans    clammered     to get

Out.



I never saw the                 little       lad m e n t i o n e d at   the early       part of this

su m m a r y again.             I d o n ’t know whet h e r        he got out or not.               I was

a p r o a c h e d by an officer               later a nd     i n f ormed that the y outh we took to

the a m b u l a n c e      had     come ar o u n d and was          conscious.



I recall           seeing a cordon of Po l i c e O f f i c e r s              later sp r e a d ac r o s s    the

centre of the              pitch.



When          the a r e a at     the West S t a n d had e v e n t u a l l y       been cleared        I noticed

all       kinds of        personal       property       lying a r o u n d on the floor,            shoes,

coats,          scarves,        jump e r s    etc.     I remember        being a p p r o a c h e d by two

            Police-.      I S u f f e r e d no    physical        injuries,.

            specific      events a f t e r       entering       the ground.

  Personal and medical            memories from Hillsborough.

  Tom Heller.        May 1989.



  Outside eve ry pub and on every verge on m y w a y h o m e
  were relaxed gr oups of young men.                     Chatting and
  joking in their "uniforms" of tight, fading jeans,
  offcolour T-shirts, and s o m e t h i n g red and white.
 Were these the exact peopl e who I later saw laid
 out on the floor with all life just pushed out of
 them?    There were so m a n y I didn't dare to count
 them all,        l o o k i n g as t h e y had in life,             not
 disfigured, just lying there, not quite the right
 colour.    Not m u c h to identify them on that sports
 hall ^floor ...who were they, what had gone wrong and
 who is to blame for all this?
 I am a general p ra c t i t i o n e r in _Sheff ield and was on
 «tll Ior a p r act ice a d j a c e n t t c T the H i l l s b o r o u g h
 ground for the weekend which included Saturday 15th
April.     I a l w a y s arrange the Saturdays wh en there
 is a ho m e match on at the Sheff ield W e d n e s d a y
 stadium so that I don't have to pass the ground
when c r o w d s are c o m i n g or going.
My home is one side of the ground, and the practice
 is on the other. The atmosphere was special on the
loth for the semi-final, people were parking their
cars miles away from the stadium and walking to the
ground m a n y hours earlier than the cr owds usually
do for ho m e games.            I r e m e m b e r being e speci ally
cheerful (despite being on duty) and really proud
that Sheffield was the centre of the sporting world
that day.      The snooker W o r l d C h a m p i o n s h i p was on
just d o w n the road, and m a n y people had thought
that this was THE s e m i - f i n a l that should perhaps
have b e e n t h e f i n a l i t s e l f .          B o t h s e t s of
supporters wear red and white, who was who on those
verges and which of them now lives to tell their
tale of the d a y w h e n s u c h a t e r r i b l e t r a g e d y
happened out of a relaxed and gentle sunny m o m e n t ?

 I s w it ched on the T.V. just after 3.0 p.m. and saw
 the s n o o k e r b e i n g i n t e r u p t e d by s c e n e s f r o m
Hillsborough.           L i k e a l m o s t e v e r y o n e else,,      I
 imagine, I th ought it was a pitch invasion and
worried about how this might reflect on E n glis h
clubs ever being a l lowed back into Europe.                      I then
got into m y car and took m y daughter to a party she
was due to attend.             At about 3.20 I heard on Radio
Sheffield       the      call     for      doctors         to g o     to
Hillsborough so I hurried to drop off my daughter
and go to the ground.             The party was about a mile
from Hillsborough and I followed a fire engine with
flashing l i g h t s and s i r e n going... t h r o u g h red
lights and the wron g side of keep left signs I kept
myself glued to the back of the fire engine and was
at the ground within a very few minutes of hearina
the a n n o u n c e m e n t on the radio.               I p a r k e d on
   Leppings Lane about t w e n t y yards from the blue gate
   that became such a focus of attention later.                   I had
   no notion of the sig nific ance of the gate at the
   time. As I was parking on the forecourt of a tyre
   fitting garage I was approached by some policemen.'
   I told them there had been a call for doctors on
   the radio.       One of them i m m e d i a t e l y used his own
   radio to ask for advice as to wher e doctors were
   being asked to go, and we set off at a run through
   the corridors, round the stadium and t o w a r d s the
  sports hall.        The scene is very familiar to me, I
  know the st a d i u m quite well and have often been to
  matches       there.      The     concrete         beneath       the
  grandstands is particular, stained grey, cold and
  unyieding... the light is a lwa y s poor even on sunny
  afternoons like this one.             As we rushed along the
  atmosphere was all wro ng though...lots of pe ople
  but no noise.        We got to the sports hall in about
  two m i n u t e s and I stepped into the door through a
  cordon of police officer s o b vious ly holding back
  numbers of peop le c r o w d i n g round the outside of the
  do or .
 Nothing c o u l d h a v e p r e p a r e d m e for the s c e n e s
  inside... I vaguely had thought there might be a
 couple of St. John's A m b u l a n c e men :standing over a
 man with his head between his knees telling him to
 take deep breaths... I thought they may have been
 "overwhelmed" because four people fainting in this
 way was mo r e than they could cope with and I'd join
 in their exhortations and be back at my daugther's
 party in time for the second round of M a r m i t e
 sandwiches.
 This was not n o rmal though.               There were these
 bodies everywhere.        Who was alive and who was dead?
 They couldn't all be dead, it is a mistake, this
 just doesn't happen on sunny afternoons.                   Blotchy
 faces a g a i n s t the floo r,         not d i s f i g u r e d but
 apparently peaceful.          Bodies h i g l d y —pigldy just
 inside the door, stretching over to the far wall
 though.     I aksed a p o l i c e m a n what was to be done,
 thankfully he pointed aw a y from the bodies to a
 section of the hall di vided from the bodies by a
long, low screen...like those used to divide off
sports halls when two different sports are going on
at the sa m e time... m o r e bodies here though...my
God what can I do here, who is going to tell me
what to do?
Without dire c t i o n s I ran along the line of cr u m p l e d
bodies.      This lot were at least alive.              I stopped
between two bodies, took out m y stet hascope and
lifted up one T- shir t and just listened, grateful
to have the time to do s om ething I know how to do
at last.         I often use 'stethascope on the chest
time' to think during everyday consultations.                    Its
a good ploy really, the patient thinks you are
being ever so thoug htful and thorough, and I have
the time to think what the hell to do next.                    Panic
overtook me on this occasion.               H o w was I to be
sure this was the one who needed help most, what
    W?fu9? i ? 9 t? ? aP P en to a11 the others if I stayed
    with this bloke?         I could hear his heartbea t and
             OUn      as w e l 1 * For some reason I took my
    stethascope out of m y ears and craw led up to his
    race,    W h a t s your name, mate?"                            "O.K
        J how are You feeling?"                 No answer.         Silly
   question really, his leg was s o mehow at the wrong
   angle and so w a s o n e of his arms, he l o o k e d
   terrible and where I had rested my stethasco pe
   earlier was o b v i o u s l y not alright at all.             It was
   moving all wrong and was not the right colour at
   either. A l t h o u g h I could hear breath sounds, they
   were h a r d to i n t e r p r e t ,      I t h i n k I w a s ju st
   panicking r e ally.          i r e m e m b e r e d h o w to do a
   tracheostomy wit h a Bic biro, would this be my
   opportunity?       I turned him over onto his side and
   pushed my fingers onto the top of his tongue to
   establish an airway.           This seemed to help and his
   breathing seemed to start again.                 I had pulled him
  over onto his bad leg though...there didn't seem
  much alternative.          His face was against the floor
  so I reached out and found a leather jacket on the
  floor and picked up his head and rested it on the
  jacket. What medical equipment could make this man
  survive?       If only s o m e o n e would arrive who knew
  what th e y w e r e d o i n g . . . w h a t do I k n o w a b o u t
  anything?       I turned round and looked at the man who
  had just been behind me...immobile and a terrible
  blue-grey colour....and so it w e n t on.                     I had
  brought my bags full of the equipment and drugs I
  usually use...not much call for antibiotics or
  infant paracetamol this afternoon. After some time
  •how long, I b e c a m e a wa r e of a friend of mine goinq
  between the bodies doing the same as me.                   A n ot her
              V6 v?o r *ed together in the past but nothing
  like this, b e f o r e or ever again.                 A s m i l e of
 recognition, I wonder if I look as lost as he does?
 The first l a r g e -scale e q uipmen t arrives and we
 start w o r k i n g together, drips up on everyone.                 As
 much intubation and a i r w a y s as we could po s s i b l y
 use.     Scissors to cut through clothes, why didn't I
 carry them in my bags?             I.V. diamor phine and some
 sort of routine and organizations starts to be
 established.        I'm quite proud in a funny sort of
 way to still be able to put up so many I.V. drips
 so quickly, without a miss.                More doctors arrive
 now and around every body there's a little huddle
 of w o r k e r s .      Someone         says       they    are      an
 anaesthetist...gold dust man, come over here and
 look at            for me mate. He's still alive but he
 keePs      stopping           breathing               "Hang        on
Tj    ^••a naesthetist t a k e s out a i r w a y and its
 blocked wit h blood.            Not a good sign.           One rib
 seems to be almost through the chest and certainly
at all the wrong angles.                  Ambulanc e stretcher
arrives we put in a passioned bid for                           to be
bod?1 h° f1f, 1.firS,t *.
                        ? Y now six peopie around his
        h° ld1\ng d “ P bottle, holding head, holding
legs   at all angles.       R e s t e d on t o low t r o l l e y .
  Check that ambulance is waiting and can get through
  to h o s p i t a l . A n a e s t h e t i s t goes with        to
  ambulance.. .thank God for anaethetists, 1^11 never
  tell an anti— anaethetist joke again.
 Now I've got no-o ne to "work on", I wander round
 and can see the dead bodies again at the other side
 of the sports hall.           I recognize many of my friends
 and c ollea gues who have also a n swer ed the call of
 duty, one of them gives me a hug...bless him,                    a
 friend for li f e a f t e r w h a t we've b e e n t h r o u g h
 today.      Police m u c h in evidence, but nobody in
 charge of the m e d i c a l tasks...what should I do
 next, w h e r e wou ld I be most useful?             I decide to
 use m y n e w l y re-found skills to put up drips on
 everybody who is going to be transfered to hospital
 I somehow remember that this is the thing to do in
 case there's mor e collaps e on the way to hospital.
 Its also a sign to the hospital doctors that we as
G.P.s can do s o m e t h i n g right after all.          I use up
all my diamorphine on those in need.                 By this time
the routines are mo r e established, someone is
writing d o w n what is the major dam age to each
person and what they have had in the way of drugs
etc.    Then suddenly there's nobody left in the hall
who is in need of attention and who isn't dead.
I notice a close friend in the sea of dead faces.
He s comforting someone who is leaning over a body.
I step over some bodies to speak to him, offer some
help, there aren't any wor ds really just a look of
rare empathy and comradeship.
The doctors in the hall are gaggling together,
almost silent, all w ond ering what to do next.                 I
leave the hall and walk through the silent crowds
back to m y car.         I go home stunned, and numbed,
children playing in the garden, its all so lovely
and normal, sandpits and skipping ropes.

  Tom Heller.        May 1989.



  Outside every pub and on every verge on m y w a y h o m e
  were relaxed gr oups of young men.                    Chatting and
  joking in their "uniforms" of tight, fading jeans,
  offcolour T-shirts, and somethi ng red and white.
 Were these the exact people who I later saw laid
  out on the floor with all life just pushed out of
  them?   There wer e so m a n y I didn't dare to count
  them all,      l o o k i n g as t h e y had in life,             not
 disfigured, just lying there, not quite the right
 colour.    Not m u c h to identify them on that sports
 hall floor...who were they, what had gone wrong and
 who is to blame for all this?
 I am a general pra c t i t i o n e r in Sheffie ld and was on
 call for a pr a c t i c e adjacent to the H il l s b o r o u g h
 ground for the weekend which included Saturday 15th
 April.    I a l w a y s arrange the Saturdays when there
 is a ho m e ma t c h on at the Sheffield W e d n e s d a y
 stadium so that I don't have to pass the ground
when c r o w d s are c o m i n g or going.
My home is one side of the ground, and the practice
 is on the other. The atmosphere was special on the
15th for the semi-final, people were parking their
cars miles away from the stadium and walking to the
ground m a n y hours earlier than the cro wds us ually
do for ho m e games.           I r e m e m b e r being espec ially
cheerful (despite being on duty) and really proud
that Sheffield was the centre of the sporting world
that day.      The snooker W o r l d C h a m p i o n s h i p was on
just d o w n the road, and ma n y people had thought
that this was THE s e m i - f i n a l that should perhaps
have b e e n t h e f i n a l i t s e l f .         B o t h s e t s of
supporters wear red and white, who was who on those
verges and whi ch of them now lives to tell their
tale of the d a y w h e n s u c h a t e r r i b l e t r a g e d y
happened out of a relaxed and gentle sunny m o m e n t ?

 I swi t c h e d on the T.V. just after 3.0 p.m. and saw
 the s n o o k e r b e i n g a n t e r u p t e d by s c e n e s f r o m
Hillsborough.           L i k e a l m o s t e v e r y o n e else,,      I
 imagine, I thought it was a pitch invasion and
worried about how this might reflect on E n g l i s h
clubs ever being al l o w e d back into Europe.                   I then
got into m y car and took m y daughter to a party she
was due to attend.             At about 3.20 I heard on Radi o
Sheffield t h e          call     for      doctors         to    go   to
Hillsborough so I hu rried to drop off my daughter
and go to the ground.             The party was about a mile
from Hillsborough and I followed a fire engine with
flashing l i g h t s and s i r e n g o i n g ... t h r o u g h red
lights and the wrong side of keep left signs I kept
myself glued to the back of the fire engine and was
at the ground within a very few minutes of hearing
the a n n o u n c e m e n t on the radio.               I p a r k e d on
   Leppings La ne about t w e n t y yards from the blue gate
    that became such a focus of attention later.               I had
   no notion of the significance of the gate at the
   time. As I was parking on the forecourt of a tyre
   fitting garage I was approached by some policemen.
   I told them there had been a call for doctors on
   the radio.      One of them i m m e d i a t e l y used his o w n
   radio to ask for advice as to where doctors were
   being asked to go, and we set off at a run through
   the corridors, round the stadium and towards the
   sports ha*Ll. The scene is very familiar to me, I
   know the s t a d i u m quite well and have often been to
   matches     there.        The       concrete      beneath    the
   grandstands is particular, stained grey, cold and
   unyieding...the light is always poor even on sunny
  afternoons like this one.               As we rushed along the
  atmosphere was all wrong though...lots of people
  but no noise.        W e got to the sports hall in about
  two m i n utes and I stepped into the door through a
  cordon of p o lice o fficer s obviously holding back
  numbers of p e o p l e c r o w d i n g round the outside of the
  door.
  Nothing c o u l d h a v e p r e p a r e d m e for the s c e n e s
  inside... I vaguely had thought there mi g h t be a
  couple of St. John's A m b u l a n c e men standing over a
  man with his head between his knees telling him to
  take deep breaths... I thought they may have been
  "overwhelmed" because four people fainting in this
 way was more than they could cope with and I'd join
  in their exhortations and be back at my daugther's
 party in t i m e for the second round of M a r m i t e
 sandwiches.
 This was not n o r m a l though.              There were these
 bodies everywhere.         Who was alive and who was dead?
 They couldn't all be dead, it is a mistake, this
 just doesn't happen on sunny afternoons.                 Blotchy
 faces a g a i n s t the fl oor, not d i s f i g u r e d but
 apparently peaceful.             Bodies h i g l d y -pigid y just
 inside the door, stretching over to the far wall
 though.     I aksed a p o l i c e m a n what was to be done,
 thankfully he pointe d away from the bodies to a
 section of the hall divided from the bodies by a
 long, low screen...like those used to divide off
 sports halls when two different sports are going on
 at the same time... m o r e bodies here though...my
God what can I do here, who is going to tell me
what to do?
Without d irec t i o n s I- ran along the line of cr u m p l e d
bodies.      This lot wer e at least alive.             I stopped
between two bodies, took out m y stethascope and
lifted up one T - shir t and just listened, grateful
to have the t i m e to do s o methin g I know how to do
at last.       I often use 'stethascope on the chest
time' to think during everyday consultations.                  Its
a good ploy really, the patient thinks you are
being ever so t h ought ful and thorough, and I have
the time to think what the hell to do next.                  Panic
overtook me on this occasion.                 How was I to be
sure this was the one who needed help most, what
    was going to happen to all the others if I stayed
    with this bloke?         I could hear his heartbeat and
     f8f5hsOUnds as w e l 1 * Por some reason I took m y
    stethascope out of m y ears and crawled u d to his
   £ ace' 'What's y o u r n a m e , m a t e ? "                ^      "O.K.
          , k ° w are y ° u feeling?"           No answer.           Silly
   question really, his leg was s o m e h o w at the wrong
   angle and so w a s o n e of his arms, he l o o k e d
   terrible and where I had rested m y stet hascope
   earlier was o b v i o u s l y not alright at all.               it was
   moving all wrong and was not the right colour at
   either. A l t h o u g h I could hear breath sounds, they
   were h a r d to i n t e r p r e t ,     I t h i n k I w a s ju s t
   panicking reall y.           I r e m e m b e r e d h o w to do a
   tracheostomy with a Bic biro, would this be m y
  opportunity?        I turned hi m over onto his side and
  pushed m y fingers onto the top of his tongue to
  establish an airway.           This seemed to help and-his
  breathing seemed to start again.- I had pulled him
  over onto his bad leg though...there didn't seem
  much alternative.         His face was against the floor
  so I reached out and found a leather jacket on the
  floor and picked up his head and rested it on (the
  jacket. What medical equipment could make this man
  survive?       If only someon e woul d arrive who knew
  what th e y w e r e doin g . . . w h a t do I k n o w a b o u t
  anything?       I turned round and looked at the man who
  had just been behind me...immobile and a terrible
 blue-grey c o l o u r ....and so it W e n t on.                  I had
 brought m y bags full of the equ i p m e n t and drugs I
 usually use...not much call for antibiotics or
 infant paracetamol this afternoon. After some time
 ?how long, I b e c a m e awar e of a friend of mi ne going
 between the bodies doing the same as me.                      Another
 G.P., we've worked together in the past but nothing
 like this, b e f o r e or ever again.                    A s m i l e of
 recognition, I wonder if I look as lost as he does?
 The first l a r g e -s cale e q u i p m e n t arrives and we
 start w o r k i n g together, drips up on everyone.                    As
much intubation and ai r w a y s as we could pos s i b l y
 use.    Scissors to cut through clothes, why didn't I
 carry them in m y bags?           I.V. di a m o r p h i n e and some
sort of routine and organizatio ns starts to be
established.         I'm quite proud in a funny sort of
way to still be able to put up so m a n y I.V. drips
so quickly, w i t h o u t a miss.          Mor e doctors arrive
now and around ev ery body there's a little huddle
or w o r k e r s .       Someone        says        they      are      an
anaesthetist.. .gold dust man, co m e over here and
look at            [for me mate. He's still alive but he
keeps       stoP Ping         breathing...."Hang                       on
      J • *anaesthetist t a k e s out a i r w a y and its
blocked wit h blood.            Not a good sign.              One rib
seems to be almost through the chest and certainly
at all the wron g angles.                A m b u l a n c e st r e tcher
arrives we put in a pass i o n e d bid for                   ^ to be
        I*-      •     Y now Slx P e° P le around his
body, holding drip bottle, holding head, holding
legs at all a n gles .   R e s t e d onto low trolley.
  Check that ambulance is waiting and can get through
  to h o s p i t a l . A n a e s t h e t i s t goes w i t h t o
  ambulance... thank God for a n a e t h e t i s t s , I'll never
  tell an anti-anaethetist joke again.
  Now I've got no-one to "work on", I wander round
      i_uan See the dead bodies again at the other side
  of the sports hall. I recognize many of my friends
  and colleagues who have also answered the call of
  duty, one of them gives me a hug...bless him,                   a
  friend for l i f e a f t e r w h a t we've b e e n t h r o u g h
  today.     Police much in evidence, but nobody in
 charge of the m e d i c a l tasks...what should I do
 next, whe r e wou l d I be most useful?              I decide to
 use m y n e w l y re-found skills to put up drips on
 everybody who is going to be transfered to hospital
 I somehow remember that this is the thing to do in
 case there's more collapse on the way to hospital.
 Its also a sign to the hospital doctors that we as
 G.P.s can do s o m e t h i n g right after all.         I use up
 all my diamorphine on those in need.                By this time
 the routines are mor e established, s o m eone is
 writing do w n what is the major damag e to each
person and what they have had in the way of drugs
etc.     Then suddenly there's nobody left in the hall
who is in need of attention and who isn't dead.
I notice a close friend in the sea of dead faces.
He s comforting someone who is leaning over a body.
I step over some bodies to speak to him, offer some
help, there aren't any wor ds really just a look of
rare empathy and comradeship.
The doctors in the hall are gaggling together,
almost silent, all w onde ring what to do next.                 I
leave the hall and walk through the silent c r o w d s
  uC? , to m y ca.r * .I 90 home stunned, and numbed,
children playin g in the garden, its all so lovely
and normal, sandpits and skipping ropes.

  but no noise.        W e got to the sports hall in about
  two m i n u t e s and I stepped into the door through a
  cordon of police o f fi cers obv i o u s l y holding back
  numbers of p e op le c r o w d i n g round the outsi de of the
  door.
  Nothing c o u l d h a v e p r e p a r e d m e for the s c e n e s
  inside... I vaguely had thought there m i g h t be a
  couple of St. John's A m b u l a n c e men ;standing over a
 man with his head between his knees telling him to
  take deep breaths... I thought they m a y have been
  "overwhelmed" because four people fainting in this
 way was mo r e than they could cope with and I'd join
  in their exhortations and be back at my daugther's
 party in time for the second round of M a r m i t e
 sandwiches.
 This was not n o r m a l though.             There were these
 bodies everywhere.         Who was alive and who was dead?
 They couldn't all be dead, it is a mistake, this
 just doesn't happen on sunny afternoons.                    Blotchy
 faces a g a i n s t the floor,           not d i s f i g u r e d but
 apparently peaceful.           Bo dies h i g l d y —p i gldy just
 inside the door, str et c h i n g over to the far wall
 though.     I aksed a p o l i c e m a n what was to be done,
 thankfully he po inted a w a y from the bodies to a
 section of the hall d i vide d from the bodies by a
 long, low screen...like those used to di vide off
sports halls when two different sports are going on
at the sa m e time... m o r e bodies here though...my
God what can I do here, who is going to tell m e
what to do?
Without di rectio ns I ran along the line of c r u m p l e d
bodies.      This lot we r e at least alive.             I stopped
between two bodies, took out m y ste tha s c o p e and
lifted up one T- s h i r t and just listened, grate ful
to have the ti m e to do s o m e t h i n g I know how to do
at last.        I of ten use 'stethascope on the chest
time to think during everyday consultations.                      Its
a good ploy really, the patient thinks you are
being ever so thought ful and thorough, and I have
the time to think wh a t the hell to do next.                   Pani c
overtook me on this occasion.                H o w was I to be
sure this was the one w h o needed help most, what
   was going to happen to all the others if I stayed
   with this bloke?         I could hear his heartbeat and
   breathsounds as well.             For some reason I took m y
   stethascope out of m y ears and c r a wled u p to his
   face, " W h a t 1s y _our n  __
                                 a m..e_, m a t e_? "                   ii© k
         J how are you feeling?"                  No aLswer.           Sill y
   question really, his leg wa s s o m e h o w at the wro n g
   angle and so w a s o n e of his arm s, he l o o k e d
   terrible and w h e r e I had rested m y stetha scope
   earlier was o b v i o u s l y not alright at all.                 It was
  moving all wrong and was not the right colour at
  either. A l t h o u g h I could hear breath sounds, they
  were h a r d to i n t e r p r e t ,       I t h i n k I w a s ju s t
  panicking r e al ly.          I r e m e m b e r e d h o w to do a
  tracheostomy wi th a Bic biro, would this be my
  opportunity?        I turned hi m over onto his side and
  pushed m y fingers onto the top of his tongue to
  establish an airway.           This seemed to help and his
  breathing seem e d to start again. I had pulled him
  over onto his bad leg though...there didn't seem
  much alternative.         His face was against the floor
  so I reached out and found a leather jacket on the
  floor and picked up his head and rested it on the
 jacket. What medical equipment could make this man
 s^vive?         If only so m e o n e wou ld arrive who knew
 what t h e y w e r e d o i n g . . . w h a t do I k n o w a b o u t
 anything?        I turned round and looked at the m a n who
 had just been behind me...immobile and a terrible
 blue-grey c o l o u r        a nd so it w e n t on.                I had
 brought m y bags full of the equ i p m e n t and drugs I
 usually use...not m u c h call for antibiotics or
 infant paracetamol this afternoon. After some time
 ?how long, I b e c a m e a wa r e of a friend of mine going
 between the bodies doing the same as me.                        Another
 G.P., we've worked together in the past but nothing
 like this, b e f o r e or eve r again.                     A s m i l e of
 r®co9 m t i o n , I wonder if I look as lost as he does?
The first l a r g e - s c a l e equ i p m e n t arrives and we
 start^working together, drips up on everyone.                            As
much i nt ubatio n and a i r w a y s as we could p o s s i b l y
use.    Scissors to cut through clothes, why didn't I
carry the m in my bags?             I.V. d i a m o r phine and some
sort of routine and organizations starts to be
established.         I'm quite pro ud in a funny sort of
way to still be able to put up so m a n y I.v. drips
so quickly, w i t h o u t a miss.           More doctors arrive
now and around every body there's a little huddl e
of w o r k e r s .       Someone          says        they     are        an
anaesthetist.. .gold dust man, come over here and
look at             por me mate. He's still alive but h*
keoPR      s-top p i n g       b r e a t h i n g .. .. « H a n g         on
        ..anaesthetist t a k e s ou t a i r w a y and its
blocked wi t h blood.           Not a good sign.               One rib
seems to be almost through the chest and certainly
at all the wro ng angles.                  A m b u l a n c e stretcher
arrives we put in a p as sioned bid f o r ^ t o                           be
          •firS^.t‘- ? y now six Pe o P 1 © around his
body, holding drip bottle, holding head, holding
legs at all a n g l e s . R e s t e d onto low trolley.


                         3
  Check that ambulance is waiting and can get through
  to h o s p i t a l .  A n a e s t h e t i s t goes with        to
  ambulance... thank God for anaethetists, X xx never
  tell an anti-anaethetist joke again.
  Now I've got no-one to "work on", I wander round
  and can see the dead bodies again at the other side
  of the sports hall. I recognize many of my friends
  and c oll eagues who have also ans w e r e d the call of
 duty, one of them gives m e a hug...bless him,                    a
 friend for l i f e a f t e r w h a t we've b e e n t h r o u g h
 today.      P o l ice much in evidence, but nobody in
 charge of the m e d i c a l tasks...what should I do
 next, w h e r e w o u l d I be m o s t useful?        I decide to
 use m y n e w l y re-found skills to put up drips on
 everybody w h o is going to be transfered to hospital
 I somehow remember that this is the thing to do in
 case there's mo r e colla pse on the way to hospital.
 Its also a sign to the hospital doctors that we as
 G.P.s can do s o m e t h i n g right after all.          I use up
 all my di^amorphine on those in need.                By this time
 the routines are mo r e established, someon e is
writing d o w n w h a t is the majo r dama ge to each
person and w h a t they have had in the way of drugs
etc.    Then suddenly there's nobody left in the hall
who is in need of attention and who isn't dead.
I notice a close fr iend in the sea of dead faces.
He s comforting someone who is leaning over a body.
I step over some bodies to speak to him, offer some
help, there aren't any w o r d s really just a look of
rare empathy and comradeship.
The doctors in the hall are gaggling together,
almost silent, all w o n d e r i n g what to do next.            I
leave the hall and walk through the silent crow ds
           m y Ca.r * -1 go home stunned, and numbed,
children pl a y i n g in the garden, its all so lovely
and normal, sandpits and skipping ropes.

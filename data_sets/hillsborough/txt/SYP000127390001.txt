LIVERPOOL SUPPORTED, SEATED IN NORTH STAND, SEAT 111, ROW 27.
STATES! ARRIVED AT GROUND AT 1430 HRS QUEUED AT TURNSTILE FOR NORTH STAND. IT
WAS CHAOS, NO ORGANISATION OR ORDERLEY QUEUES. THERE WERE NO STEWARDS OR
POLICE OUTSIDE THE GROUND TO ORGANISE THE CROWD. I GOT TO MY SEAT AFTER THE
MATCH WAS STOPPED, THE POLICE WERE STANDING IN FRONT OF OUR STAND THINKING
THAT WE WERE GOING TO CAUSE TROUBLE INSTEAD OF HELPING AT THE WEST STAND.

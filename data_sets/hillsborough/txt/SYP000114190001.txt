                  We    t r a v el le d by P o li ce Transit Van to H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m where                        the

                  m ain    pre - m a t c h brief i n g was           held      in the N o r t h S tand about               10am.       This

                  was     followed         by a packed meal               taken     in the stand before               deploying

                  onto     the    streets.             I don't      remember a great              deal     about    the     briefing,

                  it was the           usual       format      d e s c r i b i n g who was     going where          etc.      I do

them a rr iv ed w it h o u t        tickets       and tried        to get       in then he        could well

be wrong         in that assumption.

A bo u t i1am,         my serial        wa l k e d from the       gr o u n d     to the   roundabout at the

end of L e pp in gs L a n e , where we were                  dsployed            in pairs at various                ppint<=

a r o u n d the    roundabout.            I was    paired up w ith               PC 919 Evans          and we

c o n c e n tr at ed on the shops            leading      just     from the           roundabout        to

Pen i stone R o a d for           fear    of the     fans    s m a s h i n g windows,       and    causing

trouble, at a            ’Hot Pie and Pastie S h o p ’ that was open just                          before          the    ^

turn off to N i a g a r a Sports Ground.

There w e r e n ’t m any fans around at                   this     time,       but    I soon noticed that

certain fans            in groups        of 2 or 3 were w a l k i n g           backwards and forwards

from L e p p in gs Lane,           past us,       up towards W a d s l e y Bridge             and back            down

again,      asking        other    fans    for tickets        and      had anyone any spare                  tickets

or tickets         for     sale.

It soon became             evid e n t    that as     time    passed and the             crowds     got bigger

there were         even more        fans who       had    t r a v e l l e d to the      game without

t i ck e t s .

The mood of the             fans    prior     to the      game was        jovial,       and neither myself

or PC Evans            r e c e i v e d any abuse     from any of the fans.                  We had to speak

to quite a few fans who were w a l k i n g                    towards          the ground       carrying           cans

of beer and            lager.      These    fans were        told     that      if they went any

further      then they          probably w o u l d not        be a l l o w e d       into the     ground and

they ag r e e d        to go to a garage           just     round the          corner where acc o r d i n g

to PC Kent,            who was     outside     the    garage,       they sat on the wall                and

consumed what            beer     they had left          before walk i n g        up L e p p i n g s   Lane

towards      the       ground.      There was also          quite a few fans              sat on the wall

opposite         the    road to us,        drinking       beer,     etc.,       but there was          no

trouble w i t h any          of these       people.

The   crowds       got    bigger and bigger and               quite a lot were              leaving          it

late,    in my         estimation,       to get      into   the ground and get               comfortable

before       the    s c he du le d    kick      off    time.

Indeed I remember a group of older                              fans     in their 3 0 " s and 4 0 ’s asking

me,    about 2.30pm,             where        the Gate     Inn was.           I told them a n d away they                   '

w a l k e d towa r d s     the     pub,       in the    o p p osite      dir e c t i o n to the      ground with

only half a n          hour      before        kick    off.      It was obvious a lot of the fans

H a d been drinking,               a n d rnyself and PC E v a n s             had to stop them using                  the

rear a 11eway behind                 the shops as a toilet,                   this    being    the     first

secluded       spot       they     had after          getting      off    their      buses    on Clay w h e e l s

Lane.        A^^^^rr^a r i v e d there were              still       a few fans making            their way to

the    ground,       most     of these          running        or jogging,        but    nowhere       near     the

large a m o u nt       there       had been some          "10 m i n u t e s    previously.

All    our    serial       s ta rt ed to walk           up L e p p i n g s Lane,        as our    brief was           to

wait       there    on a bus         until      half    time w h e n we were            to go to C l a y w h e e l s

Lane       for a hot meal,            if there was             no need for us to remain                 there     on

standby.

I d i d n ’t have a personal                  radio     but     I can     remember       hearing       somebody

e l s e ’s as we w a l k e d         up L e p p i n g s Lane.          We had been joined              by other

o f f ic ers a n d one        told me fans             had br o k e n a gate down at              the Leppings

Lane       end of    the    ground.           We all     started         to   run towards        the    ground as

assistance          was    required.           This w o u l d be shortly after 3pm.

On arrival          at the       gr o u n d   I cannot        remember        if there were          still      any

large       numbers       of fans       outside        the turnstiles,            but we were          originally

formed       into a large            cordon outside            the     ground next to the              ro-ad.     I

d o n ’t know why,          nobody said what was                  happening.          Little      bits of

information          f i l t e r e d through that             there      had been some trou b l e and

there were          some    people        injured and one              fan said there were              some dead

as    he    passed us,        leaving         the     scene.

Our    serial       was    then      taken towards            the ac c e s s   road outside Gate C on

the a t t a c h e d map.          As we approached,               I saw people           lying    on the ground

near       to the    fence     next       to the       river.        I knew    i m m e d i a t e l y some of

             these     people were             dead.       There were          people       lying there w ith their

             to k no w somethi ng r eal ly t-e r r i bl e had happened.                             We- were formed up in

             a cordon by I n spector Sykes at this                             location,         to guard these           bodies,

              ‘acing    towards            Gate C.        The     gates     kept     being      opened and        other

             p o licemen kept              b r i n g i n g more    people      out.      Some were        dead,     others were

                                                                                                                 15 bodies

             right     behind me.

             A short time             later       the Liverpool           fans     started       leaving     the    ground,

             w here    the first            people     they saw were us,                guarding      bodies.        They

             h u r l e d abuse        at    us,    saying       it was all         our fault        for   opening        the

             gate.       I d i d n ’t even know what                   they were       talking      about,        but what

             could     1 say,         they might          be    right,      I d i d n ’t know.        By now there were

             lots of injured outs i d e Gate C and medical                                  teams    had a r r i v e d    in

             response      to a        radio       call.        Police      vans were        used to ferry some                of the

             injured to hospital.

             As the      crowds        built       up outside          the L e p p i n g s Lane     end,     a

             s u pe ri nt en de nt         whom    I did not know,             took    10 of us a way to gently move

             the    crowds       to    the     other      side     of the      bridge       and stop anyone

             a p pr oa ch in g    the       g r o un d without         good    reason.          What a futile        exercise
      cA1
             that was.           As we        tried    to move         people,       more    came out      behind us,

             filling      in the           e mpty spaces.          Fans       were    coming      up to me       looking        for
  r
             their     sons,      asking          me what was happening.                    I c o u l d n ’t tell    them,       I

             didn't     know.          I made       s o mething        up so that        it, a p p e a r e d ever y t h i n g    was

             under     control.

             I felt as       if       I should be doing                s o m e t h i n g more    to help the        injured,
                                                                                                                           PAGE         5
                                                                                                                           R346

           instead          of moving         people away,          getting      lots of abuse             in the     process.'

           I     never      a c t u a l l y went       into   the gr o u n d    until     we were all            called    in for

          d e - b r i e f i ng      in the N o r t h Stand.            I w a s n ’t, a l l o c a t e d a body to deal

          W ith o ytside             the    ground.           I didn't    know the full             extent       of what     had

           h a p pened        until       I. saw the news         on TV    later        that     night.      I felt so

           helpless,            in that        I *d been the re and            d i d n 't feel      as    though     I ’d done

           enough to help.                    I c a n ’t remember        seeing        any Club S t e w a r d s      on my

           arrival          at, the ground.

           I remember              t h i nking     w h e n moving      fans awa y       from the         scene     that we had

           to be very              careful       arid diplo m a t i c as one           slight       incident        could have

           sparked           off a riot,           w hi c h we w o u l d n ’t have        been able        to handle.

           I. saw I n s p e c to r H a r r y White at               the de-brief.              He told me that             his

           serial           u su a l l y got     the    job of     putting       the     crowd      in the   different           pens

           at the           rear    of the       goal mouth,        work i n g    from the outside               to the

           centre,           but    for     some    reason h e ’d been told to                 let the fans           find thej.f

           own        level,       on this       occasion,        resulting       in too many            going      into   the

           a rea       i m m ed ia te ly      behind     the goal.         I could tell             he was     really

           d i s tr es se d by what              had happened.

           The        personal        radios       1   could hear were going                 non-stop.         If    I'd had one

               I w o u l d n ’t have        been able         to get     on air,       but then a gain           I wouldn’t

               have    had a n y t hi ng       to say.

           What        caused        this     incident?         I c a n ’t really say,              too many

               c i rc u m s t a n c e s all    h a ppening      at the     same       time,    at    the wrong        time and

               place.        How many w o u l d         have    died outside           had     the gate      not     been opened?

               Who    knows,       it may have           been more       than died        inside         the ground.

               Perh a p s    fans w i th ou t        tickets      should       have    been s e g r e g a t e d from those

               wi th tickets          before       they got a n y w h e r e      near     the ground.            If only     it

               had gone        so s m o ot hl y as        1988.      I t ’s a day I ’ll never               forget!

                      Sheffield,             for       a    football             match         between            Liverpool         a n d / M o t t i ngharn

A %-     -   -
                      Forest,              I was       working           in      company            with      P C 4 8 5 _P ICKEjjflNG a d o g h a n d l e r

                      from       South       Yorkshire                Police.

'                     Before       the       match          we    patrolled               an    allocated              area    which          I did      not     know.

                      This       area       had       several          public            houses         which         were    all    full        of     football

                      fans       who       were       drinking           heavily.               These         fans      all    appeared            to    be     from

                      the       Nottingham             Forest          club.             The    public            houses      in    our       area      were     busy

                      from       opening          time       at       11.00am            1100        until         about      10    or       15 m i n u t e s    before

                      the       match       kick       off       at    3.00pm            1500       when      the      fans    all       started         to     make

                      their       way       on    foot       towards             the         ground.

                                                                                                                                             S2385

At    3 - 0 5 pm    15 0 5 ,       same    date,             we    were        still       patrolling               our      designated

area     when       we       received          a    radio          message           for    all     officers                to    urgently

attend       the        ground.           On       arrival          I went           into    the        ground           with      the       police

dog    along        with          other    dog          handlers.               We    all    went        in       through          a    gate       off

the    main        road       which       brought             us    into        the    corner           of       the     ground         at       the

Nottingham              Forest       end.           We       remained           on    standby           at       this       area       together

with     mounted             Officers          for       about          10 m i n u t e s     until           we     were         informed          to

stand      down         and       dogs    were          replaced           in    the       vans.

I then      went         back       into       the       ground          and     onto       the     pitch           at      the    Nottingham

Forest      end.             I saw       several             casualties              laid    on     the          pitch       at    this          end       of

the    ground.               They    were          all       being       attended           to     either           by      Police       Officers

or    members           of    the    public.                 Not    being        familiar           with          this       ground          I

initially           thought          that          this       was       the     Leppings           Ln    end        and      that       the

situation           with          casualties             was       in     hand.         It    was       only         some         time later               I

discovered              that       the    incident                had     occurred           at    the       other          end    of t h e

pitch      and      the       casualties                I saw       being        attended           to       had       in    fact       been

carried       to        this       point       away          from       the     incident           at    the        other         end    — The

Leppings           Ln    end.

Whilst       I was           at    this    end          of    the       ground        there        was       a    rush       of    Liverpool

fans     come       running          towards             the       Nottingham              Forest        end        across         the       pitch.

This     group          were       obviously             intent           on    attacking           the          Forest           fans who         were

all    still        on       the    terraces             behind           the    barriers.               Together                with other

Officers           this       rush       was       stopped          and        the    fans        were       moved          back.        The

Liverpool           fans          I saw    at       this          point       and     moved        back          were       very       drunk       and

were     in a g g r e s s i v e          mood       and       if    they        had    not        have       been        stopped         would

have     attacked             the    other          fans.           This        incident           occurred              within         about          E5

metres       of     the       Nottingham                Forest          terraces.            At     this          stage          there       was       a

large      number            of    people          on    the       pitch        not    involved              making          it    difficult

to    assess        numbers          but       I would             say     there       was        about          2 0 — 30    running             across

to    attack        the       other       fans.

                                                                                                                                         S2385

             A    cordon     of    police          O f f i c e r s was      formed       across       the       pitch       and    all       the

             people        were    moved       away       from       the    Nottingham          Forest          end    back       to    the    half

             way    line.         I was       in    this       cordon       for    a    few   minutes           when       I received          a

             radio    message           to    bring       dogs       onto    the       pitch.        I therefore              resumed         from

             the    cordon        and    together             with    other       dog    handlers          used       my    Police       dog       to

             keep    the     area       behind        the      cordon       clear       of    fans,       other       than     those

             assisting        with       casualties.

             During        this    time       I saw       one    fight       involving          5    or    6    people        break      out       on

             the    pitch     and       this       was    broken       up    by    several          Police          Officers.           After

             some    time     the       public        order      situation             calmed       down       as    everyone          realised

             what    had     happened          and       we    were    told       to    remove       the       dogs    from       the    pitch

             and    they     were       returned          to    the    vans.           I then       remained          outside          the

             ground        with    other       dog       handlers.

             At    about     4.30pm          1630     I was      involved          in    escorting             fans    away       from       the

             ground    after        the       match       had    been       abandoned.              There       was    no     incidents.

             At    6.05pm     1805       we    were       stood       down    and       returned          to    Niagara       Police

             Sports    Ground.

                                                                                                      '                'P Q             SIGNED

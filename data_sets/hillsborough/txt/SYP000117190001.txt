                               :    X                                                                             '
              Station,         at       9am    that        d at e     together       with       other       officers          I was

              transported               by    pub1i c transport                 to H i l l s b o r o u g h     Footbal1 Ground               to

              perform        duties           in    relation           to    the   Semi       Final        match       between Liverpool

              and Nottingham                  Forest.

              At    approximately                  9,30am        t hat      date    I was       at    the     pr*e m a t c h     briefing

              given     by S e n i o r         Officers.                                                                                             ■

              My    duties      together                with     other       officers         were     in the          Spion Hop       end      of

              the     ground        to       segregate           Liverpool         supporters              from Nottingham Forest

              supporters            in t h a t          area     of   the     ground.           In o v e r a l l       charge     of my

              section was               Inspector           Calvert          together         with Police              Sergeant       1203

              Ma rp 1es .

              At    11am w i t h         other          officers         I took      up      position         in the         S pio n Kop

              awaiting         arrival             of    fans.

              I would        say        that       about       2.30pm        the S p i o n      Kop    end     of      the    ground would

              have    been      almost             f ull    to      capacity,        the      crowd        in t hat      area     I would         say

              that     the     majority             of     the      fans    both Liverpool                 and Nottingham Forest

              were     in a,o,Qd? h u m d u thg^oh^tf n e or                              two    of    the     fans      were     ejected

              from     the     groundby                 officers         p r ior   to     kick       off    for       being    the    worse       for

              drink.         I recal l             one     Liverpool          s u p porter       aged approximately                   18 y e a r s
was    ejected             from    the    Liverpool             section       of       the       S p i o n Kop,       due       to    his

offensive             conduct,        he w a s       ejected          from    the       ground.            Some       ten minutes

or    so     before         t he   kick    off,       he w a s        again       in the S p i o n Kop,                   this       time

wearing a             different          coloured          jacket,          he w a s        again       ejected           f r o m «the

grou nd and I was                  given       to    understand             that       he    had       paid
                                                                                                                 :
                                                                                                                twenty
                                                                                                                      ' N       pounds

to    gain       entrance          into    the m a t c h         on    the    second             occasion.

Some       10/15 m inutes             before         the    kick       off    the       Spion Kop              was    full       and       the

fans       were       pushing       and    shoving          to    gain       space.

As    players          ent,ered o n t o         the       pitch       the    crowd          became        excited          and       the

pushing          and       shoving       became       accelerated             as       did       the    noise        of    the       c r owd

making        it      impossible          to    h ear      any    communication                   between        fellow          officers.

When       the     game      c o m m e n c e d at     approximately                3pm and a matter                       of m o m e n t s

later,        the      crowd       roared       at    t his      time       I was       not       looking        towards             the

pitch        but      at    th e   crowd,       and       it w a s     as    if a goal              had    been       scored,

shortly          after       I looked          towards          the    West       Stand          side     of    the       grbund

(L e p p i n g s      Lane     side)      and       saw a       large       number          of    supporters              a nd Police

on    the     pitch.          My    first       impression was                that          some       f ans    had       inv4ded          the

p it c h ,    it w a s n ’t u n t i l          players          left    the       pitch and a mb ul an ce s                     entered

onto       the     pitch       that      the    situation             looked more                serious.            The1 F o r e s t

supporters             I believe          thought          likewise          at    first          because        they          began       to

chant        obscenities            towards          the L i v e r p o o l        supporters              and when             they    too

must       h ave      realised        it w a s       not    a    pitch       invasion             they     became          a    li ttle

more       subdued.

When       it was          realised       that       people       were       injured             etc,     two    men who             were

stood        near      to    me,    identified             themselves             as    doctors           and wanted             to

assist.            I was       instructed            by    Inspector          Calvert             to    take     them          through

the K o p        at    the    back       and    o nt o     the    pi tch,         with       extreme           difficulty             you

had    to     squeeze         through          the    crowd,          not    that       they       did     not w a n t          to    clear

a    path     tS l e t       us    through' but            the    f act      that       they       couldn't           move       to do

so,    I re m e m b e x       thinking          t hat      if    I fell       to       the       ground        the    likelihood

             of       being       injured          or    regaining          my    feet         would       have     been       tremendous.

             However,             having       reached          the     pitch       from        the    entrance            between         the S p i o n

             Kop and             the    No rth S t a n d        the    doctors           ran        towards       the W e s t        Stand       to

             give       assistance.

             I however                saw    that       a Police       officer           was        coming     off       the     pitch      carrying

             the       body       of a y o u t h ,        heading        towards              the    gymnasium,            he w a s      having

             difficulty                and    I 'gave a s s i s t a n c e         to      carry       said     body        into      the    gym.

             In       the    gym       the    officer          left    and       I was         instructed           to     stay with           the

             body, w h i c h           I did,       minutes          l a ter     the     body was           certified            dead      by a

             doctor,             I commenced a death                    report         as      instructed           etc.

             I remained with                   the       body    u n til       approximately                3.15am Sunday                16 A p r i l

             when       it w a s        identified             to me     by on e         Albert        Hewitt         as      his    16 y e a r       ol d

             son,       Nicholas             Michael          Hewitt     of                                                         Leicester.

             After          identification                I travelled with                     the    body     to     the M e d i c o       Legal

             Centre.

             OBSERVATIONS

             During          my P o l i c e        service       I have          w o r k e d at       other       Semi-Final             matches           at

             Hillsborough.                    As    regards          communication                  difficulties,              I was       not

             issued with                a radio,          however        I can         say      that       when     speaking          to    an

             officer             at    your    side       you    had     to      shout         in o r d e r    to     be      hear d .

             When       as       stated       previously,             I took        the        doctors        through          the    K o p at        the

             back       and       through          the    walkways          leading            to    and    from      the Kop,           t his a r e a

             I would             estimate          was    more       than      full      to     capacity and               I took        the     view

             there          were       far    too       many    for    safety and               I reiterate              my    greatest          fear

             was       falling          to    the       ground,       and yet          there         were     f ans      still       crammed          in

             the      walkways              trying       to    get    o nto      the     Kop.

             I submit             this       report       for    your       information.

     o r d in a ry for a major                m at ch of this kind        involving Liverpool.                  Indeed,

     fans         looking       for    tickets are        common at most major matches                   these       days.

         I. was    not aware          of the op er at io n of ticket          touts     in this area.                In the

         past,     touts       have    been    roughly treated        by M er se ys id e     fans and they were

         probably m uc h move            covert     in their a ct iv i ti e s      here than they might                   be

         elsewhere.           Many Li ve rp oo l     fans who      came    ticketless        hoped,          instead,       to

         pick     up one w hi ch became            'spare*    because      the ticketholder              had,

         himself,        been    indisposed.         I saw no tra ns ac ti on s         between touts               (if

         they were        there at all)           and ticketless       fans.       I saw no signs              of

         disorder        amongst L i ve rp oo l      fans wjno were making            their way to the

turnstile,          there was a free-for-all                for    entry.        I saw a single Police

O f fi ce r   standing       by the       t urnstiles we were            trying to reach.              He was

helpless       in trying          to order       the    crowds.     Small       groups   of young

ticke tl es s       fans were       begi nning         to gather aro un d the front              of the

turn st il es       in the    hope       of gaining admission.                Some young men h a d

already       climbed onto          the    outer wall       in an atjfempt to find a way                  in.

No atte mp t was made              to filter       oat fans with ou t           t i c k e t s or to direct

This    combin at io n of factors meant                   that suppo rt er s        had to struggle,

physically,          to    reach their a pp o in t ed           position of entry.              Older    farts

a nd w o m e n had to be           pr ot ec te d from the         crush as more          fans    joined this

mass    of    people who were ^attempting                  to gain entry to the              game.       Evert at

this    time     (£.35 pm         >(1435 h r s ) , it seemed u nl ik el y that               the m atch

would     be able to start               on time,       given the       numbers     of   people

approaching          the    turnstiles,          the    c onfusion a r o u nd them and the almost

certain       i n te ns i fi c at i on    of the struggle          to get       in as kick-off          time

came    closer.           I was    s ur p r i s ed that    no m e nt i o n of delaying           the    kick-off

came whe n we fina ll y made                it    inside    the ground.



Our    seats were          located at       the Hop end of the North Stand.                       F ro m here,

we    could see       im me di at el y that        the    central       two    pens at the L ep pi ng s Ln

end a l r e a d y    looked d a ng e r o u s l y overcrowded.                 Indeed,    I com me nt ed to

R o g a n Taylor      on just       this    point.        One    sensed that        little a t t e n t i o n was

being     given to the            need to distribute             farts evenly       inside      the ground

because       the    outside       pens    on left and          right    seemed only about             half    full

at this       time £.50       pm    (1450 h r s ).        Police and stewards at S h e f f i e l d are

p ro bably used to c on ce nt ra ti ng                 visiting    farts into these          central

Pe o p l e     seemed to be joining               the    central          section and there were             no

signs        of fans being          fed from the front                of the terracing            into the         clear

an attempt           to    invade     the      pitch.         The motive      for an a tt e mp t ed       pitch

invasion           remains       obscure.        The m atch had been started only a few

minutes.            This attempt          to scramble             out of the      pens was a clear

i n d i c a t i o n to me that          there was an o v er cr ow di ng               problem     in the     central

pens.          As more      fans     came      over the fence,             police     lined the half way

line     to keep Liverpool                an d Forest          fans apart,        though one L iv erpool                fan

did    reach the           opposing       goal     area and remonstrate with Forest

police were a tt e m p t i ng             to    rescue/pans          by    ope rugng the gates         to the

       and a combin a t io n of the               heat and       crush on the terraces                 had made    it

       n e ce s ss a ry for some       to try to escape and for                    the game to be halted

       temporarily.          O nly when medical             workers       began trying to              revive   fans     on

       the    field did       it become          clear    that deaths        had occurred.              The arrival

      J & x s r e was    little    doubt    that man y of the Liverpool                    fans    involved       in

       the tragedy.          To the extent           that scuffles           did take        place this,        above

       all    else,      lay at the      heart.          Personally,       I saw no supporters

       There    was      no doubt,     however,          that    relations        between some          fans and

       the Police were            very s tr ai ne d       in what was an ext re me ly stressful

      hoa r d i n g s and      load their           charges,       before     carrying        them off to the                  far

      end of the ground.                    There    seemed     little       obvious      o rg an is a ti o n       in this

      and there         seemed some           danger       of the     injured       su ff er in g     further injuries

      t h ro u g h eg their           slipping       off the hoardings              while      in transit. (This

       because       of the t r ag ed y at           the Leppings           Ln end of the ground.                    Fans

       r ealising       the    full     extent       of the disaster.               I remained to talk                   to

      to control          what was          h ap pening     outside      the ground,          which had         led to the

      d ec i s i o n to open the             c on ce rt in a gates.          A number       of fans       told us that

      some     people were            banging       on the     c oncertina gates,             while     trying           to get

       in from outside,               but    the    gates were       heavy and were u n da ma ge d as far as

        |rhe ground were a pp ar en t at £.30                     p/t (1430 h r s ) when we a p p r o a c h e d the

         turnstiles.       T ic ke t le s s    fans werel/ingl ing w ith those who had t i c k e t s .

         It was a struggle             to    reach the turnstiles.                  At that time          I saw no

         violence       or obvious          signs    of drunkeness           contributing          s i g n if i c a n tl y to

         these     problems.       It was       obvious       then that           (a)   fans would be            left

         outside at kick-off                time,    an d   (b)    there was a considerable                    potential

          or disorder          outside       the ground as          kick-off a p p r o a c h e d,              s i d e , it

        was     obvious    from     150 metr es awa y or more                 that       pens 2           3    (Central

         pens)    were a lr e ad y d a ng e r o u s l y o v e r c ro w de d at 2 .4 5 jfr] f (1445 h r s ).

                 e in those       pens,       e s p ec i al l y those at          the front must a l r e a d y have

         been at serious          risk of being             crushed or        injured or of passing                   out      in

         the    heat.     (Some may a l re a d y have              done so).            Police    officers and

         stewards       close    to the       pens    do not seem to have                 been    responsive          to

         this    potential       until       it was     clearly too          late.        Fans    could have          been

         removed from the          front       of the       central        pens    via the       perimeter        gates

        and     relocated       into the       open areas          in front        of the side        pens.         As far

^\!ift(Mas I can remember,              no fans were m oved                in this way.           It seems

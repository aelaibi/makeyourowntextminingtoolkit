     HOME SECRETARY'S SPEECH FOR THE
DEBATE ON LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S REPORT
                        30 JANUARY 1990


Ye s t e r d a y    I    made       a    statement            about    the

Ta y l o r         Re p o r t           and         I         had      the

OPPORTUNITY                THEN               TO        EXPRESS         MY

SYMPATHY FOR THE RELATIVES AND FRIENDS

OF    THOSE        WHO     DIED          AND        FOR THOSE          WHO

SUFFERED           INJURY           AT    HILLSBOROUGH.                 To
VOICE        THAT SYMPATHY AGAIN                          IS NOT OUT

OF PLACE - BUT                  I   AM SURE THE BEREAVED

MOULD        AGREE        WITH           ME        THAT       THE     BEST

SERVICE           WE     CAN        NOW       PERFORM          FOR    THE

DEAD         IS     TO      BEND          ALL           OUR     EFFORTS

TOWARDS           PREVENTING              A    SIMILAR          TRAGEDY

EVER HAPPENING AGAIN.
                               2.



Wha t   happened         at     Hi l l s b o r o u g h    on   15

April    last      year        must       not     finish       as

JUST    ANOTHER          ENTRY       IN     THE      LIST      OF

MAJOR   TRAGEDIES             WHICH       HAVE     AFFLICTED

FOOTBALL    OVER          THE       YEARS.           IT    MUST

MARK A NEW        BEGINNING           FOR       FOOTBALL       IN

THIS COUNTRY.            The TRAGEDY WOULD NEVER

HAVE OCCURRED HAD THE LESSONS FROM THE

PAST     BEEN        LEARNED              AND        PROPERLY

applied.        Th i s    time      they      have       got   to

BE LEARNED,       AND IF THEY ARE,                  THE LOSS

OF   LIFE   WILL         NOT    HAVE      BEEN       ENTIRELY

IN VAIN.

Ye s t e r d a y     I    had        the       chance       to     thank

Lo r d     Ju s t i c e     Ta y l o r         for    his        report.

I     would        also        now       like        to    thank        his

assessors,            M r Br i a n J o h n s o n ,          the    Ch i e f

Th e i r    special        knowledge             and       experience

WAS OBVIOUSLY INVALUABLE.



I        STATED           PLAINLY              YESTERDAY                THE

G o v e r n m e n t 's    response             to     the        report,

OUR        DETERMINATION                  TO        SEE     A     GREAT

CHANGE         IN THE WAY IN WHICH THE GAME

THE        MAY   IN   WHICH          CLUBS       TREAT       THEIR

CUSTOMERS.            I    SHALL          RETURN       TO    THOSE

MATTERS          SHORTLY,           BUT    I    HAVE      TO     SAY

NOW THAT THE OPPOSITION'S RESPONSE TO

THE        CHALLENGE           OF     TAYLOR          HAS      BEEN

NOTHING SHORT OF PATHETIC.



T h e Rt Ho n M e m b e r       for       B i r m i n g h a m Sm a l l

He a t h    of    course       does       not     think      there

IS ANY SUCH THING AS                      FOOTBALL

HOOLIGANISM.              He   DID NOT LIKE IT WHEN

I   QUOTED HIS WORDS AT SECOND READING,

BUT    I    AM AFRAID HE WILL HAVE TO LIVE

WITH THEM.               HE SAID,        AND I QUOTE:



"1     DO   NOT      BELIEVE           THERE     IS ANY          SUCH

THING          AS          FOOTBALL              HOOLIGANISM"

[Ha n s a r d ,     27    Jun e   1989,        Co l u m n    916]


[Ye s t e r d a y    he     complained            that       I    had

NOT QUOTED THE WHOLE PASSAGE,                               BUT ALL

HE ADDED WAS:                "THERE        IS CRIMINALITY

IN SOCIETY AND THERE IS VIOLENCE".



He      DID NOT           SEEM TO        THINK THERE WAS

ANY    PROBLEM WITH               BRITISH        FOOTBALL           AT

ALL,    BECAUSE HE VOICED HIS PRIDE                              IN




                                  5
                                  6.



THE      FACT        THAT      THE      LABOUR    PARTY       HAD

NOT           SUPPORTED           MEASURES        TO      CURB

DRINKING IN GROUNDS.                      H e SAID:



"T h e    Op p o s i t i o n     have    never    supported

THE PROPOSAL THAT DRINKS SHOULD NOT BE

SOLD      INSIDE           GROUNDS."           [27.6.89    COL

861].


As       HE    DOES        NOT       THINK     ANYTHING       IS

WRONG,         IT IS SCARCELY SURPRISING THAT

HE HAS         NOT    BEEN       EXACTLY       FERTILE WITH

NEW      IDEAS        AS    TO    HOW     TO     PUT    THINGS

right:          but    the     same      excuse    is   not

THAT         HE     DID       NOT        AGREE          WITH         THE

CENTRAL           PROPOSAL         IN       THE     REPORT         THAT

STANDING ACCOMMODATION SHOULD GO.                                      If

HIS     IS        THE      AUTHENTIC            VOICE        OF     THE

La b o u r    Pa r t y ,    then       the      world       can     see

DOCUMENT PUBLISHED BY THE HOME OFFICE

De p a r t m e n t    which      owes      its        origins       to

THE TECHNICAL WORKING PARTY SET UP BY

Lo r d                    Wheatley        in    the    course       of

PREPARING            HIS    REPORT        ON     CROWD       SAFETY

AT SPORTS GROUNDS WHICH WAS PUBLISHED

in    1972.           The       document         will     now       be

REVISED              IN     THE           LIGHT         OF      THE

RECOMMENDATIONS.                  BUT I SHOULD SAY^ IN

JUSTICE          TO        THOSE          WHO     HAVE         BEEN

RESPONSIBLE FOR IT OVER THE YEARS THAT
REMARKABLY WELL:                    AND INDEED    IT IS

DIFFICULT NOT TO CONCLUDE THAT IF THE

GUIDANCE          WHICH        IT    CONTAINS    HAD    BEEN

PROPERLY            FOLLOWED          AND     APPLIED     AT

Hi l l s b o r o u g h   j and      more     recently     at

Mi d d l e s b r o u g h ,    neither      accident    would

HAVE HAPPENED.



I   SHOULD SAY A WORD ABOUT THE ROLE OF




THE     POLICE           IN    ENSURING       SAFETY    AND

EFFECTIVE CROWD CONTROL.                     A   KEY ISSUE
AND THE POLICE.         THERE MUST BE NO

OPPORTUNITY FOR EACH TO STAND ASIDE

THINKING THAT THE OTHER IS IN CHARGE:

and       Lo r d       Ju s t i c e          T a y l o r 's

RECOMMENDATION THAT THERE SHOULD BE A

WRITTEN   STATEMENT        OF    THE    RESPECTIVE

FUNCTIONS OF CLUB AND POLICE FOR CROWD

SAFETY    AND      CONTROL       IS    ONE      I     CAN

READILY ENDORSE.         I ALSO WELCOME               HIS




RECOMMENDATION        THAT        CLUBS         SHOULD

RECRUIT    AND     TRAIN        SUFFICIENT          FIT,

ACTIVE AND ROBUST STEWARDS,              NOT LEAST
 BECAUSE THE MORE CAPABLE THE STEWARDS

 THE LESS CLUBS WILL NEED TO                      CALL    FOR

 SPECIAL POLICE SERVICES,                  THUS

 RELEASING         POLICE    OFFICERS        FOR    DUTIES

OUTSIDE          THE    GROUND       NOT    NECESSARILY

CONNECTED WITH FOOTBALL:                   A BENEFIT TO

THE PUBLIC GENERALLY.



Fo r    these      reasons, and        because       it   is

RIGHT IN PRINCIPLE,              I   SUPPORT THE




r e p o r t 's    RECOMMENDATION           [R.53]     that

POLICE AUTHORITIES SHOULD                  ENSURE THAT

CHARGES          MADE   TO   CLUBS     FOR        POLICING
INSIDE GROUNDS ARE REALISTIC.                             I SHALL

ENCOURAGE               CONSISTENCY                OF         POLICE

AUTHORITY          PRACTICE                 WITH     REGARD        TO

CHARGING,        SUBJECT TO THE NEED,

RECOGNISED          IN     THE          REPORT,      FOR        LOCAL

DISCRETION AND THE NEED TO HAVE REGARD

TO LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES.



Lo r d   Ju s t i c e    Ta y l o r         has    much    to    say

IN HIS REPORT ABOUT HOOLIGANISM.                                LlKE




MANY BEFORE HIM, HE HAS CONCLUDED THAT

THERE IS NO SINGLE MEASURE WHICH WILL

DEFEAT      FOOTBALL         HOOLIGANISM                AND     EVEN



                             a   #    . .
A    PACKAGE        OF     MEASURES         MILL   TAKE     TIME

TO HAVE         EFFECT.



IN     RECENT        YEARS       THE        GOVERNMENT       HAS

BEEN ATTACKING THE HOOLIGAN PROBLEM ON

MANY         FRONTS:       WE        HAVE     TAKEN       ACTION

AGAINST ALCOHOL ABUSE                   IN THE SPORTING

Ev e n t s    (Co n t r o l     of    Alcohol        etc)    Act

1985; ME HAVE INTRODUCED IN SECTION 5

of   the      Pu b l i c   Or d e r A c t     1986    a   new




OFFENCE        OF    DISORDERLY             BEHAVIOUR,*     THE

POLICE HAVE DEVELOPED THEIR TACTICS BY

MAKING EFFECTIVE USE OF CLOSED CIRCUIT
TELEVISION           (CCTV)        AT   GROUNDS         AND    BY

INCREASING          THE      GATHERING          AND     USE    OF

INTELLIGENCE            ON     HARD-CORE          HOOLIGANS.

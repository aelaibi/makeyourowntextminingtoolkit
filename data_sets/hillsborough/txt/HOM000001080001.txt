my     opinion             ~ quite            co r r e c t .



Fans         rushed         through             the     gate          on my       l e ft      (Gate        1.)) i n l a r g e       numbers.

Shortly afterwards                            I dismounted                  and       ra n    inside         the      ground        to P o l i c e

crowded and                 people            were spil ling                 onto       the        pitch         behind      the       goal.

 Imagining               what          I saw        to be         a    pitch          invasion         I went          b ac k    to m y     horsey

 re-mounted                and        took      a team           of 8 h o r s e s            to G a t e      0-



 Shortly            after           our      arrival,            casualties              and       bodies          were      brought         off     0^

 the         pitch and              set      d o w n all         around          us.         Almost         al l     were     apparently                  ft

 why    people             were    not     passing            through.              The     crowd      hardly          seemed         to

           On Saturday 15th April            1989 (150489),       I travelled to Sheffield to see

We only stopped once on the way, about                       15 mins from Sheffield,        for a

drink and a bite to e a t .

Whilst travelling to the ground I did not see other fans drinking

a 1 coho 1.

We arrived at Sheffield at about 2.15 pm (1415) and parked in a side

street about 5 to 10 mins walk from the Hillsborough Ground.

Having    parked the car, we made our way,                    on foot,    to the ground.          I

d i d n ’t see any disorder or drunkeness on the way to the Leppings Ln

end.     Ne i t h er did I see any pol><feirien directing fans to the West

Stand area.                        /

I arrived at the West Stand main gates at                                            (1430) and

joined the crowd and people             came behind us.             1'Kere was a feeling of

being trapped in the crowd and I found myself                         locked in the middle of
                                                                               --n

On getting inside the ground I still h a d n ’t shown my ticket and I

thought there must be more_turnstiies                       inside but    I was carried along

with the crowd towards the tu n n e l .              I could see players on the field,

through the tunnel.

Once   into the tunnel        I remember thinking that                I had to show my ticket

but I was unable to stop or turn round by then,                          even if I wanted to,

because the flow of the crowd was so strong.                          I became apprehensive

about the tightness of the crowd/tn the tunnel and I told my mates to

    By the

    i nto pen,                and        got separated from us straight away.            I

    at this       point or in the tunnel. .XT never saw any police or stewards

    in pens 3 or 4, neither d i p / i       see any disorder     in the form of

    I took up my match viewing           position at abouV^fi.55 pm (1455) and I

    felt the c rowd^t i ghteni ng around me.           I /fax stuck in this position

    for about            minutes,   the crowd pressi      getting more intense every

    minute.       A   did not feel ^rfy crowd surge or pushing,         justy& gradual

    Standing jry^xt to me on my right hand side was a white m a n , aged about

    35 y r s .     He was plump build,     he had dark,    short,   collar length hair,

    no beard or moustache or glasses.            He was wearing a dark,        green

CLba s e d .    tweed,    heavy sports   coat.   I noticed him first because          it was

            ely warm day and he was wearing the heavy coat.               He was sweating

            ly.       It was about 20 minutes    past three    (1520) when I realised

    this man was seriously ill.            Together with other people around him,

   we kept trying to stop him from slipping               into unconsciousness        but he

    only roused once.          Isaw his eyes roll up and his head fell to one

                I left the ground at 4.20 pm (1620) after a police officer told us

                the gates were open.          I never witnessed anything which I consider to

                be a criminal offence.

                I, would like to add that when people in^pen 4 were screaming to be

                let out,    there was a row of about ^20 po li c em en .        One officer who was

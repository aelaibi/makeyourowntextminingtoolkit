                 1    arn a Sheffield Wednesday Football S u p p o r t e r, but on Saturday 15th

                 April       1989,   I travelled to the Sheffield Hillsborough Ground to watch

                 the semi final between Notts Forest and Liverpool,                       I had a ticket for

                 the standing area in the Leppings Lane Liverpool area for which I paid

                 £6.00


                                                                            and

                                                                        arrived at thti Leppi ngs Lane gates

                       roughly       1450hrs my entrance was gate B. The entrance for away

                 supporters,         the             had tickets for the Notts Forest End, so I was

                 entering the match on my own. When I actually arrived at the perimeter

                 gate there was a really dense crowd                         people w hich was escalating by

                 the minute my main thought was just to make my way to the front to
                                                                  PAGE

watch the match once I entered the crowd you were not able to go one

way or another of your own accord. You had to go with the crowd any

steps forward were a natural   progression with the crowd. The people

shouting to move back but there was just no way that anyone    could go

anywhere.   There was a lot oj/oodily pressure at this time you had no

control at all.
                                UCfMOU*
There were about four mounted policfc officers at this point the horses

were in the crowd, they / i d not appear to have any control of the
     '                 g                ♦
crowd at all. I think/t s^w about two or thfjee foot officers

controlling the perimeter gAte aXternpt"sT were made to tylose it at short

intervals   in an attempt to control the intake of people towards the

turnstiles but this was useless each time I was attempted to close it,

it was pushed open by the crowd. Pressure was building up all the

time and body weight was getting heavier and heavier once I got

through the perimeter gate making my way towards the turnstile the

pressure behind me got greater and greater. There was a young girl       in

front of me struggling to get out,   I think she must have been really

frightened by the volume of the crowd,   everything must have stopped as

the crowd did not appear to be going anywhere at the front it was just

building up from behind. My own impression is that they must have

closed the turnstiles as no one was going anywnere.    I think we were

like this for approximately two or three miriutes. The pressure was

that great I was beginning to think I saw iChe concertina gate to the

left of the turnstiles shoot open,   that was it then I just got lifted

off my feet and went with the crowd through the gate. Once I was

through the gate I d o n ’t remember very much it all appears to be a

blurr.   I remember going around the back of the turnstiles and then

making my way towards the tunnel. Whilst   I am a Wednesday supporter

and familiar with the ground I am not familiar with the terrace and as

it would normally be used for away supporters   I made for the tunnel

  purely because of the noise level of the cro^d which indicated the

 start of the match as I got to the t u n n e l ^         heardJWie whistle go for

 whatsoever    I saw about four stewards near <%Y t h e ^ e n t T l S g g - ' o ^ h e

 seating area to keep people away from there but there was no control

 over the crowd running towards the tunnel entrance. When I made my way

 through the tunnel there was no pressure at all from people there were

 a fair crowd milling throughrit but it did not cause concern, as I

  reached the bottom of the^tu nn el it was then that I felt a lot of

  pressure behind me, as F started to feel the pressure I began to move

  to the right   (pen 3) to get away from the crush there was no way I

  could have   gone jammed so going right was my only option.

  I edged my   way through the crowd        with great difficulty until             I could

  find a pla.ce that gave ,quite a good view and/was, comf or table •yj/ftand.

  It had still not occurred to me as to why the people at the front were

  climbing the fence.      I had just no idea whatsoever           I could understand

 at the back because of the volume of people being crushed,                     I only

  became aware when a Liverpool         fan came up to me and said people were

 dying at the front. What I then looked towards the pitch and saw

  people trying to resuscitate         people the lad that was speaking to me

 must have come from the front as he was             in terrible shock.         I don't

  know who he was as his mate        came to take him a w a y . I must have stepped

  in the terrace about twenty - twenty five minutes before making my way

         towards the tunnel to get o u t . As I did so I recollect about half

           dozen Liverpool    fans carrying a person above their heads and making

         their way out through the tunnel.       I made may way through the tunnel

         and once outside in the courtyard.       I saw three or four what appeared

         to be males laid on their side almost       in recovery position they were

         all separated at the head of the middle of the tunnel as you came out

         of it. They were motionless,    I did not go over to them I just made my

         way from the ground.    I am not able       identify any of the clothing of

         these four persons whatsoever or a/sisting       in any identification.   I

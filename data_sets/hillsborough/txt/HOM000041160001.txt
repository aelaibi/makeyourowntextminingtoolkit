  “In my opinion, one o f the biggest problems with the Police operation was lack o f
  communication. As I have already stated, I was on public order foot patrol without a radio
  between us, therefore, in the event o f our being needed urgently or to attend an incident, unless
  w e were in sight o f the Sergeant we would have known nothing about it, which I find quite
  abysmal. We would not even have been able to summon assistance, should we have required it.
  I have worked several semi-finals at Hillsborough as well as numerous league matches. My usual
  duty is at the Leppings Lane end turnstiles and on the identical match last year, I was in the
 Leppings Lane Stand on the upper tier o f seating. Our duty was to prevent Liverpool supporters
 from getting out o f the stand into the standing area below and also prevent any objects from
 being thrown down at the persons below. I can quite clearly remember from this match last year
 as to how the Liverpool fans always congregate very heavily in the area behind the goal. [ I
 remember that last year the crush behind the goal was immense and was appalled that people
 would stand being in amongst people so tightly packed. Whenever anything happened on the field
 tor example the Liverpool goals last year the crowd in the pens below us at Leppings Lane just
 became a sea o f waves the crowd from behind pushing forward time and again to create waves o f
 people. I passed comment to fellow officers last year about how glad I was not to be in amongst
 the crowd.]
I do feel that it should be said that in my opinion there were far too many people allowed to drink
before going into the game and to my recollection there were very few last year who had anything
to dnnk. I can think o f no more relevant information o f use to be provided in this event.” (Pp.80-

above in square brackets. (P.320) He therefore fails to comment upon the fact that PC Eustis

         on     public       order          patrol         it    soon    became          apparent          that       many        Nottingham

         local        public          houses.          They       were    drinking             heavily          and        were

         well       behaved.

         As    time        went       by    the    crowds         began       to    get    larger          congregating                    outside

         the    public        houses            and    at    approximately                12. m i d d a y       there       was       a     crowd      of

         approximately                 300      fans       outside       the       Royal       Hotel.           The       public           house

         itself       was     full         to     overflowing            and       all    the       crowds       though           boisterous,

         were    well        behaved.             These          crowds       were       drinking          beer       by    the       crateful

         and    sat    drinking              it   on       the    pavement.              The    crowd       outside          the          Royal

Hotel       remained          well       behaved             but       as    time          passed       and       the    more       the       crowd

got       drunk,       so    the    atmosphere                   got    more          agitated.              This       culminating                in

a    bottle       being       thrown          at       myself          and       other          officers          on    the    other          side

of    the    road.           Shortly          after          a member             of       staff       from       the    Royal          Hotel

approached             us    to    say       that       there          was.trouble                in    the       premises.              Police

Sergeant          Thompson          summoned                assistance                and       the    public          house       was

cleared       and       the       crowd       moved          on.        They          were       all    very       drunk       but       due      to

numbers,          it w a s        impossible                to    do    anything                about     them         getting          to    the

ground.           As    the       rest       of    the       fans       filed          past       us    on P e n i s t o n e        Road,

heading       towards             the    ground,             it    was       obvious             from     their         demeanour             and

behaviour          that       many       of       them       had       been       drinking             and    were       drunk.              I have

not       worked       at    the    Penistone                Road       end       of       the    ground          before       and       cannot

comment       as       to    whether          it       is    usual          that       so       many    fans       should          be

drinking          or    drunk       before             the       match.

At    3    p.m.    we       began       to    make          our    way       back          to    the    ground          in    order          to

commence          Phase       <2)       duties,             those       being          on       standby       outside          the

ground.           However,          whilst             walking          back          towards          the    ground          as    a    serial,

it    became       apparefit            via       the       radio       that          there       were       problems          in       the

ground       at    the       Leppings             Lane       end.           We    began          to    make       all    haste          back       to

the       ground       on    the    way,, b e i n g          picked          up       by    a Police          Transit          van       and

dropped       at       the    ground.              We       entered          the       ground          and were          placed          on

standby       at       the    Kop       end       of    the       ground          underneath              the      North       Stand          along

with       several          other       serials.

After       some       five       minutes          on        s t a n d b y at         this       loation,         during        which             time

it    was    becoming             obvious          to        us    that there                was a major               disaster

occurring          at       the    Leppings             Lane       end,          we    were.all           then         taken       onto       the

field       and    placed          in a       line           in    a    public          order capacity                  along       thefront

of    the    North          Stand.           Upon       entering             the       field I saw             hundreds             of

Liverpool          fans       on    the       field          and       many       fans          laying       on    the       field

obviously          injured.              We       were       kept       in       the       line       in f r on t       of    the       North
Stand       for    some          ten minutes.                       It    was       apparent             during       this          time    that

the    Liverpool             fans       in       the       North          Stand          were       very       angry       arid w e r e

venting          their       anger          on    ourselves                   on    the       pitch.           The    abuse          and

physical          signals          from          persons             in       the       stand       was    on a       very          large       scale

and    I have          no    doubt          that       had          we    not       been       in    that       location             that       anger

would       have       been       vented          on       the       Nottingham                Forest          fans.           Several          fans

were    leaving             the    North          Stand             and       ripping          up    advertising                hoardings             and

taking       them       to       the    Leppings                Lane          end       and    carrying          injured             persons

away.        After          some       ten minutes                   at       the       front       of    the    North          Stand,          myself

and    Police          Constable             682       Lowe          were          instructed             along       with          two    other

officers          to    standby             at    gate          6    (six)          of    the       North       pen       in a n      effort          to

prevent          even       more       persons             from          entering             onto       the    field          than       there       was

at    present.              The    North          and       North             West       pen    of       the    Leppings             Lane       end at

this    time       were          fairly          empty.              Most          of    the    people          being          on    the    field.

The    fans       who       were       on    the       field             were       mostly          walking          around          in a       daze

but    it    became          very       apparent                that          the       vast    majority             of    them       had       been

drinking          heavily.              They          were          venting             their       anger       upon       the       Police          and

whilst       stood          at    this       gate          to       the       North       pen,       we    were       approached                by    a

member       of    the       press          who       was       being          kicked          and       spit    at       by    drunken

Liverpool          fans.           He approached                         us    for       protection.                 He    had       been       taking

photographs             of       the    incident                which          had       caused          the    Liverpool             fans       to

attack       him       in a n g e r .            His       camera             equipment             which       he    had       with       him was

being       kicked          and    spat          at    by       the       fans.           In    an       effort       to       protect          h i m we

tried       to    keep       the       Liverpool                fans          away       but    they       were       so       intent       to       get

at    him.        The       abuse       coming             from          persons          still          left    in       the    North          and

North    West          pens       as    w e 11        as    from          on       the    field.           Whilst          there          coins

began       to    rain       down       on       us    from          the       terraces'at                the    press          man       and

ourselves.              The       only       way       we       could          protect          him       was    to       get       him    out       and

for    his       own    safety,             he    took          off       his       press       jacket          and       put    all       his

equipment          away.           Three          of       us       who       were       on    the       gate    then          formed       a
%                                                                                                    PAGE 4

    circle of sorts around him and attempted to run through the Liverpool

    fans    on   the   field    and    to     safety.          As we made           our way through the

    crowd    the    photographer's          camera equipment             and bags were kicked all

    over the pitch, we were spat on by fans who were obviously drunk and

    angry.       We eventually managed to get him to safety at the Nottingham

    Forest end.        I then went back to the centre of the field and assisted

    with the public order cordon across the field.

    The most striking thing about being on the field with the Liverpool

    fans was       how many had been drinking and some very heavily.                                 It was

    often    difficult     to understand them when                   they       asked for information

    regarding relatives,             etc.        By    this   time   as things began to quieten

    down on the field and the decision was taken to abandon the game, I

    was    directed     along    with       the       rest    of   the   public       order   line   to   go

    outside      the   ground and assist with persons                         leaving the game.        This

    appeared to go smoothly with a very subdued                                atmosphere     amongst all

    the Nottingham Forest fans.                   I had nothing to do with the supervising

    of the Liverpool fans moving from the ground.

    Upon    re-entering        the    ground       I    was    directed        to   the mortuary by an

    Inspector where I was put in charge of one of the bodies.                                    The body

    was No (2), later identified to me at 2.10 a.m.                                 as that of INGA SHAH

    SIDES    of Golders Green,              London,      34 years        of    age.     I then took the

    body    in a SYMAS     vehicle          to        the Medico Legal Centre, where the               body

    was booked in.        The body was                 described as female, 34years, shoulder

    length blonde hair of slim build and was wearing a green wax jacket

    and grey jumper and jeans.                   She was wearing black boots.                 I played no

    part    in   the removal         of this body from the Leppings Lane end of the

    ground and am unable to say which pen she came from.

    I finished duty at 4.00 a.m. on Sunday 16 April 1989.

At   1.1 5p m   I was      ins tr u ct ed by PS 454 Ch a p m a n       to attend at the

At   1 . 45 pm on c o n c l u s i o n of my meal        I was    then r e q ue st ed by PS 838

En route        I not ed    that coaches        from Liv erpool were n o w be gi nn in g             to

park     in H a l if a x Road,     I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y 5 or 6 coaches        in that

location.         I saw a crowd         I w ou ld e s t i ma te a p pr ox im at el y    200 to 300

co n t i n u e d down H al if a x Road       to Pen is to ne Roa d North and Leppings

Lane.      These     roads were        thronged w i t h suppo rt ers and I was surprised

that at this         time man y were m a k i n g no obvious attempt                 to make    their

way     in the d i r e c t i o n of the ground,          indeed quite a few were walking

away from the ground,                perhaps    seeking    licensed pr emises which were

 open?

 We e n te re d the ground via           the Le ppings Lane gate to drive                 through th

 car park to the rear of the South Stand.                          I remember re marking to PC

 have no p o s s i b i l i t y of being        inside    the ground       in good time for the..

 he was       inciting         the Forest suppo rt er s by his actions.                    I informed hint

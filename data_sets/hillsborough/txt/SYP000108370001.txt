POLICE CONSTABLE 2976




ECCLESFIELD POLICE STATION




At 9*00 am, Saturday 15 April 1989* I attended at Ecclesfield Police Station

where I paraded on duty.                 From there I was conveyed by bus to Hillsborough

football     ground.       On     arrival       at    the    ground I liaised with                other       officers

which    were   from my         Serial,    this       was     Serial        49.     On   reading        the   football

order I found I was required to patrol                            the Foxhill area of Sheffield in a

transit van and          we would have the call               sign Tango 4.

At Hillsborough          all    officers were          asked      to       seat   in appropriate         serials    on

the    North    Stand     and    here     we    received          a    briefing     by    senior    officers       and

intelligence        officers      in relation to the football match.                            On conclusion of

the     briefing     meals       were     provided          and       we    resumed      to    mobile     patrol    at

approximately 10.50 am.

On resuming to mobile patrol of the Foxhill area of Sheffield, I sat in the

rear of a small marked Police transit van which consisted of two bench type

seats    that ran        the length of                  the van.There were windows on all sides of

the van and all          of these could clearly be seen through.                              I was aware that we

were    to   make    a    check     of    the        public       houses      in   the    area     to    assess    the

situation regarding provisions made for supporters attending due to problems

that arose      the previous year.               At this time most of the public houses were

either quiet or closed.                 A particular visit was made to the Foxhill Public

House which is situated on Foxhill Road in its own grounds and had problems

with    supporters       last    year.         This    public house was visited by my Inspector

and a Police Constable.




                                    7V?s
Having continued mobile patrol a short                     time   it was noticed that supporters

were arriving in the area parking their cars and vans on side streets.

At 11.30       am*, The Fox Public House was checked and it was clearly seen from

the van that it was starting to fill up with Liverpool fans standing outside

the    pub   still     within      the    grounds   drinking.       Vehicles    were   now parking      on

both sides of the roads               and arriving fans were proceeding towards both the

ground and to the public houses.

At 12.30 pm, we were directed by radio control to attend nearby Wilcox Road

where youths were reported to be acting in a disorderly manner and urinating

in    people's       front    gardens.       At   the    bottom of Wilcox Road,         several Police

Officers     were     spoken       to regarding      this matter.       They indicated to a small

group of Liverpool fans that were walking up towards the top of Wilcox Road.

They    reported       that    they      had heard them being        abusive    and    seen    them throw

down beer cans but were                too far away on foot          to be able to approach them.

The youths were stopped and spoken to.                      It was immediately obvious that the

youths had all been drinking and were in a boisterous mood.                            The youths were

strongly       advised       and pointed     in the      direction of the football            ground.    On

returning       to     the     transit      the. youths      were     watched    closely       and    after

travelling a short distance they boarded a South Yorkshire Transport public

bus which was travelling in the direction of the football ground.

At 12.50 pm, The Fox Public House was again visually checked.                              By now their

car    park was       full to capacity and people had also started to drink on the

public footpaths surrounding The Fox.                     I would estimate there were in excess

of 400 people stood in                this area drinking,         of which consisted mainly of the

age    group    18    to     21.      Several     were   already the    worse    for drink      and     cat

calling as we paused to examine the crowd.




                         pc
At 1.00 pm the White Horse Public House on Halifax Road was checked and the

scene was similar to that of The Fox with Liverpool fans congregating around

the public house.

At    1.05    pm    we     received           a   message        from       control     that    they       required    us   to

attend       GT    News,      a    newsagent         and     confectionary             shop    that    was    situated      on

Foxhill Road opposite The Fox Public House, where an incident had took place

where    six      drunken Liverpool                 fans    had    gone       into     the shop,       acted disorderly

and    then       stole    cigarettes             and   sweets.             The   manageress         had    followed    them

outside       where       she     saw     them      drive    off       in    a white      Renault      van,     registered

number

At 1.15 pm,            whilst making a search of the area, I saw the van being driven

on Halifax Road.                  The   vehicle was followed to the White Horse Public House

where    it       parked up just              inside       the    car park.            After   a short        conversation

with the occupants of the van,                          Police Constable 333 Ogilvie,                        who was in my

serial, arrested the youths and they were placed in our Police van.                                                   Due to

the large         group of Liverpool                 fans attending the Public House,                         several fans

came upto         the transit           to see what was going off.                        Amongst      some of the cat

calls being made by the drinking fans,                                 several offers were made to the fans

to sell them their tickets to get into the ground.                                        The occupants of the van

were subsequently conveyed to Ecclesfield Police Station where they were to

be dealt with.

All     of    the      suspects         remained        in       the    rear      of    the    van     until    they    were

requested by the Custody Officer to go through the rear door at Ecclesfield

Poilce       Station       into         the       charge     area.           Throughout        the     period    that       the

suspects remained in the transit van, I remained with them supervising their

custody.          It    was     whilst I was            supervising the suspects                  that I had several

conversations            with      them    and      although       they had          initially        appeared hostile,
they    did    calm        down    and      talk    quite      freely       to pass     the    time,      whilst       their

friends were being documented.                        Several comments were made which only after

the incident appear relevant                       to the Hillsborough disaster.                        They had asked

what would happen if one of them pleaded guilty and would they be released

to go to       the football match.                   It was revealed that on theyouths travelling

to   Sheffield            that     only     two     of them      had    initially        got         tickets for          the

football match, however one had exchanged his ticket for two enabling three

of the six to see the game.                         All of the six youths were aware that at last

year's    football              match    supporters       had    been       able   to    get      into     the   football

ground without tickets, owing to the rush when the match was starting.

At   approximately               2.40 pm,    I     resumed     to mobile        patrol       in      the    transit van

along with the rest of my serial, excluding Police Constable Ogilvie who was

dealing       with        the    prisoners.          On   resuming          to Foxhill        area   of Sheffield           I

could    hear       that         there    had      now developed        a    problem     with        fans    around the

Leppings Lane end of the football ground and that other officers were being

deployed       to     the       area.       I heard my Inspector,              Inspector           Robinson, use          his

personal       radio        and    inform control            that we would be able                to assist if they

required our assistance.                     At that time we were informed that other officers

were    attending           the    location         and   we      would       not be required.              We     did move

closer to the ground around the area                             at the end of Leppings Lane.                      The next

radio    message          I h e a r d ,which        reported      a serious        problem        was     when     I   heard

someone       say    they        are    coming over the fence,               which appeared to me                that     the

football ground was being invaded by supporters.

Our serial then attended at Leppings                            Lane end of the football ground to                       find

that    the area was              congested with both motor vehicles                      and supporters coming

away    from        the     ground.           There was        poor     reception       on     the      radio    and      the

messages       relayed           were     diffcult to        understand.           We   parked       up     near       to the
                                                                    -    5   -




    football ground just off the main road, Leppings Lane.                                                We waited there for

    our next instruction believing there had been some sort of incident, but not

    knowing      the    sc a l e .     I saw several                    fans      as    they    came    away    from the ground

    shout and swear at officers who were on foot in the area, some were shoved.

    The    officers       accepted       some       of        the       shouts         but    restrained several                fans   who

    appeared the worse               for drink,           holding them until                     they appeared calm enough

    to continue on their way and being advised accordingly.

    I    saw    Inspector          Robinson    leave           the       transit         to    find     out    what    he       could by

    visiting the control box.                       He had only gone a few yards up the road when I

    saw him speak to a driver of a motor vehicle.                                              Inspector Robinson then got


#   in    the    vehicle       and moved           it    to the          side      of    the road.            The   driver of           the

    vehilce appeared to have been a doctor who made his way immediately towards

    the football ground.

    On    Inspector Robinson returning we                               were       informed of          the serious nature               of

    the    incident.           Our     transit          was    required            as    an ambulance          and our          services

    were       required       in    the mortuary              area.          We    walked       then     towards       the      football

    ground walking            through        the    rear       of        the North Stand to the gymnasium area.

    There we were             asKed to form a cordon along with a serial from Barnsley and

    to    allow        stretchers       through           with          dead       and       injured,    as    well        as    nurses,

    ambulancemen          and        other    officials.                     Throughout          this     period       I        saw    many

    confused fans,            some were        shouting and waving their arms about, others were

    crying       and    being       comforted by              what       appeared            their    friends       and some          other

    fans were fighting amongst themselves.                                       Several fans did make very assertive

    attempts to gain entry to the gymnasium, mostly worse for drink.                                                        These were

    restrained          and    when     calmed          down        explained            the    reasons       for     not       allowing

    entry.        They     were       then    escorted              away         from    the    entrance       of     the    gymnasium

    without being arrested.
Members of our serial were asked to assist in making an ad hoc casualty desk

in front     of the gymnasium at the edge of the North Stand.                           Here we obtained

details      and descriptions           of      missing     fans      and    details     of     the    people

concerned.      They were        then asked to check their motor vehicles and writing

phone numbers on their hands               of the casualty lines that were being set up,

as well as the          telephone number of Hammerton Road Police Station regarding

any   further      developments.        Whilst     at    this desk,         although most of the fans

came upset and worried,            several were          very angry and agitated,             smelling the

worse for drink,         I recall a small group coming up to me asking me questions

and   a young      female      in the   group,     who    was   the worse       for    drink,    asking me,

"How big is your willie"?               I was      confused by what           she was saying and when

she   again spoke        to me    she tried to apologise              saying,    "I'm sorry,          I'm just

trying to make light of it".                 Later I saw her and her friends re-united with

someone they had reported as missing.

At    6.00   pm,    I    was    asked     to    return    to    our    transit    van     and    to     attend

Claywheels      Lane      and     await        further    information.           Before       arriving      at

Claywheels Lane we attended the Northern General Hospital to deal with fans

fighting     the pressmen who           had gone     there      to report on the        incident.        Other

officers     were         present and we remained in thearea a short time as backup.

At 8.00 pm I was stood down along with my serial where we were allowed to go

for something to eat before               signing off duty at Ecclesfield Police Station

at 8.30 pm.

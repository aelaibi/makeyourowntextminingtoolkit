I gave the Taylor Inquiry secretariat a copy of Mr Simcock1s
minute of 12 January to Mr Baden and said that if Lord Justice
Taylor was minded to commend this agreement, he might like to do
so by referring to the value of agreements "broadly along the
lines of that between Lewisham and Millwall".

AGREEMENT BETWEEN LONDON BOROUGH OF LEWISHAM AND MILLWALL FC

Your minute of 11 January asked for my urgent opinion whether the
agreement between Lewisham and Millwall, of which a copy was
attached to your minute, is within the powers of the London
Borough.

2. I must begin with three points (which should clearly also be
made to anyone else to whom you copy the substance of this
minute).   First, it is not for the Department to say whether
anything is within the powers of a local authority or not: each
local authority must decide on the scope of their own powers,
subject of course to the supervision of their auditor and the
courts. Secondly, I am not a lawyer, and (given the pressures on
our lawyers) I cannot justify disrupting their programme of work
to carry out the substantial research that would be necessary to
give a fully considered opinion. Thirdly, the copy of the
agreement which you sent is partly illegible; your colleagues
were uhable to find a fully legible copy; my comments are
therefore subject to special qualifications on the illegible bits
(paragraphs 1(c), (j) and (1), 2(a), and 3).

3. I hope nevertheless that the following comments are helpful.

4. We have to start from the fact that a local authority must
have a statutory power for everything that it does. There is no
single power   which would enable Lewisham to enter into the
agreement. It is therefore necessary to look at the individual
provisions of the agreement to seek powers.

5. You mention section 137 as a possible source of a general
power. This does indeed give a very wide discretion to local
authorities. It is however subject to two major qualifications:
it cannot be    used to override specific limitations on other
powers, and it can only be used for things which are in the
interests of the local authority's area, or part of it, or of the
inhabitants of that area, or some of them. We have further
tightened   up these definitions   in section 36 of the Local
Government and Housing Act 1989, to require that any expenditure
is for the direct benefit of the area or the inhabitants (all or
part), and that it is proportionate to the benefit achieved.

6. I believe Millwall FC's ground is not in the area of Lewisham
borough council: this must colour the approach to the use of
section 137.

7. It is therefore necessary to look at the individual provisions
of the agreement.

8. It seems to me that paragraph 1(g), (h), (1), (o), and (p),
and 2(a)   (on the assumption     that the archery club is a
non-profit-making association) and (b) (on the assumption that
the women's football team also is non-profit-making and includes
some women from Lewisham) are within the powers of Lewisham under
section 19 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act
1976 (recreational facilities).

9. It could be argued that paragraph 1 (e )and (f ) are within the
powers under   section 142of the Local Government Act          1972
(provision of information about thecouncil's services.        This
would depend   on the use     made of the programme     space   and
announcement time secured: but it clearly could be used for this
purpose. There would be problems, however, if the space did not
provide information but merely said "Lewisham Borough Council is
great" or words to that effect.

10. It would seem fairly clear that paragraph l(m), if limited to
schools within Lewisham, or (if outside Lewisham) attended by
pupils resident in Lewisham would currently be within section
137, and from 1 April 1990 (when Lewisham takes over from ILEA as
education authority) would be within their education powers.

11. Paragraph l(i) seems to be within section 145 of the Local
Government Act 1972 (provision of entertainments). I think that
the same can be said of paragraph l(j) and (k) and paragraph 2(c)
as long' as the view is taken that attendance at a football match
is going to an entertainment. The same might be argued for
paragraph l(s), provided that some of the children are brought by
Lewisham parents.

12. I think that it can fairly easily be argued that    paragraphs
l(k) and 2(d)    are incidental to the council's        legitimate
activities in opposing racism etc. They would then be   covered by
section 111 of the 1972 Act (subsidiary powers) when     read with
the basic provisions of such legislation as section     70 of the
Race Relations Act 1976.

13. I think paragraph l(r) (murals) could have been supported
under section 2 of the Local Authorities (Land) Act 1963 which
permits local authorities to do works on land for the improvement
of their area, if the ground had been in Lewisham. Since I
believe that it is not, I find it difficult to see how that could
be supported.

14. Given that so many elements of the agreement can be supported
under specific powers, I think that paragraph 1(a), (b), (c), and
(d), 2(e) and 3 can be supported on the grounds that they are
incidental to the other activities for which there are specific
powers, and are therefore within section 111 of the 1972 Act,

15. I can think of no power which could support the purchase of
six cup-final tickets (paragraph l(q)) unless they were bought
for prizes in a Lewisham council lottery.

16. Likewise, I can think of no power which could support
paragraph l(t) (relations with the FA and FL): I do not see that
the Council has any legitimate business with these bodies which
needs the intermediation of Millwall.
17. Section 71 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 will
prevent further use of paragraph l(u) unless Lewisham obtains a
specific approval to being involved with Millwall by appointing a
director.

18. I hope that this is reasonably clear: if further explanations
are needed, please let me know.

climb over             the vertical          fencing       and tans       outside       the    pen were        trying

to as s i s t      them over          the    fence.        The    densely       packed     crush on the

vertical          fencing       appeared          to be about        five      persons     deep and at           its

one or two           shouting       such    remarks as          "You    don't     know what          i t ’s like,,'

was    the     panic       to scale       the   fencing.

At this        time    I do     not    believe         there were any          other     officers             inside       th

Suddenly      he star t e d s n atching                       breaths          and such was                    his weight             that

returned to the               front          fencing and             it was a p p arent                       by then that a lot

pass       bodies    through/the gate which had cleared considerably.                                        This    was

abandoned after a very short time as a number of the approximately 150

tans       left on the       terrace    contin u a l l y kept         getting        in the way either                 to

shout       recriminations at the Police, get out thro u g h the gate to look

for     friends      or just     g e n e r a l l y stagger     about.

Although        there    is no doubt many were               badly      shocked,          Inere       is equally

no doubt        that ma^fy were        drunk       or at    the least a f f e c t e d by al coho !

Eventually          the bodies and injured were removed and I w e n t o uj/t,inrougn

the wi ckeyET gate ■          Persons     were a i m l e s s l y     trying      to get       ba/k      in the       pen

a is n ecessary.

At one        point,, whilst      doing      so,    I saw a/Oery drunken man, aged about

2 5 ’27,      thinly built,       s taggering        ab/tit on the          terrace        near       the    front

the     pen    leapt    on him and'one         struck       him v i o l e n t l y on the            face.      1

ente r e d the       pen and     dragged the d r u n k e n y o u t h out of the                     pen and        onto

t he    pi t ch to get       him out    of    the way.         There      was    st i II appr ox imately

100 persons          on the    terrace and          the    public     order      si t u a t i o n     could on*re

with a radio             I requested        that a number                of bags          he/€&nt          for.      These

e v e n t u a l l y arri v e d and the            possessions            were      bjreiqed a n d taken by myself

I did not          return to the           pen or the            pi t>m as         by then the               grou nd was

well    on the way to being                 emptied.

In any       life and death             sit u a t i o n such as this                 r e c o llections            will      become

distorted.,           This acco u n t       is a c c urate           to the        best           of my belief          but    it

has    to be said that whilst                     some areas          are      crystal             clear and have a

lasting        i m p a c t , other      areas       are hazy.           1 am unable                  to give any

a c c urate       idea of t im s scale              f o r t h e s e event s ,,

1 am fairly           certain that          I was      the      first       to the            front      fsncisng        on the

inside       of    the    pen having made my way at                        least naif                of the      distance

down    the       terrace,        1 know      1     was able         to do so without too                       much

d i f f i c u l t y and will       remain         convinced         that many            of        the    fatal i t i e s     and

i njureis         could have         been avoi d e d          if    persons         in the            " c r u s h e s ’ had

leave    p r e c 1u d e d t h i s ,

As far as Police acti o n s                 are     cortcernea           it has        to         be said that          in the

early stages             it was    necessary          for     individual             officers             to do what          they

thought        best      in the    rescue         operation.            Persons          were          literally        dieing

before       their       eyes,    and    1 speak        p ersonally of my own ex pe ri-ence.

Dear Sir,

^ ^.llsborough 15 April 1989

I write on behalf of the Hillsborough Steering Committee who are
in turn co-ordinating the Hillsborough Group of Solicitors
instructed by those in.1ur.ed and bereaved as a result of the
incidents at _Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Stadium at
Hillsborough on the 15 April 198.9-

 The matter has been under investigation by the West Midlands
 Police under their Assistant Chief Constable Mr J Mervyn Jones
 who was initially working to Lord Justice Taylor in respect of
 the Inquiry and subsequently to H M Coroner at Sheffield.

 We appreciate that following the publication of the interim
 report the matter was referred to your office for consideration
 of any possible criminal charges and that whereas the West Midlands
 Police continued with the investigation they were now working to
 your directions.                               .

^fcilst matters were under the control of Lord Justice Taylor
 we made a request that copies of- statements made bv individuals
 at the ground (the majority of whom nad themselves surferea
 injury - physical or psychological - or were the relatives of those
 who had died should be supplied to the Solicitors acting for those
 individuals.

 That request was granted and it has saved a very considerable amount
 of trauma for the individuals concerned.

  Over recent months the policy has, however, been reversed and
  such statements are no longer being given to the Solicitors on
  request.   I understand that this is at your direction and that
  the West Midlands Police have been instructed not to provide copies
i of the statements until the investigation is complete and you
. authorise such statements to be provided.

 This change of policy is causing difficulties for those handling
 claims on behalf of the injured and bereaved and considerable
 trauma on the part of the individual Plaintiffs.

                                     /C o n t 'd

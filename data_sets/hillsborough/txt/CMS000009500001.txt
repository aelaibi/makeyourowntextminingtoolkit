Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to the Prime Minister which has been
passed to this department in view of our responsibilities for the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act. I apologise for the delay in replying
to you.

Lord Justice Taylor recognised, in his Final Report, that there is
no single solution to achieve crowd safety and cure all the problems
of crowd control.   However, he was satisfied that seating does more
to achieve these objectives than any other single measure.     He also
considered that moving to all seated accommodation was consistent with
the policies of both FIFA and UEFA.

I understand your feelings and those of many others who wish to stand
at football matches. However, Lord Justice Taylor said on his Final
Report:

"I am    not convinced that the cherished culture of                          the terraces is
wholly    lost when fans are seated. ... The communal                         spirit is still
there    and finds ready expression.    To such extent                         as the seating
limits    togetherness or prevents movement, that price                        is surely worth
paying    for the benefits in safety and control."

This is a view with which the Government is in agreement.


                                                      Yours sincerely

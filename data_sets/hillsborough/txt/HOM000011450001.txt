I am now receiving various letters and I enclose one of
these to you, which are creating the impression that "a
whitewash" was the outcome of the Hillsborough disaster
enquiry.    I know this not to be the case, and that work
is still proceeding on this, but I have to report that the
feeling in Sheffield is running pretty high that South Yorkshire
Police are a good police force and that they are not responsible
for the tragedy that occurred.

I did feel it was my duty to inform you of the situation
and just enclose, as I stated previously, one sample letter.
                                                           19 August    1989

Dear Sir

It was wit h a feel i n g of deep shock and utt er d i sbelief that I
wit nessed the t remendous trage dy of the events at the Hi ll sb orough
football ground on my TV sc reen all those wee ks ago.            My heart
went out to the re la tives and fr iends of s upporters at the ground
who could not at that point know w h e t h e r their loved ones were
directly involved, and more p a r t i c u l a r l y to the poli ce officers
who were havin g to deal wi th the s e e t h i n g mass of victims.

However, having o v e r c o m e my initial sho ck and hav in g then followed
news bulletins later that day and over the weeks that ensued I do
feel mos t stron g l y that the fol l o w i n g ten com me nt s should be made:-

1 ) Contr a r y to the comm en ts from Mr K elly of the FA "we must
stress that no h o o l i g a n i s m is involved", had there been none of the
abhorent footb al l h o o l i g a n i s m at gr ounds in the past, no crowd
b a r r iers/pens wou ld have been necessary.

2)  Had fans wit h no tickets not a t tempted to gain access to the
ground (and let's be honest a fair number e v i d e n t l y had no inten ti on
of paying), the c r o w d i n g s i tuation w o u l d not have occ ur ed either
inside or ou tside the ground.          Added to w hich I thought we Brits
were noted for queuing, u s u a l l y in an orde r l y fashion!

3)  The comme nt mad e by the EUFA of ficial to the effe ct that
"it's Engl an d again and it's Liver po ol again" should NOT have been
rescinded because, in the o p i n i o n of myself, my husba nd and
everyone wit h who m we have d i sscused the matter, he was a b solutely
correct.

4)  Why do L i v e r p u d l i a n s have the f e e l i n g that they are the only
ones in the wor ld who are w h i t e r than whi te and the only ones who
every suf fer tragedy?

5)  Did Mr Ju stice Taylor, whi l s t l i s t e n i n g to e v i dence from
residents of the H i l l s b o r o u g h area about the d r u n k e n n e s s and
public u r i n a t i o n of the Liver po ol 'fans', have his hea ri ng aid
switc he d off?        B e c a u s e his initial repor t seems to have o v erlooked
these facts.

6)   Why does there have to be a c o l l e c t i o n for the grief stri ck en
bereaved and in jured of every m ajor di saster - nobody col le ct ed
for me when I lost my father just aft er my f o u r t e e n t h bi rthday or
when I lost my m o t h e r just be fore my twent yf if th ; and I dar es ay
that the b e r eaved and injur ed vi ctims of the thou sa nd s of road
ac cidents ever y year could do with the odd e xtra bit of financial
help to re build their s h a ttered lives f o l l o w i n g their own maj or
disaster.

7)  Police officers, from new rec ru it to Chief C o n stable are, after
all, only human bei ng s (perhaps this shou ld be po inted out to
football fans the w orld over) and cannot be e x p e c t e d to react like
I

        • au tomatons to every new s i tuation in whi ch they s u d d e n l y find
          themselves.            To err is human and the senio r o f f icers concerned,
          Mr D u c k e n f i e l d in particular, should not be held perso n a l l y
          re sponsibl e for the outc om e of a s i t uation of such rapidly
          e scal a t i n g circumst an ce s.   Mi stakes were qu ite o b v i o u s l y made in
          the police ha ndling of the problem, but it appea rs just as
          obvious that at least 50% of the bl ame shoul d be born by the
          Liverpool supporters.            Had the police ope r a t i o n at the turnstiles
          been so appalling, sur el y a simil ar incid en t of al beit smaller
          propo rtions would have de ve loped at the N o t t i n g h a m end.

         8)   What busin es s is it of L iverpool's p o pulation who we in South
         York shire have as our Chief C onstable?           As far as my deali ng s with
         the local c o n s t a b u l a r y (always on the right side I m i g h t add) are
         concerned, Mr Wright runs a very tight ship - even the traffic
         cop who stopped my husband for s p e e d i n g re cently was mos t corteous!
         As for d e m anding the r esignation of the head of the Police Comm it te e
         who expressed com plete c onfidence in Mr Wright, who the bl oody hell
         do they think they a r e ? !

         9)   No doubt the call for criminal procee d i n g s will be answered,
         but in my opin io n the accused in the dock should inc lu de some
         of the a f o r e m e n t i o n e d Liver po ol fans who se ac tions in pushing,
         sh oving and d i s r e g a r d i n g the police calls for o rder inst i g a t e d the
         fatal crush whi ch resulted.

         10) Lastly, and the final straw w h i c h prom pt ed me to wri te this
         epistle; why on God's earth should the rate pa ye rs of Sh effield
         (who are already s u b s i d i s i n g the mos t i r r e s p o n s i b l e so cialist
         council overs pe nding) be ex pected to foot the bill for the enquiry?

         WE did not invite                the FA to use H i l l s b o r o u g h   for   the ill-f at ed
         semi-final match;

         WE are not all              footb al l   su pp orters;

         WE el ected you to Parli a m e n t and sho ul d be o b l i g e d to know if a n y ­
         thing can and will be done to right the inju s t i c e s to the police
         force and to pre ve nt the bill being passed to the ratepayers.

         It is my i n t ention to c ommunicate w ith Mr Wr i g h t to exp re ss my
         supp or t for his of ficers and also to Mrs T h a t c h e r and I shall
         enclos e a copy of this letter.

          Incidentally, I am not an eld er ly fudd y- du dd y, but a 28 year old
          h ous ew ife and m o t h e r who feels most e m p h a t i c a l l y that hearts have
          ruled min ds in a wav e of natio na l hysteria.

          Yours         faith f u l l y

      Thank you for your letter of 20 April enclosing one from
Mrs                             Abergavenny, Gwent, who makes
suggestions as to how another tragedy such as that which took
place at Hillsborough might best be avoided in the future.


      As you know an enquiry under the Chairmanship of Lord Justice
Taylor has been formed to investigate the events of Hillsborough
and to make recommendations. I have therefore forwarded yours and
your constituent's correspondence to Mr R Whalley, Secretary to
the Enquiry who can be contacted at this address.

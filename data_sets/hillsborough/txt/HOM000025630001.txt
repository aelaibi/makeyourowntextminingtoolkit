SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

I am writing about the safety of sports grounds with particular
emphasis on the implementation of the recommendations of the
Final Report of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry into the
Hillsborough Disaster.

As you will be aware the Home Office traditionally takes the
lead in this matter for both Departments following consultation
with the Welsh Office .

The contents of the Final Report and the operation of the
Football Spectators Act 1989 will clearly affect football clubs
in Wales. I understand that there has already been some contact
between our respective Divisions about the recommendation on all
seated accommodation at football grounds.   I wonder whether the
time has now come, in order to ensure that we maintain common
ground to suggest that we arrange a meeting to discuss the
application of the report in Wales.

I would suggest four particular areas for discussion :

     i.     Recommendations of the Final Report.

     ii.    Football Licensing Authority.

     iii. Designation of football matches under Part I of the
          1989 Act.
     iv.   Review of the Green Guide.

     v.    The Welsh National Rugby stadium.

If you agree that such a meeting would be useful, I have an open
mind about where it should take place, and would be quite happy
to come to Cardiff.

                                    Yours sincerely

WALSALL FOOTBALL CLUB

You will recall that some time ago you drew to my attention an article in
the 'Today' newspaper in which a Liverpool player in interview with the
reporter, Mr Bob Harris, said that a barrier broke at Hillsborough, as it
had at Walsall.

We have made enquiries into this alleged incident and have discovered the
following information.   Mr Roy Wally, Club Secretary, informs us that at
8.30 pm on 14 February 1984, when Liverpool played Walsall at Walsall in
the second leg of the League Cup semi-final Liverpool scored a goal, this
led to a crowd surge amongst Liverpool fans at the Railway End of the
ground.   The effect of this surge was to cause a concrete wall to fall
over.   There were no crush barriers or fences in place at the time.  There
were no fatalities, although there were a number of minor injuries.

I trust this information is of assistance to you.              I have copied this for
the information of Mr Whalley.

       Dear Mr and Mrs Church

              Thank you for your letter of 22 March concerning the Hillborough Disaster
      Fund. It would seem from your letter that you have corresponded with other offices
      within the Court Service or Lord Chancellorâ€™s Department as the letters on our file do
      not follow. I cannot see from this current letter how I can be of any help to you. This
      office can only respond to complaints about the administration of the courts or for
      requests for advice on procedural. If I can be of further assistance, please do not
      hesitate to contact me.



                                          Yours sincerely




                                           Ms L Beazley
                                       Customer Service Unit

                              CHARGE 1



The basis of this charge is the fact that Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield   assumed   the role of overall operational

commander at the said football match and having accepted

that duty he failed     to prepare himself for the command

responsibilities   that he knew he had accepted.

As a commander he was obliged to:

1.   Aquiant himself with    all the immediately available

     material   in relation to his command responsibilities.

2.   Aquaint himself with    the history of the event and

     any previous problem areas.

3.   Aquaint himself with    the geography and the layout of

     the location and the ground itself including the

     methods of entry and exit.

4.   Approve the planning of the evnt after     having satisfied

     himself that contingencies existed for     any forseeable

     problems which would endanger the safety of those

     attending.

5.   Aquaint himself with those resourses available to

     him and provided by the Sheffield Wednesday Football

     Club.

6.   Aquainted himself with the division of    responsibilities

     between the police and the Football Club in order

     that the various resourses could be co-ordinated to

     ensure the safety of those attending the event.



Chief Superintendent Duckenfield accepted that he was the

operational commander on the day in question,    in his evidence

to the Inquest Day 1, Page 47    'C':

     'No the operational Commander was myself and Mr

     Jackson was the ACC on duty weekend.'
 The Chief Superintendent was made aware that he would

 take over command of the Division responsible for Policing

 the said football match in a South Yorkshire Police

 General Order 11/1989 Part 2 dated 6 March 1989 which

 stated that his command responsibilities would be effective

 from 27 March 1989.

 The draw for the Semi-Final            tie took place live on television

 on the morning of Monday 20 March 1989 and after negotiations

 on that day between            the police and the club,   the police

 accepted      responsibility for the policing of the event.

 In his evidence         to LJT Day 1 Page 115    'H' the knowledge of

 that date was admitted by the Chief Superintendent in answer

 to the following question:

        Q      'You learned then and you realised immediately

                this was going to land on your plate very

                shortly after you had taken over ?'

        A      'Yes S i r . '

We know therefore          that Mr Duckenfield had from Monday 20

March       1989 until Saturday 15 April      1989,   some 27 days in

which       to prepare himself for the command responsibilities

he was      to accept on the day.

It is however acknowledges            that during that time he would

be required to cast off the responsibilities of his old

command      and take on the reins of all the other responsibilities

a ssociated with his new command.

We know      that on 22 March 1989 he attended a preliminary

planning meeting instigated by the then resident Chief

S uperintendent Mr. Mole.             Of that meeting Mr. Duckenfield

told   the LJT Day 1 Page 116          'B'

              'I attended the meeting on that particular day

               prior to my promotion and Mr Mole had called a

               m e e ti ng with all interested parties     ...... '
 We also know that on 29 March 1989 Mr Duckenfield held a

 meeting with his planning team ie Superintendent Murray,

 Chief Inspector Beal and Inspector Sewell.        (LJT Day 1

 Page 116   'C/D')

 On Saturday 1 April    1989 he attended the stadium where

 a league match was taking place between the Sheffield

 Wednesday and Millwall football clubs.         At that match he:

            '      walked the area and familiarised myself

            with the situation.'        (LJT Day 1 Page 117       'G')

 On the evening of 5 April     1989,   he attended a further

 league match when Sheffield Wednesday played Wimbledon.

 (LJT Day 1 Page 38    'B').

On 10 April     1989 he instigated a further planning meeting

with his Sector Superintendents,       representatives from the

other Police Divisions and the British Transport Police,

all of whom had direct concerns with the operation.



In addition to the information he aquired from these meetings

and visits,     he also knew of and had available to him the

following documents,     a knowledge of which the presentation

believes was essential     to the planning of a police operation

on this scale.

1.   The Guide to the safety at Sports        Grounds.   (Known

     generally as the     ’Green Guide'.)

2.   The Association of Police Officres Sub-Committee on

     Hooliganism at Sporting Events,        Guide to Policing

     Football.

3.   The South Yorkshire Police Standing Instructions for

     the Policing of Football Matches.

 •   The Divisional Intelligence Report.

5.   The De-Briefing notes for the 1988       Semi- Final

>.   The Operational Order for the 1988       Semi-Final.
 It is accepted that other documentation existed which would

 have been available to him should he have chosen to research

 it.      In relation to this charge however,   the presentation

 are prepared to accept    that these were the documents on

 which he could rely as his sourse of information in the

 limited time he had in which to prepare himself for this

 event.

 Throughout, Mr. Duckenfield has admitted to his knowledge of

 their existence and to having seen and read them albiet in

 relation to the ACPO document and the South Yorkshire

 Police Standing Instructions,     in his evidence to LJT Day 2

 Page 2 'F' he admits    to not having read those two documents

 subsequent to his promotion.



As regards the history of the event much has been made of the

 injuries caused in198l   and the closing of the tunnel in1988.

In fairness to the Chief Superintendent the presentation

accepts    that whatever problems occurred in198l   were dealt

with by those concerned at the time and a knowledge of those

problems would not have greatly assisted him.

In relation to the closing off of the tunnel in 1988 the

presentation accepts    that   the knowledge of this incident was

not and could not have been readily available to him.



It is the responsibility of any commander to make himself

aware of the geography of his command,     its physicsal

peculiarities and in the case of the football stadium on this

occassion,   that as far as he is able,   content himself   that it

is safe to be used by the public for that particular event.

His visit to the ground on     1 April 1989 gave him the opportunity

to make himself aware of the geography and to obtain knowledge

of the layout and conditions of the stadium.        The presentation
 are of course primarily concerned with his knowledge of the

 geography of the Leppings      Lane area and the turnstiles,

 concourse and terraced areas at that side of the ground.

 He was aware that the game itself was going to be a capacity

 crowd,      (LJT Day 1 Page 118   'C') and that in order to

 obtain total segregation,     Liverpool supporters would all

 use the Leppings Lane Turnstiles.          It should have occurred

 to him that there would need to be some form of control

 within   Leppings Lane to accomodate the passage of those

 supporters.

 The fact that it should have occurred to him is corroborated

 by the undisputed fact    that the problem did actually occur

 in that some time between 2.17 pm and 2.30 pm on that day he

was asked by Superintendent Marshall to close Leppings Lane

to Vehicular traffic.      (Inquest Day 1 Page 48     'B').

                      (SEE NOTE 1 ATTACHED      )

Clearly he had a duty to manage the arrival of fans in the

Leppings Lane area and his responsibility was to plan for

it within the operational order.           This he did not do, which

rersulted in the hurried and not too efficient closing of

Leppings Lane to vehicular      traffic.

In his evdience to LJT D a y 1 Page 117       'G' Mr Duckenfield

admits    that on his visit   to the ground on 1 April    1989 he

went   to look at the turnstiles and how they worked.

On Page 118 ’D' he acknowledges      that he observed the layout

of the pens and barriers      at the Leppings Lane end.       He

does however go on on the same page at        *F* to admit that he

did not see a problem with      the crowd being able to spread

laterally across the terrace.        He should have seen that as

a problem.

He admits to seeing the central      tunnel and saw that turnstiles

A-G lead via the concourse     to that tunnel.
 On Page 119 ’B' he admits that the signing giving directions

 to the terrace were less than adequate       (Note - his answers

 appear to be given in the present tense and given with the

 benefit of hindsight.)

 This is    corroborated somewhat in his answers given to the

 Inquest Day 1 Page 44     ’B'   :

       Q       'Would it be fair to say that you did not on the

            day have detailed knowledge of the signing,

            directing people which way to go at the Leppings

            Lane end ?'

       A   'No Sir,   I had only had that one visit.'

The fact that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield visited the

ground on 1 April     1989 and on 5 April   1989 are not disputed

by the presentation.        What he failed to do and what it was

his duty to do was     to take that opportunity    to:

a.     Aquiant himself with which turnstiles gave access to which

       particular parts of the ground

b.    Aquaint himself with the layout       and the signing on the

       concourse area which would have directed fans to the

       terracing other by means of the      central tunnel,   and

c.    Aquaint himself with the general       layout of the Leppings

       Lane area.

Had he done so he would have realised that fans coming onto

the concourse through      turnstiles A-G would without doubt make

for the tunnel and present       those responsible for filling and

monitoring the pens with a possible overcrowding problem which

would have required within       the planning some form of formalised

stewarding and m on itoring of the terrace by either the police

or stewards.
                       *

Mr.   Duckenfield clearly failed to recogognise or consider this

problem in relation    to the geography of the ground.
 We have already been through the planning operations and our

 concern begins at the meeting held on 29 March 1989 with

 his planning team.

 In his evidence to LJT Day 1 Page 116       'D-E' Mr Duckenfield

 describes how he went through the order page by page and at

 that m eeting effectively gave the plan the go-ahead.

At   *E* he admits that he had not visited        the ground prior

 to giving   the plan that 'Go—ahead'.     He could not therefore

have incorporated into that plan at that stage any potential

problems he may have forseen on his subsequent visits and

was clearly relying at that stage totally on the advice

given to him by others and the fact that the plan had worked

previously.     This was a serious error of judgement.

We know that he had looked at the Crime intelligence information

but we do not know at what stage.        We also know from

his evidence to LJT Day 2 Page A 'C' that apart from

intelligence regarding travelling criminals         it told him in

his own words   '       very little else.'

It is beyond doubt that had the information been sought as it

was after the event by Detective Inspector King and his

team,   it was available from other forces.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield should have been aware of

this and caused further enquiries    to be made.

                      (SEE NOTE 2 ATTACHED    )

He did not do so and again this can only be described in

terms of planning as a serious error of judgement.

Had he sought that information he would have known of the

propensity of the Liverpool fans during that season to arrive

at away games both late and ticketless.

We know that Mr. Duckenfield had considered         the problems of

late arrivals and fans arriving without tickets.           It is

accepted fully by the presentation that appeals had been
 made via the media and by contacting the visiting clubs in

 particular Liverpool who inserted an item in their club

 programme of 8 April      1989 encouraging fans to arrive between

 10.30 am and 2 p m .

 In his @policy decision regarding the delay of the kick off,

 he considers    the possiblity of late arrivals due to traffic

 hold ups,    roadworks,   weather etc..   What he had not considered

 and was it was his responsibility to consider was put to him

 at the LJT Day 2 Page 1 'E':

      Q      'What about if, for no ascertainable reason,     there

             were a large number of late arrivals ?        Had that

             been taken into account at all ?'

      A      'No sir not at that stage.'

 The possibility of fans arriving without       tickets also featured

 in the Chief Superintendents planning.         At the end of his

briefing notes he includes the line:

      'Nobody gets in without a ticket.'

However    in his evidence to LJT Day 1 Page 135     'E' he admits

to not seeing it as a problem because:

      'the intelligence report that I received gave no

      indication whatsoever s i r . '

We know of course that the intelligence        report was far from

adequate   and that contingencies were not provided in either

the operational order or the briefings        to take care of either

of these   two forseeable problems.        They should have been.



A knowledge of the number of turnstiles available        to accomodate

fans was of great importance in the planning of this operation.

The Chief Superintendent knew he had a ’full house*        and also

knew that all the Liverpool supporters were        to be accomodated

via the Leppings Lane turnstiles.
 So far as the planning is concerned it must be accepted that

 he had assumed a duty and a responsibility for the safety

 of the supporters attending the event.             On Page 2 of the

 Op erational Order for the day it states:

           ’.......   fco ensure public order and safe ty both inside

           and outside the football g r o u n d ...... '

 as the intention of the day.

 He has accepted that his pre-match           briefing to officers       of

 Inspector rank and above includes:           (Inquest Day1 Page 41      )

At   'E'

          'We must ensure the safety of the public inside and

           outside the ground'

At   'F'

          'I cannot stress too highly the word safety.'

At   'G'

       'Our job is to ensure the safety of spectators.'

On Page 43       'E' it is suggested to him that he used the following

phrase to Inspectors and above but            may have left    it out on

the general briefing on the 15th          :

       'Safety of supporters in this ground is p a r a m o u n t . '

At   'F' on that page he does however maintain             that to the

best of his knowledge he did in fact use            that phrase at

both briefings.

Again at the Inquest Day 1 Page 71            'D' he is asked:

      Q       'You have told us that you were particularly

               concerned for the safety of the public at the

               H il ls borough Semi-Final.     That is what you have

               told us ?'

      A      *Yes S i r . '

The presentation maintain that that paramount concern should

have but was not incorporated into the planning of this event.
 In his evidence         to LJT Day 1 Page 118 he is asked:

        Q   'You knew the A-G turnstiles which gave onto the

                part of the concourse leadinfi to that central
                                             0
                tunnel were the turnstiles that were to be used

               for the terraces ?'

        A     'Yes'

        Q    'I assume you knew that ?'

        A    'Yes. We are talking about the Semi Final tie ?'

        Q    'Yes i n d e e d . '

        A     'Yes.'



Mr Duckenfield was aware of the safety certificate             issued to

the club because at the Inquest Day 1 page 68             'B' he says:

        'I recall asking about it sir.'

It must therefore be assumed that he knew he had a capacity

on the terrace of 10,100 and that those            10,100 fans had to

enter the ground through turnstiles A-G.

In his evidence          to LJT Day 2 Page 76   'D' Mr Duckenfield

proffesses a knowledge of the Green Guide and he must             therefore

have known that the minimum accepted flow rate for turnstiles

was 750 supporters per hour which would have given him one

hour and 56 minutes          at full flow to accomodate   the 10,100

ticket h o l d e r s .

                             (DANGER SEE NOTE 3}

This at the very least should have caused him to ask questions

about   turnstile allocation and flow rates and should have told

him that there was likely to be congestion           at these particular

turnstiles.

He ought also to have realised that fans enetering through

turnstiles A-G and wishing to take up a position on the North

or elevated terracing would have to pass through the gate in

the concourse wall.            If they did not know that,   then there
 was a possibility that they would make for the central

 tunnel which again would have registered the possibility

 of overcrowding and the need for monitoring and stewarding

 by wether the Police or the club.

 At the Inquest Day 1 page 74         'C' Mr Duckenfield was asked

 if he had aquainted himself with the arrangements          for the

 ticketing and the turnstiles        to be used by spectators.        Whilst

 he gives no specific answer,        he implies that he was not aware

 pointing out that such arrangements had been made before he

 took over command.

 That may be so and indeed we accept that it was so.             He should

 however have aquainted himself with those facts and he did not.

A knowledge of all      these potential problems was available         to

him simply by visiting the ground and making reference           to

documentation which was readily available to him.

In order to take effective command of such an event a commander

must have a knowledge of the resourses readily available              to him

 which in the case of a football match includes          those technical

and manpower resourses      provided by the club.

Section 17.1 of the South Yorkshire Police Stan din g Instructions

state:

     'There are considerable benefits to be gained from a close

      personal liason with the directors and m a n ag em en t of

      football clubs.        The establishing of such a wo rking

      relationship by divisional commanders is essential to

      the success of Police o p e r a t i o n s . '

At the Inquest Day 1 Page 38 *F'          Mr Duckenfield mentions      that

arrangements had been made with Mr Mole for him to visit the

club and be introduced      to the Secretary Mackrell     and the Chief

Security Officer Lock.        That meeting did not take place but

of course the Chief Superintendent had the opportunity           to

introduce himself on his two visits          to the ground and clearly

it was his duty to have done so.
 The facilities available      to a commander and his knowledge of

 them are of prime importance to the planning and operation

 of an event of the nature of the Semi Final and indeed other

 football matches.

 In his evidence      to the Inquest Day 1 page 50   ’B' Mr Duckenfield

 frankly admits:

      'No Sir, I think it fair to say that the knowledge of

       the capability of the equipment that Sheffield Wednesday

       had was not something that I had aquired by that s t a g e . '

 That reply was given inanswer to a question regarding the

 facilities available      to him from the Sheffield Wednesday

Club Control Room.

His lack of knowledge in relation       to the control room is

corroborated by his admission      to LJT Day 3 Page 37   'A' in

relation to the clubs monitors:

      'I don't know the fine technical details sir.'



His lack of knowledge regarding the duties and responsibilities

of the club stewards is however the most serious of his

omissions.

The Green Guide Section 13 paragraph 197:

      Where a ground such as one used by an association

      football league club has a high police presence,        duties

      and responsibilities of stewards should be agreed with

      the p o l i c e .'

Whilst the presentation accept that the responsibility for

obtaining this agreement is placed upon the club,        the Chief

Superintendent has professes a knowledge of the guide and

should have known of this requirement.        The fact that no such

agreement existed would then have been within his knowledge

and begged him to ask what were      the duties of the stewards.
  Having read the South Yorkshire             Police Standing Instructions

 on Policing at Football Matches              he would know that they were

 ammended by the Assistant Chief Constable on 20 March 1986

 and that included at A pp endix            'L' Page 40 paragraph 3

         'Stewards should be distributed throughout the ground

         in accordance w ith a detailed pre arranged schedule

         agreed between the Police and m a n a g e m e n t . '

 This instruction is repeated             in the form of advice at

 paragraph 3.4 of the ACPO document.

 In his evidence to the Inquest Day 1 page 69                  'C' in relation

 to this latter schedule Mr Duckenfield admits:

      'There may have been one but I do not recall having

         seen i t . '

 In his evidence        to LJT Day 1 pages 76/77         'G-A' Mr Duckenfield

 is asked about the duties of the stewards                and his knowledge

of their responsibilities              in relation to the supervision and

control of the crowd within              the Leppings   Lane pens as follows

     A      'That a rrangement was made between Mr Mole

             and Mr M u r r a y . ’1

     Q      'And you did not take it upon yourself to find

             out what it was ?'

     A      'No S i r . '

Had he made such enquiries             he would have been aware      that at

this capacity event there would have been no control over the

crowds enetering the Leppings             Lane terrace and that no

monitoring system existed with the club.                  That was a very

real and forseeable problem which required action                  to be taken

at the planning stage of more substance than an unbriefed

reliance on Police officers             reylaying any problems      to him.



To summarise - The presentation maintain                that
As a member of a Police Force Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

had a duty for the pretection of life.

Knowing that he was to accept the role of overall operational

commander on 15 April    1989 he had a responsibility to give

that duty a high priority in his planning and personal

preparation for the police role on that day.

It is accepted   that time given    to him was limited and that

he was obliged   to rely heavily on the advice of those

around him whose experience was far greater than his own.

However a commander in these circumstance was still under an

obligation   to question closely those giving him advice,           to

refersh himself and his knowledge by reference to material

which was readily available to him,      To familiariase himself

with the ground and those officials who would support his

command role on that day in order that he could fulfill his

duty to ensure   the obligation that he had placed upon himself

as well as his duty and which he incorporated into his briefing

notes for that event i.e.

     'SAFETY OF SUPPORTERS IN THIS GROUND IS P A R A M O U N T .*
Should he have s e e n      the g e o g r ap h y of the Leppings Lane area

and in p a r t i c u l a r that area i m m ed i a t e l y o u t s i d e the turnstiles

as a problem and c a t e r e d for it accordingly.



In his interim repo rt para 2 1 A LJT refers to a large volume of

evidence    to the e f f e c t    that in 1988 there had been a systematic

f iltering of fans and           checking of tickets       in Leppings Land

and on the ap pr o ac he s       to the area.

The Police ev id e n c e    is that no such specific policy had been

persued,    and there      is no evidence       to suggest    that it was.

There is however e v i d e n c e       from fans   in particular STEVEN ALLEN

who recalls     being f i lt e r e d     through barriers    at the Leppings

Lane Penistone RoacS Roundabout.                That evidence is in total
                                                                                      /   i       _

contradiction      to tfae evidence        of Inspector Paul Kerry GRACE              I       ^       ^

who was    in charge c f     that area in 1988 and specifically states

that no such b a rriers were errected.

The situation in hindsight,              wh ic h was not recognised by the LJT

enquiry appears       to toe that when fans        talk about barriers         in

Leppings    Lane and filtering,           they are referring to the permanently

fixed railings      around       the roundabout    itself which creates a

natural    filtering s y s t e m    for any crowd entering Leppings            Lane

from that direction.

With regard     to the p r o b l e m s   i m mediately outside    the turnstiles



As far as the area innmediately outside               the turnstiles       is concerned

Whilst there is no e v i d e n c e       to suggest   that it was seen or considerd

as a problem     it was c a t e r e d    for as follows:

Senior Command - S upt Marshall

Whilst it would a p p e a r      that his area of command ended at the line

of the perimeter gates,            he co nsidred himself responsible           for t h e ^ ^ T t

area up to the turnstiles.

This accords with SYP         S ta nd i ng Instructions     Para 2.2.     in that that

o fficer should not be        below the rank of Chief Inspector and his
 responsibilities include       the ma in t y a i n a n c e of public order.



 Chief Inspector Creaser

 This officer was in command of the turnstile area both inside

 and out and had exactly      the same re sp o nsibiliteis      as 1988.

 He was allocated four serials of m e n ' - l o s e     duties according

 to the operational order on both occassions was              the formation

 of orderely queues at the turnstiles.

 In accordance with SYP S.I.s para 7.6          , there were     6 mou nted

officers available     to him whose duties       included    the formation
Of orderley queues.



Previous problems

The only evidence     to suggest any previous       problem    i.e.   in 1 9 8 8

came from D/Supt Macltay who describes a compacted queue at the

turnstiles between 2.50 p.m.       and 3 pm in     1988.      He has however

never been asked w h e t h e r or not he menti on e d   that incident        to

his collegues in any debriefing session.

It certainly does not apear in the d e b r ie fi ng documents          for
the 1988 Semi Final.
      C l e a r l y a vital part in r e la ti on       to this charge is the

      intelligence available            to Duckenfield.

    The evidencein relation             to Sgt Ch arlesworth the Divisional

    In telligence officer will            be dealt with here in full and will

   be referred to later in this summary.                                /

   Sgt Charleworth provided 3 recollections                     to the h'ain Enquiry

   in w hi c h he was outspokenly critical of the intelligence

   p ro vi de d by the Mersydie          Police   Liason officers.          Those

   recollections were condensed              into one recollection which

  was supplied          to the West M id l an ds enquiry team and which

   'watered d o w n ’ his critism considerably.                   The basis of

  his evidence is that he could               not obtain any intelligence            re
  crowd     behaviour from Mersyside.

  The question which has never been posed is                      -Did he tell

  D u c k e n f i e l d of his difficulties       ?’     Duckenfield clearly

  relied     on the information supplied by C h a r l e s w o r t h .            m

 his evidence        to the Inquest        P . 39 he states:

           •We d i d n ’t receive any intelligence that related

           to public order matters           as s u c h . ’



    b ^ e “ Jent to the disaster a n / e n q u i r y was conducted by

 Insp    King of the South Yorkshire              Police      in relation   to

 the po ssibility that a c o n s p i r a c y may have existed between

the Liverpool supporters            to arrive at the ground en mass

at a prearranged          time in or de r     to cause the confusion required

for     the Police to open the gates and allow them in without

tickets.         This    theory was dismissed by the Lord Justice

T a y l o r enquiry but it does under li ne the fact that

i n t e l l i g e n c e was available    if so ught regarding        the activities

of Liverpool fans and          their propensity           to cause   trouble,

a r rive late and ticketless at away games.

  AS A PROBLEM.




  The only direct q ue s ti on posed in relation to this matt,

  0.        Did you regard              the turnstiles at Leppings           Lane and   the pens

            as being included within problem areas                        that you reffered to

  A.        Not a z aj or p roblem area,                because from previous experience

            other than the discussions I had with Mr Greenwood about the

           area,      that it was not a moj'or problem area because                     recent

           e vidence did not indicate it was a problem.



 On the        15 April          1 989 it is known that:;

         Tur n st il es      1- 10      (Ten) were used         to give access to the

         p ermitted         capacity of 9882 fans to be accommodated within
 the North Stand.




       T u r n s ti l es    11   . 16   (Six)    were used      to give access     to the

       permitted           capacity of (465 fans to be accomodated within

If m atters were as simpl e as that clearly with the knowledge of

flow rates as laid out in the                         'Green G u i d e ’ which he admits he

had read        (See page 7 this draft)                  it should be immediately obvious

that it would              take some     1 hour and 56 minutes at full flow                to

accomodate         the supporters          through A-G.         and that would undoubtably
cause problems.

  In hsi e vi d en ce      to LJT he admits                that he Knew that turnstiles

  A- G were         to be used       to feed the Leepings Lane terracing LJT
  DAY 1 Page 118

  It will no doubt be argued                      that those figure refer to paying

          and    th<=4. at an all       ticket match             the flow rate could be

  in the region of 1000 per hour.                          Even So for 10100 fans            to

  enter through gates A-G would still                           take a p p r o x ’ one and one

 half hours E t full flow,               and the problem as such is till evident

 That problem v „          n o t forseen fc.. Duckenfield as stated in his

 evidence       to LJT did not see the Turnstiles as a problem.



 However m a t te rs were not as simple as that.



 In his e vi d en ce     to the LJT P . 87 The Secretary of the SWFC

 describes how he prior to the 1987 Semi Final had agreed with

 the resident Chief Suptr Mr Mole                      that in order A c h i e v e          segregation.

 entrance       to the West and North areas of the ground would be

a ccomodated by the 23              tuirnstiles at Leppings                Lane.     He goes
on to say       :

     Q.      And so far as the standing was concerned you had to get

             10,100     through A-G,              seven turnstiles        ?

     A.      Yes,     but we knew we had the flexibility of, if necessary,

            bei n g able to use              11    - 16 for standing as well because                 the

            tickets for the West stand,                         obviously checked,      a s e c o n da da r y

            Pdnt,      if the need was               there we could utilise           those       turnstiles

            to take up any slack if we found A-G being                             ____ .

If indeed       this was an agre em en t between Mackrell                     and Chief S u p e r i n te n de nt
                                                      \%                                                                 %

       Mole,    it would be n e ce ss ar y        to prove that Duckenfield was not

       aware of it and would of n ecessity have then seen turnstiles

     2-    Did PC Guest in the SWFC control                 room know a n d 'he'tooSias

           never been asked.                The ioplication being that if

           a.      Turnstiles          1-10 as opposed to 1 - g were be i ng used for

     the North Stand,          the totals on his computer would be inacurate.

           b.      The same would          apply   to the West stand w hi ch is fed

     no r ma ll y by turnstiles 9 - 16 and catered for on the computer as such.

           C.      Equally if terrace ticket holders were be in g allowed

     through     1< -   16 the nu mbe rs given for the terrace would                  fall well

    short of the actual figure,                 wh ic h certainly appears   to be the case

    on the day in question as               the figure for the West stand shows at
    3 o ’clock 1 1 5 4    over capacity.



     furhter question to be a n s w e r e d is whether in fact Hr Mole or

    indeed Mr D uckenfield             knew of the extra g a t * b e i n g used       for the

    North Stand.          From Mr Mo le s evidence to the LJT it wo u ld appear

    that he did.         There is no ev id en c e to show wether Mr Duckenfield

    did or did not know.                It is ho wev er relevant that both operation

    orders for , 8 8     and ,989 place a serial of men on t u r n st il es                     1-9

    and a further serial              on 10-16.

  situation even further,           in his evidence to LJT page 2:

 0           there was some evidence          that

             the Vvest Stand      then by    ...      ___________________________________

 a           That IS true.         That was early on.           That was very early on

             that.     Then   they changed it to the can t il ev er stand.               They
             altered   the barrier.

 He goes on to say that            the change

The timing here is to some extent impTrta7t aT T h e ' r e ^ f s                      hour

difference between          the evidence of PC Larkin and

The only c o r r ob or a ti on avai l ab le was the club camera overlo ok in g

these turnstiles wh ic h u n f o rt u na te ly is the one that is missing.



The allegation being m ad e is that Duckenfield n eg l e c t e d              his duty

in that he failed         to i de nt i fy   the Leppings Lane t ur n stiles      as

a potential problem f o r wh ic h he should have made plans
 If he had not known about the ar rangements between Mr Mole and

Mackrell   and If he was unaware of the turnstile allocations,              the,

he should have re cognised      the potential problem of turnstile
flows through A-G.

If he knew of the a rr an ge m en t   then he could quite    rightly say

that it was not a problem because he would have         the seven T/Ss

*-G plus   the 6 11-16   through which to accomodate        14,565   fans

which at 1,000 per hour would have required        them all     to be full*

op eratioanl   shortly before 2 p.m.

It would also indicate     that he would    know that any figure given

to him by the SWFC would be g ros sly innacurate.

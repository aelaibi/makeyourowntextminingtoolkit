o        Dear Sirs,               .

         Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


         If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
         of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
         on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
         due course.

         I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
         evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
         coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
         inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

        Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
        under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
        witnesses who wish to give evidence. I am at present engaged in considering

c       this and. in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

        Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
        to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
        appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
        consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

        May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
        attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

         I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
         names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
         to who to call to give evidence is and. remains a matter for me.

         I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
         heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
         submit.

         You/S/jf/lthfully,

Dear         Sirs,

Ses        s n E S ^ ' ^ ' ’3^BBXS037

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990 •

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. / In these circumstances, I have decided not*to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take; I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner.

    4th July 1989

    Dear Mr Popper

    I write following my very helpful conversation this afternoon with Mr Thompson
    from your office to confirm a number of points.

    Firstly, I understand that you are favourably inclined towards the requests
    that you have recieved from a number of Solicitors to release copies of
    the Post-Mortem Reports on the victims of the Hillsborough Disaster in advance
    of resumed Inquest Hearings and in this regard might I ask you to let me
    have copies of the Reports on the deceased named in the, attached list the
    families of whom I respresent.

    There is a strong feeling from many of the families that early receipt of copies
    of the P.M. Reports would be beneficial both in terms of answering some
    hiterto unanswered questions and also in perhaps reducing the anguish which
    might be suffered when full details of the cause of death become known at a
    public hearing perhaps some weeks or months hence.

    If payment is required for copies of any of the Reports then needless to say
    I will be happy to deal with this.

    I understand that the relative positions of approximately 50 of those who
    suffered fatal injuries has been established at or immediately prior to the
    estimated time of death, this information is being generally discussed and
    although I am not asking you at this stage to release the names of the 50
    involved I would be very greatful if you would confirm that this information
    is correct, perhaps the number has increased from 50? Would it be your intention
    to release this information prior to reopening of the inquests?

    Finally, I confirm that I will speak to my fellow committee members tomorrow
    (Wednesday) about the issue of 'block representation' of the bereaved families at the

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

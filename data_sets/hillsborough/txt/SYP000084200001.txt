the    stewards             room       and       I started             to       issue          all    of    the       stewards             with          the

yellow          coloured             stewards          waist          coats.              The       issuing          of    the       stewards

relieve             him.        On    this       Saturday             it    took          me    about       half          an    hour       to       issue

the    waistcoats                and       every       steward             was       issued          with       one       of    them.           At

about          14.15       hours       I finished                issuing             them       and       went       to    my       entrance

long     it w e n t       on       for     like       this.        The       gam^was              stopped           and       I think             it

must     have       been       about        fifteen          to J^^r^ty^minutes                        before        an       ambulance

came     into       the       ground.                        a    number          of       people       lying        down          on    the

pitch.         Just       aft^p^^he              supporters             climbed             on    to    the       pitch        one       of       them

a    youth     in L i v e r p o o l         colours          ran       the    length             of    the       pitch        in    front          of

the    South        Stand          down     to    Cop       end    and       started             dancing          and        jigging          about

in     front       of    them.           Then     three          police       officers                chased        him       two       of    them

caught        hold       of    him       and     took       him    away.           I stayed             where        I was          for       about

twenty        minutes          before           I went       down       to    the          stewards          room        to    find          out       if

the    match        was       going        to    be    abandoned             or    delayed.                 I remained              there          to

receive        the       stewards           waist       coats          back.           During          my    forty           minutes          in       the

stand        there       was       lots     of    people          lying       on       the       pitch       people           were       giving

them     first          aid    and       others        were       being       carried             off       on    advertising

boards.            The    Police           and    St    Johns          Ambulance                men    had       managed           to    gain

access        to    that       part        of    the    terrace             but    there          was       still        a    number          of

people        in    there.           The        last    thing          I saw       before             I went        to       the    stewards

room     was       the    fire        brigade          walk       through          that          area       of    terrace           on       to       tne

pitch.         I    c a n ’t       r e m rtember       anything             more.           I d i d n ’t a t         any       time          see       any

of     the    people          in    the     west       terrace          with       alcoholic                drink.            From       where          1

was     standing          I c o u l d n ’t s e e            if    anyone          had       climbed          into        the       ground.              No

person        entered          any       area     of    the       stand       without             a    ticket.               1 could          not

get     onto       the    pitch          from     my    stand          to    help          or    see    the       condition              of       the

injured        people.              I could           not    see       how    they          had       got    injured.               The       only

incident           that       I saw        that       I believed             was       a    criminal             offence           was       that       of

the     youth       running           up    to    the       Nottingham             Forest             end    of     the       ground.             I

             left    the    ground    at    about   ten     past   five   that    same   night   as    usual    of   my

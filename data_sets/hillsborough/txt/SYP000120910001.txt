                       At 0815 am on Saturday,          15 April   1989,   I paraded for duty at

                       Ground later       that d a t e . I travelled to Hillsborough         and was       present

                       at the North Stand where a briefing took place and which                  commenced

                       about    1000 am 150489.       I was attached to Serial No. 6 with the

                       following officers,         PC 28 D r e w i t t , PC 2818 Marshall,   PC 861

                       Inspector Harvey was officer in charge,             Chief    Inspector Beal was next

                       in command and the Officer           responsible for my serial was

                       Superintendent Greenwood.

                       After the briefing a packed meal was taken and I was issued with a

                       radio and ear piece.                                        _______________

                       The duties of Serial 6 was to man barriers to be e^e'cled at the rear

                       of South Stand adjacent to the car park, and barriers from turnstiles

                       A —G at Leppings Lane end.           The area between the two barriers was to

                       remain sterile.          Liverpool   supporters were not to be permitted

                       entry.     The only persons allowed entry were to be authorised persons
                                                                           PAGE       2
                                                                           R452

arid persons with tickets for South Stand i.e. Nottingham Forest

Supporters.

At 1100 am my serial     took up their    positions.    Manning the barriers

at rear of South Stand were 2818 M a r s h a l l , 1159 L o n g , 169 F illingham,

DC 515 C a w k w e l 1 and DC 1828 Metcalfe.   The following officers were

manning the top barrier near turnstiles A ~ G , PC 28 Drewitt,         PC 861

Wadsworth,    PC 3217 Wadsworth,    3162 Pears and     142 Long.

There were no problems experienced at either barrier until 2.30 pm

(1430), when the crowd at the Lappings Lane end began to build up.                I

had checked my personal      radio and found it to be in good working order

I began to hear    radio messages to the effect that the crowd at

Leppings Lane end were becoming agitated.           Additional men were

requested and Police Horses arrived.           The barriers were opened twice

to permit the horses access.        The   crowd was making more and more

noise and it was difficult to hear         radio traffic.    I saw a beer can

thrown from the rear of the crowd towards the turnstiles.             The can

was opened and fluid was falling from it.           Youths began climbing over

the wall at turnstiles A - G .

At this time the    crowd pushed towards the concertina door adjacent to

our barrier.     Suddenly the concertina door opened,        I believed i^t had

been forced open.      About 200 fans entered unchecked before Police             |

horses   cut off fans and the gate was closed.

The crowd pushed forward and       once again pressed against the

concertina doors.     There was    no pressure against the barrier.        I

heard a message over the public address          telling the crowd at the

Leppings Lane end to stop pushing as there was room inside.              The

c:rowtji/ pushed forward towards the turnstiles.        1 saw Inspector Purdy

standing on a crash barrier shouting at the crowd.            A young boy was

carried over the head of the       crowd to Inspector Purdy.

I   heard a radio message    concerning the kick off.       I did nothear the
message   clearly because of the noise.        The message related to the

kick off.    It was either a request to postpone the kick off for                 15

minutes   or a message stating the kick off had been put back.

I heard   an instruction over the radio stating that the gates at                 the

Leppings Lane end should be opened.          As soon as I heard the message

the gate adjacent to our barrier opened.           The crowd surged through

unchecked like water from a tap.         The forecourt   cleared in minutes as

the outer gates were closed the concertina gates were closed and our

barrier was moved forward.         The outer gates were opened and the crowd

once again filled the forecourt to turnstiles A - G .

The concertina gates were opened slightly and persons were allowed in

after checking of tickets.         Inspector White was supervising this
                 'V


procedure.

I walked to the barrier behind the rear of the South Stand.               As I was

walking towards        it I heard a radio message requesting every available

officer to go into the ground.         I got to the barrier and no officers

were present.         I went to the BBC vans nearby and saw a technician

looking at a TV monitor.         I enquired what had happened and was told

that there had been a pitch invasion.

I walked back to the top barrier at the Leppings Lane end in order to

check what men if any had remained at the barrier.           As I approached |

the concertina gates they were opened obviously from the inside.                    I

saw a man being carried by three others.           The man appeared to be dead.

I   said to these mens      "What *s happening."   One answered!   " T he r e’s

people dying in there get inside."         I entered through the concertina

doors and saw another man being carried.           He was unconscious and

appe^fed dead.        I assisted two men in carrying him to the roadway

outside the concertina doors.         He was not breathing and I applied

cardiac massage.        The man immediately started breathing all       be it

very shallow.         I was joined by a female who stated she was a nurse.
                                                                                    PAGE
         ,,                                   -4-                                   R452

 'she felt the man's        pulse and confirmed that he had a pulse.             I later

  identified this        patient^an the television as a man giving the name

                         No sooner had the nurse confirmed a pulse than a man

  who stated he was a doctor arrived.               I later established that this

  was Dr. John Ashton of Liverpool University.                 He examined

 -|       ~l   confirmed his pulse and the fact that he was breathing but

  not conscious.         I stayed with the patient until he was conveyed by

  ambulance from the scene at 4.00 pm.              (1600)    He regained

  consciousness about 3.40 pm (1540) and complained of pain in his

  chest and in his        right   leg which he was unable to move.           I comforted

  him and assured -him..          I saw Dr. Ashton certifying dead bodies about

  10 and after my patient had been carried assisted in security of the

  bodies.      Dr. Ashton was also giving advice as to which patients

  should be carried by the ambulance service.                 Whilst with the patient

                    11                  heard repeated radio messages for ambulances

  directed to the Leppings Lane.

  1 later formed a cordon against the crush barrier preventing the fans

  leaving the ground,        getting to the dead and injured.           Many Liverpool

  fans were abusive as they left.          They were         calling the officers    in

  the cordon Murdering Bastards and Fucking Murdering Bastards.                     When

  the crowds had left and the bodies had been removed to the temporary^

  mortuary by Police vans         I went to the North Stand and collected my

  serial with the exception of PC 3162 Pears who was on Mortuary

  Duties.      I later enquired from members of my serial what               part they

  took    in the incident and wrote down a resume on the de-brief sheet.

  I retired from duty at 7.30 pm.           (1930)

Dear Mr Marshall


You wrote to Mr Moynihan on 5 May 1989
enclosing one from Mr |       about the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Miss Bannister,
in her letter of 18 May 1989, mentioned that
your letter and your constituent's had been
forwarded to me as the Secretary to the
Inquiry.

I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice
Taylor who has noted it.

                                Yours sincerely




                              R M WHALLEY

As you know, your letter of 5 May to Mr Moynihan enclosing a copy
   a letter from M r |      of                 NW11, about the
Hillsborough disaster was passed on to the Home Office for a
response.


I have sent copies of your letter and your constituent's to
Mr R Whalley, Secretary to the Inquiry under Lord Justice Taylor,
to investigate the events at Hillsborough in order that the
Inquiry may take account of the points your constituent raises.
Mr Whalley can be contacted at this address.

        Dear Mr Marshall

        You wrote to Mr M o y n i h an on          5 M ay enclosing
        a   letter  from    Mr                          about   the
        Hillsborough disaster.

        However, as the matter seems to be primarily
        for  the Home Office,    I am passing your
        letter   to  that  Department   asking  them
        to reply to you direct.

        Yours sincerely

I enclose a copy of a letter from my constituent
Mr         of                          [ NW11 which he has
asked me to send to the Prime Minister.              I feel
that it is more a p p r o p r i a t e ^ letter for your
department rather than the Hard-pressed No. 10
office.

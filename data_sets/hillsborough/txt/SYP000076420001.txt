     to    be    in my o p i/fion full,              and had no d i f f i c u l t y            rejoining my friend,

                                 of                                                                                 who had

     re m ained on the               terrace.

     It was about 2. 3 0                pm - 2.3 5       pm     (1430-1435 hrs)               by this stage,             and we

     re m a i n e d    in the        p o s ition    I indicated as the              pen       continued            to fill up.

     At about 2. 5 0            pm    (1450 hrs),          I realised              it was      becoming       full enough                  to

     make       it u n co mf or ta bl e and          I could see other                 s upporters          leaving our                   pen

     by climbing           over       the    fence      into the a dj oi n i n g             pen,    to my left as                I

     faced the          pitch.

     My a t t e n t i o n was         drawn to       the      pitch a short while after                      this     because

     the    players        came onto the             pitch for the             kick-about.             At about 3 pm

     (1500 hrs),           as    the game a ct u a l l y           ’k i c k e d - o f f ',    I found myself             in

     p o s itio n      ’2* w h i c h     I have      indicated on the                 grid (Ex.       No.            )

     (Ex.       Ref.            )r a matter of 4 feet.

     I had e x p e ri en ce d          no sudden abrupt               surge      to get        to this       second       point?

     it was       just a steady              crush w hith fo r c e d me down the                      terraces.           However

     I do       remember a sideways                m o v ement       betw e e n 2.5 5         pm    (1455 hrs)       and 3 pm

fN   (1500 hrs)          towards         the     lVft    (as     I faced the           pitch).         This    lasted a few

     moments a n d         I thought            it might       cause me to topple                   over,    but    I managed

     to    retain my balance.                    It was       so u n c o m f o r t a b l e    by now that my             chest

     felt       re st r i c t e d and the          crush of people was                 o b viously a f f e c t i n g          many

     others       in the        pen,     p a r t i c u la rl y those        closer      to the fence           than myself.

     I had become           s e p ar at ed from my friend,                   also,      by this        time.

     I deci d e d that           s om e h o w    I had to get           out of the            pen,    and somehow             I

     m a n a g e d to    reach the spi k es on top of the                          pitch f enci ng , a 1 though                       I

     cannot       remember           e xa ct ly how      I did so.            I swung        forward and           climbed up

     and over the f e n c e / n i p p i n g              my jacket          in the      process,        and    jumped onto

     the    pitch siVie                the      fence.        I do not know at what                   time    exac t l y this

                 a n d a fter a brief            rest,       seconds           probably,       I realised that             people       at

                 the     front      of the     pen       I had     c 1 imbed out         of were getting             crushed.           They

                 were       shouting and s cr ea m i n g              for help and           I knew        I had to try and             do

                 something,           so   X climbed         back onto the              fence and began g e s t i c u l a t i n g             to

                 people at the             back of the           pen to move           back.           few other s u pporters

                 were       also    doing     this,       but    because we did ru/t appear                       to be having any

                 effect       on the       crush,        I came down off thj? fence.

               I tried      to hand them             in to my          local Police at Dagenham,                     e x plaining     to

               them how       I had       come by them,               and they told me             they were         probably       not

               traceable,         so   I have        th r o w n them away.             I did not see             that man who

               recognise         him again.

               I tried,       as well,         whilst          on the fence,          to    pull a white          lad of      roughly

               20      23 years who            I cannot          further       describe,          out of the         pert and onto

               the    fence.       U nf or t u n a t e l y ,     it was       just    not    possible and            I had to       let

               been op e n e d by now,             w h i c h was       easing    the       pressure,       and    I can recall

                   I remember          taking a step a w a y from the               fence and        it was      only then that

                   I r e a lised what         had a c tu al ly happened,            that     people were         dead or dying.

                   render First Aid,              having       never     been trai n e d     in that       respect,        and so        I

                   decided,          having     rec o v e r e d s l i g h t l y from the     shock    of     realisation,           to

                   pitch for          treatment.

                   I probably helped about                  half a dozen,          of w h i c h two were a c t u a l l y

                   conscious,          across     the    pitch on these           br o k e n hoardings,         w h i c h were      the

                   m a k e s hi ft    stretchers,        and    left them to        be t/TeaTled or e x a m i n e d         in the

                   corner       of the N S t a nd and S pi o n Hop.                T w of others     of these were            covered

ds/\               (he a d and shoulders)               by coats.         I cannot     really describe             either      these

T O       Lb       persons       or their         clothing,      apart     frc^m one man,       a whits male,              33 - 40

                   years,       a bout 5 ’10 tall,           of st^ocky/to        fat build,        with short i s h hair            (I

               {   up    light       coloured      shirt w h i c h was       ripped an d up over             his stomach.            His

                   eyes were          open and      his m ou th      open and he       lay on his          back on the         pitch
      k X
                   near    to the       penalty area at            the Liverpool         end.

      ^            He was       not    being a t t e n d e d    to and as       far as      I was    concerned,         was    dead.

                   I closed his eyes,               having      realised there was            nothing       else     that     could

                   be done       fo r h i m .

                   I con t i n u e d to assist           as m uch as       I could by carrying a few of these

                   other     people across            on the hoardings,            and shor t l y after          tried to          calm

                   some    of the Liv e r p o o l        fans who        had become      irate at      the      insensitive

                   reaction of the N o t t i n g h a m Forest               fans.      No   trouble        d e v e l o p e d and    it

                   was    not    long after         that    the Police          formed a cordon across               the    pitch.

                   1 remained on the              pitch     in a bit       o/   a daze,     again,     and e v e n t u a l l y      left

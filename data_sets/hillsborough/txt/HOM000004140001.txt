           TAYLOR REPORT: PROPOSED NEW OFFENCE OF CHANTING OBSCENE OR
           RACIALIST ABUSE


           The Home Secretary has seen Mr Patten's note of 17 July.

           2    As you know, we are due to discuss the offences in the
           Taylor Report at a meeting on Tuesday, 24 July, which
           Mr Patten will attend. The Home Secretary has noted
           Mr Patten's concern about the proposed new offence of chanting
           obscene or racialist abuse at a football match. He has made
           the point, however, that the chanting offence is, like the
           ticket touting offence, justified by the particular
           circumstances of football match and that, in both cases, that
           argument could be cited to resist wider.reaching legislation.

Dear Mr Benton,

Re; Hillsborough Steering Committee                                                                      ^,'
                                                                                                     0

Thank you for your letter.

The Steering Committee has been disbanded but as I was a member
of it perhaps I can help.

The Committee was    set up shortly after     the disaster  to
coordinate all   the  legal  issues which arose   from it ...
membership was by election at a meeting at which approximately
80 solicitors were present who elected 6 members.

The Committee had no direct responsibility  to any   individual
client   but   existed  to assist   Solicitors  who  themselves
represented individuals or families in relation to such matters
as :-

1. The Public Inquiry.
2. The Inquests.
3. Civil Actions for damages.

I trust this general information is of some assistance to you
but if you or your constituents have a more   specific enquiry
that you would like me to deal with please do not hesitate to
drop me a line.

Yours .sincerely,

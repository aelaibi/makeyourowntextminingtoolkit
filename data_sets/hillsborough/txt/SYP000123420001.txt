 SUBJECT:     SAFETY IN SPORTS GROUNDS - POPPLEWELL REPORT -
              FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS - C M ® 9710




Attached is my report dated 29 January 1986, together with replies
frati divisions recovered to date. I understand A Division have no
comment and nothing received from D Division to date.

The only comment from divisions is from Barnsley who remain, so far
as recommendation 14 is concerned, strongly in favour of a total ban
on alcohol at sports grounds, including 'executive boxes'. They feel
this has brought about a drastic reduction of policing problems and
an overall improvement in crowd behaviour at Barnsley and it is perhaps
fair to say that this applies throughout the county.

 I personally still favour some relaxation in this area as I am mindful
 of the majority of supporters who are law abiding and well behaved who
 enjoy a quiet drink and these, and indeed the clubs, are being penalised
 because of the anti-social behaviour of the hooligan element that causes
 problems at matches.

 CCTV has done much to curb the activities of the irresponsible element
 attending matches and, whilst we do not have any 'executive boxes' in the
 county at present, I still feel that some consideration should be given
 to the 'bone-fide' supporter.

JOHN STEVEN WILSON




POLICE CONSTABLE 16




ECCLESFIELD POLICE STATION




At 9-00 am on Saturday         15 April 1989, I came on duty at Ecclesfield Police

Station in relation to the above          football match.        I was aware at that time

that I was to be directly responsible to Police Sergeant 468 Whitlam and to

be later the same date deployed, as part of Serial 17, at the Leppings Lane

turnstiles leading into the West Stand and terraced area below the same.

At approximately 10.40 am the same date, I was on duty at the Leppings Lane

turnstiles    as mentioned being situated directly beside               the    cantilever gate

leading to the North Stand, i e , gate 'A' as shown on the attached diagram.

At 1350 hours that date, I arrested a youth re possession of Cannabis Resin

and therefore had to leave the turnstile area to attend at the Police Room

within the ground itself.

At approximately 1440 hours I returned to the rear of gate                    'A' on the North

Stand side of that g a t e , at which time I became aware of a large number of

people   on   the   Leppings    Lane   side   of   gate   'A'   who   were    apparently              being

crushed against the gate by others outside.

As a result of this,      gate    'A' was eventually opened and a large number of

people   surged through    the    same and made      their way towards        the North Stand

area, some of the same people complaining of the crush outside.

Within minutes of that incident I became aware of people being brought from

the tunnel leading to the West Stand terraced area, whereupon I immediately

left gate ’A' and made my way towards the tunnel area.
On reaching           the    entrance       to      the    tunnel       I saw several            people      lying at the

entrance        apparently          injured         with many          others       in   attendance          attempting     to

revive      and    transport         the    injured            to nearby       ambulances.            On     seeing this I

then looked into the tunnel and saw further people apparently injured, being

carried        from    the    tunnel       and again to               the    ambulances         in attendance        at the

scene.         I was       then     informed of the crush situation in the terrace area by

several people,             whereupon I immediately ran into the terraced area, my path

to   the     scene     being blocked             for a         short    time by people           at     the rear of the

terrace.          After eventually pushing my way to the front area                                        of the terrace,

I saw Police Constable 2913 Auckland attempting mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

approximately halfway                down the terraces                  on a youth approximately 18 years,

blond hair of medium build wearing a maroon                                     coloured crew neck jumper and

light       coloured        trousers.           I    approached             Police    Constable         Auckland     and    on

reaching        him    I     offered       my    assistance            of    which       I   took     over    the   task    of

reviving the youth.                  Eventually,           I was       informed that the youth's pulse had

returned        and    he     was    transferred               by     others onto        the    pitch      itself   to     the

awaiting ambulance crews.

I    then    began     to     assist       other       officers         in    removing         approximately        fifteen,

what    appeared        to    be     deceased,         people         from    the     area at       the    bottom    of    the

terrace slightly to the right,                         if viewed from the rear of the terrace, of a

barrier which I saw had been extensively damaged.                                            These bodies were            then

passed through a gate in the centre of the perimeter fence or through a gap

in the fence itself near to the gate.

After       clearing        the    area of       these         bodies,       I then      remained          in the   terraced

area to supervise                 the remaining people in that area.                            After a short time I

left     the    terrace       via     the       gate      in    the    perimeter         fence,       following which        I

remained by the gate on the pitch side and pulled several people through the

gate and the nearby hole in the fence and onto the perimeter gravel track.
,   *                                                       -    3    -




    Whilst      remaining          in   that     location            I eventually            met        Police    Sergeant       468

    Whitlam        and    other    members      of     my   serial,            whereupon           we    left    the    scene    and

        returned    to    the    Leppings       Lane    turnstile               area    where       I     assisted      with     the

        supervision of people leaving the West Stand area.

        I can only describe the bodies I assisted to remove from the terrace as male

        from 20 to 30 years of age, all of a white European appearance.

    Throughout           the    incident   mentioned            I was          aware    of    the       presence       of several

    people      who      were    obviously      intoxicated thus                  making       the       task    at    hand     more

    difficult than it need be.

    I     was   also      aware    of    several       people             in   the     crowd       spitting       and    shouting

    obscenities          at Police Officers mainly to the fact that we were to blame for

    the incident.

    Whilst      standing on the perimeter track after removing                                      the bodies mentioned,

    myself      and other         officers      were    struck about the body                       by a number of coins

    thrown      from      the West      Stand    and    terraced areas which further substantiated

    the atmosphere at that time of hatred and antagonism towards the Police.

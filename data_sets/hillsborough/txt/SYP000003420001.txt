                  When      I first             joined           the    crowd       I saw a mo u nt ed                police        o f f i c e r who        wa s

        I saw        the     players         waVfajrltq up            on the         pitch.            The      ter r a c e s w e r e          pretty

        packed         but      it w a s      reasonably alright.                          At     th e     end        of    th e      tunnel

        told      us    to      go    left.        As      I turned           to     go    left         it w a s       l i ke      being       thumped

        in, the        back      and       I was      forced          forward.             1 turned              to    l o ok      for    my mates

        been      to m y        left.         I just         saw a         s ea     of    faces.           I started               off    just        to       the

        left      of    th e     tunnel         but     was      almost           immediately              pushed           forwards           towards

        t he     pitch       s i d e , I saw a metal                      barrier          and        I j u m p e d on          it.      I didn't              se e

        The      time      by    now would            be a b o u t         4 minutes            to 3.           The        barrier        was

        towards         the      front       of    the       terrace.               I s t o o d ajptti f a c e d            th e      tunnel         and

        was      shouting            for    people         to    go       back.          I ^fould        see      that          no-one        was

        moving,         they were            just       crushed.              p»rere w e r e           still          peo pie         in the

        I fell         off      the      barrier.            1 landed             on m y       feet.          I remember               putting my

        arms      above         my    head      it w a s        just       instinct.

        Everyone           was       c r u s h e d all       around           me      by t h i s       tim e ,     Iw a s        about        16 f ee t

        because         by      t h is     time    the       match         bid      started.             I saw         p o 1 i ce      offi cers

     Although           I tried my              hardest       I just/couldn*t                       reach a n y o n e .              The       look    on

     their        faces       was      pan i c.         I was      amly        there        for       10 s e c o n d s         and     thought

     I' d    better         help       somewhere            e'm e.

     I remember             a g t . J o h n Amfofllance m a n                     running           over       to     s om e    feller

     lying        on    the    pitch and m e                laid a stre tch er                   next        to     him.        There          was

     only a        couple         of     lad*/standing               round          him.         They        lifted         h i m up a n d           put

     him     on    the      s t r e t c h y , there           was        o n l y 3 of          them       so      I got        hold       of    the

     4th     corner         and      caijfried h i m         down        the      pitch        to     th e     o ther       end      round       the

     back     of        the sta n d,            a n d we    just         left      him      there.

     I went        back        to    the        pi tc h,    all      I remember                is     running         to    people seeing

     if     they       were    alright.             Most      of     them         j u st    seemed           to     be    l y in g     on      the

     floor        trying       to      get      their       breath.            Others          were       j us t      standing            there

     crying,           others        were       being       sick.

     I went        to a f u n e r a l           of m y      friend        the       other        d a y a n d a g ir l               came       up to

     I'd     told       him my         name       and      talked        to    h i m f or        20 minutes               but       I don't

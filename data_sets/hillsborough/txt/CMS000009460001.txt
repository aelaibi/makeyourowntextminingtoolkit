Dear

I have been asked to reply to your letter of 30 October to the
Minister for Sport, about Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations
to improve safety at sports grounds.

I attach a copy of the Home Secretary's statement to the House
of Commons on 29 January 1990, which sets out the government's
response to Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report into the
Hillsborough-Stadium Disaster. For information about the reaction
of clubs and* football bodies to the recommendations, I suggest
you contact the Football League Ltd, Lytham St Annes, Lancashire
FY8 1JG.




Yours sincerely

Dear Mr.Atkins



               I am doing some research into the Governments
proposals for the improvement of safety at football grounds
(the Taylor Report).  I am hoping to get an article published
focusing on the reaction to the proposals as well as
analysing the proposals themselves.  I would be very grateful
for any information you could let me have, or any terms of
reference you could refer me to.

            I am hoping for completion in early December and
although I realise you will be very busy at this time I would
very much appreciate any help you can give me.


          Thanking you in anticipation,

                                                   5 NOV 1990
          Yours sincerely,

         involved a M o t o r cycle.                 We made         no    planned       stops - no one was             drinking

         alco h o l     on the         coach.      There was also a series                      of    road works     before we

         e n c o u n t e r e d the a c c i d e n t      whi ch a g a i n s 1owed us             down.      We were      d e 1ayed

         by at      least        three     quarters          of an hour          perhaps    45 minutes.

         Last      year     I made       the same           journey to the m a t c h and               on the    M1 we were

         s t o p p e d and       checked       by the         Police        for alcohol.             This year we w e r e n ’t

         day"      and got        off.      The     coach         continued       on to a road          near    to the

         brew e r y and Co-op,              before we             got off a n o t h e r Police Officer              got    on,

         w e ’d been        last year.            As we       left the          coach    I. noticed other          coaches

         about 2 0 - 3 0 all wit h               people       getting       off.        I saw 4 policemen           next       to

         our     coach and en route                 saw man y others              in small       groups.        I didn't        see

         any m o u n t e d       policemen.          The      time was about             1230    pm when we        started to

saw one         fan swinging          on the         goal    crossbar        at   the time          I thought

he was an           idiot     I d o n ’t know what            he thought          he was      doing.            Soon after

to    the      goal    area and       then      ran back.         The      next     thing about            100 Police

Officers         marched       into      the    ground and fo r m e d a             cordon across               the

halfway         line.       At this       time Liverpool             fans     were      still       carrying          people

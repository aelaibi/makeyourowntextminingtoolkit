             In response to your appeal for personal experiences of the tragedy at

             Hillsborough,            here are some points for your     consideration.

             (1)               The reason for the late arrival        of fans to the ground.

                                If my experience was typical, and I have no reason to

                               believe that it wasn't,    the problem lay in travel delays.

                               Ne left Crosby at 11.00 1100 a nd travelled via the M57 and

                               M62.    Prior to the junction with the M63,       there were Police

                               signs which advised football      fans to travel via the M 6 0 2 ,
        sr
                               Since there was a stationary queue of traffic waiting to

                                join the M62/M63 this seemed to be sound advice.           Once we

                                left the M602 in Salford we hit a very slow moving          line of

                                traffic on the A57 until we filtered onto the next section

                               of motorway (The Mancunian Way).         This   could have been
                                                           PAGE      2
                                                           S2504

anticipated because it was the result of long-standing

roadworks.      The next hold up was at tne end of the M67,    the

Hyde roundabout.      The queue started between 600-800 yds,

from the roundabout and continued up to the traffic lights

at Hyde.     We encountered three further queues before we

cleared Glossop.At none of these points, which were all

predictable, was there a single policeman to ease the flow

of traffic,     We turned off the A57 shortly before Sheffield

and parked in Tapiin St near Hillsborough to wn/ vi 1lag e.    The

time was then 14.05 1405.      A journey of 81 miles had taken 3

hrs 5 mins.      It was 14.20 1420 before we got to the

turnst i1e .

Return journey.

We left Taplin St at 17.00 1700 as Sports Report began.        We

stopped at the first public telephone on the A57 and were

asked into the adjacent farmhouse fay a young woman who let

us use her phone.     That was very good of her and we are very

grateful.      The traffic over the Snake Pass moved very slowly

and I d i d n ’t see much overtaking at all - trully funerial.

However,    despite this and the fact that we were diverted

off the last section of the M67 and had to drive in file

through a built up area with several sets of traffic lights,

we arrived back in Crosby at 19.15 1915.      The difference was

that there were Police     in Glossop, at the foot of the hill

in Hyde and at the traffic lights at the top of the hill        in

Hyde,   Had this been the case for the outward bound journey,

I suspect that many more fans would have arrived in plenty

of time for the kick-off.

Fans travelling without tic ke ts .

Undoubtedly, many fans did travel without tickets.        However,
                                                                                      PAGE        3
                                                                                      S2504

                     my son and I were in the West Stand

                     The two seats immediately in front of us were occupied by

                     two middle aged men with their 6 or 7 year old sons on their

                     knees.    The two seats      immediately next to me were occupied

                     by one man and 2 lads        about 11 or 12. Obviously,       3 of   those
b      m
                     people got in without        tickets.     as they were probably

                     younger ones,     I doubt    that they got in by scaling the
S tQ
                     walls.    I suspect that they got in because the dads paid the

                     usual back-h and er s.

                     So long as fans know that they can get into big matches,

                     without tickets,     if they canjust get to a ’fr ie nd ly ’

                     turnstile they will       continue      to journey in hope.    It is up

                     to the Police and the groundstaff to ensure that they do not

                     get away with it.       At Old Trafford there was a policewoman

                     at our turnstile checking tickets before we tried to gain

                     access.   That is the way that it should be.

           (4)       Lack of explanation over the PA System.

                     Many of the criticisms of the organisation both inside and

                     outside the ground have already been covered at great length

                     in the media,     national and local.       Our personal experience

                     may ssrvs to indicate the problems that arose because of the

                     lack of information.        When we had been given neither

                     information nor advice by 15.45           1545 I asked the Police at a

                     gangway   ’what   is h ap pe nin g? ’    Iwas told that the match had

                     been abandoned and would I please leave quietly.              When we

                     left the Stand I tried to gain entry into Leppings Ln

                     terracing beccause I wanted to look for a young woman                (17)

                     whom we had taken with us to Hillsborough.            I was told that

           JO^       I couldn’t go in through the tunnel and that I would just
                 A
                     have         t outside.       That was ridiculous.     There was
                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                        S2504-

                           nothing remotely like an accident       centre where concerned

                           •friends or relatives could obtain information.        Between

                           16.00 1600 and 16.30 1630 the organisation outside the

                           Ground was as bad a s it had been before the match.

                           Worse was to come!     As we walked along by the park     (Middle

                           Rd/St)    towards Tapi in St we were confronted by a manic

                           Forest suporter who was stalking between S lines of

                           stationary traffic screaming      ’come on you bastards   if you

                           want a fight."     J ust as we approached a path whi ch cut

                           across the park,    there was a charge by about 12 Forest fans

                           (late >teens early twenties).

                           Fortunately,    they charged passed us at some Liverpool

                           supporters who had bailed out of a car (feelings were

~/i    T           h       running high at this point because of the rumours of people

                           dead)    but my son was hit in the back by an iron b a r .    Had

                           there been an explanation over the PA system,        I think that

                           the Forest fans might have been sympathetic.        As it w a s ,

                           they thought the scousers had just rioted again,        in keeping

                           with their    reputation,   no doubt!   This misapprehension was

      [Q   ^           ’   supported b y a comment m a d e / W a Police Officer to a fan in

                           front of me as we left tfrfe Ground,     "T hat ’s the second time

                           you -a##** have doneJLbis."      Ironical when one remembers the

           vJpfc           sequence of events that led up to the stampede!

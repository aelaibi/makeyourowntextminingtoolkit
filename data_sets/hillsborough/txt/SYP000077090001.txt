            I would refer to the questionnaire I have completed about the football

            match at Hillsborough on Saturday 150489.



            ine particular incident that occurred was when before the match
            ■>t/frled7 two Policemen walked over to me and my friends and offered to

               et us into the ground for money,      if we didn't have tickets.

            Jhat happened was, that because we got to the ground at 1143 hours,

            tnd the turnstiles weren't open, we bought something to eat and some

            tews papers to read from a little shop near the turnstiles and then

went     back        to    our     turnstiles              gates     and    sat       on    the    floor       with     our       backs

While        we    were      sitting        th ere,         there     was     j ust        a few       other     supporters                in

the    vicinity            and     some     Police          Officers.           I can        remember          seeing        a

smallish           blonde        haired        Police        lady,     who      was        tubby.        Just     as    we       sat

do wn,       two P o l i c e m e n       walked        over     to    us,     having         come       from     the    p ath

alongside            the     river,       and       walked      straight          across          to    us.      I would

describe           t h e m as      both     being          Constables,,         they were              wearing       helmets           and

had    on     n or m a l    C o n s t a b l e s ” uniforms.




Only     one       spoke      to    us a n d        he was      about        in his         early       thirties,           about

5"9    t a 11,       m edi um      b u i 1d wi th d a r k          hai r .      I thi nk          he mi ght       have       had a

moustache            which       was     dark,       trimmed         and     j u st    on    his       top    lip.




The    other         one    was     a    bit     tal l e r ,    about       6*1,       y o u n ger      t ha n t h e fir s t , in

his    late        twenties.             This       one     didn't     say a n y t h i n g .




The    older         one     said,       " D o n ’t t a ke      your       cans       into    the       ground."            He    spoke

with     a    local        accent.          He      wa s    talking        about       the    cans       of    pop we        had with

us .



                  said,      "Alright          we    sh all     put    them       into       the       bin w h e n     we    have

f i n i s h e d ."



Then     the       Policeman            said,       "Have      you    got     tickets,            cau s e     if y o u ' v e      not       we

            We      all    said     w e ’d got     tickets,          which    we    had.      Th e    two P o l i c e m e n    just

             walked        off    then,      towards       those      fences       in   front    of    the    turnstiles,           and

             I.   don't     know where           they went       after       that.




             I 'm    not    sure      if    I could       identify      these       Policemen         again.




             Until        the    t ime     the   turnstiles          opened,       a n d we   went     into     the   ground,         I

             saw     these       two P o l i c e m e n    on   other    occasions          and   presumed        that     they were

             posted to Lhat end.

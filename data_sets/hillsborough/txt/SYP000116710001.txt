                            ’trouble at Lappings Lane * »

2.45 P.M.                  En route Lappings Lane find two youths

                           with tickets for terraces within North

                           Stand.      Both youths escorted back to

                           terraces via Steward controlled gate.



Back of North Stand packed with men urinating against the wall when

shouted at by myself,,        carried on regardless.     At this time my

attention was drawn to back of turnstiles for North Stand where

Police Constables         from my serial had come through the turnstiles.

Entrance gates       'A' were shaking violently.       Fans coming through

turnstiles    drunk and hostile shouting,         "THEY *RE GETTING KILLED OUT

THERE, T H E R E ’S GOING TO BE ANOTHER HEYSELS," and screaming for gate

*A * to be opened.

Gate   *A * opened after failed attempt for C & V to get out and crowd

force a way in through,         gate    *A ’ closed momentarily after.

Back on turnstile duty only a few Liverpool            fans coming through

suddenly a crowd appears at main gates to turnstiles which are

closed.     Only people now attempting to get in are very drunk

Liverpool    fans.    Turnstiles       closed scuffling breaking out between

Liverpool    fans and in one occasion a drunken Liverpool            fan lashed out

at a Mounted Officer with a broken bottle.             Suddenly Special

Inspector beckons wildly at me.             I ran to gates   'B ’ where   I saw an

obviously dead boy being put in an ambulance,            passed a near naked,

dead man at gate      "B* and into the area between gate         "S’ and the

tunnel    for the terraces.         In this area approximately 10 dead people

were strewn a b o u t .

I   checked these to ensure they were dead then assisted with the

injured people some of who were also            lying in this area.       I then,
                                                                          PAGE
                                                                          R32

after seeing the arrival of ambulance          crews ran through the tunnel

to the terraces where      I was met by a wall of Liverpool     fans,    looking

over them I could see the pitch had been invaded,          people around me in

the tunnel    began moaning,   I assisted to escort these people out of

the tunnel where    if they were    injured,   directed ambulance   crews to

them.

Myself and Police Constable 809 carried the body of a young fair

haired boy in a Liverpool      shirt and light trousers to the lane

running adjacent to the River Don, we then went onto the pitch.

People were being carried away but no bodies were on the pitch,.

Attention called for Leppings Lane terraces where Liverpool             fans were

attacking another Liverpool      fan who they say was picking up

belongings from the terraces and putting them in his pocket.

Called by another officer to go to Leppings L a n e .       On the way assist

to remove bodies from back of terrace tunnel to lane running adjacent

to the River Don then form cordon helping fans to leave ground,

stream of urine    running down from North Stand like a waterfall.

Fans    leaving ground violent and asking       if the match is off.

Ambulances    convey bodies away.

Liverpool    fans leave,   then instructed to go to North Stand for de-

brie f .

Throughout these events      1 felt nothing,     I just helped where    I could.

It seemed as though no body really knew what to do but help with the

dead and injured.

1 have worked at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on numerous

occasions and usually have Policed the same turnstiles without any

trouble.

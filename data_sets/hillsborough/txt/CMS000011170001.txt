Dear Miss

Thank you for your recent letter to the Minister for Sport which
has   been  passed   to   this  department   in   view   of  our
responsibilities for safety at sports grounds.   I apologise for
the delay in replying to you.

There is no dispute that a tradgedy such as that which occurred
at Hillsborough must not happen again.  It's lessons have to be
learned.  Football, including the spectators, must look to the
future.

There is little which I can add to Lord Justice Taylor's very
comprehensive analysis contained in his Final Report on the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster.    He recognised that there is no
panacea which will achieve total safety and cure all the
behaviour and crowd control problems at football matches. He was
satisfied that seating does more to achieve these objectives than
any other single measure.   The Report also identified that all
seated accomodation is consistent with the policies of both FIFA
and UEFA. All seated accomodation is, we believe, a major step
towards creating a better, safer environment in which all
spectators can enjoy the game.     That is why we have supported
Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation and are implementing it.

As you are probably aware the government are making available
£100 million to the football industry over a five year period to
assist clubs in installing extra seats.       The Football Trust
expects to provide clubs with a further £75 milliom over a ten
year period, in addition to almost £26 million provided each year
by television and pools companies.      Consequently there is a
considerable ammount of money available to football clubs to make
the necessary ground improvements.

Following the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report
the Government has met on several occasions with the two
supporters organisations, the Football Supporters Association and
the National Federation of Football Supporters Clubs.

                                                     Yours sincerely

                                                     Steve Bilbe

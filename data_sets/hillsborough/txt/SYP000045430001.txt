                                                        and cannot be solved simply by ensuring that each component of

                                                        they should be compatible and combine to form a balanced unit.

 18.3 Access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as possible
in normal circumstances while, at the same time, providing the
police with proper access to the terraces for the purposes of crowd
control and enabling the pitch to be used in the event of serious
emergency. One alternative to fencing is the construction around
the pitch of a wall with a smooth surface which should be not less
than 4 feet in height on the terrace side. This boundary wall should
have gates or access points to the pitch which could be manned
by the police or stewards. A walkway between the boundary wall
and the terraces, which would be solely occupied by police, first
aid and official club personnel, has been found to be effective as
regards safety and security. In order to achieve this, it might be
necessary to remove one or two rows of terracing and to protect
the walkway from the terrace by a continuous line of barriers, so
designed as to discourage access to the walkway except at authorised
points. The access points from terrace to walkway should be
reasonably near the access points from walkway to the pitch, (see
paragraph 7.9). Where a walkway system is in use, sliding gates
may be installed at the access points from the walkway to the pitch,
ie where there can be no crowd pressure against them, (see paragraph
6.14.2 regarding use of sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to the
pitch is unnecessary where seating extends to the level of the playing
area.

18.4 Clubs should carefully consider their arrangements for the
sale of alcohol. In any case all refreshments should be served in
plastic containers.

18.5 Home clubs should consider, in conjunction with the police,
each of the matches and determine which should be all-ticket,
and the allocation of tickets to the visiting club. So far as the

                                                        they should be compatible and combine to form a balanced unit.

18.3 Access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as possible
in normal circumstances while, at the same time, providing the
police with proper access to the terraces for the purposes of crowd
control and enabling the pitch to be used in the event of serious
emergency. One alternative to fencing is the construction around
the pitch of a wall with a smooth surface which should be not less
than 4 feet in height on the terrace side. This boundary wall should
have gates or access points to the pitch which could be manned
by the police or stewards. A walkway between the boundary wall
and the terraces, which would be solely occupied by police, first
aid and official club personnel, has been found to be effective as
regards safety and security. In order to achieve this, it might be
necessary to remove one or two rows of terracing and to protect
the walkway from the terrace by a continuous line of barriers, so
designed as to discourage access to the walkway except at authorised
points. The access points from terrace to walkway should be
reasonably near the access points from walkway to the pitch, (see
paragraph 7.9). Where a walkway system is in use, sliding gates
may be installed at the access points from the walkway to the pitch,
ie where there can be no crowd pressure against them, (see paragraph
6.14.2 regarding use of sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to the
pitch is unnecessary where seating extends to the level of the playing
area.

18.4 Clubs should carefully consider their arrangements for the
sale of alcohol. In any case all refreshments should be served in
plastic containers.

18.5 Home clubs should consider, in conjunction with the police,
each of the matches and determine which should be all-ticket,
and the allocation of tickets to the visiting club. So far as the

   the above loading requirements, doubt should arisdH j; any
   reason (including such matters as cracking of the terracing^ r
   distortion of connections) as to the safety of the barrier or
   handrail, a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless
   the results of this investigation remove the doubt as to the safety
   of the barrier or handrail, the barrier or handrail, as the case
   may be, should be deemed to have failed the test.

   and of their performances during the tests.

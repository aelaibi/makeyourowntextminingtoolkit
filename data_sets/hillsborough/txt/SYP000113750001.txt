                 After     briefing         at    the H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o tball     Ground      I was     deployed,           in

                 company 'with' PC           1698 Martin,           on point        duty at the j u n c t i o n of

                 Micidlewood Roa d and W i n to Road.

                 Neither      myself        or PC M a r t i n     had    radios at any time              during         the    day.

                 A ny    communi cat ion we           received was         given       to us verbally,.

                 Throughout         the morn i n g        of the     game,    suppo r t e r s       of both      teams were            of

                 good     behaviour         and    humour.        However,       as    the    day    prog r e s s e d    supporters

                 were     passing      by,       towards     the d i r e c t i o n of     the    ground,       carrying         cans

                 of     lager and      bitter,        drinking       from these          cans,      as they made          their way

                 behaviour,        at this         stage,     was    still    acceptable.

                 As Z pm (1400)             approached,          myself    and PC Ma r t i n were a s k e d              by Sgt.

                 L e p p i n g s Lane.       This was       due to       large      crowds      g a t hering at         this

junction        (mainly L i verpool               fans)»

At    this     junction        I o b s e r v e d numerous          empty    cans of       lager and bitter :

and groups           of   people        outside a, nearby           public       house    that was open.

Som e    supporters          were       now    clearly the worse            for drink and the                  goo'd

b e h aviour and          humour, w i t n e s s e d earlier          had now        changed       to fans                  ■

chanting        lotidly,      their       tfearfi and heroes.

As 2,30' prri (1430)            approached,-           I re cei ved a verbal             mess a g e    f rom Sgt

L omas    to assist          further          down L a p p i n g s Lane     towards       the     entrance           to

the West Stand.               As myself           and PC M a r t i n 'made .our way down Leppings

Lane,     I. was      informed          by PC 714 Bell' that              the Superiritenderit,                in

charge at        that       end of the ground,               had    requested that           no    traffic,

except       buses,       be a l l o w e d     to travel         down L e p pings Lane          towards         the

s t a d i u m becau s e t ha t a r e a was             g e 11 i n g h e a v i 1y con g s s t ed,      w it h

s u p p o-rters.

i then       r e t urned     to the j u n c t i o n of L s p p m g s            Lane with M i d d i e w o o d Road

and     started       to direct          traffic,       except      buses,       away from Leppi n g s               Lane,

I stood at           this    point        until        3 pm (1500).

During       t his    half    hour           I observed from         my poin t      in the m i d d l e       of      the

road,     a large         crowd at        the     bottom     of L e p pings       Lane    (junction with the

stadium)        w h i c h was      s t e a d i l y growing        from S. 30      pm (.1430)       onwards.               At

about 2 . 4 0 / 2 . 4 3 / 2 . 3 0       (1440 1450)         I remember          having a little

d i f f i c u l t y w ith    the       traffic,       due   to    large    crowds     descending          towards

rne from the          road    opposite L e p p i n g s Lane,              the    road w h i c h    contained

the     open    public       house.           1 also    saw a small         fight     ha If--way down

L e p p i n g s Lane,       which       officers       i m m e d i a t e l y on the scene         broke        up.

There were also              groups       of    people w a l k i n g around,          in this         vicinity,

presumably, t o u t i n g          for    tickets.           One    fan I saw, was being               carried by

two     others       because       he     was      unable to walk on his own.                 (He      was      drunk).

My feelings           are    that most          fans w a n t e d a last drink             before       going         to

the     game.

                     After       standing        down from traffic              duty, (point         duty)     at about 3 pm              (1500)

                      I received         instructions          from Sgt.         L omas     that we were            to a t t e n d at" the

                     ground          (outside)      to assist       at   this       point.

                     The       large    number      of    people    I had seen earlier,                 at this point,            had now

                     d i m i n i s h e d and     only a small         perc e n t a g e     in c o mparison          remained      outside

                     t he g r o u n d .;                                            ’'

                      I saw      people w i t h       tickets,      who were         being       refused a d m i s s i o n     to the

                     ground,          by other      officers,        'because        the ground was            full.**

                     After a few minutes,                   one young man           came    out,of      the    ground shouting

                      "What are y o u          lot s t a nding      there       for,     whe n    there are         people     dead and

                     dying       in t h e r e . ”

                     At       this    point    in time,       I f ol lowed. PC Sha w             (Serial      23)    running      towards

                      the      tunnel    a rea      I saw    people      (one    or-two      I think)         lying     on the

                      ground,         I do not       know    if they were           dead or alive.             At    the other           end

                      of the tunnel            1 saw one supporter,                 white    in the face •- just               coming

                      round      (someone was            kneeling     down next          to the      person)        saying     "Have we

                     wo n . " '

                     I then made vptf way                to the    front     of the terracing where                   I saw a pile

                      I helped         pass    numerous       bodies     from the terracing                 to the      playing aren;

                     one      person     I was      going    to    pick up was           only young,          young     enough to

            but another           officer          said "I *11 get           this                one   (her/him)       you   help them,''1

            This        person was       passed          thro u g h the gap                  in the fencings            "You help them"

            re f e r r e d to a very              l a r g e / h e a v y man w h i c h             two or three         o f f icers were

            attempting           to    pick       up.       I helped      in the removal                    of this       ma n through

            Gate No.           3 which    had just             been opened.                  I then a s s i s t e d       in. removing,.',,.-

            other        bodies       through        this gate.          O f f i c e r s at              the other side          of the

            fencing        -formed a      chain            to receive       these bodies.

             I vaguely          remember          two     of the     bodies a,s being                    late t e e n s / e a r l y

            twenties and one              early te^ns all                male.                   All   had white       faces     and.

             purple       lips w ith their               bowel     area wet and                    stained.

            Once        I was    on the       pitch       I carried one                  bo d y , . a l o n g wit h three         fans,

            on an a d v er t i s i n g        board across            the    pitch                towards     the -gym,      but halfway

            across another              fan took          over and said                  "you go back and help".                       By

             this       time    everyone          who    could, be was           being a t t e n d e d           to.      This    person

            was wearing           blue    jeans          and   probably a teenager                         (16?)

             I then joi n e d the             police        line    :i.rv. the       centre            of the    pitch.

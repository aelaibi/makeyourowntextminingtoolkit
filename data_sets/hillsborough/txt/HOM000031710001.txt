    Thank you for your letter of 15 May to Joyce Quin about the calls for a new inquiry
    into the Hillsborough disaster. I am replying as this issue falls within my remit at the
    Home Office.

    As you will be aware, the Home Secretary announced on 30 June that Lord Justice
    Stuart-Smith is to conduct an independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there exists
    any new and significant evidence relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough football
    stadium which was not previously available.

    I am grateful for your offer to meet and discuss the events at Hillsborough. At the
    moment, however, you will understand that these are issues for Lord Justice Stuart-
    Smith to consider in his scrutiny.

    I will ensure that your helpful letter is drawn to his attention.
X




                                        ALUN MICHAEL

    Ian Daines Esq
    Assistant Chief Constable

LORD DORMAND OP EASINGTON'S PRIVATE       PEER'S BILL ON             SPORTING
EVENTS (CONTROL OP ALCOHOL ETC)

Thank you for your letter of 6 March setting out your proposals
for handling Lord Dorman of Easington's Sporting Events (Control
of Alcohol Etc) Bill which is down for Second Reading on Tuesday
10 March.

I agree that we should support the Bill in the event of a
division. As you say, pressure on Parliamentary time may affect
the Bill's progress, but I am advised that the Bill would not
require amendments and the remaining stages could therefore be
taken on the nod in the event of a dissolution.

I am copying this letter to members of LG Committee, the
Secretary of State for Education and Science, the Minister for
Sport, and to Sir Robin Butler and First Parliamentary Counsel.

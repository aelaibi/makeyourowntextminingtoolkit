    Dear Hiss Wass

    1 am grateful for you advising me of your information about the tragic events
    at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.  I have noted the information which has also
    been made available to Secretary of the Inquiry as well as the Treasury
    Solicitor, who is instructing Counsel to the Inquiry at the oral hearings.

    Having considered your contribution I do not intend to arrange a personal visit
    to obtain any further statement.  However, if you have any additional
    information since you last contacted my investigation team or you feel that a
    personal visit is essential please do not hesitate to make contact at any of my
    offices listed above.  Alternatively you can write to the Secretary of the
    Inquiry as below;-

    Mr R M Whalley
    Secretary to The Inquiry
    50 Queen A n n e ’s Gate
    London SW1H 9AT

    Lord Justice Taylor has asked me to convey his personal thanks for your taking
    the trouble to make contact and for the contribution you have made to his
    Inquiry.

    Yours sincerely




f   J M JONES

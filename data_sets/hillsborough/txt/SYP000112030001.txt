 Laae I saw that Liverpool fans were climbing over the security fence and that Police
 officers were on top ©f the secorityfence telling fans still ia the pens to move
 back. I could see that faas were pushed up against the security fence and that officers
 were on the top of the fence attempting to pull fans from the crush, at this tine I
 could not see if the gates leading onto the pitch were open*
 It heeame obvious that persons were injured and 1 went to a steward on thepiteh to find
 some stretchers ,to he informed that any stretchers were in use, I then returned to
 the area behind the goal and at this time I saw that a gate to the left of the goal was
 now ©pen,I wept to this gate to assist in pulling people from the crush t due to the
 gate being very narrow only two officers could he at this exit pulling fans sat , by
 this time I had become detached from ay serial due to the general confusion and the need
 to attend to the injured. Officers that were at the exit gate were pulling fans oat
 were passing them to a group of officers that had formed near to this exit of which I
 was one* ’
 As faas were passed from the front of the terrace they were given first aid as required
 as no ^bulanee or Medies could be found on scene, the first Arabulane I saw was a St.

 Liverpool fans had jtt&ped onto the playing surface , these fans were pallingdown                 -.

'injured due to tjh© narrowness ef -the- entrance at the eomer ef the Kep/8@rlh stand, this
was made verse as fans were taking injured to the same eorn#r of the ground and thus
blesking the exit. I then assisted #®»e other ©ffieers in the removal ef another body ••

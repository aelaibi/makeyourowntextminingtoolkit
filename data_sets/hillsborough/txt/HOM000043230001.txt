Mr Turney



I attach a copy of a note which I have received from
Miss Harrison covering papers from the Lord Chancellor's
Department on deciding the form of inquiry to follow a disaster.
I also attach a copy of my proposed reply.

If you have any observations I shall be glad if you will let me
have them fairly quickly. Although Miss Harrison's note sets no
deadline, the letter from the Lord Chancellor's Department seeks
a response, in effect, by 18 March.

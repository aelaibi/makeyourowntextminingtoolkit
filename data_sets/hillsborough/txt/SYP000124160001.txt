Q 17

 <•
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 (1) ORGANISATION OF SAME M A T C H I N ^ S S    (000088) WAS BETTER COMPARED WITH 1989

 (000089). PERHAPS LESS PEOPL^JpkmNED UP BECAUSE OF GRAND NATIONAL AT A INTREE.

 (2)    I SEE NO NEED FOR FENCING FANS IN.       BUT IF FENCES REMAIN THERE MUST BE

 MORE EXITS.

 (3)    I DO NOT AGREE WITH I/D CARDS.     IT IS NOT FOOLPROOF,    IE IN LUTON HOLDERS

 OF    I/D CARDS GO ROUND PUBS SELLING “GUEST TICKETS THAT GO WITH CARD OR SIMPLY

 G^IG     IN WITH CARD HOLDER.    HENCE THE OCCASIONAL GROUP OF OPPOSING FANS THAT

 CAN BE SEEN STANDING WITH "HOME” FANS.          ALSO ANYONE CAN BECOME MEMBER OF A

 SUPPORTERS CLUB AND OBTAIN A CARD.

 (4) BETTER USE OF CAMERAS.

 (5) CHANNELLING OF FANS INTO GROUND.

 (6) APPROX    1/3 (THIRD) OF "LIVERPOOL COACHES ENDED UP TOWARDS THE NOTTS FOREST

 END.

 (7) THIS MATCH WAS BADLY ORGANISED. THERE APPEARED TO BE A LACK OF

 COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE ORGANISERS.

 PITCH THAT SOME OF THE POLICE WERE MORE INTENT ON KEEPING PEOPLE OFF THE PITCH
              -----------------------------------------------------   - f   ------------------------------- —

 INSTEAD OF ASSISTING SOME OF THEIR COLLEAGUES WHO WERE MARVELLOUS ASSISTING

 THE FANS OUT ONTO THE PITCH.               IT WAS COMPLETELY DISORGANISED THE WHOLE

 EMERGENCY. WHAT I THINK WAS GOOD WAS TbfAT 2 FANS TOOK DOWN THE GOAL N E T S . THIS

 I THOUGHT THE POLICE ACTED PROPERLY WHEN THEY KNEW THE       SITUATION WITH       THE DEAD

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE LACK OF STEWARDING AND SIGNS TO INDICATE OTHER ENTRANCES TO TERRACES,               ONCE

YOU GET THROUGH THE T U R NS TI LE S, WHICH BRING YOU OUT VIRTUALLY IN LINE WITH THE

 TUNNEL.

 I^K    OF TURNSTILES FOR THE STANDING   AREAS.

SHOULD THERE HAVE BEEN MORE ACCESS BETWEEN THE PENS IT        WOULD HAVE PREVENTED             A

 LOT OF DEATHS & INJURIES.

 IF THE LONGITUDIAL FENCES WERE REMOVED THIS AGAIN WOULD HAVE LESSENED THE RISK

 TO SPECTATORS.

 FROM PENS 3 & 4 THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY OUT,      THROUGH THE T U N N E L .   EVEN IF I

 WANTED TO GET OUT I C O U L D N ’T BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE TRYING TO GET IN.

 THERE W E R E N ’T ENOUGH GATES LEADING FROM THE TERRACES ONTO THE PITCH.         THE

 HEIGHT OF THE EXISTING GATES ARE TOO HIGH.       I REMEMBER A WALL ABOUT 3' 6 HIGH

 BELOW THE BOTTOM OF THE GATE, WHICH COULD HAVE MADE       IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET

 OUT,   IF I WAS INJURED.

THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOME CONTROL OVER THE ENTRANCE OF THE TUNNEL AT THE

BACK OF THE WEST S T A N D , BY POLICE OR STEWARDS,        TO PREVENT MORE PEOPLE

ENTERING THE ALREADY CROWDED TERRACES OF PENS 3 & 4.

CLIMBING FENCES AT THE FRONT TRYING TO GET OUT AND OTHERS CLIMBING INTO

Q 49

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR         IN THE DEATHS 7 OR

THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL WAS UNMANNED AND MONITORING OF PEOPLE TO PENS 3 & 4

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED.

ONE OFFICER REACTED TO THE FANS PLEAS WHO SUBSEQUENTLY WENT TO THE REFEREE

^     STOP THE MATCH.      THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION WAS NOT RELAYED TO

OTHER OFFICERS.      FANS ALL. AROUND THE GROUND KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG BUT THE

OFFICERS DID NOT REACT TO THE SITUATION AS WE SAW IT.

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

THERE WAS A TOTAL DISREGARD FOR THE FANS HUMAN DIGNITY.          WHERE THERE ARE A

MASS OF PEOPLE CONGREGATING IN ONE AREA IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SOME CONTROL

AND ORGANISATION     IS REQUIRED TO GUIDE SPECTATORS WHO ARE FOREIGN TO THE

GROUND AND AREA APPROACHING THE GROUND.         I FEEL PROPERTY NEEDS TO B E
                                                                               PAGE    9

 PROTECTED,    WHICH IT APPEARD TO BE ON THIS OCCASION BUT CONSIDERATION TO THE

 GENUINE SPECTATOR WAS NONEXISTANT.         WHICH ALSO APPLIES TO THE STEWARDING

 INSIDE THE G R O U N D .   SURELY WHAT WAS MONITORED VIA THE CCTV SYSTEMS SHOULD

 HAVE BEEN REACTED TOO OR ACTIONED PROPERLY TO OFFICIALS IN THE TROUBLED

 AREAS.

 LOOKING AT THE HOOLIGAN ELEMENT         THERE WAS NO HOOIpGASIUM AT ALL IN THE

EVIDENCE TO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER        INQUIRY    [

WE ARRIVED AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END OF THE GROUND AT APPROXIMATELY 2.45PM

(1445), HAVING TICKETS FOR THE WEST STAND.         HAVING ATTENDED OTHER BIG GAMES

AT THE GROUND WE DID NOT CONSIDER THIS PARTICULARY LATE TO ENTER THE STAND

FOR AN ALL-TICKET MATCH.        AT NO TIME ON OUR WAY TO THE GROUND       (DOWN WADSLEY

LANE)   WERE OUR TICKETS CHECKED.       NEITHER WAS THERE ANY ATTEMPT TO FILTER OR

J^EEN     SPECTATORS.     IN FACT THE FIRST TIME THAT OUR TICKETS WERE CHECKED WAS

AT THE TURNSTILES.

WE WERE STRUCK BY HOW FEW REQUESTS FOR TICKET WE ENCOUNTERED ON THE WAY TO THE

GROUND.     NORMALLY AT SUCH A BIG MATCH WE HAVE SEEN DOZENS AND DOZENS OF PEOPLE

ASKING?    ON THIS OCCASION WE WITNESSED PERHAPS FOUR OF FIVE.          CROWDS ON THE WAY

TO THE GROUND HAD BEEN GOOD N A T U R E D , AND ALTHOUGH WE HAD SEEN PUBS       IN THE

VICINITY PACKED TO OVERFLOWING AT 1.45 (1345)          (HORSE AND J O C K E Y , WADSLEY JACK)

THEY WERE EMPTY AS WE PASSED THEM AT APPROXIMATELY 2.40            (1440).

AS WE APPROACHED THE. OUTER ENTRANCE       IT WAS IMMEDIATELY CLEAR THAT CROWDS WERE

u4p!3ALLY LARGE AND THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE ALREADY ANGRY AT THE APPARENT LACK

OF ORGANISATION.        THERE WERE ABOUT SIX MOUNTED OFFICERS MILLING AROUND,         BUT

THEY APPEARED AT THIS STAGE TO HAVE LITTLE IDEA OF ANY SYSTEM FOR FUNNELLING                 !

FANS.     WE SOON REALISED THAT A DIFFICULT SITUATION HAD DEVELOPED,          AND THAT THE

POLICE HAD LOST CONTROL.        AN OFFICER WITH A MEG       HONE WAS STANDING ON THE

RUNNING BOARD OF A POLICE LAND ROVER APPEALING TO THE CROWDS TO STOP PUSHING

AT THE FRONT, BUT I ’M NOT CERTAIN HOW WELL HE COULD BE HEARD;           WE STOOD ONLY

TWO METRES OR SO IN FRONT OF THE LAND ROVER AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY

CLEARLY AUDIBLE.                                             /

THERE DID NOT SEEM TO BE MANY OFFICERS ON FOOT LN THE CROWD.             THOSE WE DID

THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE OF US GETTING IN AT THAT M O M E N T .            NATURALLY HE WAS

HAVING ONLY A VERY LIMITED EFFECT.        NOJ>ALL THE POLICE WERE SO GOOD-HUMOURED;

ONE OR TWO MOUNTED OFFICERS LOST Ti^OR TEMPERS AND REACTED AGAINST CROWDS

AGGRESSIVELY.    SOME FANS IN TU£Hn SHOUTED B A C K , BUT WE WITNESSED NO

DELIBERATELY AGGRESSIVE OR DRUNKEN BEHAVIOUR NEAR US.               THE FANS WERE SHOUTING

AT THE POLICE TO "GET YOURSELVES ORGANISED" AND STOP THE CROWDS PRESSING.                           IT

WAS CLEAR THAT MANY PEOPLE HAD BEEN OUTSIDE FOR SOME TIME, WAITING P R E S U M A B L Y ,

L^j^E US, FOR THE CROWDS TO THIN.       WE COULD ALSO SEE A1        iHIS 1 1ME. IHA 1 LARGE

NUMBERS OF FANS WERE STILL MAKING THEIR WAY TO THE GROUND,                 IN A CALM AND

ORDERLY FASHION, FROM THE DIRECTION OF WADSLEY STATION.                  THESE CROWDS

INCLUDED CHILDREN AND FAMILIES —         IT DID NOT SEEM TO US THAT THEY WERE

"DRUNKEN YOBS" OR THAT         THEY WERE SURGING TOWARDS THE ENTRANCES.

A LARGE NUMBER OF FANS         WERE ASKING THE WAY TO VARIOUS GATES AND ENTRANCES AND

THE CONFUSION ABOUT THE LAYOUT OF THESE SEEMED TO BE ADDING TO THE ANXIETY.

WE DECIDED TO STAND NEAR THE LAND ROVER AND WAIT FOR THE SITUATION TO EASE. AT

THIS STAGE WE DID NOT THINK THAT IT WAS NECESSARILY A DANGEROUS SITUATION

SIMPLY AN ANXIOUS CROWD WANTING TO GET IN BEFORE KICK-OFF.                  AT ABOUT 2.50PM

    0) WE RELAISED THAT WE WOULD NOT GET IN IN TIME.               IT SEEMED APPROPRIATE

IN VIEW OF T H E -'LARGE NUMBERS OUTSIDE TO DELAY THE KICK-OFF.                I WAS JUST ABOUT

TO APPROACH THE OFFICER        IN THE LAND ROVER TO SUGGEST HE CONTACT THE GROUND AND

ARRANGE IT, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE CROWDS BOTH

INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING WHEN HE SAID OVER THE

MEGAPHONE THAT "WE ARE TRYING TO GET THE KICK-OFF DE L A Y E D 11.             AGAIN I'M NOT

CERTAIN HOW MANY PEOPLE HEARD THIS.

ABOUT THIS TIME ONE OR         MORE OF THE LARGE WROUGHT-IRON GATES ON THE                 OUTER

PERIMETER WERE CLOSED FOR A        BRIEF TIME,   WHICH EASED THE CONGESTION                SOMEWHAT.

THE OFFICER WITH THE MEGAPHONE CALLED TO THE "JAUNTED INSPECTOR” A NUMBER OF

SOMEONE    (A FAN?) TAPPED HIM AND PHYSICALLY DREW HIS ATTENTION TO THE OFFICER
   t
IN THE LAND ROVER,       WHO INSTRUCTED HIM TO "FORM A L I N E ” .   THE HORSES QUITE

QUICKLY FORMED THEMSELVES INTO A LINE STRETCHING FROM THE SHOPS ALMOST

ACROSS THE AREA OUTSIDE THE OUTER GATES.           THIS IMMEDIATELY EASED THE

CONGESTION.      A SMALL GAP WAS CREATED FOR FANS TO FUNNEL THROUGH.          IT WAS BY

NOW 2.55PM     (1455) OR A LITTLE LATER.      CHEERS FROM INSIDE THE GROUND SUGGESTED

THAT THINGS WERE HAPPENING,        BUT WE HAD NO IDEA STILL AT THIS POINT WHETHER

THE GAME HAD BEEN DELAYED OR NOT.          PEOPLE WERE STILL ANXIOUS TO GET IN THE

GROUND.

l ^ D E C I D E D AFTER ANOTHER MINUTE OR SO THAT THE CONGESTION HAD EASED

SUFFICIENTLY AND WE STARTED TO MAKE OUR WAY INTO THE INNER AREA,             THROUGH THE

BLUE WROUGHT-IRON G A T E S .^ JUST AS WE WERE GOING THROUGH THESE OUTER GATES WE
                             < 7 ^ A
SAW THE CONCERTINA STEEL,GATES ON OUR LEFT LEADING TO THE NORTH STAND OPENED

FOR A SHORT TIME.        A NUMBER OF FANS EN T E R E D THROUGH THIS GATE.   I AM UNCERTAIN

AS TO HOW MANY —        BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT THOUSANDS.

WE WERE ABLE TO APPROACH OUR ENTRANCE         <C) WITH ONLY MINOR DIFFICULTY.        WE HAVE

BEEN IN MUCH WORSE SITUATIONS AT OTHER GROUNDS          (NOTABLY WEMBLY AT CUP FINALS)

AND WE WERE IN NO WAY ANXIOUS AT THIS STAGE.           THERE WERE ABOUT A DOZEN PEOPLE

IN THE QUEUE IN FRONT OF US FOR OUR TURNSTILES.           AS WE WAITED WE OBSERVED

<4RjT A DOZEN FANS CLIMBING UP THE DIVIDING FENCE ON OUR RIGHT AND ONTO THE

BALCONY A B O V E .   A SINGLE POLICE OFF.ICER UP THERE WAS VIRTUALLY POWERLESS TO

STOP THEM.      EVENTUALLY A MOUNTED OFFICER FROM O U T S I p / APPEARED AND CUT OFF

THIS ’ENTRANCE'’.

AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE IN FRONT OF US HAD T I C K E T ^ F O R   DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE

GROUND.     THE PERSON DIRECTLY BEFORE US HAD/A TICKET FOR THE NORTH STAND,

ALTHOUGH THE GATEMAN WAS TRYING TO REFOSaE ADMISSION,          THE POLICE OFF ICER

(A P.C AND W.P.C) JUST INSIDE THE TURNSTILES,          WHO, REMARKED,    LOOKED "ASHEN",

WAVED HIM THROUGH.        THEY WERE CLEARLY CONCERNED WITH GETTING AS MANY PEOPLE

THROUGH AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

WE ENTERED THE INNER COURTYARD,        WHICH WAS RELATIVELY EMPTY,      AND WENT UP THE

STAIRCASE
   «
          TO THE WEST STAND.        WE VISITED THE TOILETS AND ARRIVED AT OUR SEATS

AT 3.06PM    (1506).   THERE WERE A LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN THE A I S L E S ,

SUGGESTING THAT THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THIS STAND? WE DID NOT SEE ANY

EMPTY SEATS WHICH THEY MIGHT HAVE VACATED.        AT THIS POINT WE WERE STILL NOT

AWARE THAT THE GAME HAD ACTUALLY STARTED:        IT APPEARED THAT THE PLAYERS WERE

WARMING UP.     IN FACT THEY WERE JUST LEAVING THE PITCH,      THE GAME HAVING BEEN

STOPPED.    THERE WAS SOME BANTER WITH PEOPLE SITTING BEHIND US? AT THIS POINT

NO-ONE REALISED HOW SERIOUS THE SITUATION WAS.         WE THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE WERE

BEING ALLOWED ONTO THE PITCH TO EASE OVERCROWDING.          IT WAS PERHAPS ANOTHER

l^pUTE OR SO BEFORE WE BEGAN TO REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

WE LEFT THE GROUND AT APPROXIMATELY 3.45        (1545), BEFORE THE OFFICIAL

ABANDONMENT OF THE GAME,     HAVING REALISED THAT THE SITUATION WAS SERIOUS AND

THE GAME WOULD NOT BE PLAYED.       WE GUESSED THAT PEOPLE HAD DIED,    WE DID NOT

REALISE HOW MANY.

SEVERAL POINTS,    IN MY OPINION,   NEED STRESSING.

* THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED.        CROWDS WERE ANXIOUS NOT TO MISS THE

START AND THIS MUST HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE SURGE.         THE POLICE MUST ALSO HAVE

BEEN AWARE FOR SOME TIME THAT THE SITUATION OUTSIDE WAS SUCH THAT A DELAY

WOULD BE PRUDENT.

•s^PliE MOUNTED POLICE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST CONTROL,      EVEN BY 2.45   (1445) WHEN WE

ARRIVED.    AS SOON AS THEY ORGANISED THEMSELVES INTO A LINE THE PRESSURE EASED

IMMEDIATELY AND FANS WERE FUNNELLED THROUGH A NARROW GAP.          WHY DID THIS NOT

HAPPEN SOONER?

* THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT ENTRANCES IN A VERY SMALL AREA AT THE LEPPINGS

LANE END    (BY MY RECKONING 4 -- WEST STAND,   NORTH STAND, LEPPINGS LANE TERRACES

AND SOUTH STAND).      WE SAW LARGE NUMBERS OF SPECTATORS EXPERIENCING GREAT

DIFFICULTY IN LOCATING THE RIGHT TURNSTILES.          I FEEL SURE THAT THIS CONFUSION

IN AN ALREADY CONFUSED SITUATION CONTRIBUTED IN SOME WAY TO THE OVER CROWDING,

ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE FANS WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE GROUND.

* COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE POLICE OUTSIDE THE GROUND WERE WOEFULLY
 INADEQUATE.    SO WERE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CROWDS.     THE TANNOY REQUESTS FOR
   «
 MEDICAL ASSISTANCE CAME VERY L A T E , AND THERE WERE NO ANNOUNCEMENTS   INFORMING


019

 THE CROWD ABOUT THE SITUATION.

 * THE GATE WE SAW OPENED IS NOT THE ONE MENTIONED IN THE MEDIA.       THIS SUGGESTS

 THAT AT LEAST TWO GATES WERE OPENED TO ADMIT FANS.       THE GATE WE SAW OPENED

 AT A TIME WHEN THE WORST OF THE CRUSHING OUTSIDE APPEARED TO HAVE STOPPED.

 SHOULD YOU WISH TO INTERVIEW U S , WE CAN BE CONTACTED AT THE ADDRESSES

PRIME MINISTER



THE TAYLOR INQUIRY


Attached are
          a Cabinet Office note - Flag A; and
          a minute by the Home Secretary - Flag B.


The Home Secretary concludes that the Government should not
proceed with the National Membership Scheme envisaged under
Part 1 of the Football Spectators Act, but he also propos es
that Part 1 should not be repealed.     I think he is right on
both counts.     The Government cannot prevail in the face of the
recommendations of the Report.     Equally, retaining the powers
gives the Government a lever over the football industry should
it be slow in putting its house in order.     It is also important
^.T'r^nnarTTse that the current versioii of the membership scheme
is only one way of proceeding.


You might like to refer again to the Popplewell Report - copy
attached. Although he recommended that
      *consideration should be given to some form of membership
     scheme- for Football League Clubs in England and Wales'
it is clear that he did not envisage the national,
                     in the Act. He appeared to have in mind
club-based schemes which might develop by a system of mutual
recognition.     He did not envisage that a position would be
reached under which membership was the only way of going to a
match.   His ideas come closest to the 'away members only1
scheme discussed in paras 316 - 319 of the Report.     Thus,
while Popplewell can be quoted in support of membership
schemes, he cannot be quoted in support of the particular
scheme-*in the Football Spectators Act.


Conversely, in responding to Taylor, it is important not to
allow his rejection of the current scheme,to impede progress
towards other kinds of membership.

Mr. Michael J. C. Burgess,

Dear Michael,

Thank you for your letter of 10th November.

I am aiming to catch the 7.38 from Nottingham which arrives in Kings Cross at 9.10.
then have to make my way to Buckingham Gate. I will get to the hotel as soon as I
can but do not think it can be much before 9.50 or so.

I hope to see you then.



Yours sincerely,



S. L. Popper

re:          The Hillsborough Scrutiny

I agree that we have a meeting before that with Lord Justice Stuart Smith on 17 November;
I suggest, say, 9.30 am at St.James's Hotel, Buckingham Gate, just round the comer from
the Home Office. Unfortunately, in the few days immediately before then I shall be away
in Stoke (from Friday morning 14 November to the Sunday) on a Home Office training
weekend. Unless you leave a message to the contrary, I shall see you there.

 Yours sincerely,

Thank you for your letter 29th October.

I have spoken to Mr, Bone and agreed that we would meet at their offices at 11 am

Perhaps we could speak before that and arrange to meet so that we can go to the
meeting together.



Yours sincerely,

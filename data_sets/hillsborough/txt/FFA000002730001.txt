Dear Councillor Chase,



      Further to your recent letters, I would inform you
that I am not willing to duplicate the work we are doing for
the official Inquiry.

      I am sure Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry will provide
the full picture the Liverpool City Council is seeking and
certainly The Football Association will render every
possible assistance to the Inquiry.




                                                Yours sincerely




                                                 Chi'ef E xecutiv

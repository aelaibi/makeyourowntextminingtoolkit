F A HILLSBOROUGH



1.         I spoke to                 He thanked me for my
fax.  He said that he would draft an appropriate letter for
the FA to be sending to the Coroner as he had done before.
He said that it was imperative that the FA were not summoned
or subpoenaed to attend at the inquest but that          and
       jave voluntary evidence.

2.        He had no idea why they were being subpoenaed
since other people were obviously capable of giving much
better eye-witness evidence.  Perhaps it was to keep the
fans relatives happy.

3.        He mentioned to me that     ,      '     _ who was
acting for the           was in Herbert Smith the other day
and he had bumped into him.     He said it was very unlikely
that the FA could be joined.     I said it was pretty remote
given that no blame was attached by              â€˜
The hearing in Manchester in relation to who should pay for
the negligence ie the Club, the engineers or the Police had
been sorted out without reference to the FA and although
there was    two  years  under the     1978 Civil Liability
Contribution Act to make a claim against the FA I thought
this was highly improbable.   He agreed with me. However he
wanted to be kept closely informed.

Engaged: 15 minutes

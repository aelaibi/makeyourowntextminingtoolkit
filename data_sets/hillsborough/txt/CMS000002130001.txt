GENERAL EXPENDITURE


1.     The third quarter figure has been
revised downward to reflect the fact that the
Sheffield City Council Bill for the Town Hall
facilities has not yet been received.   It is to
be sent to us early next year and will
therefore appear in the fourth quarter figures.
In total it is likely to amount to some
£140,000.

2.     On the advice of Treasury Solicitors, we
have made interim payments of £100,000 and
£34,500 towards the final bills for the legal
costs to the two parties whose costs will be
met by us.  The balance of these bills,
amounting to some £220,000 will therefore be
paid in the fourth quarter.

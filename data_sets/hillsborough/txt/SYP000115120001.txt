             At Sara (0800)           on Saturday,           15 April,       1989    (150489)        I came on duty at

             Once at the H i l l s b o r o u g h        ground we were             paraded and the m a t c h detail

             was       outlined.        The    serial       was   split     into    pairs and        I par tn er ed PC

             We    commence        these      duties a ro u nd       11.20am       (1120).

            There was a steady flow of                       people     towards      the ground all         in a good

            mood,        and    1 was a p p r o a c h e d    by a number        of teenagers and older               people

the nuiTiber «of cars and vans                        conta in in g      supporters.

The % e n # r a l      d e i ea n ou r     of the        crowd was       good and fairly well                behaved’,

2, 4 and even more                      cans of beer        or    1age r .

Numbers       s t ea d il y grew until                I n o ti ce d the       train arrive        over       the

bridge       further          up the        road and about          fifteen minutes            later      there was

a   large     surge          of suppo rt er s w h ic h were              escor te d    by the M o un t ed

Branch*           A g a in    general        behaviour was          good but        large numbers            were

carrying          cans       of    beer.

The    s u pporters           were       on both sides           of the      dual   ca rr ia ge wa y down the

central       r e se r va t io n and on the                road singing and            chanting.          I was

co n t i n u a l l y a sk ed        for    the nearest           pubs and toilets and             by now       it was

a round 2.20prti (1420).

All    the    time       there were              people w a lk in g agai ns t         the flow of the main

body of s u pp or t er s as ki ng                  for   spare     tickets      "Any spare,         mate".

Around 2.40pm                (1440)       A /PS Thomas       came up to me and said                 that      it

sounded as           if there was                fighting    in the       ground,      a cc o rd i ng   to    the

radio messages.                    He    remained w it h us on the              point and        I remember

T hese    coaches were                  now being        parked    on the main         road near        to the

railway bridge                as C l ay w he e ls Lane was            full and had been for about

  At3pm        ( 1 5 0 0 ) . we       left our        point w ith other members                 of our    serial       to

  see     the game.

   It waf quite a p p a r e n t                to me at this            stage      that    s om ething   had happened

   inside the g ro u nd a l t h ou g h                 I was         not aware      exactly what.

  The     officers         present were               told to form a cordon w hich we                    did.     This

  was across             the       e nt ra nc e    to the L e p p in g s Lane          entrance    to stop anyone

  a p pr o a c h i n g    any       further.

  At    this     time an a m b u l an c e arrived,                     the    cordon      parted and a l lo we d       it

   through^                    ,

   I thfm saw someone                    beckon us towards                where     the a m bu la nc e   was    now

 , t a l k e d , w hi c h was          outside        the      c on ce r ti n a gates.       I saw at     the    rear of
it \J
   the amb ul an ce a male                    body    laid on the floor and a police                     officer with

  him and by his                   colour      he was         in a bad way or dead.              I w al k ed    past    the

  ambulance            t h ro ug h the         c oncertina g ates and there                  saw a large        number

  of    people,          a lot        of which were             laid on the floor            there were        other

   people      next       to the         people       some      giving       first aid others        crying some

  shouting            for help.

   I ran to the            near es t          person on the            floor who was a l re a d y        being    tended

  to by anot h e r male.                      He   had a pulse          but had been sick and was                of a

   poor    c ol o ur .a nd          in a bad way.               We    im me di at el y were    joined     by an

  a m b ul a n c e man who             had a res us ci ta to r           w hi ch he       placed on the man and

  we then w ith others                    carried the man               to the a mbulance         by the       gates.

  After      he was        placed         in the a m bu la nc e           I returned back t h r o u g h the gate

            .and        went    to the        next     person     I found who was just about                       conscious.              I

                placed.him           in the     recovery         position and a sked the two                      lads    next       to

                there was         no    pulse,, ^t all         and his f riend covered him up.

                there who had been sick and all                             that    came up was           pure alcohol.             There

                w ere    people        crying,        shouting       in anger and all               this time        I still         was

                not aware         of What       had gone         on.        But as the          comments made           to me went

                on like        "Why did you o pen the gates,                        you bastards are              r esponsible            for

                without        having        their     ticket     taken from them.                  One    of the       last    I

                went/around            the    large     numbers        of    people who were              still    in this area

                cKc&k'ing to see              if anyone        was     still       in need of medical              attention,             and

        At 8 am on Saturday 15th April 1 9 8 9 , I came on duty at Adwick police station,
        we were then taken by force coach to DHQ. We then travelled by transit van in
        our serial, which was serial 3 2 .
        Once at the Hillsborough ground we were paraded and the match detail was outlined.
        The serial was split into pairs and I partnered PC 3110 EDWARDS to our particular
        point which was on Penistone Road near to Claywheels Lane, the rest of the serial
        weree deployed above us at various points upto The Gate, public house.
        Our direct soupervisory officer was AP/S THOMAS, and our inspector was Insp MILLETT
        part of our duties were to supervise Liverpool supporters coming from the coach
        park and the train station.
        We commenced these duties around 11.20aai.
        There was a steady flow of people towards the ground all in q good mood, and I was
        approached by a number of teenagers and older people and the main questions
        asked were "WHERES THE NEAREST PUB THATS OPEN” and 11 WHERES THE NEAREST TOILET"


        Around 12.15pm I was told by Inspector Millett to attend further along Penistone
        Road, and position ourselves at the first junctin beyond the rounabout which I belive
        is part of Claywheels Lane. This was the junction the Liverpool coaches were to
        take, to park along Claywheels Lane itself.
        Pc EDWARDS and myself were then making sure that the coaches took this junction.
        From this time the number of supporters on foot grew steadily, as did the
        numer of cars and vans containing supporters.
        The general demeanour of the crowd was good and fairly well behaved, the younger
        element were shouting and chanting there were a good number of people walking
        into the road as the crowds grew. I saw large numbers of people who had obviously
        been drinking, there faces were flushed there eyes somewhat bleary, large numbers
        were carrying 2,4 and even more cans of beer or lager.
        Numbers seadily grew until I noticed the train afrive over the bridge further
        up the road and about fifteen minutes later there was a large surge of supporters
        which were escorted by the mounted branch. Again general behaviour was good
        but large numbers were carrying cans of beer.
        The supporters were on both sides of the dual carraigeway down the central
        reservation and on the road singing and chanting. I was contiually asked for
        the nearest pubs and toilets and by now it was around 2 .20 pm.
        All the time there were people walking against the flow of the main body of
        supporters asking for spare tickets, "ANY SPARE MATE".
        Around 2.40pm A/PS THOMAS came up to me and said that it sounded as if there was
        fighting in the ground, according to the radio messages. He remained with us on
        the point and I remember seeing the last coach go up Penistone Road around 2.^5pm
        These coaches were now being parked on the main road near to the railway bridge
        as Claywheels Lane was full and had been for about 15 minutes. Shortly after
        PS THOMAS said that it sounded on the radio as if the fans were trying to rip
                                 ,

dovm a gate at the ground .
At 3pra we left our point with other members of our serialto return to Leppings
Lane, as we had been briefed, to await our meal break.
As we walked back we mixed with other serials who were also returning to Leppings
Lane. Once at the entrance I saw other officers including members of the mounted
branch and a small crowd of people some of whom were waving there tickets stil
intent on getting in to see the game.
It was quite apparent to me at this stage that something had happened inside the
ground although I was not aware exactly what.
The officers present were told to for® a cordon which we did. This was across
the entrance to the Leppings Lane entrance to stop anyone approaching any further.
At this time an ambulance arrived the cordon parted and allowed it through.
I then saw someone beckon us towards wh ere the ambulance was now parked, which
was outside the concertina gates. I saw at the rear of the ambulance a male
body laid on the floor and a police officer with him and by his colour he sras
in a bad way or dead. I walked past the ambulance through the concertina gates
and there saw a large number of people, a lot of which were laid on the floor
there were other people next to the poeple some giving first aid others ccyying
some shouting for help.
I ran to the nearest person on the floor who was already being tended to by
another male. He had a pulse but had been sick was of a poor colour and in a
bad wa|r. We immeidiately were joined by an ambulance man who had a resuscitator
which he placed on the man and we then with others carried the man to the
ambulance by the gates. After he was placed in the ambulance I returned back
through the gate and went to the next person I found who was just about concious
I placed him in the recovery position and asked the two   lads next to   himto
keep an eye on him as I tended to the next man who was dead there   was nopulse
at all and his friend covered him up.
The next part is all a bit of a blur really picking people up carrying them
to outside the gates where it appeared other officers were segregating the
people into different groups, dead, badly injured and those that could wait
There were a lot of people in there who had been sick an dall that came up
was pure alcohol, there were people crying, shouting in anger and aall this
time I still was not aware of ahat had gone on. But as the comments made to me
went on like "WHY DID YOU OPEN THE GATES”, YOU BASTARDS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
YOUR’RE MURDERING BASTARDS" and the like, it became apparent that had been soma form of surge
through the turnstyles and the gates.- 1 was told by some that stewards had
been letting people over the tumstyles for a price and    that lots of   people
just surged past without having there ticket taken from   them. One of   thelast
I helped carry out was a man who had back and chest injuries. We then went around
the large numbers of people who were still in this area checking to see if
anyone was stil in need of medicalattention, and then as the crowds were

    dispersing from the area directly above the incident I was one of a number
    of officers deployed in a cordon, directing the crowd away from the concertina
    gates, where the ambulances and injured were, towards the other gate into Leppings
    Lane. I don't know how long I was stood there for, but it seemed like forever
    as supporters left, blaming us for the incident making remarks as mentioned
    earlier and "I SEE YOU'VI GOT THE GATES SHUT NOW IT'S TOO LATE" but the
    majority of remarks passed were to the effect" I HOPE ME DON’T GET THE BLAME
    FOR THIS ONE AS WELL", other remarks were made in a similar vien and some
    commented on the good job we8d done and enquiring about the number of dead
    and injured.
    Most people were clearly upset and at that time needed someone to blame
    and we were the nearest target.
    When all the fans had cleared the area we were de ployed outside the
    Leppings Lane entrance for a short time before being stood down to the North
    stand to await instuctions. This was h ortly before 5p®
    I do remember quite a surge of fans shortly before 2.^5pm people running
    towards the ground cutting across the dual carraigeway and onto the roundabout
    cutting across and through the vehicles virtually halting traffic, and there
    were still people asking for tickets coming the opposite way until shortly
    before this

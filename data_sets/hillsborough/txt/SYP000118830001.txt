identified            and     being       unable         to    produce         a ticket         or      stub,      had    to    be

manhandled            and     forcibly          ejected         outside         through gate                '8’.      This      is a

usu a l    practice           at    m a t c h e s » as        fans      waiting        to e n t e r      through

At    about        S . 43    p.m.    the     situation            inside        and     outside          got w o r s e .        As

their      numbers           increased          the      situation            became      electric.             Crushing            was

occurring           outside.           Numerous           f a n s , male        and     female          with    children,

young      and      elderly,         were       complaining              about        being     crushed         outside.            Many

were      in a d i s t r e s s e d        state,         sweating,            breathless           and      pale    in    colour?

s om e    rubbing           their    c he s ts .         There       were      too     many     to      deal    with

individuals.                 Many    pleading            to    help      the    people        outside.

             determined            to    gain       access       into      this       ground         by a n y m e a n s         available             and

             no a m o u n t       of P o l i c e     Officers          wr e     going       to     stop      them.        Numerous           were

             under      the       influence          of    alcohol         to    th e      extent          they    behaved           like

             hooligans            a n d we re       uncontrollable.

             From     what        I witnessed             inside       the      terraced           end      of    the W e s t        Stand,       I

             can    only         visualise          as    mass      hysteria.              I am      positive          t h at      many     of

             these      fans       were       not    aware       of    being         trampled,             crushed       or     killed,          OR    if

             aware,         did    not    care.           Perhaps        on     reflection             they       became        animals,

             fighting            for    survival          in the       heavy         atmosphere             being      created         by b o d y

             heat.          It    is w o r t h y     of    n ot e     that      this was           the      only area           of    the    ground

             where      the       sun w as      shining           into.

             Being      on d u t y       in    the       inside       of L e p p i n g s        L a n e,    seeing       and       hearing        the

             mass     of     the       crowd    outside.              I agree         infull         with        the   actions         taken          by

             Superintendent               Marshall.               I saw        the    state        and      pleading          of     supporters

             entering            the    ground.           I am      certain          if    these       gates       had    not        been

             o pe n e d ,    many would             have       died    outside            the     turnstiles.             1 myself           became

             very     apprehensive              for       my    sa f e t y ,    shortly after                H . 45    p.m.

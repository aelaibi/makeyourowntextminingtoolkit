Dear Mr. Dorries,

Re: Tony Bland - Hillsborough Disaster

Thank you for your letter of yesterday’s date. I entirely agree with the course which we
discussed on the telephone. I have in fact sent a message through my officer to Tony
Bland’s parents that I would welcome a meeting, even at this stage, to discuss the present
position and they seem to have welcomed this. I will let you know the outcome.

I will certainly make it plain in due course that your involvement was peripheral but that,
in order to be absolutely correct, you have felt, and I have agreed, that it would be
inappropriate for you to conduct the inquest.

I look forward to contact after your holiday and the planned lunch.

Yours sincerely,



J. A. Turnbull

          Dear Mr Turnbull

         HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
         TONY BLAND ____ .____

         I refer to our telephone c o n versa tion on Friday m o r n i n g and am w r i t i n g to
         thank y ou for agreeing to deal w i t h the Inquest w h i c h w i l l have to follow the
         death of this youn g man.

         As I indicated to you over the telephone I had some involvement on the day of
         the disaster (primarily the care of relatives) through my w o r k for a
         v o l u n t a r y agency. I was subsequently involved in bo th Lord Justice T a y l o r ’s
         enquiry and the Inquest giving advice to a M e d i c a l Defence Union.    A l t hough
         my role was fairly peripheral, I am sure it should still be regarded as a bar
         to me h e a ring any further Inquest relating to the disaster.

         I must confess that even dealing w i t h the requests from relatives for copies
         of statements gave me pause for thought, but I took the v i e w that there was a
         con siderable difference in the administrative m a t t e r of dealing w i t h
         pap erwor k (which has to be in my possession) and any form of norm al judicial
         fun ction such as an Inquest.          I have even discussed this w i t h Gillian
         H a r r i s o n at the Home Office w h o agreed that there w o u l d be no conflict of
         interest p r o vided I was not m a k i n g decisions about statements of former
         clients.

         Nonetheless, I am a little cautious about the choice of w o r d i n g that might be
         used in any explan a t i o n given publicly as one is aware that c e r tain people
         are very ready to take things out of context.            It may w e l l be that everyone
         w i l l regard it as perf ectly n a tur al that you deal w i t h the case but if an
         exp lan a t i o n is requested I w o u l d be grateful if you could make it quite plain
         that my previous involvement at H i llsb orough was purely peripheral.

         Very m a n y thanks for yo ur assistance.    W h e n I return from h o liday at the end
         of September I w i l l telephone you w i t h a v i e w to lunch one day.

         Yours         sincerely

Dear

Thank you for your letter of 17th December, received today, with its enclosures, which I am
sure I shall find very interesting and informative. I am contemplating proceeding with a
similar exercise here and will let you know whether we have similar responses.

Further to our recent conversation concerning the Hillsborough case, I shall be glad if you
will let me have a transcript in due course together with, if you have it, a copy of the Taylor
Report and details of the senior police officer who conducted the investigation.

Yours sincerely,

              Hillsborough Inquest

              Further to our conve r s a t i o n before Christmas I am just w r i t i n g to let you
              have a note of the telephone numbers of the police officers mo st closely
              c o n n ec ted w i t h the H i l ls boroug h Inquest.

              M e r v y n Jones was an ACC in West Midlands and is n o w the D e puty Chief
              Constable in Cheshire.       His n umber is 0244-350000 ext 2091.

             Det ectiv e Inspec tor Caroline Perkins is still at West Midlands, she seems to
             have played a fairly central role in adminis trati ve terms.           I have spoken
             w i t h her, she does not have any papers left in the West Midlands at all and
             always un ders t o o d that the South Yorkshire Police w o u l d deal w i t h enquiries
             into any deaths subsequent to the m a i n Inquest.     I am not at all sure that
             that is a good idea in p olitical terms but that is o bviously a m a t t e r for you
             and R i char d Wells.    Detective I nspector Perkins is m a k i n g enquiries to see if
             a summary was ever prepared, she was aware of this being discussed at one
             stage but thinks that it never actually happened.        Her telephone n u m b e r is
             021-359-3576 and she is expecting to hear from you in due course.

              Chief Sup erintendent Brian Mole is in charge of the Complaints and Discipline
              office in the South Yor kshire Police.       His direct line is 0742-523850.      The
              switchboard is 500700.        Mr Mole has a close personal k nowledge of the
              H i l ls boroug h Incident, he was Divis ional Co mmander for that area until about
              3 week s before the disaster.       His office n o w holds all the relevant papers
              and I w o u l d commend h i m to you as an exceedi ngly sensible individual w i t h an
              open and straight forward attitude to his work.

             I am m a k i n g arrangements for a transcript and a copy of the Taylor report to
             be made available and w i l l bring these up to you m y s e l f early in the N e w
             Year.

Whilst w r i t i n g I might just m e n t i o n that Dr R oger Start (the author of the
questionnaire on h o s pital doctors) has submitted an article to the BMJ and
also to the Britis h Journal of H ospital Medicine.             Both have been a ccepted
and the latter p ubli c a t i o n has in fact asked h i m to expand the article
quotin g from the questions involved and setting out guidelines on reporting
deaths.    Rog er is m i n d e d to use the list that I have prepared, I w o n d e r if
you have any comments on that?

Re: Hillsborough Inquest

Thank you very much for your letter of 29th December, which I have received today, and
for all the very full and useful information which it contains. I will get in touch with the
personnel you have referred to and I look forward to having a transcript and a copy of the
Taylor report in due course.

I note what you say about Dr. Start’s questionnaire. I will come back to you with any
comments on your list if I may. I have invited the observations of my Coroner’s Officers.
I do not expect that any material alteration will be suggested either by them or by myself.

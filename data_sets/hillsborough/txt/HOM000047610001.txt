              Dear Sir


              You will b e aware that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith met with a number o f families during his
              visit to Liverpool last week. In som e o f those meetings he asked whether the families had
              received a com plete body file from South Yorkshire Police. In the following cases I w as
              unable to state categorically that a full body file had been released and undertook to clarify this
              with yourself:-

              Paul Carlile;
              Michael Kelly;
              Philip Hammond;
              Kevin and Christopher Traynor

              In all o f the above cases som e information has been released to families in the past. On this
              basis, only a limited amount o f information w as supplied to m yself as you assured me that this
              comprised the remainder o f the body-file. H owever, at individual meetings with Lord Justice
              Stuart-Smith families o f the above named deceased identified gaps in the evidence provided so
              far. In order that I might comply with my undertaking to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith I should
              be grateful if you w ould provide me with a copy o f the complete body file.

               I thank you for your assistance.


               Yours faithfully

RE: MICHAEL KELLY

I refer to your letter dated 15 October 1997 regarding the meeting of Hillsborough Families with
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and whether a full copy of the body file relating to the above named
had been released to relatives.

As recently as 15 September 1997, at the request of Mrs J M Sinclair, sister of Michael Kelly, I
forwarded a full and complete copy of his file to yourself. Subsequently a telephone call was
received at this office from Mrs Sinclair, claiming that the statement of an off duty Merseyside
Police Constable called Evans was "missing" from the file. This was not the case, as the
statement had never been part of the file. Nevertheless, we searched our data base, traced the
statement made by Police Constable Evans and on 8 October 1997, I wrote to him seeking his
written authority to release his statement to Mrs Sinclair. On 10 October 1997 I wrote to Mrs
Sinclair, advising her of her error regarding the statement of Police Constable Evans being
missing and that I was seeking his authority to release it.

In consequence of your letter I have today taken the unusual step of telephoning Police
Constable Evans and subject to an assurance that his home address will not be disclosed, he will
send me written authority to release his statement, which I will then forward to Mrs Sinclair.

RE: PHILIP HAMMOND

I refer to your letter of 15 October 1997 regarding the meeting of Hillsborough Families with
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and whether a full copy of the body file of the above named had been
released to relatives.

Our correspondence with Mr Hammond dates back to 8 May 1992. Having carried out a detailed
review of the file I note that some statements were provided by the Coroner and some by
ourselves. Whilst I can be certain that Mr Hammond has received copies of all the charts, plans
and photographs within the file, I cannot express the same certainty in respect of all the
statements. I am therefore going to take the opportunity of forwarding a copy of all the
statements to Mr Hammond, as I do not have written authority from him to release documentation
to yourself.

RE: KEVIN & CHRISTOPHER TRAYNOR

I refer to your letter of 15 October 1997 regarding the meeting of Hillsborough Families with
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and whether full copies of the body files relating to the above named
persons had been released to relatives.

We have a considerable amount of correspondence with Mrs J Traynor, which dates back to
12 June 1992. She has in fact been provided with copy documentation on seven different
occasions, which has not only encompassed all the documentation from both body files, but
additional material as well. This was confirmed in writing to yourself by one of my colleagues on
1 September 1997.

 Both yourself and Mrs Traynor have requested that we release the statement of a Mr Langley
 that does not form part of either body file. Can I here remind you that your initial request of
 12 August 1997 for this statement gave no indication that you were seeking the statement on
 behalf of Mrs Traynor and that the statement reference number you supplied related to a
 statement made by PC Langley of South Yorkshire Police. I wrote to him, obtained his written
 permission to release his statement and forwarded it to yourself on 19 September last. On
 30 September we received a telephone call from Mrs Traynor indicating that it was the statement
 of Norman Langley, a coach driver that she was requesting. I wrote to Norman Langley on
 6 October 1997 requesting his permission to release his statement to Mrs Traynor. To date, I
 have not received a reply. This is the only outstanding request we have in respect of
 Mrs Traynor.

RE: PAUL CARLILE

I refer to your letter dated 15 October 1997 regarding the meeting of Hillsborough Families with
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and whether a full copy of the body file of the above named had been

We have a considerable amount of correspondence with Mrs S Stringer, mother of Paul Carlile,
which dates back to 11 June 1991 and with Ms Donna Carlile, Paul's sister, dating back to
17 September 1991. I have carried out a detailed review of the files and whilst I can be certain
that Mrs Stringer has received copies of all the charts, plan and photographs within the file, I
cannot express the same certainty in respect of all the statements, as some may have been
forwarded to her and some to Ms Donna Carlile. I am therefore taking the opportunity to forward
you a copy of all the statements contained within the file.

     apologies ot the rn lr.n a n . Mv. i». £ . Mc^oe. .Mr. Whitehead stressed that the
      Club wishod to fee the Staiil-i*-, . ->*d icr bie matches as regularly as possible•

2.   For the Coupty ‘:uur- i ,   was cr.i; i r .-:i^oJ that the aim of tne meeting was purely
     exploratory so that jny posa\Uc j^ n t h o' mis’moer standing could hopefully be
     cleaied iiefcro the otr.:Hl prc-ct-- begen.

      During the c o u r ^ o< i>.:- ais'.u.3>o:i ta« Allowing points were maoe:-

      (a>     the Stadium had been a^ec! for many capacity matches over the years and
              Its saf«**y rr^crd ".as the eq jfl of a ay ir the country;

      <b>     il tne Code of Practice \c r e to be applied literally, then there would
              probably be minor cUsc rep ancles such as In the width of the steps on the
              Spton Kop and in the width of the gangways and exits in the Stands;


                                                        1.
                                                        32
                                                         -




     (c)    in order u             a base from v.!iit,h to work, all oi the crush barriers
            would requ;      i.„   be tested initially, with up to 209/ tested annually
            the reafter;

     (d)    it w ss likely that the fire risk in the North and West stands would be
            minimal, hut the main stand would probably require more detailed
            attention; however, only a detailed inspection t y the Fire Service would
            reveal the true position;

     (e)    the police *’'.'!iid be happy with the existing position of the Police Control
            Centre, but felt the present structure would not meet tbeir requirements;

     (f)    the North and West Stands were modern structures, but the main stand
            had originally been built some 50 years ago and there were now no
            records, which would mean that a complete aurvey of this would be
            necessary;

     (g)   the only autNuy which normally took place at the Stadium other than
            football was the Annual Jehovah1* Witness Rally, and an endeavour would
            be mad?' to make provision for this in the General Safety Certificate so as
            to obviate the v*?ed for the Special Safety Certificate procedure;

     (h)    10 avo 10        ^ complication should a change of Club Secretary occur,
            the C*nitU‘0..fi *Qxild be l »\ be purre oi the Club with a sominated person
            being r»cti*i*a In writing tc the County Council:

     (i)   as regards tbe draft General Safety Certlflcate:-

            (a'i   th* definition of "Holder” would need to be imended,

            (b)    to              3 of Part 2 would need the words "of medicine’ adding
                   a f t * ’' tije w ord ‘'liootcv*1,

            {c'i   paragraph 12(3) ol Part 2 would need amending by deleting tbe
                   firs*. i'n« aad substituting the words "Qtthe day of a Specified
                   Activity *u5fl not le s s than three hours prior to its commencement
                   th *\

            (d)    the «i» i ‘varnlng system referred to in paragraph 13(1) of Part 2
                    would he the subject ol consultation between the Chief Fire Officer
                    anj t t.'r Club.

     0)     the County Council would require the detailed information and plans referred
            to lb the concluding paragraph of the letter dated i3th September, 1976 from
            the Chief Exeotfive to the Club before any formal progress could be made on
            the application.

4.   At the invitation of the Club, tbe Working Party took tbe opportunity of carrying out
     an informal inspection of the Stadium in company with the Club's representatives.

 1»       Purpo se of Mee t ing

Following the Working Party’s meeting with the representatives of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 13th December, 1978 the
Secretary of the Club had (by letter dated 22nd January, 1979) circulated a
Beporl, together with Plans, drawn up by Dr. W, Eastwood of Eastwood
and Partners* The Secretary had also suggested a meeting on Friday,
16th February, 1979, to discuss the documents.

The purpose of today's meeting was to consider the views which the Working
Party should put to the Club on the 16th February*

2.       Plans

(a)    Whilst the "Notes for the Guidance of Applicants'1 stated that detailed
plans at 1:1 0 0 scale should be supplied of all buildiogs and other accommodation
for ^ ecta to rs, some of the plans supplied were to i«200 scale. The Fire
Service f«lt that the latter size were acceptable provided ail of the plans were
to the same scale, and it was AGREED that the "Notes for the Guidance of
Applicants" should be amended to read plans to 1;200 scale*

 <b)   The site plan at 1:500 scale had not been supplied as required by the
Notes, but Eastwood and Partners had undertaken to prepare this in time for
FYUfey's meeting, The firm had also promised that ali site fixtures would be
lodicated on that plan*

                                                        1*




                                                                       DOCUMENT No. ij- ?
(c)     It \vas AGS TED that tVw oU»n* supplied h-J inaccuracies and
Inadequacies. In p^rticul^r. they lacked indications of rro.'S sections,
profiles, structural stabilicv, position of haadvatis aud balustrades, width
of stairways, etc* Where appropriate, thes^ could, a s an alternative» bo
described Id a Report*

(d>    The County Council’s hope w*is that, in view of limited resources in
the Architectural & Building ServicesBivisJon, the plans supplied and finally
accepted by the Working Party could fo r a the basis of the Certificate
Drawings,

3*       Report

(a)      General

It was recognised that thecriteria set out In the Home Office "Guide t o
Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)'1 required new work or reconstruction
to be to a standard uot lower than the standard set out in tbe Guide, and that
in existing situations the criterion was that ot a reasonable degree of safety.
A s tbe Guide stated, it would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable,
to seek tbe absolute safety of everyone attending a ground.

 With these factors in mind, both tbe Fire Service and the Police felt that
  tbe flow of spectators was the most important criteria to be adopted.
 Whilst not disagreeing with this viewpoint, the Building A uthority suggested
 It would be useful to know the reasoning behind the recommendation In the
  Guide that gangways should not be leas than 1.1 m etres wide. The County
  Council AGREED to try to find this information out, and the Firs Service
 AGREED they would contact their colleagues in o tte r areas who had been
  Involved in the Certification process to ascertain how nearly the l » l metre
  gangway recommendation had been observed In existing situations In their
. respective areas.

 At the request of the Fire Service, the County Council also AGREED to try
 and find out If there was any general recommendation on reduced
 admission if a ground were used at a night time Instead of during tbe <ky
 time.

 <b) *    Front Covftr

 Whilst it w as probably a typing mistake, It was AGREED that the wording
 on the Front Cover should read ,!REPORT TO SOUTH YORKSHIRE CCOTTY
 COUNCIL" and not "REPOST OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL".



                                   - 2 -
The Working Party agreed with the Club's view that, with the existing three
e x it s , there was no way that the recom m ended discharge time of 8 minutes
could be m et. Where they d isagreed was that an evacuation time of I l f
minutes should be regarded as acceptable. If no m ore ex its w ere to be
provided, the Working Party AGREED that a crowd limitation of 1 1,0 4 0
on the Spion Kop should be imposed.

The existing ex it at the North end p a ssed under a bridge with a headroom
below agreed by the Club to be l e s s than the recom m ended value of 8ft.
A s this w a s in fact som e 6’6", the Working Party AGREED that the Club
be informed that in their view it is e s s e n tia l that the floor be lowered to
rem ove this danger to sp ecta tors.

The exit at the South side would a ls o require widening, and p o ssib ly flow
b a r r ie r s would need installing.

The a rea at the back of the Kop would also require c lo se attention.

If new ex its w ere to be provided by the Club, it w as AGREED that at lea st
TWO would be required. The m o s t econom ical way o f providing one would
be to u se the ga tes in the existing b a rrier, provided these w ere lined up with
the gangways, with discharge onto the pitch surround, and the other would
require to be a com pletely new exit.

The Building Authority felt that the majority of the crush b a r r ie r s would fail
the t e s t s , and consequently any n e c e s s a r y r e - s it in g would probably not be
too much of a problem . Certainly the suggested additional b a r r ie r s would
require careful consideration.

For the purp oses of crowd control, the P o lic e suggested there should be some
form of lateral separation. The Working Party AGREED, and it was suggested
that three m etal fen ces sited centrally in the blocks (as opposed to adjacent
to the gangways) should be provided, with a c c e s s between each lim ited to a
padlocked gateway under the control of the P o lic e .

A s recen t a d verse weather conditions had proved, ice and snow on the K i
could cau se p ro b lem s, and it was AGREED that Paragraph 11 (4) of the draft
C ertificate should be amended so a s to require the Club to take steps to
c le a r the Kop of ice and snow before a gam e was played.

The Building Authority pointed out that information w as s till required from
the Club on profile and step dim ensions and the slope of the Kop.
                                                              GO


(d)                    The West T er r a c e   ''pages 4&5)

to view o f the lack of depth of tUU t e r r a c e , the Club's offer to reduce the
spectator lim it to 7 , 2 0 0 , and the discharge tim e of G. o m l"u t e s ; ‘
Working Party A G R E E D that it woula be unreasonable
gangways or additional e x its m ust be provided.

H owever, even if the existing crush b a r r ie r s w ere to p a s s the t e s t s , the
Working Party AGREED that the b a r r ie r s would require sp ecial attention
in view of the apparant sharp ed g es, c o rr o sio n , etc.

 (e)                   The North W est Corner Reinforced Concrete T er ra ce       (pages 5 & 6)

 The Working Party AGREED there w ere no rea l p rob lem s h e r e , but the
 Building Authority pointed out that a s w ell a s the crush b a r r ie r s , t e
 e    x   corrugated sheeting would require to p a s s the appropriate t e s t s .
           i s t i n   g




     (f)                   The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

 Whilst the flow r a te s and discharge tim e s w ere probably sa tisfactory (the
 construction and width o i the ram p s being such that               q u itep r• p
 be regarded as elevated roadways), the fact rem ained that the gang*,:ays i
 the North Stand w ere only 640mm wide for much of their lengtn, com pared
     with the recom m ended width of 1 .1 m e t r e s .

     Additionally, ob servation s had shown that tw o-thirds of the sp ectators u sed
     A d d itio n a l ,          rem ainder used the lower exit. An ideal would be
      to^rov^deTdditional ex its at the top of the stand but, in view of its can tilever
      construction, the co st would be prohibitive.

      A s an a ltern ativ e, the Working Party AGREED that consideration might be
      given to removing                                                ^he^s'tand'be'low^he U(^)er

          exU ^to^ensure m i r e equal u se o f both upper and lower e x it s bybs Pe c ^ * ° r s -
          H this would cau se difficulties, a b a rrier in the gangways only below             uppe   w
          e x its m ight be considered.

          So far a s the Wire Mesh b a r r ie r s under the stand w ere concerned the
          Working Party AGREED that these m ust either be rem oved or ma e o
          perm anent construction.

           (g)              The W est Stand

          W hilst the ex its w ere adequate and w ell spaced       a n d  discharge tim es
                                                                           t h e


          w e r e acceptable in v ie w o f the type o£ stand, the F ir e S erv ice felt that
                                                        -4 -
the means of escape were not adequate as the only moans of eg re* s n n
by way of two staircases. The Working Party AGKEED chal ;t * a s essential
that another staircase be provfctecf, and on«-cn tte south-west corner was f*ll
to be the roost acceptable.

(h)     The South Stand fcages 7 & 8)

So far as the seating arrangements were concerned, the Working party
felt that it was the front, open air part which caused the concern. Because
of the bad In gress/egress, the Working Party AGREED that two addit Iona,
exits would be required. It was suggested that the most economical way of
doing this was by means of one discharging at the Spion Kop end and the
other by breaking through the wall by the Tea Bar.

Additionally, the penning arrangements of the seating would need to be
looked at closely.

A s the balustrades and handrails were constructed of timber, the Building
Authority considered they would be likely to fall the appropriate tests.
A lso, as ll»e staircase was a 24 Instead of the maximum 12 riser recommended
in the Guide it was probable that this would have to be reconstructed.

Contrary to their Initial reaction, the Fire Service felt that, provided that the
necessary increased fire resistance measures were carried out, the stand
would not be the problem from a com bustability point of view that they had
anticipated.

 The Building Authority expressed concern a s to the corrosion of the steel
 work of the stand, and considered that this would require investigation.

 The Police expressed concern about the use of the car park behind the
 Stand. Persons entitled to use this car park frequently arrived just before
 the start of a match and drove through the spectators attempting to gain
 access to the ground. As they ieft immediately afterwards, the same tkng
 occurred at the end of a match. This practice had to be stopped, either by
 banning the use of the car park entirely on match days or Imposing some sort
 of time restriction on Its use before and after a match.

  (h)    General Requirements

  These were not discussed by the Working Party at this stage.

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975                                            26.3,79


I refer to my minute of 5th March, 1979, and to the recent telephone
conversations between Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff and Divisional Officer
K. Jones of your Fire Prevention Secfon.

Following the return from holiday of the Chairman of the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club Ltd., the Club Secretary Informed me that the 30th March,
1979 was not convenient. That meeting has, therefore, now been arranged
for 2.30 p.m. on Monday, 2nd April, 1979, after conferring with the members
of the Working Party.

However, because of evident differences of opinion on means of escape,
tiie original time and ia te of 1 0 .00 a .m . on 30th March, 1979 (but at
your Headquarters) is being retained to discuss these differences, prior
to meeting the Club.

 ______ Purpose of Meeting

Following the postponement of the meeting with the Club because of adverse
weather and the difficulty in agreeing a mutually convenient alter D ative
date, the purpose of the meeting was to review the position since 12th February,
1979, ptior to the re-arranged meeting with the Club which was now to take
place on 2nd April, 1979.

2.       Plans

The plans at 1:500 scale and Indicating all site fixtures were. It was still understood,
to be supplied by Eastwood & Partners at the meeting with the Ctuh.

3.       Report
(a)      General

The County"Council had contacted the Home Office, but had been given little
information additional to that contained in their various Circulars. Basically,
they had said that aay new work or reconstruction had to he to a standard not
lower than that se t erat in the Guide, However, the maximum flexibility* had
to he maintained In the case of existing structures and differences In such
m atters as age, size and mode of construction had to be taken into account.

The Fire Service had contacted four other Brigade/ with designated g r e e d s ,
and only in one case had the recommendations of t i e Guide been strictly
adhered to.

                                  1.
(b)      JglonjCoj^ (pages 2, 3 & 4>

Additional to tbe points mentioned on 12th February, 1979, concern was
expressed by the Building Authority as to the general maintenance of the Kop
a n d the loose and broken concrete at the bottom I q particular. I f attention
was not given to this. It was AGREED that It would be necessary to restrict
admission to the Kop, additfonai to tbe restriction to 11, $40 l£ the extra
exits are not provided*

On the question of exits, It was again AGREED that tt was essential to line
up the gates in the existing harrier with the gangways. Of the existing two
exits, concern was expressed as to the effect of the right-angled turn on
the embankment at the exit at the rear. After discussion, it was AGREED
that the best compromise was to leave things as they existed, provided
handrails are provided on the stairways, taking Into account the
desirability of maintaining a smooth flow.

The Fire Service queried the exact /orm of the lateral separation discussed
at the meeting on 12th February, 1979, as this would naturally have a
bearing on the means of escape recommendations. After discussion, It
was AGREED that the metal fences should not be of the climb-proof type,
that it was cot Intended that they should obstruct the gangways, and that
In consequence the padlocked gateway recommendation should be dropped.
However, it was AGBEED that it was still desirable to seek 3 x 2 central
barriers but, if the Club really resisted the suggestion, 2 x 2 could
reluctantly be conceded. The Building Authority stressed that whatevei
barriers were provided would have to p ass the appropriate strain tests.

The fact that the height of many of the existing crush barriers was below the
recommendation In the Guide, in some cases well below, was pointed out by the
Building Authority. The corrosion point mentioned at the last meeting was
also reiterated. It was AGREED that these points must be drawn to the
Club's attention, as must the condition of the Score Board Structure.

(c)      The West Terrace (pages 4 & 5)

As well as the condition of the crush barriers mentioned at the last meeting,
the Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places of the
terracing In small areas near to the stand. The cro ss-fa ll on the steps on
the north-west corner exit would s is o require attention as It tended to throw
people forward. The height of the crush barriers mentioned in regard to the
Spion Kop also applied. It was AGREED that all these points must be drawn
to the Club's attention.

*d)      The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 6)

Having now had the opportunity of having a closer look at the existing corrugated
sheeting, the Building Authority confirmed that it wcold require alteration to
m eet the requirements of the Cfcilde.

      confirmed as being a reasonable compromise to put to the Club.

     A s the asbestos sheets at the top of the stand were protected, the Building

      at the ends of the stands was not g la ss and s0 would noi shatter.

      (f)     The West SUnd (page 7)

     Consideration was given to the Building Authority's suggestion of lateral
     S                -He segregation or exits but, after discussion, ii was AGREED
     that the additional staircase agreed at the last meeting should be confirmed.
     So long as u was of 4-umt exit width, It was AGEEED it was not necessary
     to Ins s t ,t should be on the south-west corner. Such staircases could be
              *“* P,6g and- i£ not instaUed ia &e '-•^se season, it was
     AGREED that a £ reduction ic capacity would be n ecessary.

     (g>      The South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

    As mentioned at the Jast meeting, the penning arrangements of the seating
    sa d jh e numbers of seats in the rows caused problems. Bearing in *ind !he
    need for re as oca o.e ness and to zcske the situation better, it was AGREED
    that, even though not strictly in accordance with the Guide, that the Best
    compromise was to seek the removal of the existing barriers and their
    re-alignment, together with the widening of the gateways at the position
    of the wings.

    The Fire Service pointed out and It was AGEEED that Fire Resisting Doors
    would be required leading to the Directors* sealing, and i hour fire
    re sista n c e would be required for ail problem areas under the stand. TMs
    could be reduced to J hour If automatic detection equipment were to be
    installed.

    For their part, the Building Authority reiterated their concern as to the
    corrosion of the steelwork of the stand, and also pointed out the concrete
    spalling whioh was occurring. Again, the likelihood of the balustradhg,
    barriers and guardrails needing to be reinforced or replaced was mentioned.
    It was AGREED all wculd need to be given attention by the Club.

    (k>      .General Requirements (pages 8 L 9)

A s well a s the Fire Service pointing out that the present temporary
structures used for police and first-aid purposes would need removal
from a means of escape point of view if the capacity of the North Stand

with the Club the facilities they would require, Briefly, they envisaged
a permanent stru ctu re alm ost twice as U rge as the existing temporary
structure, and expected com muni cations, detention, toilet, parade room,
e t c ., facilities.

So far as First-Aid was concerned, the Sheffield Area Health Authority
had eoufirmed tlieir wiUingaess to provide advice o d Fjrst-w4id and
Medical Facilities, biitthe person nominated (Dr. H. Bailey - Specialist
in Community Medicine (Social Services)) was on holiday until
2nd April, 1979. He had been Invited to the meeting, with the Club on
2nd April, but it was recognised that possible practical difficulties might
prevent his doing so.

1.    Scope and Objectives of Discussions

Mr* H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were
ambitious and waated to make the Stadium the b est In Europe. Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely a s a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and it was hoped to expand this side of the Club’s activities. The Club’s
eventuai ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerstions*

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That, whilst Designating Orders did not specify time lim its for the issue of
General Safety Certificates, it was essential to aim for the Certificate to be issued
by the start of the 1979/80 Season.

be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.

3      That s s much work a s possible should be carried out <n the clo se M m ,
bearing In mind that because of the recent contlmioue spell of bad weather, this

also tobe borne In mind.

P aras. 2 & 2 - Revised cop ies o f drawing no. 1610/DC were circulated at the meeting
showing the proposed new crush barrier layout, including the two lines o / radial
b a rriers. This was AGREED in principle.

Para. 3 - A 16.550 crow d capacity on the Kop a s existing would mean an unacceptable
evacuation time of some 1 2 j minutes. Larger and re-aligned gates in the barrier
and Improvement of the existing upper exit could reduce this time to som e 10 minutes,
but 8 minutes could only be achieved by Installing a new exit of 3 metre overall width.
This could be integrated into the proposed future scheme for enlarging and roofing the
Kop, The Club AGBEED to give consideration to the proposals.

structure should be looked at. » ® a s AGREED that the question of the height of some
o l the crush b arriers be considered again after It was se e n which of them ftlfed on
testing.
para 7 - The Club str e sse d that their proposals for the improvement of the means of
e g r e s s would hopefuiiy be carried out in the shorter rather than the longer term future.

Para. 8 - Tbe Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush barriers, together w itt
the Installation of the new crush barrier layout and alteration of the gates m the existing

surrounding area. On the e a st sid e , consideration was given to an extension of the
footway at the front of the stand a a i the removal of the wall, provided the new exit was
Isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGBEED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service

With regard to future meetings 1 thick it is essential that all matters agreed
he recorded, as we are now approaching finality in many areas and it is necessary
that we have recorded exactly the agreed matters*

I would also suggest that in view of the spproseh of certification it would,
perhaps, he advisable to hold future meetings away from the ground, and that
Hr. Vaughan, as the coordinator, ehould chair such meetings.

Yours faithfully,________________

     Waiting Ares could be arranged within corridor space to minimise
 the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

 T3TAT>'t£t7T AP.5A

The Treatment Area tiiould be sufficient to accommodate two or three
patien.e at any one time and consideration should be given to the
needs for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that
the three patients may well be lying on couches.

LlCKTTfTO

Coed lighting is esser.tial nrd at the present time strip liphtiji^
is very much in vogue and would be satisfactory* The provision of
a power point would also appear to be a basic requirement.
WATER

A supply of hot and cold water is eessntialf the cold water suitabls
for drinking* It would also appear reasonable to request provision
of a h*nd baein and a Urge Beifast type sink. The Club should
consider whether it would be cheaper in the long run to provide
stainless steel basins which are not subject to chipping.

TOltET B m n R S V S M T S

The Chib should provide at least one tnale and one female toilet, for
the use of the public and should eonsider whether they should provide
an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

STORAGS

Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and                                 for two sets
of wheels for stretchers, blankets snd other bed linen.                                 This storage
should be lockable.

EQUIPKEKT

The following is a minimum list to provide a basie service.

Treatment couches with lift up ends* two or three in number depending
on space available and/or number of cubicles, if the accomodation is
cubicledo

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sporta Grounds Act 1975

I have now received the detailed comments of a U of the disciplined

These have been collated Into tbe attached schedule which, together with
plans i confirm formaUy In writing the matters dfacuesed by the Working
Party with tbe Club over the series of meetings held so tar and which
the County Council feel require attention so as to secure reasonable
safety a t the Ground.

They are, of course, Indlvidua teequlrsm eata on spedOc mattere and are
additions IJto tbe generai requirements set out in tbe epecimen form of
General Safety Certificate forwarded to the Club with tny letter of
6th December, 1078, and discussed a t tbe meeting held oa 23th Ifecember*

After the Clu£ has had the opportunity of considering tbe schedule, perhaps
you would let me t a w whlcb o ! tbe requirements you feel wiii be able to
be carried out in the close season.

Should you have any queries, Mr, D. Vaughan of my staff (ext. 422) would

I.      Purpose of Meeting

The original Intention of the visit had been to check that the outstanding matters
referred to in the Note of the meeting heid on 12th November had been oompleted
or were in the course of completion prior to the anticipated Issue of the Certificate
 by the County Council this week.

 2,     Minor Matters

A n inspection of the ground ehowed that a number of minor matters still required
attention, but tha Club undertook to ensure that these were attended to In the a xt '
 few days.

 3.     Major Matters

 A,     Emergency Lighting - South Stand

 The meetings *tolch had taken place between the County Fire Service and Messrs.
 Eastwood and Partners since 12th November on tbe South Stand Emergency Lighting
 had produced agreement on an Interim arrangemea which would be regarded as



                                              0      0
acceptable for the duration of tbe existing battery life. Further modifications at
that time would remedy the shortcomings of the existfog InsteUatfcn, Details were
contained la the letter dated 12th December which Messrs, Eastwood and Pwtners
had addressed to the Fire Service,
     /

B.       South Stand Construction

Tbe Building Authority expressed concern as to what they saw as a lack of structural
Integrity In the South Stand, In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
progressive deterioration of the Stand which. It was felt, could only be properly
determined by a full structural survey. The report forwarded by Messrs, Eastwood
and Partners in the last week was act considered to be aifficlentiy comprehensive
to provide tte required Information, sod the basis of calculation used caild not be
agreed as appropriate* Whilst It was agreed thet there had not been a specific             (
written request for such a full structural survey of tha South Stand, the Building
Authority felt thet It had been Inherent In the detailed dlscueslons which had taken
place that such a report would be forthcoming. The Building Authority were
concerned at the possibility thet the requirements of the Building Regulations and
the Code of Practice Safety Factors could not be met? In particular the Structural
 stability of the South Stand In ooadlttoas of gale force winds and heavy snowfall
was mentioned.

 For the Club, Dr, Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obvlonsly not be fcullt to the
 same specification or the sac© construction standards nowadays, hit pointed out
 that, for Inst® ce, none of the tulldlngs In Sheffield built before 1*70 could meet
 the latest wind pressure requirements. Even the Building Research Station was \
 evidently thinking In terms that these requirements were unreallstically hlgb. In
 his professional opinion, the Staisd was structural safe aad able in practice to meet
 the loadings demanded. In any case, the conditions which had been described as
 being possibly dangerous would meaa In practice that a match could not be played
 and consequently no spectatore would be present*

 Experience of the corrosion of todoors steeJ in to She/fleJd area showed this to be
 minimal, and the Staad was regularly test loaded by spectators. Structures such
 as this would show obvious external signs, such as cracks, well before th « e was
 any possibility of collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
 visual inspection. Even though he did not consider It essential, plating of the
 treat steel columns had been carried out as a compromise to try and meet the
 Building Authority’s concern. He agresd there might well be a continuing
 maintenance problem with tte Stand, but this wae a different matter to saying there
 was a structural problem. Reference was made to the Guide’s advice that when
 aseesslng whether existing situations provided sdequately for the safety of spectators,
 the criterion to be used Is thet of a reasonable degree of eafety, in Dr, Eastwood’s
 view. It would be unreasonable and unnecessary to Insist on a full structural survey
 of the South Stand or to delay the Issue of tbe Certificate, It wae his professional
  opinion (which he was most jealous of and would not put in jeopardy) thet the Smth
  Stand was structurally safe aad thet tbe hasls of the calculations provided was
  spproprlate. He was preparsd to advise the Club to use the appeal procedure open
  to them should this be necsssary.

IT W A S A G R E E D tbet:

£)      &e tbere was ao obvious deterioration in the South Stand structure of such
        a nature as to be of immediate concern, no objection would be retsed to the
        continuance of the derby game with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning
        provided tbet no extreme weather conditions occurred In tbe Intervening
        period, and

<b)      a furttiermeeting should be held as a matter of urgency betweeQ the Building
         Authority and Dr, W, Eastwood to discuss tte structural Integrity of tbe
        South Stand and tbe approprlateness of tbe calculations used (Mr, d , Vaughan
        to be present at Dr, Eastwood's request),

N O T E As the discussions on tbe South Stand Construction hinged on structural
        theories and practices, the Fire Service and police representatives felt
        there was little they could contribute and left the meeting prior to its
        termination.

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 -
Sheffield ttedneaday Football Club Limited

I thank you for your latter dated 15tb July.

After conaultationa with the Building Authority and in viftw of the fact
that all of the barriera vere teated prior to certification, the County
Council is able to agree thia year with the course of action which you
propose. However. I would atteas that thi* agreew o t i9 conditional
upon it being recognised and accepted that it is without prejudice as
to what may be required in future years under the provisiona of paragraph
25(2) of the Safety Certificate.

May 1 also mention the Certificates bys-

(a)          a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer (aa required by
              paragraph 24 of the Safety Certificate) as to all structural
              parta of the Stadium, excluding crush barriers and handrails;

(h)          an independent Electrical Engineer (as required hy paragraph
              26 of the Ssfety Certificate) aa to the electrical installation
              within the Stadium; and

(c)          an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by psragraph
              12(2) of the Safety Certificate) aa to the condition of the
              Emergency Power Supply.

I take it that if the Cluh has not already done ao, they will shortly be
requesting you to auppiy theaa.

 is And caused problems on the motorway* The pontoon bridges and extensive
roadworks on the motorway in the Derbyshire Police Area also created delays.
 This 90 minute delay resulted in a sudden flood of vehicles, all of them
•Spurs sijpportsrs, into Sheffield. 'Acting Chief Superintendent Thompson took
 up this point and said that he accented that the traffic route, designed to
divide, the foothall supporters from Che city centre steppers, was too tortuous,
although this may not have proved a problem had there been a steady flow of
spectators rather than the sudden influx caused by the incidents described by
Mr Hepold.
The Chairman then sought the views of the meeting over the crashing incidents
when several spectators were injured and which necessitated the removal of
ssre spectators frctn the Leppings Lane enclosure.
Mr Serold said that the capacity for the Leppings Lane enclosure, stated in
 the certificate issued under the Safety of Spor*s Grounds Act, is 10,100.
This mustr of necessity, contain a safety mergin. The actual turnstile
 rsading*,was l0,42S to which must be added the 70 Spurs supporters who had
sar.aged to obtain tickets which put them soonest the Wolves supporters. These
had been saved to Leppings Lans frost the X&p for their own safety. This made
a total of 40S spectators over the authorised limit. Inspector Calvert pointed
out that this created a similar situation to last year when about 400 forged
tickets wer* printed for the Leppings Lane endr although the same problem was
■ftct experienced then.
Mr HeroId had already referred to the late arrival of a large number of
spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppings Lane enclosure when
the catch started. The flashpoint occurred when Tottenham scored after only
thrae minutes. The spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was
hsppening and caused a crush, which resulted in the injuries. Inspector
Creanwocd also mentioned that there had been two or three fights, albeit of
& rinor nature, at the same time. This had resulted in the Order from Hr Goslin
to open the gates at the front of Leppings Lar.e in order to release so&e
spectators onto the pitch surround. This was done by opening the crates,
releasing a few spectators and then closing them to allow a steady flow. This
wss difficult to maintain because as soon as pressure was relieved at the
frrnt the crush from the back* filled the vcid.
The lack of a reserve serial between the South Stand and the Leppincs tane
stsnd (wr.ece one has normally been situated) caused a few minutes delay in
the 'deployment of officers to police this situation but this problem was soon
overcome. Superintendent Chapman stressed that there was still room in the
cer.ire of the Lappinps Lane enclosure although it vas quite full. This was
only to be expected when there was a capacity crowd, but the refusal of
scectetors to fill spaces had caused difficulties elsewhere in the enclosure#
The discussion progressed to the construction of the Leppings Lane enclosure#
Kr Sosiin felt that it was inadequate      required core divisions.so that
spectators are not in such a solid mass. He also felt that the liait of
10,100 was tocr high, although Superintendent Chapman disagreed with this.
The Chairman disagreed with Mr Kerold's suggestion of a 6 ft to 8 ft wide
channel down the centre of the enclosure to divide spectators and segregate
opposing fans on the grounds that such a small segregation gap only encouraged
opposing spectators to throw articles at each other and at police officers
in the middle, inspector Calvert expressed concern aboue the central

                                                               C o n tin u e d /
 eatrance to the Leppings Lane are* becausa it always causes 4slays and
 bl*(*ages. It would benefit from reconstruction.
.The chairman said that talks would take place with Sheffield Wednesday
 Football Club on the ground capacities add for any reconstruction thought to
 be necessary.
The discussion progressed to the fans who ran onto the pitch during the half
tiee interval*
Mr,HeroId said that the trouble steased fron the front central gate being
opened frcm where about 150 young fans were led onto the piteh surround.
These were the ones who eventually ran ento the pitch although at the tine
it was necessary for the gate to be opeted to relieve crowd pressure. The
aateh referee, Clive ?hcaas, had said that he was unable to start the match
when he wanted to. This was, however, Sased on a five minute half-tiae
interval and not on the noraal tsr. minute cne. It was unfair to suggest
that the ratch was held up as a result cf the fans on the pitch.
       «#

Mr Goslin said that he may have sede a vrong decision et half*tine to try
and get the fans frott the pitch surround onto the Kop. They had not been
causing any trouble where they were, ye; the decision to move thea onto the
Stop precipitated a minor pitch invasion. The half-tise interval was, on
reflection, insufficient to carry out zhs necessary manoeuvre. 5ooe of the
people who were bein? shepherded into the Kop refused to go in, resulting in
a minor rbreak-out’ which was cuickly controlled. Mr serold said that it was '
apparent, for future reference* that when people have \a be moved from the
Kop the area behind the hoardings is an ideal position to put them into. Chief
Inspector Seith also pointed out that 5C-100 fans had been successfully removed
froo the pitch and plaeed into the centre of the Kop. Kr Eerold said that
this situation prompted the only oriticisa of the police by the club in that
we seemed to be helping rans so cliab ever the railings. Inspector Sykes
replied to this criticisa by saying that cnly.the fans who had become stuck
whilst attempting to cliab over the railinos to avoid the crush had been
helped by police officers so they did net injure theaselves. The other fans
were released, in small groups through a police controlled gate.
One problem which was totally unnecessary was that caused by the sale of
unwanted tickets by Wolverhaapton Wanderers direct to Tottenham Hotspur. This
is contrary to TX directions and neither The fA, Sheffield ft'ednescay FC nor
the police were told of this decision. This aade a nonsense of the
segregation arrar.gs'ssnts and was a contributing fector to the difficulties
vhieh octurred. Discussions were to taka place about this situation.
rhe Chaims.*: then asked for any cccrents or criticises which could prove
useful for future occasions. The following points were raised:
Acting Chief Screrir.tindent Thompson
                                    •
The route for traffic frca the csotor^ay *as too tortuous and the more direct
route, the Parkway, should be considered in the future. Chief Superintendent
HeroId pointed out that this would bring the fans through the city centre
and into -direct conflict with the bas routes for walking spectators.

             Dear Sir,
             SEMI-FINAL %. 11TH APRIL 1961
             On the occasion of the above natch, there was an incident
             at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, in the standing
             enclosure, which resulted in injuries to spectators
             because of crushing.
             Prom our enquiries it appears the crushing was caused,
             through Tottenham supporters arriving late, due to
             problems on the Motorway, and rushing to their places
             after the game had commenced, thereby causing problems
             to spectators at the front of the terracing who had
             been in the ground a considerable length of time.
             According to our turnstile readings there were 335 in
             exceaa of the stipulated capacity for that particular
             area; this was the result of Tottenham fans having
             purchased ticketa from Wolverhampton and on arrival
             \t Turnatile 'N', Feniatone Road, which was the
             Wolverhampton standing area, were directed by the
             police to the other end of the ground where the
             Tottenham fana were standing,
              1 give below details of injuries reported to mej-
                  30 apectators treated by St, Johnrs Ambulance
                               Brigade for minor ailments, etc.
                  Treated at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital

held at this ground without previous problaas. The stadium is Issued with
a certificate under the provisions of the Safety in Sports Grounds Act 1975c
This limits the total capacity of the ground to 504174. The area Qf the
Leppings Lane enclosure has a capacity of 10,100.
Prior to the match itself, difficulties were envisaged because both sets
of supporters were obliged to use the HI Motorway. This problem was added
to when a major road aecident occurred on the Ml near to its junction with
the A3B. The problem was exacerbated by a coach breaking &wn further along
the motorway, and by extensive road works. This set of circumstances
caused a large number of spectators, predominantly Tottenham Botspur fans,
to be held up on the wtorway for seme 90 minutes. As you vii2 appreciate
traffic jams built up and resulted In a sudden Influx of large numbers of
football supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the
start of the match when a fairly steady build up of support throughout the
afternoon could have been anticipated.
I cow wish to outline an aspect of the problea which could have been avoided
and which should be anticipated for future similar occasions.
Cn the day before the Wolverhampton ticket allocation was put on sale to
the public, Tottenham Botspur played Coventry City Football dub at Coventry
in a league match. Kany Tottenham Botspur supporters stayed overnight in
Coventry and travelled the short distance to Wolverhampton to obtain tickets
which were at a premium in London. Others also made the journey from London
to Wolverhampton on the Sunday. This completely defeated the spectator
policy which is put into effect at these matches and which places the largest
groups of standing supporters at.opposite ends of the ground. Neither of




                                     m   ■
      tbe two.participating Semi-Final clubs saw fit to infomi the South
      Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club or the Football
      Association^about this situation and In that event the nixing of supporters
      was sot properly catered for, Tha result of this was that some 400
      Tottenham fans had to be. removed from the Spion Kop, in the interests
      of general safety and public order# and were accomodated in the Leppings
      Lane end of the ground*, which had been designated for use by Spues
      supporters.
      The capacity at the Leppings l^ne end is 10,100 and this obviously contains
      a safety factor, At a previous Batch some 400 holders of forg?d tickets
      gained entry into this part of the ground and ware absorbed without any
      apparent difficulty. However, on thie date turnstile readings showed
      that 10,435 people wore admitted to this part of the ground.       -*
      A policy of packing spectators occurs at most football grounds where
      large crowds are in attendance so that all the available space is utilised.
      On this occasion the Tottenham Hotspur fans, who bad arrived early in the
      day and taken up advantageous viewing points, refused to rove into the
      centre of this enclosure,- thereby creating a jasming effect at the
      extreaeties of it. The late arrivals caused sa immediate problem upon
      gaining access to the Leppings Lane area because of rushing forward
      immediately upon entering after Tottenham Botspur had scored a goal soon
      after kick off. This resulted in a mjnber of crushing injuries on this
      terrace including broken arms, legs and crushed ribs. In all' some 36
      fans received treafcnent either at hospital or from the St John Ambulance
      representatives present at the game.
      As a result of this the safety gates at tha frsnt of the -eppings Zass
      enclosure were opened and spectators at the front were allowed to go
      onto the playing area perimeter track to relieve the pressure within the
      terraee. Due to the problems beicg created by crushing, my officers also
      refused access to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to
      get in. In my view r*o other course of action could have been adopted in
      the interest of public safety.
I'>   Daring the half time interval ay officers attempted to move tbe spectators
      who were standing or seated within the tracks around cnee the carmal
      spectator areas. During this manoeuvre some rather foolish youngsters
      did run onto the pitch but the situation was quickly brought under control
      by officers within the ground.
      in conclusion I would add that there were no other incidents either
      inside or outside the ground other than those caused by the circirostanees
      1 have described. The oircumstances X have outlined have been discussed
      at length and will be horns in mind in the plajinia? of future similar
      events. Discussions are to taice place with ay officers and officials
      of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding suggestions for obviating
      the problems caused within the Leppings Lane terrace on this occasion.
      Yours faithfully

for the attention of Mr, P, raughac.


Dear k r . Vaughan,
             Sheffield Wednesday Football CXuh Ltd,
               Radial Fence* at Leppings Lane End

     We have been instructed hr the Club to organiae the
installation of t*o radial fences on the terrace at the
Leppinga lane end of the ground*

     It is Intended that theae fences are so positioned
that they diride thia eeetion of the terrace into
approxiaately three equal areas, etch aerved by its o n
entrance*
     By dividing the terrace *ore control over supporters
should result*    A visiting teas eith only % fee folLo«ra
will be allocated one aeotlon, vitb tba other two sections
retsined by the bo«e supporters*

      Larger contingenta of visiting spectators could be
a c c o m o d a t e d in t*o or *11 three areas as their nuabera
dictate*
      A 1.15 aetre vide gate la propoaed at the « M » ©f
e»cb feoca to give acce** for saloteoance and also policing
during a gam*.        The'gat* could be left open, hut fastened
 back, to connect the area* during a gaae If adjacent ©nea
are occupied by supporters of the saae teas,      Whan establishing
ttM height we bave considered that the v i e w to the corner
fifths should not be restrioted any further than they ere at
present by the perimeter fence*     We therefore propose tbst the
top of the fenoe should be epproxiastely IdfiOaa above the
terrace.

     This aay sot prevent the-odd spectator c U a b i n g the fence
but should eliminate * asss invasion froa one ares to the other*
Fences this height appear to work succeesfully tt St. Jaaea’s
Park, the boas of Newcastle United*

     We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
vi thin the Working Party end your coaaenta forwarded to us»

     Also to be included In the saae contract are sowe gates at
various locations around tbs north stand*      How the gyaaasiua i*
open to the g e n i a l public security to ttber parts of the ground
oust be aaintained*    It is proposed tbftt gstes are provided at
the top of the ravps at both ends of the stand with additional
gates at ground floor level at the Peniatone Eosd end of the
stand*     A separate sete will be placed behind the west raap to
prevent people going round the rear of the gyanssiua towards
Loppings Lane*
     Six copies of our drawing 3963/1 together with two copies
of our drawings 3963/2 end 3 (tor reference only) ere enclosed*


                                        Tours sincerely,

Dear Sir.

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

Referring co you* latter of 9th September, cht Officer Working Parry
(Sheffield Mstriet) has considered the proposals referred Co in four
latter of 2nd Sepcaabar tad accompanying plans#

1,   Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst welcoming tha increased control on the Terrace which should
result, concern vas expressed as to the prohleaa vhich could occur with
opposing fan* nixing *t the rear of the Vast Stand and/or at the entry/
exit gates* However» it vas felt that only experience would ahov
whether this would prove to be a reality and, if realised, whether the
problem vas of such a snail scale that it could be easily copfed with by
the police*

Accordingly, the Officer forking Party at this stage sees no objection
to the proposals to instal two 1680 ran high radial barriers, with 1.15
tetre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject to:-

(a) the further calculations required hy the Building Authority being
    satisfactory (Mr, Sheriff to contact you direct);

(V   confirmation chat adequate headroca will be available at tbe reer
      of ths lerrace alter installation of the barriers and gates, ana

(c) the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being under police
     control.

2.   Security Gates around Worth Stand

The Officer Working Party fully recognises the Club’s need to provide^
security for the remainder of tha atadium when only the gymnasiun is in
use#

Provided that the gates and/or their supports, hinges, etc. do not
impinge on Che existing critical rasp widtha and the gates ere secured
in tha fully open position on match days, the Officer Working Party
eeea no objection to the ereetion of eecuricy gates around the Horth Stand,

                                   BY THE CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


               On 23 September 1981, I made an inspection of the ground,
  after having had approximately one fifth of the crush harriers
  and sections of the perimeter fence on Spion Kop tested by members
  of my staff under my control.
       In my opinion the various structures on the ground
  are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate for the stadium
     to he used to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of
   Ground Safety.
        In July, crush barriers n u m b e r s . 4 0 , 4 1 , 4 2 , 4 7 , 4 8 , 4 9 , SO,
   55,56,57,58,5 9 ,6 0 ,6 1 ,68,69,70,71,85,90,114,115,116 and 118 (see
     our drawing 161Q/63) were tested in accordance with the procedure
     laid down in the Guide to Safety at Football Grounds, Certain
     barriers deflected excessively and would not sustain the test load.
     In one instance a clip retaining the horizontal tube had to be replaced
          Remedial work was carried out on barriers 41 (one post)
     and 115 (one post and one d i p ) . At the same time two corroded fence
     posts and four corroded fence post stays were replaced.
          After remedial work the sections of barriers which failed
     were successfully retested on 9 September.                                                         I am now able to certify
     that all 24 barriers have a satisfactory strength.
          The step at the top of the original stair flight at the
     back of Spion Kop has been filled in to give a Safe landing.



                                                                  B epinw sd in England - No. 1134631

                A permanent harrier has been installed adjacent
           to the servery at the bottom of the nev stair flight
           leading from Spion Kop and a new concrete landing added
           in the same area.
              Certain items of maintenance work which it is
           suggested should be carried out at an appropriate time
           have been recommended to the club. A list is attached.

                                        and Security Oates
                  The work on the radial fenced and security gates
            indicated on our drawings 3563/1-3 which we sent to you on

    f             Three first team hone games have been played since the
            fences were erected. We have sot heard any formal comments
            from the Working Party about the operation of the fences and
            their access gates hut we understand that representatives of the
            South Yorkshire Police have Inspected the work and they are
            satisfied with the new arrangements.
                  To increase security it is proposed tbat pairs of gates
            are installed at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of
            the West Stand, Two copies of our drawing 3563/4 are enclosed
            showing details of the gates*
                                                                                                                           i .     -   -

ror the attention of Mr, 0* Vaughan

Dear Mr* Vaughan,
                 Safety of Sdort» Ground Ae&
        ThanX you for your letter of 20 January*
        I believe the small nuaber of points needing
clarification have already been discussed between
John Strange and Mr* sheriff*   one of the#e refer to the
need for a goal post type fraae over the gates but this ia
in fact already provided by the sheeting frfre*       There i s
also a small aaount of rust staining arising fro* aisplacaaent
of reinforcement in the 100a* thick retaining Mil*        There
is no ionediate danger arising fro* this and an appropriate
maintenance repair will be oarried out*
        Turning now to the radial barriers on the west
terrace it i» of course accepted that where there is a
crush barrier passing through or_close to the radial barrier
it will make It easier for anyone who. so wishes.-to cliab
over.   Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable to
leave the crush barriers as they are*     If * 1 1 barriers
were removed back to a diatance say 1 .2 a froa ths fence it
would aean a 2,4a wide gap which it not protected by barriers*

 ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED BY THE
                                         CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


                       on 16 August 198 2, I made an inspection of the ground,
  after having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
  on Spion Kop tested by members of my staff under my control.
            At the end of June, crush barriers numbers 43, 44, 4S,
  46, 51, 52, 53, S4, 62, 63, 63A, 6S, 66, 72, 73, 74» 75, 76, 78,
  79, 80, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 92, 94, 9S, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103,
  1 0 4 , 105, 107, 108, 109 and 1 1 0 were tested in accordance with the
  procedures laid down in the Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.
  All the barriers sustained the test load although in some instances
   the clips retaining the horizontal tube defori^d.   These clips have
   been replaced.   At the same time, other clips and horizontal rails
   showing signs of advanced corrosion were replaced.
             I am now able to certify that all 41 barriers have a
    satisfactory strength.
              Two radial fences have been installed on the Leppings
   Lane terrace to segregate spectators.
             Gates have been installed at various locations around
    the ground to prevent intruders entering the stands.
              Repairs have been carried out to six stanchions
    supporting sheeting along the boundary wall near gate '0' on
    Penistone Road.
                                                                                                                                           OOCtlMEIil to. 304.

            Sharp corners on the underside of the lauding of
  the south exit at the front of the West stand have been
  ground smooth.
            Various minor items of remedial work to concrete
  and brickwork walls, steps, terracing and the like have
  been completed as part of the maintenance programme*
            Certain other items of maintenance work which it
  is suggested should be carried out at an appropriate time
  have been recommended to the Club.   h list is attached.
            I certify that in my opinion the various structures
  on the ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate
  for the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid down
  in the Certificate of Ground Safety.

         Annua l Inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium as required
                                      b y the Certificate of Ground Safety


               O n 25 July,                    1983 I made a n inspection of the g r o u n d after
 h a v i n g h a d app roximately one fifth of the crush barriers
 te sted b y members of m y staff under my control.

               At the end of June, crush barriers numbers 121, 122, 123,
    124A,            125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135,
  136        (part), 137, 13d, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144                                                        (part), 145
    (part),              146     (part),                  147, 148, 149 (part),                       150, 151, 152, 153
  a n d 154              (part), all at the Leppings Lane e n d of the ground
  we r e tested in accordance wit h the procedures laid d ow n in the
  Guide to Safety a t Football Grounds.

                in all but one case the barriers sustained the test load
    although in two cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube
    deformed.                  These clips w er e o n barrier 136 between spans 6-7
    a n d 8-9.              N e w clips hav e be e n fitted.

                The only failure w a s the centre support of barrier 141
    w h e r e the angle leg parted where it was bad ly corroded.                                                               The
    angle has be e n plated and n e w bolts Inserted.

                I                 a m n o w able to certify that all the barriers tested
    have a satisfactory strength.

    K o p and protec tion of the North side gable stanchion in the
    West stand have been completed as part o£ the maintenance
    programme.

          Certain other items of maintenance work which it is
    suggested should be carried o u t in the near future have been
    recom mende d to the Club.       A list is attached.

          N e w toilets and turnstiles ha v e recently bee n constructed
    b e h i n d Spion Kop.    During these operations the ramp down the
    back of Spion K o p was disturbed b y movement of the embankment.
    In particular the hand rail and concrete wall guarding the
    edge of the g a n g w a y m o v e d sideways.    The har d rail and wall
    have n o w be e n tested in accordance wi t h the requirements of
    the Code o f Practice and i n all but one case, where there was
    excessive deflec tion of a ha n d rail post,            successfully
    resisted the test load.

          Following these inspections a n d tests, I certify that in
    m y opinion the various structures on the grou nd are in a
    satisfactory condition a n d are appropriate for the stadium to
    be used to the full capacity laid dow n in the Certificate of
    Ground Safety.

1,    Purpose of Meeting

Ths purpose of the meeting was to carry ©ut the "winter'* inspection of the       i            ,
Stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football
League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

2.    Ground Inspection

A.    South Stand

The alterations and extensions to the understand *ree of tbe Stand (which
had been ccwpleted since the "Sumner” inspection) vers shown to the Officer
Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That any further arsas of spa lied concrete on the vertical columns at
the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored end receive attention
by the Club as a matter of maintenancs*

(ii) That the unsecured wire to the illuminated “Exit” sign in the Hatch
Day Sponaors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

<iii) That Che rmaioiftg bridge between the Stand and tht Club at the rear
of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape f r « the Kitchen
should be infilled with aesh frc* a safety point of view to accord strictly
with the appropriate Regulations.

 (iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
 of the inspection would receive urgent attention by ths Club.

8.    We«e Scend and Terrace

The Club recallad the practice followed in consultation with the South
Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rsar
o£ the Stand afi certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
temporary barriers. This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters
of the West Stand and Terrace. On those occasions when tbe nuaber of
visiting supporters w a s snail and the weather was inclement, it was
obviously desirable to allow home supporters access to a sheltered area*



                                        V
  i   WAS A G R E E D   -


(i)   That the Club would consider at some future date a scheme for
permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
being submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party in the
usual way*

(ii> That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
co be monitored.

(iii) That the apparent rusting of the steel columns at the rear of the
Stand should receive appropriate treatment by the Club*

C.        North West Terrace

No c o m n e n ts .                                     —

D.        North Stead
IT WAS AGREED that so long as larger, not easily ccobustible, materials
continued to be etored in the timber screened store area under the Stand,
the area would be regarded as acceptable.
E.        Spion Kop

It was noted that the remedial work to the roof of the tunnel exit from
the Kop had stabilised its condition for the tiae being (pending the
Club's development proposals proceeding'; that eh* loose coping stores
had been removed frco the ton of the wall between th« Spion Kop and the
South Stand, and that the damaged corrugated metal sheeting between the
Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.

 IT WAS AGREED -

 (i)   That the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit f r « the Kop should
 continue to be monitored.

 (ii) That the Club would carry out the pointing work to the outer perioeter
 wall on Penistone Road once the frosts had ceased.

 F.        Lighting Pylons

 The visual inspection of the lighting pylons (first mentioned at the
 inspection on 29th February, 19*4) had yet to be carried out by the Club.

 IT WAS AGREED that the visual inspection of the lighting pyl«ns would be
 carried out by the Club in the near future (weather conditions permitting).

                      MAJOR INCIDENT FLAN


 Introduction

 A major incident is a situation that we can never predict, it can occur
 at any place at any tine. The cbject ol this plan is to enable us to
 deal with any incident in an organised professional way, by each and
 every memer sticking to their oro job and knowing exactly what their
 role is.

The Admlance Service has more problas regarding itannlng levels than
£r> c£h?fJt"0 EDSr?Bnc^ Services especially at night, the weekends and
Bank Holidays. Inis problem alone makes the construction of a plan
such as this a major task due to the difficulties that can occur in
contacting off duty personnel. The plan has been designed to be sijmle,
easy to read and each duty itenised so individuals can concentrate on
the areas that concern them and all unnecessary information left out.

Attention aust be drawn to the following factors:-

The colour of Safety Helmets will denote the duties and rack of the
wearer i.e.

1.   Anbulance Personnel transport           =   Hbite
     Leading Aatoulance Person               •   White with Black Band
     Bnergency Support Team (FootSquads)     ®   Yellow
     Ambulance Officeis                      =   Blue

2,   All personnel must ensure that their H. V. jacket and suitable
     footwear are taken to the scene of any major incident with other
     items of personal safety equipment.

It is most important that the Incident Officer ramies in or close to
the Gmnunications Vehicle, this being the centre for directing and
monitoring the whole operation. He nust also ensure that a V.H.F. R/T
Handset (which will be marked) is given to the first available crew
that depart for the designated hospital so it can be handed over to the
Liaison Officer who will be on duty,

Antoulance crews must remain with their vehicles at all tijaes, their
role at a major incident is transportation      Acfeulance Nursing whilst
mobile, all rescue and treatn^nt duties will be performed by the
fidergency support team which are Ambulance Personnel without anbulances.

Delegated officers will be issued with a U.H.P. R/T Handset to enable
cannunications to be made via the nobile Control.

The support and ccmaunication vehicle will be based at Heatkjuarters, this
vehicle will contain all the necessary equitnent and drivers will be
allocated by Control.

lb enable the plan to run efficiently, it is essential that all personnel
concentrate on the objectives and check list of their individual role.

Dear Dick,
                           Turnstiles at Leppings Lane
             After speaking to Sharon last Wednesday about the number of
 turnstiles required to serve spectators using the Leppings Lane
 end of the ground we have altered our proposed layout accordingly.
 Three prints of our drawing 6705/3 are' enclosed.
      The eighteen existing turnstiles will remain.                                          Ten will serve
 the North stand and eight the terraces for the home supporters.
 In addition to four turnstiles from (A - E ) r which can be re-used/
 twelve new turnstiles will be required. Four each of these will be
 for home and away spectators using the West standr four for visiting
 supporters using the terrace under the score board and four more,
 primarily for away supporters to the centre terracer but they could
 be used for home supporters if the need arises- We understand the
 police have suggested a central fence to divide the middle section
 rather than provide a 2 m wide sterile area to one side. This may
 work providing you are happy having home and away supporters in the
  same area outside.
       Would you and Sharon be kind enough to have a look at the
  drawing because I would like to hear your comments before proceeding

Dear Dick,
                                                                        Turnstiles at Leppings Lane

     Thank you for returning the marked copies of our drawings
6705/2 and 3. After our telephone conversation yesterday we
have altered the layout accordingly. Two prints of our drawing
6 70 5/4 are enclosed for your comments.
     We have                     equalised each combination of turnstiles and gate
as requested                     but each gate needs to be at least 2.7S m for exit
purposes.
     If this                     arrangement is satisfactory, or even if you wish us
to make more                     alterations, we would be available to have a meeting
with you and south Yorkshire Police s onetime next week to discuss
the proposals in detail.
                                                                                     Yours sincerely,

                    Dear Sir

                    SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
                    SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FC

                    Further to the joint meeting on 18 April 1985, to discuss the proposals for
                    new crowd control arrangements, the means of escape implications have now
                    been considered. The scheme would appear to be satisfactory providing that
                    certain gates have the minimum widths (in metres) as indicated on the enclosed
                    plan- It is understood that these gates will be supervised by either the police
                    or club officials.

                     Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact
                     this Department.

                     Yours faithfully

Dear Dick,
                                Re-organisation of Turnstiles
                         and New Toilet Facilities at Lepplngs Lane
        As reguested we have now prepared an estimate for the
cost of works envisaged at the back of the West stand for the
 segregation of visiting spectators.
         The scope of the work falls into two categories, firstly
 the turnstiles, fences, walls and gates, and secondly, the
 toilets and refreshinent facilities.
         The proposed layout of the turnstiles etc. at the back
 of the stand is shown on our drawing 6705/4, a copy of which is
 enclosed*   Including the radial fence on the West terrace, we
 estimate that the cost of this work, including professional
 fees, is likely to be in the order of 566,600.   This
 assumes that five of the existing turnstiles can be re-used
 and seven new turnstiles are purchased.
         Also enclosed is a print of out drawing 6705/7 showing
 the proposed layout of the new and refurbished toilets beneath
 the West stand. We estimate that the cost of the toilets,
 again including professional fees, will probably be around
 £60,700.   This includes stainless steel fittings which are fairly
 resistant to abuse but are expensive. The saving if vitreous
 china is substituted for stainless steel urinal troughs and

 sinks would be about £2,200.                                                      If the items of maintenance

 concrete frame at the back of the South stand and the corrosion
 of stanchions at the back of the West stand, repointing the
 boundary wall on Penistone Road and providing the mesh infill
 on the bridge to the kitchens are added to the same contract
 we suggest that an allowance of £3,000 be made for this.
                            The total expenditure for the whole scheme plus
 the mainteannce work is therefore likely to be about £130 300
 including professional fees and Building Regulations fees.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                        Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                  Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
 of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
 to you o n 9 April.
                  In the interim period several of the points which you
 raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
 which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.                                                        However I
 w o u l d ask that further consideration should be given to the
 request in paragraph                                (c) of your letter for a second gate to
 be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
 barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.                                                        If these
 gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having                                                               a
 steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
 would hardly be justified.                                          It is our view that in the event of
 emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the
 gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
 We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
 Fire Officer’s staff should you so wish.

                                                                                     Yours sincerely,             DOCUMENTNo. U-          M-

Dear Dick,
                                          Alterations at Leppings Lane End
            We have pleasure in enclosing two prints of each of our drawings
6 705/5 and 6705/8 showing two possible alternative arrangements for
the turnstiles and toilets at the back of the west stand.
            Both drawings show the following turnstile arrangements.
                     Turnstile Nos                                 1 - 8              -         North stand
                                                                   9-13               -         North west terrace, home supporters
                                                                14 - 16 -                       West stand, home supporters
                                                                17                                                                                       - 19 -          West stand, away
                                                                20 - 23 -                           South west terrace, away supporters
            The proposals for the toilet and refreshment facilities are also
the same on each drawing.                                               You will see that we propose to build a new
ladies toilet for away supporters using the end of the existing
refreshment bar.                               The existing ladies toilets will be refurbished for
the use of home supporters.                                                     The existing gents toilets will be
divided and refurbished.
            Drawing 6705/5 indicates present turnstile                                                                                         housings (17 & 18)
remaining with the ajoining fence covered with sheeting to completely
separate the home and away supporters.                                                                           However, doing the calculations
for the evacuation of the ground reveals that there is a pinch point at

the two external gates on the left hand side of the row of six.
It could take over 20 minutes to evacuate that end of the ground
depending on how many people leave the South stand frora that side*

arrangement by demolishing the two end turnstiles (17 & 18) and
constructing a new dividing wall angled across to enclose three
gates on the left hand side instead of two.
      We believe that the cost of the scheme on drawing 6705/5 will
b% about £57,500 and for the one shown on drawing 6705/8 around
£$9,500, both including professional fees.                                       To these figures add
say another £3000 for the maintenance work mentioned in our letter
of 2 May.
      If a decision to proceed with one of the proposed schemes is
given within the next few days it may be possible to have the work
substantially complete by the start of next season.                                          This is not
certain but we would have a go.


                                       yours sincerely,

       Dear Dick,
                                                   Ground Safety Work. 1985
                           Meeting with Chief Superintendent Moseley
                                                   and Councillor Mike Smith
                   As requested I met the police representatives on Thursday,
        13 June.             I had some difficulty in persuading Mr. Moseley
       that it was not appropriate to have a high segregating barrier
( J P down the middle of the seating area in the West stand.                                                                         I think
€ F     he finally accepted that it was not necessary to do any more
        than have a relatively low level rail which would be sufficient
        to make the two lots of spectators go to the appropriate
        refreshment bars and toilets and also make their way out through
        the correct route.
            Superintendent Moseley was very concerned about the
        segregation of the two lots of spectators on the West terrace
        on those occasions when the centre of the terrace will be filled
        by visitors.                          He said that on the occasion of the Liverpool
        match he had had to station policemen in pairs down the full
         length of the dividing fence and this had been a very uncomfortable
         situation for the officers.                                                           Not least of his difficulties was
         that it was not easy for the officers to get in and out of that

                                                                                                                                OQQIttEMTNo.
                                                                   SHEET

 particular area if the ground was packed with spectators.
 He felt that a higher fence than the present one or a double
 fence was necessary.      I suggested that we should have a double
 fence with a gap between so a» zo Keep cne s^ccatois apait
 and to provide a space in which his officers could stand.
 Fewer policemen would be needed if the spectators had a
 gap between them.        It so happens that right alongside the
 existing fence there is a gate on to the pitch and if the
 second fence were placed on the other side of the gate, it
 will provide an easy access gangway for the police and they
 will be able to move in and out of the gap depending on the
 situation.      Mr. Moseley was clearly very pleased by this
 suggestion and subject to your approval, we are including
 the work in the contract for segregating the spectators at
 Leppings Lane end.
     I should point out that it will mean losing about a metre
 of advertising space because the hoardings carry straight on
 past that particular gate at present.         There will have to be
 a gap in the hoardings to enable the police to get in and out and
 of course, to evacuate the crowd in emergency.


                            Yours sincerely,
                                                                             FILE

Dear Mr» Calvert#
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
      Further to our telephone conversation on 24 June we have
pleasure in eocl o t i i t q two copies of our drawing 6705/fl shoving
the proposed arrangement of the turnstiles and fences end gate*
at the rear of the West stand»
      Zt is also proposed, but not shown on the drawing to
install a tingle barrier rail, just above head halght down
the centre of the seated area and also a fence approximately
2m away fro* the existing radial fenee.on the right hand side
of the terrace (looking from the pitoh)*to separata standing
spectators« The fence will be juet like the ones aitmady installed*
      Although Dr, Sastwood has discussed the proposals in
outline with Chief Inspector Moseley we would also appreciate
receiving your comments*
      Perhaps the work can be coaplated ready fox the start
of the season if the scheme meets with your approval*

                                     Yours sincersly#

Dear Sirs.

Safety of sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

As requested by your letter dated 16th July, 1 have written a confirmatory
letter to the club regarding the steel sheeting and non-slip surface of
the tiober deck to the South Stand upper stated area (copy attached for .
your infcreation),

I understand that applications for building regulation/planning approval
have been made by the Club in respect of (1) re-organisation of fences
and turnstile* and alterations to toilet facilities at the rear of the
vest stand, Lepplngs Lane, and (ii) erection of roof and enclosure to the
Spion Kop Terrace,

d e Officer Working Party considered and gave approval in principle to the
rear of the West stand re-organisation proposals in Nay butr other than
brief mentions by the Club or yours elves at routine asetings of the
possibility of the Spion Kop being enclosed, no outline plans or details
of such proposals have been considered to date.

As on previous occasions, Z aa assuming that you will subnit the necessary
detailed plans r specifications and calculation for Safety of Sports Grounds
Aet approval (bearing in mind the General Safety certificate requirement
to give the COunty Council ae l#a*e 21 days actice of any proposed
alterations or extensions at the Ground) should the Club decide to iapleaent
the proposals after building regulation/planning permission consideration.

                                                   Yours faithfully,

letter dated 25th Ju If from Messrs. Eastwood and Partnera of arrangen*nte
for the segregation of visiting apeetatora at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. It vas
recalled that consideration of outline proposala had teken place by the
Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985. Whilst formal application had been
made for Building Regulation approval and aome of the work had actually
commenced, Measre, Eaetwood and Partners hed apologised by 'phone thet
submission of the detailed proposals for Safety of Sports Grounds Act
approve! had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and etaff
holidays. The plana also included details of .repairs to certain crueh
barriera on the Spion Kop.

The   14 detailed plane aubmitted   were each consideredand discussed individually.

IT WAS AGREED - that, subject to the following pointsand to the submissionof
the necessary detailed calculations to the Building Authority, the propoaala

<river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
the new handrail not to be less than the width of the roller sbutter gate
between Turnstiles 16 and 17;

<c)    Plan No. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the interal walls
(e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
substantial stud partition (tinier or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
be required;

(d)     Plan No. 6705/10A ~ same conments as for plan 9A;

(e)     Plan No.6705/11A - no objection in principle, but details of exact

indicated;

(g)   Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness ia achieved by steep

     For the attention of Mr. D. V aughan


     Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                             Safety o f Sp o rt sground Act,                                   1975
                                     Sheffield W e d ne s da y Football C lu b PLC
                    Tha n k y o u v e r y m u c h for your letter of 30 July gi ving the
     outcome of the Working Party m e e t i n g on 29 July.                                                                     We note
     the general comment th a t the calculations have to be approved
     by the Building Surveyors Department.                                                       We believe that all the
     calculations whi ch are likely to be required have b ee n sent for
     c h e c k i n g and comment.
                    Wit h regard to your detailed observations our response
      is as follows ?-
    * (a)           We are n o t sure of the location on the W es t t errace of
     t h e proposed ext ra security gate.                                              There is already a g*ate Un
      t h e 2m wi d e gap formed b y the n e w radi al fence for use b y the
      police.            This same gate will still be available for the spectators
      in e m e rg e nc y as t h er e are gates into the 2 m g a p fr o m the terrace
      w h i c h w il l be u nd er the c ontrol of the police.                                                            This point m a y
      perhaps be clarified during the working Party's visit o n 7 August.

       (b)            The foundations'for this fence are in fact already aligned in
                                            A n U nlim ited C o m p an y , t o g l w w d j n t n t f v * -   *** 18 3 3 1 4 4             T *   C t< ii E f i

        the w a y y o u suggest.

         (c) a n d     (d)
                     W e are a little surprised b y the suggestion th a t a
        s ingle bl o ck thickness is not sufficient to.- m e                cuoicie
        walls.       The inside of a t o i l e t cubicle is not a very
        vul n er a bl e a re a and the wa l ls are brace d by the d oo r frame.
        Studding is not at all suitable in terms o f strength or
        durability, a n d w o u l d probably invite vandalism.

         (e)     The refreshment area is under the m o s t westerly
         staircase up to the n or t h w e s t corner terrace.              There will
         be an opport u ni ty to inspect o n 7 August.

         (f)     The h an d r a i l is to be at a he ight of 1250mm            (4'1">
         above the hor iz o nt a l step, m ea s u r e d at the face of the vertical

         step.
         {g)         The stepping of the face of t h e w a l l is achieved b y 45
         chamfers whi c h will not form good footholds.

          {h)        Mr. C h e s t e r says that the club wi l l certainly not
         o bject to the provision of another gate at th i s point, and
         the p r e c i s e location can be discussed on 7 August.
<po




          <i>        As w i t h point   (a), w e are n o t sure w h a t is intended,
          and the m a t t e r can be d i sc us s ed on 7 August.

          (j)        Y o u r comment regarding stewarding wi l l n o doubt,              be
          t a k e n c ar e of by Mr. Chester.


                      It w i l l be m u c h ea sier for y o u r W o r k i n g Party to
          appreciate wh a t is intended w h e n they see the wor k s under
          construction.         There w i l l also be an opportunity to see
          the me t al d ecking of the South stand.


                                               Yours sincerely.

the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

 2.   Ground Inspection.

 A.   Leppings Lane End

 The progress of the works to segregate visiting supporters behind and on the
 (test Terrace sad $card were inspected with particular reference to the
 points raised at the Officer Working Party's meeting held on 29th July*
 (forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive's letter
 of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood * Partner® reply of 1st Auguat.

 Mesars. Eftatwood & Partners had confirmed tbat all the calculations which
 vere likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
 checking and coosaent.

 On the inspection, the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
 to be the poor standard of vortaaanship in the construction of the new
 dividing wall which was being built behind the Stand. The position of the
 Police Peraotmel accesa gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by
 45 chamfers so as not to f o m footholds were accsptahle.

   The fowriatione of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually heen
•* aligned ao as to maintain the exit width between the witer (river) wall
   and the Tumatile (unlike the itriication on the plan sutaaitted).

 As regards the single block thickneas of the internet walla of the cubicles
 in the new male and fenale toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
 Messra. Eaetvood aid Partners conaidered that the inaide of a toilet cuticle
 was not e very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the walls were braced
 by hoth the outer walle and the door fr«ea. The Building Authority noted
 the assurancea given by Dr* Eaatwood, but expressed concern tbat the
                                     *

Dear Sir,

Harry thanks for your coaaunication dated 9th August 1985.

1 can confirm that arrangements have been finalised with South Yorkshire
Police Authorities, Hamnerton Road, for the staff concerned to be briefed
on matters relating to safety/emergency procedures prior to our first hcne
game, Saturday 17th August 1985.

The written instructions are already in existence with the araenHprf "warning
message1* of an emergency situation confirmed during season 1964/5.

My Head Steward and various sectional senior stewards, sre kepc fully
informed of the various matters and are responsible for advising the
*'match day1' staff accordingly.

In addition the staff are supplied with distinguishing attire, and are
given specific duties to perform and required to be in attendance at those
points througtiout the entire period.

With the approval of South Yorkshire Police, due to holidays and the
unavailability of a full canplement of staff, I have delayed the convening
of an evenings seminar/instructional course, by the Fire Authorities until
after the season has commenced. Having spoken to the Fire Authorities they have
confirmed their willingness to attend leaving only the final isation of the date
in abeyance.

Yours faithfully.

Oeax Dick,
      Many thanks for your note of 12 August enclosing the
copy of David Vaughan's note of the meeting held at the ground
on 1 August.   A copy of ay letter to David Vaughan was sent
to you the same day so that our letters have crossed in the
post*-
      You will see that I have taken up very strongly the
suggestion by Don Sheriff that the workmanship in the brickwork
was poor and would lead to weakness® It is unfortunate that
David Vaughan did not record that I had completely refuted
what Don Sheriff said.    David now recognises that this was a
mistake but ife putting the matter right by circulating a copy
of ay letter®
      Turning to the matters on the second page*- ...
■It was agreed*
My comaents on the points you have in alnd are as follows i"
 (b)     This refers to the existing gate between the new 2m wide
         gap formed by the radial fence which will be used for
         police access only.   You will notice from the wording
         of David's minute that I persuaded them that steps could

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. V a u g h a n r
                                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                                            Safety o f Sportsgrounds Act
                                                   Roof of N o r t h Stand
           I           spoke to y o u before going o n holiday regarding the very
advanced state of corrosion wh ic h w e discovered w he n I made an
examination o f the external steelworJc of the N o rt h stand roof
at the e n d of t h e last football season.
           Attached are four photographs w h i c h are representative
of the conditions wh ic h I discovered.                                              photograph 1 shows one
of the ma i n trusses.                         It w i l l be seen that the vertical
member and the top b o o m and diagonal were fairly rusty and they
 clearly needed a p ai nt treatment because the paint h a d largely
 d isappeared and corrosion can be expected to accelerate f r o m no w
 on.         It has to be kept in m i n d that the roof was designed for
 the p r e -1970 w i n d loadings including downward suction wh e n the
 w in d is blowing from the back of the stand so that factors of
 safety have always b e e n slightly less than they wo u ld be

 according to the present d a y Building Regulations.
         At the time of m y first inspection the bottom boom
 memoe r :■:£& covered by some flashings wh ic h hid two side
 legs.     1   arranged for representative lengths of these
 flashings to be removed and as you wi l l see from photograph 1
 rusting had been taking place rapidly for m an y years.           It seems
 that w h e n the roof w a s painted last time the flashings were
 left in place so that there had only been the original paint
 treatment w hi ch had disappeared long ago.          Photograph 2
 was taken on the same day at another location.         You will
 see that there is a v er y large rust lamination on the nearside
 leg of the botecra boom where a large piece of r u s t is splitting
 a wa y fr o m the remainder of the steel.
         In addition to the very serious rusting of the vertical
 flanges, there were m an y places on the w e b of this bottom
 boom m ember where rust had progressed quite considerably.
 The w e b had clearly be e n painted 18 years ago but because
 of the v e r y shallow slope of the b ottom boom    (parallel to
 the roof) the rain whi ch falls in it had been ponding thus
 keeping the steel w e t for a considerable portion of the time.
 This had tended to occur locally where small dams of dust had
 bui l t up.
         As a result of these findings I reported t o the Club
 t h a t all the steelwork needed painting as a matter of urgency
 but in addition, the botto m b o o m would n e e d to b e blast
 c leaned before painting and finally that a completely different
 form of flashing should be incorporated w h ic h wou l d stop
 rain from falling into the trough and w h i c h co u ld also be
 easily taken off when next the roof is painted.
         The Club took the decision to c ar r y out the painting.
 Tenders w er e obtained and w or k began at the beginning of
 July.     W h e n the flashings were taken off everywhere, w e found
 even w or s e conditions in some places than had b ee n diecovered
  in the original inspection.      photograph 4 shows the extent to
                                                                                      SHUT    3.

 whi c h metal had been lost in some parts of the b o ttom boom.
 Photograph 3 w a s just as bad but the damage does not show
 up quite so w e l l in the photograph,          incidentally, photographs

 of the members.           This steel had of course already b ee n painted
 and does not represent the original condition.
            During the w or k on the underside of the roof which
 has also been painted but for which the Cl u b is not intending
 to apply for a grant, we discovered that at m a n y places
 wat e r had b e e n leaking between roof sheets and had caused
 some localised rusting.             The r eason for this leakage is clearly
 the very shallow slope of the roof whi c h is only about 1°
  (1 in 60).        A normal m i n i m u m roof slope is about 5°.              W i t h the
 1    ° slope it seems that when the wind is blowing from the south
 rain w h i c h falls o n the roof c a n be bl ow n up ths slope under
 the lap between sheets and small amounts leak into the stand.
             In order to give long term protection f ro m this leakage
 which could in tlae cause the steelwork beneath the roof to
 b ecome unsafe,         I have recommended to the C l u b that t he y spend
  approximately £3,000 in having the lower edges of e ac h roof
  sheet lifted and a seal placed before fastening the sheet down
  again.
             The Club wi l l therefore be applying for a qrant towards
  the co s t of t-
     (a)    painting the external steelwork
     (b)    bla s t cleaning the steelwork w h ic h was wo rs t affected
             b y rust.
     (c)     completely n e w flashings over the botto m b o o m of the
             ma i n trusses of a kind w hi ch w i l l shed the rain and
             can be e a sily taken off for future painting.
     (d)     placing of the seal between all roof sheets.


             For your information the total cost of all this work
  including professional fees will be in excess of £ 6           0   ,0   0 0   .
  This does not include the cost of the internal painting for
  w h i c h the Club w i l l not be applying for a grant.       It is

 regarded as routine maintenance.
         It wi l l be    very m u c h appreciated if the County Council
 c a n certify that in                       i^oma
 (c)   and   (d) set out above were essential in the interests
 of g r o u n d safety   a n d that they would have been made a requirement
 of the next      annual safe t y certificate if they had not been
 carried out.

                 R.   Woodhouse (South Yorkshire Countv Pire Service)

   t.       Purpose of Meeting
   The purpose of che meeting was to consider the response to be given to the
   proposal.* outlined in the letter dated 25th October, 1985 and plans received
.^-.frotD Messrs. Eastwood 4 Partners relating to facilities for the disabled, an
^increased capacity for the Spion Kop and consequent additional exit routes.
^|utliae details of the roof to be erected over the Spion Kop had also been
^provided.

   2.       Disabled Facilities
  The Officer Working Party expressed reservations on both of the suggestions
  proposed by Messrs. Eastvood 4 Partners for the disabled. If the disabled
  continued to be accommodated in front of the North Stand, they would still
  be in the firing line" of mis-aimed shots and any clear sheeting over the
  top of the area they occupied could constitute at* unacceptable hazard to
  persons who might vacate the North Stand in an emergency situation by
  climbing over the front wall of the stand onto the pitch perimeter. It was
  accepted that the means of escape did not provide for this to be done, but
  it had to be recognised that in practice this was a real possibility. The
  structural stren^hof such a structure would also be something of a problem.
  The other suggestion of accommodating the disabled in front of the perimeter
  fence along the front of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) was also
^unacceptable for the reasons stated by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners.
•Js*
^fc*he suggestion of the Police representatives was that the front area of the
flower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the terracing levelled
   to provide, say, a two-tier level landing on which to accommodate the disabled,
   with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch perimeter fence in
   front of this area could be removed, and the disabled would continue to gain
   access from the rasp between the Spion Kop and the North Stand as a t present*
   This would also enable free access by the disabled to the proposed disabled
   toilets under the rebuilt terracing of the Spion Kop.
       The current legislation relating to the disabled was also diacusaed.
    IT WAS AGREED that the proposals for the disabled, as now
   • outlined by the Police representatives, should b4 supported arid
     transmitted to Messrs.1Eaatwood & Partners as the Vieva of
    the Officer Working Party, subject to there being no obstruction of exit
    routes and flows.
       3.    Enlarjaed Spion Kop
       The Fire Service and the Building Authority agreed that calculations showed

          This document sets out to amplify a n d clarify the responsibilities
          of Clubs in relation to this most difficult problem.    Both our
          bodies are fully aware of the enormous amount of time, money and
          energy expended by our Clubs in ensuring that the public can
          attend matches in safety.   With Che eyes of the world on us,
          however, we cannot afford to relax for one moment.

          We ask you to study the Memorandum in great detail. Failure to
          act on any of the recommendations m a y b e taken into account should
          a Club subsequently be charged wit h misconduct under Football
          Association Rules 23 and 24.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


 Dear Sirs,
                                Safety of Sport Grounds Act,                        1975
                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
             Thank y o u for your letter o f 1 8 December,                                 1985 enclosing the
 comments of the Building Authority to whi ch X would reply as follows?"


  Disabled Facilities
  a)          There is no doubt that the Kop is covered by the Building
              Regulations and that we shall need Building Regulations
              approval.              However, there has effectively been no change
              in the 1985 Regulations*
              Ev e n if there wer e a change in Regulations, it is obviously
              commonsense that facilities for the diabled apply to the
              ground as a whole and not to one particular building.                                                 At
              the mome nt there are perfectly adequate facilities under
              the overhang of t h e roof of the Nor th stand*                                     There is a
                 level approach.                     The disabled are under the               cover        of the
                 cantilever roof.                       Any facilities at the front of the Kop
                 would be less sheltered from the rain, and mo r e prone to
                 disruption by the fans immediately behind.                                   It is not a good
                 place at all for disabled people.

b)   We have no intention o£ entering into further discussion
     regarding a w a y in which the 50 or any other number of
     places could be provided under the n e w Kop.      There are
     adequate facilities for the ground as a whole at the
     moment*


c)   The Building Authority clearly has no knowledge whatever
     ut ti'M c*wat oi iooti>«xx grouna stiuecuie.s».   me   extra
     £500,000 is made up o f several components*       Firstly,
     there is a steel frame supporting a precast concrete
     deck,   some of it at ve r y high level.    Very expensive
     piling is required for the columns of this steel frame
     because most o f the columns are hi g h up on the bank.
     Secondly,   the ma i n roof girders have to carr y ver y much
     more load, because of the larger area.        The spans of the
     radial girders are also that muc h greater so they have
     to be stronger.    The cost per square foot of all the
     covered space is increased.     In addition the framing and
     sheeting at the rear of the stand are on average very
     m uc h higher and, therefore, mo r e expensive*     Thirdly,
     the addition of the extra spectators has resulted in
     the need for complete re-organisation of ex i t routes with
     considerable extra expense.      N e w turnstiles are needed and
     additional toilet accommodation*.        A re-examination of our
     figures shows the additional cost for the 5,000 extra places
     is about £560,000.     To simply roof over the existing Kop with
     no extension wou ld reduce the cost of the scheme to less than
     a half o f that for the enlarged Kop*        I trust we shall have
     no mo r e of this uninformed opinion.

     This extra m o n e y is being provided to achieve 5000
      extra spectators.    If w e give up 1000 of those spaces to
      provide for say 100 disabled plus 1 0 0 helpers then over
      £100,000    of the extra cost of the enlarged Kop has.to be set
      against the disabled accommodation*        The Building Authority
      mus t accept that the extra £580,000 the Club intends to spend
      is to cater for those days when the ground is full or ne arly full

      to capacity.

     Wi t h regard to the proposal that a glazed shelter might
     be pl a c e d over the disabled accommodation in front of the
     North stand,          it was not our intention that any seats within
     the North stand wou ld have an obscured view although a few
     of the spectators might have to look through the glass of
     the canopy to see the near touchline*           There are materials
     available for t h e gl azed roof which migh t prov e to be safe for



     I re gard it as regrettable that there has been such a
     negative attitude on this particular matter.           W e have not,
     of course,       taken the design study any further with regard
     to the possibility of a covering for p a r t of the disabled
     area nearest to the K o p e n d of the North stand, but would
     reconsider the matter if the working Party has a change of
     heart.


     E n l a r g e d Kop
            W i t h regard to the request for a barrier to protect
     the ladies toilet, it has perhaps not been realised that
     there is handrailing already in place.           A gap will be
     c reated for a n entrance to the ladies toilet.         The
      final version of the proposed arrangements is shown on
      the attached print of drawing number 6648/53.          The new
      brickwork is shown shaded.


      Roofing the Kop
             W e are really surprised by the suggestion that the
      steel frame of the gable wall s and presumably the ba c k of the
      stand should be sheeted over.           It is a common feature of
      every stand structure that I know of in any football ground
      in the country that the sheeting rails and other bracing
      members are exposed o n the inner face.          In older structures
      they are generally only at 1.2 m centres but in mor e modern
      structures they are generally at 1.8 m centres.           Wit h the
      1 . 8 m spacing it would be extremely difficult indeed to
      climb up except adjacent to a column.           However, I know of
      no instance where the sheeting rails of an existing stand
      are regarded as being such a hazard that they should be boxed
       in, wi t h an inner skin as well as an outer skin.          X find
       it very surprising that this matter is being pressed.

            This correspondence on these matters leads me to believe
      that there would be great advantage if the Club's advisers were
      present for pa r t of ea c h of the meetings of the Officer working
      Party.    Matters of this kind need to be discussed round the
      table rather than in lengthy correspondence.            We can be o f great
      assistance in providing information whi ch m a y result in fewer
      matters becoming contentious.       It is also inevitable that we


      to give the opportunity to cojEZsent at an early stage*          The
      plans are incomplete in some respects and this may lead to
      misunderstanding of what is intended or a lack of appreciation
       of the thinking behind wh&t is proposed.         Th ere is also the
       difficulty^!* the light or comments received from the Club, and
       indeed those from the Working Party, quite significant
       changes may take place at a very late stage.           It is desirable
       that any late changes be dea lt wi t h in as short a time as
       possible.     In this regard I now enclose six prints of each of
       our drawings numbers 1 C ,   8 A r 9A, 1 7 A and 5$.   As the Club
       will be w i s h i n g to place an order for the n e w building not
       later than the end of January*      it may be that an oral presentation
       to your Working Part of what is proposed might be beneficial
       all round.


                            Yours faithfully.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: LOCAL GOVERNMENT AC T 1 9 8 5

Introduction

1.   HOC 54/85 and 5 / 1 9 8 $ were copied to Chief Executives of
Metropolitan District Councils and London Boroughs in view of the
forthcoming transfer to them of responsibility in the Metropolitan
counties and Greater London for the administration of the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA).        The purpose of this circular is to
advise successor authorities of the changes to the SSGA brought
about by the Local Government Act 1985 (LGA) and to give guidance
or* discharging these responsibilities*       It is not intended to affect
any internal or locally agreed arrangements which may be in train to
ensure that all those who ha v e an interest in securing safety at
sports grounds are fully consulted,

SSGA 1975

2.  The SSGA gave effect to the main recommendations contained in
the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds which
was prepared by Lord Wheatley f o llow ing the s e r i o u s accident at
Ibrox Park Football Ground in 1971.

 3.        The main provisions of the Act are:

           a.  A power, exercisable by the Secretary of State, to
           designate sports stadia with a capacity for more than
           10,000 spectators. Once designated, a stadium will require
           a safety certificate from the local authority.

           b.   An obligation on the local authority to issue such
           cer tif i c a t e s .

    Guidance to the SSGA procedures

    9.  A copy of the SSGA and the Regulations (Statutory Instrument
    1263 1976) are enclosed with this circular.                A detailed description
    of the Act and its provisions is caitainsd at Annex B.                        The Regu­
    lations s e t o u t the procedures and t i m e l i / n i t s a s s o c i a t e d w i t h
    safety certificate applications and appeals.                These same regulations
    alao empower local authorities to determine fees in respect of
    applications for the issue or amendment of safety certificates. A
    guide to the procedure for the issue of a general safety certificate
    is at Annex C.      Similarly, the procedure for the issue of a special
    safety certificate is at Annex D.

..-'rO, .lie i'oliowiri^ points are highlighted as being ot particular
   potential interest to local authorities:

         a.  P r o c e d u r e u n d e r s . 10. P a r ag ra ph 21 o f A nn ex B r e f e r s .
         Authorities may wish to note that this procedure can be
         applied to all sports grounds withi n the meaning of the Act,
         not just to stadia.               It is hoped that authorities will not


•
         feel inhibited from invoking the procedure, as necessary,
         where they perceive the risks to be such that urgent action
         is required to provide reasonable safety for spectators.

        b.      The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) (The
        Green Guide).        Attention is drawn to paragraphs 5 and 6 of
        Annex B and paragraph 3 of Annex C.                      Authorities wil l no
        d o u b t bear in f t i nd t h e c o n t e n t s o f p a r a g r a p h k o f HOC 5^/J9#5
        dealing with action on the Interim Report of the Inquiry
        contains additional recommendations on the content and
        structuring of the Green Guide whi ch will be revised as soon
        as possible.       In the meantime the existing guide, a copy of
        which is e n c l o s e d > may be used until such time as the revised
        version is available.

    Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds

     11.      The Final Report of Mr Justice P o p p l e w e l l ’s Committee of Inquiry
     into Crowd S a f e t y and C o n t r o l at Sports Grounds was p u b l i s h e d on
^ ^ 1 6 January 1986 (Command 9710).             A separate Home Office circular,
^ ^ n u m b e r 5/1986, was sent to local authorities - including Metropolitan
     District Councils and London Borough Councils - on 20 January 1986)
     giving details of the G o v e r n m e n t ’s response to the safety recommend­
     ations contained in the Report, and next steps.

    Other

    12.   A list of designated stadia for England and Wales is attached at
    Annex E.   Management of those stadia in Metropolitan counties and
    G reater London have been informed o f the change in responsibility f o r
    administration of the SSGA and have been advised to copy applications
    for special safety certificates or amendments to existing general
    certificates to successor authorities (see Annex F).

    13. T h i s circular is copied to Chief Executives of County Councils,
     Secretaries of the successor authority coordinating committees, and
     to Chief Fire Officers for information.    Paragraph 10 is of
     particular r e l e v a n c e .
                                        3,/tf


E„R„
       as "Building Authority", paragraph 7(2) of Schedule 6 of the LGA
       r e d e f i n e s , for the purposes of the SSGA, "building authority" in
       England and Hales as meaning:

               a.  in England, outside Greater London, and the
               Metropolitan counties, or in Wales, the district
               council.

       The effect of this, together with amendments to Sections 3(3), 4(7)
       and (8), 5(5), 10(4) and 11 of the SSGA resulting from paragraph 7(1)
       of Schedule 5 of the L$A, is that in Metropolitan counties and
       ui'tfoit* yyngv.i,     tut  - ua**uii^ a u cao r i l y tinu       au crjor I’Cy "
       are synonymous, the local authority is not required to refer safety
       certificate applications to the Building authority or consult it
       about the terras and conditions of a certificate.         Similarly the
       building authority in these areas does not have the status of
(      "interested party" and has no need of the right to authorise entry
       and inspection of a sports ground because these powers are vested in
       it as the local authority.

       7.   An additional change brought about by paragraph 7(1) affects the
       role and status of the Fire Authority in Greater London and the
       Metropolitan counties.   The  converse of paragraph 6 applies in
       respect of the Fire Authority which,    from 1 April 1986, has the status
       of ’’interested party* in Metropolitan counties and Greater London.
       In these areas the local authority is required to refer safety
       certificate applications to    the Fire Authority and consult it about
       the terms and conditions of   a safety certificate; and the Fire
       Authority will have the right to authorise entry and inspection of
       a sports ground.   The reason for these changes is that the newly
       constituted fire authorities will not (as in the past) be the same
       as the local authority.

       Transitional Arrangements

^      8.   Under article 2 of the Local Government Reorganisation (Transitional
        Provisions) Order 1^85 (SI 1985 No 1 7 & D , London Borough Councils and
       Metropolitan District Councils will acquire certain anticipatory d q w ^
       including powers in respect of safety certificates for sports g r o u n d w :
       The provisions of SI 1985/1781 were explained in DOE circular LGA(L)              ^
        (DOE) 13/LGA(MC)(D0E)16 of 2 6 November 1985.             The Secretary of State
       takes the view that Metropolitan County Councils and the GLC are not
       empowered to issue new safety certificates or amend existing safety
       certificates to take effect on or after 1 April 1986: SI 1985/1781
       therefore allows successor authorities to consider, before 1 April,
       applications for certificates to come into effect on or after 1 April.
       Successor authorities wiLl therefore wis h to ensure that they are kept
       informed of the progress of safety certificate applications or amend ­
       ments to existing certificates now under consideration by the M e t r o ­
       politan County Councils or GLC. Much of this information will a u t o ­
       matically have come to successor authorities in their present role as
       building authorities but they may nonetheless wish to establish
       early contact with the current ’c e r t i f i c a t i n g 1 authority to ensure a
       smooth transfer of responsibility from 1 April 1986 without impairing
       the safety cover afforded by the certification process. In this
       context successor authorities will no doubt wish to bear in mind
       that applications for special safety certificates for events on or
       after 1 April 1986 may require advance consideration if a certificate
       is to be issued in time. Similarly, successor authorities will doubtless
       wish to be acquainted with any other action or initiatives currently
       in rtand by the present certificating authority in respect of snorts
       grounds in their area.                                                     H

Dear Dick,
                 Home Office Document on Fire Safety and
                       Safety at Sports Venues
           I have read through the part of the document which deals
with Sports Grounds. I do not see any grounds for objecting to
any of the recommendations. There will be little if any change in
the procedure already established at Hillsborough. The document
‘envisages that far more grounds for various sports will be designated
but in appropriate circumstances the procedures will not be so
 onerous as those relating to Hillsborough. However, as it is a
 •top' ground we cannot expect that there will be much relaxation
 compared with the present -arrangements,.
          There is a welcome statement on page 11 that due account
  whould be taken of the -need to keep the cost* to club* an.d local
" a u t h o r i t i e s t o reasonable proportions.  There are also various
  references to Safety Certificates reflecting the circumstances of
  each particular ground and the number of spectators who are likely
  to attend (see page 14).              These words may be useful to us in the
  future, a l t h o u g h we can expect t o have more stringent requirement*
 compared with some of the smaller clubs.
          It is comforting to know that the new Green Guide will not
 become a statutory code, and will continue to be subject to
                                         IH O -          _________________________

some clubs.  But in paragraph 2.38 on page 20 there is a clear
implication that it is only necessary to reduce the risk to
an acceptable level* rather than trying to remove all risk. This
wording will help curb excessive demands, and may be useful to
us sometimes in negotiationsc
         I am returning the document herewith.

                          Yours sincerelye

Mr Chester

Bear Hr Chester

Folloving your recent telephone conversation with              on 2$th July 1986
in regard to your Club supplying passes for Officers froo the South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Service, 1 am submitting tte folloving information for
you to discuss vich your fellow directors*

On the 16ch July 1986 ___________ fisited your Club along with two other Officers
from the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and Sergeant Godhard
of South Yorkshire Police. The meeting vas hsld vich Mr Ward, Senior Groundsman.
After touring your complex and discussing evscuation plans vith South Yorkshire
Police» it was felt chat the Ambulance Service vould normally only becoae involved
in sny events after they had already occurred and therefore, slight delays could
be experienced on occasions in responding to the incident. To avoid this I vould
ssk if tvo passes could be supplied to the Ambulance Service vhich vould enable
us to snsure that sn Ambulance Officer vas in your ground at all home fixtures.

There vould be no cost to the Club for this facility, and it vould improve ground
safety. In the event of any untovsrd occurrence my Officers vould be in s position
Co idtatify problems prior to them happening asd vould therefore be in a much
better position to respond to any emergency.

If you require any further information chea please do not hesitate to contsct
Mr Wilkinson on Rotherham 361581 extension 259, vho will ask one of our
Offciers responsible for the safety of your ground to contact you.

Yours sincerely -




A Hopkins I
Assistant Chief Metropolitsn Ambulance Officer

Dear Sir,
                        Safety of Sportsgrounds Act                                                               1975
          Application for Increased Crowd Capacity                                                                on the Spion Kop
        I atn grateful to Mr. Bownes for sending us                                                               a copy of your
letter to the Club dated 14 August. This enabled                                                                  me to see it over
the weekend, and to do a little research into the                                                                 points you have
raised.
       The proposed meeting at 2.00 p.m. on 21 August is convenient
for the Club officers. It is likely that the Chairman w i n be present,
but he is indisposed at the moment. A director with special
responsibility for the ground, Mr. Keith Addy and the club secretary
will also attend, and I will hope to deal with the technical side
assisted by John Strange.
        Turning nov to the matters raised in your, letter, I think it
appropriate to make a preliminary response, so that the members of
the Working Party may be informed of our thoughts. No doubt there
will be fuller discussion at the meeting on Thursday.
        I will use the same nomenclature a to f, as is used in your
letter.
<a>    The statement is made that the new terrace construction does
not comply with the plans submitted to the Council for Building
Regulations Approval.
               As far as I can see it is incorrect to say that our drawings

 do not show the steepest slopes.
         X should explain that the submission of plans was
 complicated by changes of mind which were forced on the Club
 uy ux.toums'tances eeyona tnei*-v^ntrol. The intention was to
 redevelop the Kop broadly as the present scheme. They were
 informed at a very late stage that the level of grant which
 had b'een expected may not be forthcoming,, because of demands
 from other clubs following the Bradford fire. The scheme was
 therefore changed in January of this year, to roofing with no
 extra accommodation.   All our drawings had to be changed.
 The contract was let in early February and we sent a very full
 set of drawings and calculations to the Council on 24 February
 1986.   Following a good run in the cup the Board were able
 to revert to the original scheme in March.   By that time the
 steel frame for the roof only scheme was ordered and we had
 to make use of it. The columns and the bracing arrangement
 against wind now had to be modified to receive the new terracing.
 In effect a third scheme had to be prepared utilising steel which
 was more suitable for the roofing only version.   Thus, we had
 to do completely new calculations and drawings in March and April*
 This necessitated a re-submission for building regulations approval.
        However, that re-submission shoved the steepest slope
 which occurs on the terracing, and the drawings submitted in
 March and April show accurately what has been built.
        I enclose a phbto-copy of our letter of 30 April which was
 the one which accompanied most of the drawings relating to the
 new inclined terracing. It will be seen that it lists the drawings
 which were enclosed, fiv$ of them, Nos, 45, 47, 48, 49 and 51,
 being drawings of the Xop terracing. Prints of these five drawings
 are enclosed.
        It will be seen that each of these drawings has a small
 triangular diagram above the steps which gives the rise and the
 tread of the steps, and hence indicates the overall slope.

                                                                  SHEET

        Four of the drawings, Nos. 45, 47, 48 and 51 show
 sections through the main part of the new deck and have a slope
 of 173/330 which is just over 27J-.   The drawing 49 shows a
         «Aw;;h                         dc ene Dack at the stand.
 This has a slope of 173/285 which is just over 31«.   The
 slope occurs everywhere in the wings, and there is nowhere
on the Kop where a greater slope occurs. Thus it is not correct
to say that the terrace 'does not comply with the plans
submitted........ ■ and 'in particular.......is now steeper'.
       We believe that because the City Council did not respond
to the drawings which were sent on 30 April within the five
weeks allowed, we have Building Regulations approval for the
construction shown on those drawings.
       It is expected that this development is subject to the
Safety of Sportsgrounds Act as well as the Building Regulations,
but as the same officers advise the Council on both matters, there
could now be a possibility of a charge of maladministration if the
Council decides to restrict the crowd capacity in the Safety
Certificate because of the slope of the terrace.
       With regard to possible danger,, the Green Guide clearly
envisages 30* slopes because the spacing of crush barriers for
such a slope is given in table 12*3.
       No doubt there will be discussion on this matter at
the meeting on Thursday/ but the slopes we had to use were
determined by the very crude shape of the existing Kop. Matching
the main new part of the terrace to the old part so as to give
good sightllnes determined the slope of 27«, to which we assume there
is no objection* Because of the presence of Penistone Road the
corner had to be swung round and this modified the slope in the
wing areas to just over 31°.    we consider this difference of just
over 1 ° to be acceptable bearing in mind the very good crush
barrier arrangement and the excellent viewing which will stop the
crowd craning forward and thus causing a surge when some exciting
play takes place in the goal area (the viewing can only be judged
by visiting the ground)*

      (b>         The vertical steps from terrace level to the new gangway
      can be measured in different ways depending on which foot it is
      assumed will be used to step down. As a result of observation
                                                         n                   ♦   4   J   •

      found that the spectator generally holds the rail with one hand
      and steps down with the opposite foot* This reduces the step to
      just over 1ft.                Even if he does not use the opposite foot he
—     still steps onto the higher step which is available.
^           3 ut if it is thought to be necessary/ the addition or a
®     short length to the barrier running parallel to the gangway
      can direct the spectator a little further up the slope, so that
      he will automatically take a small step downward. This can be
      discussed with the Fire Service and the Building Control Department.
      Only one or two of the gangways need consideration.


          (c)It has always been intended to sheet down to the ground
       level at the Ozzie Owl corner, but the precise detail had to wait
       until that part of the Kdp was built, and the trees cleared. When the
      iframe had been erected it was my view that it was preferable not to
          sheet to ground level for reasons which I have expressed to the
          Working Party* As my view was not agreed the work is proceeding
          as was intended.

          (d)     We are a little surprised that the Building Control officer
          who has spotted a pre-cast step resting on las we understand it)
          a bearing of 50am instead of the intended 75ram did not point it out
          to either my resident engineer or to the contractor so that i£ there
          was need to take remedial action it could have been done there and
          then*
                    However, we understand that it is one of the concrete steps
          which has a short span, and it rests on steel.   In that case it is
          probably incorrect to say that the seating is sub-standard. The
          Code of Practice to which we are working gives the Engineer
          discretion to reduce the step below 75mm.   (See attached, photocopy
          of clause 5.2.i.3>.   Firstly the seating is subject to a permissible
              tolerance so this will reduce the 75mm.         Also this is a solid step
                                                                 SHEfT   ^

with a full width of bearing to take the load*    In other buildings,
precast units are often        >*«*»«*-                ^ •>
        th* load is concentrated on the narrow beam. A smaller
seating can clearly be permitted where the beam is of full width.
If as we understand it the beam in question is of short span, which
means the load at each end is small, I think it highly likely that
when I know which one out of the approximately 1000 new steps
has the smaller than specified seating I shall take the view that
it is perfectly safe and no action is needed. If I think it necessary
we can weld a small plate to the steel on which it rests to increase
the bearing width, but this is very unlikely to be necessary*
         I am surprised that this matter has been raised in this way.


(e>    The reference to the provision of a toilet and kiosk underneath
the new terrace not featuring in the application is surprising. The
word 'provision' makes it appear that these have been constructed
as part of the scheme* They were built about three years ago* The
work was not designed by us, but I know it was subject to building
control from discussions I had with the Building Control Department
at the time*
         The presence of the kiosk and the toilets was shown on various
of our drawings. For example the drawing 6648/16 (a copy is enclosed)
shows the way in which the foundations had to be orientated to miss
the toilets and also the kiosk* This drawing was submitted for
Building Regulations approval* Drawings 7 and 9 were issued for
distribution to the Working Party together with others to explain
our scheme, on 23 December 1985 (see last page of attached copy
of my letter). These drawings each show parts of the toilets or
of the kiosk protruding from under the stand (copies enclosed).
       The drawing No. 6648/9 showing the rear elevation of the stand,
which was included with our planning application in July 1985 shows
the upper part of the kiosk projecting into the sheeting.   Our
drawing No. 6648/7 which was also distributed via the Working Party
secretariat in December, 1985, shows the toilets and kiosk protruding
from under the roof of the Kop
                                                                   SHEET   6

            The Building Control department was visiting the site very
      frequently during late February and March, 1986, to watch the
      piles being installed immediately alongside the toilets and the
      kiosk* Visits have taken place frequently since May.
             I am at a loss, therefore, to understand why this matter is
      being raised now* However, the kiosk is not used for storage*
      All saleable matsrial is taken back to a central store after each
*2?   game*   During a match the goods on sale consist of no more than
      packets of crisps, and Bovril, tea and Coke served In paper cups*
      The number of cups and packets of crisps is not great and there
      is no significant fire hazard*
             The kiosk performs exactly the same function as the several
      kiosks inside the south and north stands.   These kiosks are also
      on exit routes, and have never been considered a hazard by the
      Fire Service.
             One matter which might cause concern is the fact that the
      roof of the kiosk is combustible. If this matter is considered
      critical, the Club would no doubt be prepared to put a fire resistant
      inner and outer skin on the roof.

m     tf>    The discussidn   on evacuation times which has arisen in the
      last month was apparently sparked off by the Popplewell report
      recommendation No. 24. This says that the Green Guide should be
      revised to make it clear that the suggestion of an eight minute
      evacuation time is concerned with 'the effect of crowd turbulence
      on the rate of flow' which arises if there are delays in evacuating
      spectator accommodation.
             It may be that the wording of the Green Guide had not
      always been understood by other licensing authorities, but there
      was no misunderstanding on this matter in the South Yorkshire
      Working Party when the ground was granted its Safety Certificate
      in 1979. The calculated evacuation time for the Kop with its
      pre-certificate capacity of 20,000 (23,000 until the Ibrox disaster
      in 1971) had been about 16 minutes (or 18$ minutes pre 1971).
      At that time there were far fewer crush barriers to control
       turbulence in the crowd, and the barriers were not so strong.
                                                                          SHEET   7.

EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




 The very experienced police officers on the South Yorkshire
 Working Party, who had been in attendance at games for many years
 said they had never seen turbulence occur when the crowd was
 sufficient to give an evacuation time in excess of 8 minutes.
 It should be remembered that through the 1960's +•»*«                        .
 wuuiu ue sucn tnat “ ore than 11,000 people would be on the
 Kop at almost every game (this number could just get out in
 8 minutes with the exits as they were at that time)
        The present Chief Fire Officer, Mr. Harry Wright, was
 on the Working Party at the time.        He requested an extra exit
 route from the very top of the Kop.        This was constructed by the
 Club at a cost of £16,000 (1979 prices).         He was prepared to
 count the exits onto the pitch as part of the evacuation system
m   an emergency (each gate is controlled by a policeman).             With
these measures the evacuation time in an emergency was brought
below eight minutes, and disregarding the gates onto the pitch the
evacuation time in normal circumstances with a full Kop (16,850)
would be 11 /4 minutes (see attached extract from Minutes of
Working Party dated 2 April 1979).
        The Fxre Servxce at that time took the view that the very
s l i g h t risk of turbulance   (if there really is such a risk) could
not justify greater expense to the c l u b . T he Fire Service in
its advisory role i s    a l w a y s having to balance money against
slight or very slight risk, and this was a calculated decision
which Mr. H.E. Wright supported,,
       I am a frequent attender at the ground. The police are
there every week. There has never been an occurrence to my
knowledge of turbulance associated with this ll3 / 4 minute
evacuation time in the seven years since the ground received
its Safety Certificate.      The police can give their own view.
       I know that at other grounds longer evacuation times have'
applied without there being the slightest trouble. For example,
at Bramall Lane, the evacuation time was almost 20 minutes at
the Bramall Lane end until the new exits were constructed onto
Bramall Lane near the centre of the stand about three years ago.
There had never been -turbulance- of the kind envisaged in the
Green Guide as far as I know.
       Further, in recent years various police forces have
adopted a policy of keeping the gates closed at one end of the
                                                                     '» w <iw w » v,i<--

          rr^ w.          pUto Clie eight minute rule in perspective.
            The words    'eight minute rule' are not really correct”
    of course.  The Green Guide uses the words 'it is suggested'
    It is not nearly so positive as it is about its other
    recommendations.
           With this as background the Club has been quite shocked
    by the suggestion that the gates onto the pitch should be ignored
    in the calculations of evacuation times, and that eight
    minutes should be achieved by means of ordinary exits.          They
    feel this change of view cannot be justified.      The fact that
    Popplewell has clarified what it is the Green Guide suggests
    is of no relevance in Sheffield where we have always interpreted
 the Guide correctly. The change of view is not the result of
 Popplewells clarification.
          If the City Council chose to ignore the gates onto the
pitch     in setting the number of spectators which will be
 allowed the effect would be to limit the capacity of the enlarged
Kop to almost the same as it has been since 1979.         The completely
new exit which has been built at the south end of the Kop, and
the widening of the exit at the north end, will only cancel out
the loss of the exits onto the pitch.
          It should be emphasised that the provision of the new
decking to accommodate almost 6000 more spectators, the new
exit routes, extra toilets, and the part of the roof over the 6,000
extra places, will have cost about E500,000.         It has stretched
ingenuity to find room for the new exit routes, as the Fire
Service will    I   am   sure agree. I see no way in which further exits
could be provided even if there were unlimited money available.
       However, it should be brought to the attention of the City
Council that I entered into discussion with the South Yorks
working Party at a very early date and kept them informed of our
proposals regarding the exit arrangements for the Kop at all times
m    particular. I sent a clear exposition of our      proposals in a                         '
letter dated 25 October, 1985.        It will be seen that near the end

                          y-uuwi wcroTe tne Working Party on
13 November, 1985, and their decision was sent to me in a letter
from S,Y,C,C, dated 14 November 1985, A copy is enclosed. It
Wil 1 5 ® Seen that under itete 2 on Pa9« 2 it is stated that the
Working Party "agreed with your calculations and proposal to increase
the tunnel exit on the north side of Spion Xop to 8 clear units
and to provide a complete new 6 unit staircase on the South side".
       The only change we have made since that subfoission in
October is to improve the arrangements by widening the tunnel
exit to 9 units instead of 8,
       In the light of that completely unequivocal acceptance of
proposals last November the club has proceeded with the scheme
in its entirety. The Fire Service did not voice any second thoughts
until July, 1986, by which time the structures were virtually
complete, rt is now not feasible to construct a new exit route.
The new decking for the extra places, the new exit routes, and the
extra cost of making the roof large enough to provide the extra
places amounts to about S500r000. This would now be wasted,
        It is quite unacceptable that with the Popplewell report
beiftg published in January, 1986, only a few weeks after our proposals
had been approved by the Working Party, the Fire Service did not
give any indication of a possible change of mind until July, 1986.
This is clearly maladministration in the Club's view.
       The Club did not mate the decision to install the extra
decking until Marchf and did not erect it until June/July. If the
change of policy had been indicated earlier the Club could have
been saved much of the additional expense.




       With regard to the proceedings on Thursday, we would like to
have a clear statement of all the points which cause concern, so
that we can properly answer them,   I presume that the various matters
                                                                                   3H££? 10

    will be explained to the Committee by officers of the Council or
    by the Fire Service representatives.          Following that, I presume
    we will be allowed to ask questions.          It will then be our turn to
                     '      ---------                  L i g u e u *

           Finally, I suggest there will be a brief summing up.
           I mentioned in our telephone conversation yesterday that
    the Club thinks it would be very helpful to the Committee in
^   coming to its decision if it would inspect the Kop.                Indeed we
    believe it will be very difficult for them to get a true picture
    to enable them to make a fair decision from drawings.               They would
    be welcome to visit on Friday afternoon, say if they decide to
    reconvene their meeting at Hillsborough, or such other time as
    will suit their convenience.


                                        Yours faithfully.

Dear Sirs,
                            Safety of Sport Grounds Act, 1975
                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ole
          Thank you for your letter of 18 Decenber, 1585
comments of the Building Authority to which I would reply as follows?


Disabled Facilities
a)        There is no doubt that the Kop is covered by the Building
          Regulations and that we shall need Building Regulations
          approval.          Howevert there has effectively been no change
            In the 1985 Regulations*
          Even if there were a change in Regulations, it is obviously
            commonsense that facilities for the di&bled apply to the
          ground as a whole and not to one particular building.                                     At
            the moment there are perfectly adequate facilities under
            the overhang of the roof of the North stand.                               There is a
            level approach.                  The disabled are under the               cover; of the
            cantilever roof.                   Any facilities at the front of the Kop
          would be less sheltered from the rain,                                 more prone to
            disruption hy the fans immediately behind.                            It is not a good
            place at all for .disabled people.

                                     3^7                              SHEET


EASTW OOO * PARTNERS


     With regard to the proposal that a glazed shelter might
     be placed over the disabled accommodation in front of the
     North stand, it was not our intention that any seats within
     the North stand would have an obscured view although a few
     of the spectators might have to look through the glass of
     the canopy to see the near touchline.    There are materials
     available for the glazed roof .which might prove to be safe for
     that purpose.

     I regard it as regrettable that there has been such a
     negative attitude on this particular matter.    We have not,
     of course, taken the design study any further with regard
     to the possibility of a covering for part of the disabled
     erea nearest to the Kop end of the North stand, but would
     reconsider the matter if the Working Party has a change of
     heart.


     Enlarged Ko p
          With regard to the request for a barrier to protect
     the ladies toilet, it has perhaps not been realised that
     there is handrailing already in place.    A gap will be
     created for an entrance to the ladies toilet.     The
     final version of the proposed arrangements is shown on
     the attached print of drawing number $649/53.     The new
     brickwork is shown shaded.


     Roofing the Ko p
          We are really surprised by the suggestion that the
     steel frame of the gable walls and presumably the back of the
     stand should be sheeted over.   Zt is a common feature of
     every stand structure that I know of in any football ground
     in the country that the sheeting rails and other bracing
     members are exposed on the inner face.    In older structures
     they are generally only at 1.2 m centres hut in more m o d e m
     structures they are generally at 1,8 o centres.    With the
     1,3 m spacing it would be extremely difficult indeed to
     climb up except adjacent to a column.    However, i know of
     no instance where the sheeting rails of an existing stand
     are regarded as being such a hazard that they should he boxed
     in, with an inner skin as well as an outer skin.        I find
     it very surprising that this matter is heing pressed.

          This corrsspondence on these matters leads me to believe
     that there would be great advantags if ths Club's advisers were
     pressnt for part of each of the meetings o£ the Officer Working
     party.       Matters of this kind nssd to be discussed round the
     table rathsr than in lengthy correspondence.                     We can be of great
     assistance in providing information which may rssult in fewer
     matters becoming contentious.             It is also inevitable that we

     to givs the opportunity to comment at an early stage.                          The
     plans are incomplete in some respects and this may lead to
     misunderstanding of vhafc is intended or a lacfc of appreciation
     of the thinking behind what is propossd.                     Thers is also ths
     difficulty^in the light of comments received from the Club, and
     indeed those from the Working Party, quite significant
     changes may take place at a very late stage*                     It is desirable
     that any late changes be dealt with in as short a time as
     possible.          In this           r now enclose six prints of each of
     our drawings numbers 7C. 8A, 9A. 17A and S6*                    As the Club
     will be wishing to place an order for the inew.building not
     later than the end of January, it may be that an o^al prmsentation
     to your Working Part of what is proposed might be beneficial

Mr* H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives* and stressed that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best In Europe* Crowds had been
averaging 11*000 this season and* viewed purely as a football operation, tie Club
had been loetng money since 1967* Commercial ventures had made the Club
viable* and Itwas hoped to expand this side ol the Club's activities* The Club's
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations*

IT W A S A G R E E D -

1*    That, whilst Designating Orders did not specify time limits for the Issue of
General Safety Certificates, it was essential to aim for the Certificate to be Issued
by & e start of the 1S79/80 Season.

   2*    That, as the Club wanted to attract representative games, the atm should
   be far the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds*

   3*    That as much work as possible should be carried out in the close season*
   bearing (n mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather» thia
   will be more restricted than usual* The Annual Jehovah's Witness Pally had
   also to be borne (n mind*

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

    I have now received the detailed comments of all of the disciplines
    represented on the Working Party.

    These have been collated Into the attached schedule which, together with
    plans, confirm formally In writing the matters discussed by the working
    Party with the Club over the series of meetings held so far and which
    the County Council feel require attention so as to secure reasonable
    safety at the Ground.

    They are, of course, Individual requirements on specific matters and are
    additional to the general requirements set out in the specimen form of
    General Safety Certificate forwarded to the Club with m y letter of
    6th December, 1976, and discussed at the meeting held on 13th December,
    1976.

    After the Club baa had the opportunity of considering the schedule, perhaps
    you would let m e taow which of the requirements you feel will be abie to
    be carried out In the close season.

    Should you have any queries, Mr* D. Vaughan of m y staff (ext* 422) would
    be happy to discuss them wife you.

                                                        Yours faithfully.

                As design of the roof over Spion Kop and the extension of the
    terracing proceeds we thonght 'that the W o r k i n g Party should be
    given an early opportunity to comment upon the proposals.                                                    At this
    stage the roof, although it will be an impressive structure, does
    not hold the individual interests of all atenbers of the Working
    Party and we will deal with the roof at a later date.                                                    However, we
    would,like to discuss the parameters surrounding provision for the
    disabled, the increased capacity of the Splon Kop and the exit routes

    showing in outline the areas of terracing for the enlerged Spion
    Kop together with the exits/ - •
                It was initially thought that the disabled could be accommodated
    along the front of Spion Kop between the North stand in front of the
    perimeter fence, which would be set back about two metres.                                                   There
    are disadvantages to this proposal.                                             The advertising boards would
    need to be mounted well into the perimeter track level reducing
    its width.                   The disabled would be in the 1firing line1 of mis~cued

The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed,
la che circumstances, the Officer Working Party consider that the
proposals for the disabled suggested by the Police should be supported
subject, of course, to there being no obstruction of exit routes and
flows.

2 m     Eniarged_Sgiog_gog

The Officer Working Part? agreed with      calculations and proposals to
increase the tunnel exit on the"north side of tae Soion R o d to I cTsar^
units and to. orovj.de a                 r •»»**      •, - .-

Accordingly, the Officer Working Party agree that, subject to the following
points» the proposals for the enlarged Spion Kop are generally acceot*blas~

(a)   adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the upper
       rear and the new south side exit routes;
(b)   to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents1
       toilets and the new ladies1 toilets in the new six unit staircase
       on che south side;
(c)   to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
       gates in the pieth perimeter fence (as at Bramall Lane);
Cd)   to confirmation of the Qi&zb*r o£ aev turnstiles to be provided on
       the south side and on the Penistone Road side;
(e)   until acceptable alternatives are available, the new exit gates to
          fitted vieh a turn-bar arrangement under the control of stewards.

3.    Roofing of Spion gop

It was accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals has been supplied
to date, but the Building Authority point out that it appears that the gables
are not to be lined and thus it would be comparatively easy for then to be
climbed.

Also the Police asked me to stress that should any of the proposed works on
enlarging or roofing the Spion Sop take place other than in the cloee season,
it will he a requirement that the areas concerned will heve to be secured to
prevent unauthorised access.

4.    Crowd Flow at the Cappings Lane end of the Stadium

The Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the merging of spectators
frcs all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings      end.

It was agreed that it was difficult to see bow this could be overcome, ae the
physical restraints to achieve this could conceivably be more of a danger than
allowing the present position to continue, but I was requested to register the
point.

                                         Yours faithfully._________

Dear Dick,

                                                                   Safety Work 1986

           During the suinraer inspection Inspector Calvert asked for some
of the barriers at the Leppings Lane end of the ground to be
removed so as the allow easier access into the various pens*
Rather than ask Ackroyd & Abbott's sub-contractor to do the work,
who were at that time working overtime, we instructed George Shaw

Desr s i r

Safety of Spores Grounds Act lf>75 “
Future Admlnlstration of the Council's Certificating Function

Following a meeting on Tueedey 10th March I have given some further thought to
the above subject*

Many points were raised et Che nee ting but I think that the general feeling wee
that the roles of each Authority involved in the system should be defined
perhaps along the lines adopted by Che South Yorkshire County Council*

I have no objection in principal to rolss being defined in this way but I ehould
make it clear that If it is agreed thst particular Authorities adopt particular
roles then they will be under s duty to consult with other interested parties
where there is an overlap of interest* As I see it the Author!ey wfcich carries
out a particular role will have the responsibility of sdvising the Council as
Certificsting Authority on all natters falling within that Lead Authority role-

1 have drawn up a draft Schedule which ettenpts to define Lead Authority roles.
I should point out that the draft ie intended to be open fordiscussion and I
would therefore welcoos your comments on it* Wouldyou please also 1st nsknow
if thsrs ars any other natters which should be included in the Schedule.

Moving onto the question of inspections of stsdia, this point was also discussed
at the neetlng on 10th March. My view is that the existing systen of hi annual
United inspections is no longer appropriate? I feel that one najor inspection
per year should be carried out on each stadlun which should include all the
areas and installations within the scope of the legislation. To back up this
inspection there should he a number of “during perforaance* inspections by
Officers. I think tbat there la general sgreenent in re1stion ro "during
performance" inspections as they would highlight the performance of the safety
system at each atadlua whilst it is in operation*
                                                           Coot*

                                                                            734690 • Mr. Bovnes
                            F « wtapfrvw •nutria* OA 0 * mrt* plMM     ................ t»lw Ced*C742)
                                                  Ttfttx W O   (AdmiftMtoA ft Uftti)
Perhaps "during performance" iospections could be srrsng&i *o Chat each
Authority carries out such inspections Independently with a degree of central
co-ordination to prevent two Inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
first step towards the development of a programme of iospections it might be
appropriate for me to arrange s joint inspection involving representatives fr*B
all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
encountered*

noving on to the wonting psrty structure i m i n * *-    ci«ar tr«*       feeing
of 10th March that some clarification of its status is rsquired. It is
reasonably clear from the County Council’s records that the working psrty as
euch was actually a decisico making body presumably acting under delegated
powers* However, the normal City Council practice    is that the principal powers
remain with a Committee or Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purposes
Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
myself). I would therefore propose to ask tbe Panel to accept the working party
as a Corum for discussion.

I take s view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Psrty as
a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
to be submitted to the Certificating Authority. I propose thst when an
Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with
my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then make arrangements for the
meeting to take place. An agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will prepare s list
showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
Authority. This list will be circulated as wall*

Would you plesse consider the points I bave raised and let me have your comments
on them in due course; it will be necessary for me t o formulate a report to the
General Purposes Panel on the sdministration of the Certification system.

Yours faithfully,

                  be adequately c o n tro lled by means of "ongoing" maintenance.
              5.       The d e fe c tiv e rendering to th e f i n a l e x it g a te w all requires

                       p r o je c tile s by the crowd. Such m ate ria l should be collected
                       and su ita b ly diaposed of.
               2        The main f i r s t s id room req u ire s to be aupplied with adequate

                        become i l l o r injured w ith in the sp o rts ground.
                  3     In order to ensure th a t th e fo o tb a ll club f u lly discharge th e ir
                        dutv to supply an adequate number of f i r s t a i d e r s , I would req u ire
                        th a t a minimum of 1 2 be employed to render f i r s t aid to sep ctato rs
                        during an a c t i v i t y . I f the club continue to use th e voluntary
                        se rv ice s of th e S t. John's Ambulance Brigade, then i t would be
                        necessary to form alise t h e i r re la tio n s h ip w ith them in orde r to
                         eaaure adequate deployment.
                                                                                            D O C U M E N T No.
4.   I a n to understand th a t the club i s now ptepared to ap p o in t,
     in w ritin g , a sa fe ty o f f ic e r of adequate s ta tu s and a u th o rity .
     I would propose th a t he has the functions described in the d ra ft

 FUTURE ADMINISTRATION Of THE COUNCIL'S CERTIFICATION FUNCTION
 Xntroduccion

 The Panel w ill r e c a ll chat on 1 st April 1986 the City Council in h e rite d from the
 South Yorkshire County Council the role of c e r t if i c a t i n g Authority under the
 1975 A ct.   The Act i t s e l f i s b a sic a lly aimed a t     ensuring adequate standards of
 safety a t designated s ta d ia ; th ere are       three of      these in Sheffield a t the nome
 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield Uniced fo o tb all. Club, sad che
 Owlerton Sports Stadium. A d e ta ile d report on the Aet and i t s ap p lication in
 S heffield was submitted to the Panel on 6 th Hay 1986.

 The Current S itu atio n

 The Panel a t i t s meeting in Msy 1986 id e n tifie d several main areas *or fu rth e r
 in v e s tig a tio n .
  F i r s t l y i t was accepted a t the time th a t the broad o u tlin e s of the
. ad m in istrativ e system organised by the County Council should be continued fo r
  the tla e being. This system has b o w been reviewed and the proposed
  reorganisation i s d e ta ile d l a t e r in th is re p o rt.
 The Panel also askad th a t the Bealth and Safety Executive be kept informed of
 a l l m atters r e la tin g to sp o rts ground sa fety and th a t th e Association of
 M etropolitan A u th o ritie s a lso be asked about the BSE's Involvement• As f a r as
 keeping th e BSE informed of sa fety developments a t the s ta d ia the Executive made
 i t f a i r l y p lain th a t they would not make any comments. The p ra c tic e was
 th ere fo re discontinued. The involvement of the AMA in th e BSE issue has been
 somewhat f o r e s ta lle d by a c tio n a t c en tral Government le v e l to reylew Che BSE's
 re la tio n s h ip with lo c a l a u th o r i t ie s t t h is review wae announced in the
 Government's rep ly to the popplevell Report but no r e s u l ts of th a t reyiew have
 y et been received* F o rtu n ately , however, the C ouncil's D irector of Bealth and
 CEDSUfr Services has perm itted h is O ffic e r's to provide ahealth and sa fety
 input in to the d e cisio n tak in g process in r e la tio n to sa fe ty of sports grounds. *
 This s u b s titu tio n , th e re fo re , tem porarily covers che ahsenee of an input fro®
 the BSS»

  The Panel also made reference to con su ltatio n on the sa fety of sports grounds
  policy w ith the o th er D i s t r i c t Councils in South Yorkshire. Q ofortunately(
  attempt* a t arranging c o n su lta tio n meetings have been unsuccessful to date* I t
  i s proposed to t r y egain to organise some c o n su lta tio n s in che f a i r l y near
  f u tu r e , perhaps when the C e rtific a tio n system has s e t tl e d down in each area*

  The d ra ftin g of new sa fe ty c e r t i f i c a t e conditions in c o n su lta tio n w ith the
  C ouncil's ad visers has been progressing s te a d ily and new d r a f t conditions are
  c u rre n tly under co n sid eratio n by those advisers* I t i s hoped th a t the new
  conditions w ill be submitted to the Psnel a t i t s meeting in October fo r f in a l
  spproval;        v
  As to the question of charging fees under the 1975 l e g i s l a ti o n , i t should be
  be made clear! t h a t such fee s a re only payable on the g ran t of a C ertificate*
  I t i s a n tic ip a te d chat i f the Panel approves the new C e r tif ic a te conditions e
  C e rtific a te w ill then be issued to Sheffield United and a t th at time i t is
  proposed to deal v irh tn t cuestior. o* fees.

Follow!ag a thorough teview of the le g i s l a ti o a I t has become c l e i r th a t s
d e ta ile d adm inistrative system Deeds to be established la coonectlon' with the
C ouncil's C e rtific a tin g fra c tio n . Discussions oa t h is m atter have been underway
f o r soae time with the P o lic e , the Fire Service, the C ouncil's Building
Surveyor and the D irector of Bealtb and Consumer Services oa the establishment
of such a sy stea.

Accepting th a t the Council as the C e rtific a tin g A uthority w in s e t on the basis
of advice from experts (such ss the Fire Service) the question a rises as to how

an O fficer lurking Party which was apparently used ss e forua fo r discussion
between O ffice rs p rio r to the fl& sl formulation of advlee to the Council* That
p a r tic u la r working party a lso appeared to have had some decision making powers.

As I t i s e sse n tia l tb at meetings taks place due to th a p o ten tial overlap of
requirements in many areas, a l l the A uthorities and O fficers have now agreed
tb a t i t would be appropriate to e sta b lish a revised f o r e of the working p a rty tc, )
perform a sim ila r function fo r the City Council. I t i s recommended th a t tha
"Safer? of Sports Grounds Advisory Group" (which would consist of
re p re se n ta tiv e s frcm the P o lice, tbe Fire Servlee, th e Building Surveyor's
D ivision and tbe Department of Bealth and Consumer S e rv ic e s), would function as
a forun fo r discussion between O fficers; i t s most re g u la r use would probably be
tbe discussion of ite o s of adviee to tbe Council before they are fin ally
form ilated by tbe appropriate Authority. Meetings of th e Group would be held a t
cha request of oae o r more A u thorities sad oa re c e ip t o f a request tba Seed of

A uthority would be noted. I t i s then an ticip ated th a t d e ta ile d w ritten advlee

l a ad d itio n tha Bead of A dm laistratioa and Legal Department w ill keep copies of

Supplementary advice and explanatory notes to tbe statutory
Guidance to local authorities given by tbe Secretary of State
under section 10B(2) of tbe Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

Introduction
1.   Tbe following advice does not form part of the statutory
Guidance given under section 10B of the 1975 Act. The following
advice is given in good faith but it should be reaeabered that
only the courts can rule authoritatively on interpretation of
points of lev.
Objective of Inspections
2.   The object of the inspections is to aonitor the suitability
of the terns and conditions of the safety certificate (where
issued) in the light of any change in the condition of the ground
and secondly, to assist local authorities in enforcing compliance
with the terms and conditions of the safety certificate or other
notice served on the ground occupier.
3.   Local authorities aay wish to note that the inspection is
not intended to shift responsibility for spectator safety away
froa the holder of any safety certificate or ground occupier, but
rather to help see that he succeeds in achieving (and
aaintaining) the safety standards intended to be set by any
certificate for the nuaber of spectators authorised to enter the
ground for a specified activity.
General
4.   As the size, age, configuration, condition and usage of
designated sports grounds as well as the attitude of management
can give rise to different inspection needs, the discretion of
local authorities to carry out aore frequent or more extensive
inspections than is laid down by section 10B of the 1975 Act ia
not restricted. The requirements of the Statutory Guidance have
been set at what is seen as the desired minimum likely to achieve
the objective described above leaving authorities free to add to
the content of the inspections or increase their frequency
according to locally determined needs. In this context local
authorities aay wish to bear in nind that inspections carried out
under section 10B of the 1975 Act are in addition to, not a
substitute for thoee required to be carried out under the terms
and conditions of the safety certificate by or on behalf of the
bolder.
Inspection frequency
5.   As section 10B(3) of the 1975 Act stipulates that an
inspection ehould take place of a "designated" ground at least
once every twelve months, this frequency must be observed even if
the issue of a safety certificate is delayed. Where a safety
certificate has not been issued, the inspections carried out
prior to its preparation and issue should be such as to fulfil
the requireaents of the Statutory Guidance. Once a safety
certificate has been issued at least one further inspection of
 the ground should be carried cut either:-
 vithin a year of its issue, or

 Vi thin a year of tha last inspection, whichever is the earlier*

 Thereafter, inspections should take place at least annually froa
 the date of the last inspection.

 Where an inspection of a sports ground takes place at the
 discretion of tha local authority for aoae other reason, for
 !2“ 8U       5J8ult.of           alteretions or an application for
 aaendasnt to the safety certi fiesta, that inspection can be
 regarded as an inspection carried out under section 10B of the
 1975 Act provided the criteria of the Statutory Guidance are met.
 Inspection Teaa
6.   The Statutory Guidance allows the local authority to
determine how best to arrange and effect inspections under
section 10B of the 1975 Act and does not stipulate that thev
should be carried out by a particular professional discipline.
As it is nonetheless iaportant that inspecting officers are
qualified for that purpose, the guidance places an onus on the
local authority to be satisfied on this account.  (The Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds (paragraph 36) envisages that
inspections arranged by ground aanageaent will be carried out by
soaeone who is professionally qualified. Local authorities mav
wish to consider whether inspecting officers should also be
professionally qualified.}

7.    Local authorities are also asked to bear in aind the
potential advantages of a te&a approach to inspections under the
Statutory Guidance and the role of the fire authority, building
authority and the police. Local authorities in London and
aetropolitan counties aay therefore wish to arrange at least one
inspection per year to be carried out with a representative of
     fire authority in attendance. Elsewhere, local authorities
w i n no doubt wish to consider inclusion of a member of the fire
service as veil as a representative of the building authority.
Local authorities aay also wish to consult the Chief Officer of
Police so that the opportunity can be given for a police officer
to attend at least one inspection each year. (It is not intended
that these coneiderations should interfere with any internal or
locally agreed arrangeaents between the local authority, fire
authority, building authority, police and any other agency with
an interest in safety at the ground.)
Scope of Inspections

8.   Where possible all the iteas listed in paragraphs 3 and 4
of the Statutory Guidance should be inepected and tested, it is
recognised however that there aay be occasions when one or aore
of these eleaents cannot, for soae reason, be inspected. T o r
this reason there is a degree of discretion within paragraphs 2 -
 4 of the Statutory Guidance. In this vay it is hoped to avoid
the situation trtiere the local authority has to pay repeated
visits to a ground in order to cosply with the statutory
                               4*3^

 the ground should be carried out either:*
 vithin a year of its issue, or

 within a year of the last inspection, whichever is the earlier.
 Thereafter, inspections should take place at least annuallv from
 the date cf the last inspection.
Where an inspection of a sports ground takes place at the
discretion of the local authority for sone other reason, for
example as a result of proposed alterations or an application for
amendment to the safety certificate, that inspection can be
regarded as an inspection carried out under section 10 B of the
1975 Act provided the criteria of the Statutory Guidance are aet>
Inspection Team

6.   The statutory Guidance allows the local authority to
determine how best to arrange and effect inspections under
section 1 0 B of the 1975 Act and does not stipulate that they
should be carried out by a particular professional discipline.
As it is nonethelese inportant that inspecting officers are
qualified for that purpose, the guidance places an onus on the
local authority to be satisfied on this account. (The Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds (paragraph 36) envisages that
inspections arranged by ground management will be carried out by
someone who is professionally qualified. Local authorities aay
wish to ccr.sid&r whether i:.sptitir»y officers should also be
professionally qualified.)

7.   Local authorities are also asked to bear in mind the
potential advantages of a team approach to inspections under the
Statutory Guidance and the role of the fire authority, buildiner
authority and the police. Local authorities in London and
metropolitan counties may therefore wish to arrange at least one
inspection per year to be carried out with a representative of
the fire authority in attendance. Elsewhere, local authorities
will no doubt wish to consider inclusion of a member of the fire
service as well as a representative of the building authority.
Local authorities may also wish to consult the Chief Officer of
Police so that the opportunity can be given for a police officer
to attend at least one inspection each year. (It is not intended
that these considerations should interfere with any internal or
locally agreed arrangements between the local authority, fire
authority, building authority* police and any other agency with
an interest in safety at the ground.)
Scope of Inspections
8.   Where possible all the items listed in paragraphs 3 and 4
of the Statutory Guidance should be inspected and tested. It is
recognised however that there may be occasions when one or more
of these elements cannot, for some reason, be inspected. T o r
this reason there is a degree of discretion within paragraphs 2 -
 4 of the Statutory Guidance. In this way it is hoped to avoid
the situation where the local authority has to pay repeated
visits to a ground in order to comply with the Statutory
G u id a n c e *

9.   The Statutory Guidance does not require that an inspection
should take place at any particular tine so the local authority's
discretion to carry out an inspection whilst the ground is in use
is not restricted. An "in-use" or "during performance"
inspection could therefore constitute part of the.inspection
required by section 10B of the Act even though it might not be
sufficient (having regard to the requirements of the Statutory
Guidance) to be an inspection itself*
Records
10* Local authorities will doubtless need to keep a record of
all inspections carried out under the Statutory Guidance and may
wish to consider whether a copy of any report/record should be
sent to the holder of the eafety certificate. Local authorities
are also asked to consider affording a reasonable opportunity for
any such report to be mads available for inspection, if so
requested, by members of the public.

     removed, and the crush barrier be modified to join onto the end
     of the new ateel supported barrier directly adjacent to it*                                        B.S.

1.3    A timber hut at ground level, voder the KOP structure should be

1*4    An additional length of crueh barrier Is required to be Installed
       adjacent to the base of the ramped stairway from the extended
       terracing. This was agreed on site by Dr. Eastwood.                                              B.S.

1.5    An area of the corrugated metal sheeting used as cladding to the
       side of the Kop Is corroded and tom.                                                             HCS

1*7 At some positions within the new development there Is a
    difference in height between a terraced area and radial gangway
    of over 600mm. As such these areas require to be protected by a
    suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.                                                          HCS

1.8    Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
       minor repairs. I t *as a g re e d , however, t h a t t h i s defect would be
       adequately controlled by means of **ongoing" maintenance.                    HCS

1.9    The defective rendering to the final exit gate wall requirea to
       be repaired.                                                                                     HCS

2.)    A broken glass panel in the west gable end should be replaced*                                   B.S.

2.2    The step between seats           12   and 13 on row 43 is loose and shouldbe
       correctly bedded down.                                                                           B.S.

2.3    It Is important to ensure that the groundoan'a store beneath this
       stand is not used for the storage of potentially inflammable
       fertilisers or weedkillers.                                       HCS

3.0    West Stand

3.1    Signs over the front parapet wall at the upper level are to be
       permanently secured at the following positions:*

       a) between seats 1 and 14                                                                        B.S.

         Additionally the sign bracket a adjacent to seats 62 and 72 are to
         be correctly bent (or othe rtflas suitably checked) and aecured.

         Rain water drainage holes through the upper level alab should
         have a gauze inserted ao as to inhibit the dropping of missiles
         onto the crowd below.                                                                                 B.S.

 3.3     It is felt that discussion ahould take place regarding the
         suitability of the gate fastening device at the base of the
         e& ergency exit ssaltva? on ehe south end o f t h i s stand. The
         fastening consisting of a patent lockable barrel bolt which
         cannot saslly be unfastened Id the direction of travel, and is
         impossible to be unfastened from the other side.                                                      B.S.

4.0      Miscellaneous Points

         At a number of points within the atadlua various pieces of
         abandoned builders1 waate were readily available for use aa
         projectiles by the crowd. Such material should be collected and
         suitably disposed of.                                                                                 HCS

        The provision of qualified first aiders is being reviewedat the

   1           S.W.F.C. - Buildine Surveyor's memorandum of 2.2.88

               The Building Surveyor's representative outlined the
               memorandum and the circumstances which gave rise to it.
               Superintendent Stsjart indicated that the gangway problem
cm             had been discussed with Sheffield Wednesday who were
               going to take measures with their Stewards in an attempt
               to resolve it. As far as the turnstile question was
               concerned, a pattern has developed of people arriving
               some 15 mins. before the start of the game hoping to
               gain admiasion. This trend may be due to the banning of
               alcohol at sports grounds which could lead to people
               going elsewhere for refreshment prior to the football
               match.  As the available turnstiles operated quite
               effectively for the majority of the time, and cb*t the
               late arrival problem could perhaps only be dealt with by
               education of spectators.




   2           owlerton - General Principles

               Discussion took place about the south and east terraces
               which Eastwoods in their original report had recommended
<•             be closed. There was no disagreement with the idea of
               closing the south terrace {which is in a very poor
               condition), but whether or not there should be
               maintained along the front of the terrace a public
               walkway so that complete public access could be allowed
               around the perimeter of the stadium was not final is ed»
               It was mentioned that the Company planned in due course
               perhaps to re-site the speedway pit on the site of the
                old south terrace.



                                   -
       3        The Canacitv of Owlerton Sports Stadium

                There was a fairly lengthy discussion about capacity
                principally revolving around Eastwoods1 original capacity
                estimate of 6,781 people. There was also discussion
                about controlling the access, of spectators to particular
                areas or zones of the stadium by various, means.            It was
                recognised that such area control would be difficult as
                the stadium is r.ot at tne moment physically split into
                different zones o r s e c t i o n s . A s t h e stadium at the

             Means of Escape in Case of Fire

             North Stand

                     W it h the exception of a small hut and the steel
             clad groundsman's accommodation, which are both
             located under the ramp and not the stand, the timber
             clad buildings have been removed.
                     We believe that the reference in the minutes
             dated 7 August, 198 5 was to storage facilities and
             not to buildings.

             Spion Kop

              a)     The small timber programme kiosk will be

     removed so that the width of the exit route is not
     reduced.
     b)     This item has already been dealt wi t h in our
     letter dated 15 January.
     c)     Some of the concrete terrace steps have been
     repaired but, as has always been accepted, the
     repairs will continue to be a regular maintenance
     job.
     d)     The intention of the mesh was not to prevent
     people from climbing onto the steelwork but to act
     as a guard preventing spectators damaging and
     possibly loosening the rear sheeting.
            We disagree that spectators climb onto the
     steelwork in large numbers although we do not deny
     that the police have,     at some matches, had to tell
     a few spectators not to sit on the steelwork.
             The cost of erecting a full height fence
     woul d b e several thousands of pounds.      T h e Club is
     not at present contemplating that magnitude of
     expenditure just to protect a few spectators from
     their own foolish behaviour.
     e)      There are four or five lengths of barrier
     where the drop in front is just over one metre,
     but as far as w e are aware this has not created
     any hazard.      In fact to the contrary, because
      people can leave the ground by going under the
     barriers onto the lateral gangway.       This is a
      common feature of most league grounds.
             The welding is performing well arid it seems
      that any additional vertical support is
      unnecessary.     However, the welding can be inspected
      at    regular intervals to make sure that    it   con­
      tinues   to   hold the mesh securely.
EASTWOOO *    PARTNERS                                       SHfET




     f)      Exit gates are unlocked before spectators enter
     the ground.     The Jceys then remain in the possession
     of the steward(s), given the responsibility of
     unlocking the gates, until after the end of the
     match and all spectators have left the ground.

     West Stand

     a)      Do we understand correctly that the
     reference to 'timber framed and clad units'       is   to
     the bar fittings at first floor level?        If so, then
     those fittings were part of the original construction
     for which Building- Regulations Approval has been
     granted.      There has not been any previous comment
     about the presence of the bar fittings in that stand
     or other stands.       We do not consider that they
     present a hazard.
     b)      This item has already been dealt with in our
      letter dated 15 January.

      South Stand

      a)     (i)   We note the comment about the doors and
      this point has b e e n dealt with under the regular
      procedures of obtaining a Fire Certificate under
      the Fire precautions A c t of 1971 for the offices.
      F i r e Officer Roger woodhouse has been dealing with

      the matter.
           (ii)          We see the principle behind the creation
      of fire compartments.      That is sensible.   Sealing
      off the windows is not difficult but the provision
      of ducting to the south wall is, and furthermore
      very expensive.       A major exercise such as providing
      ducting would by necessity have to wait until the
      redevelopment of the South stand in 1991.

6ASTWOOO » PARTNERS                                                                 SHEET




          (iii)         we agree that stored materials should be
     removed from stairways and exit routes.                          There is a
     particular problem outside the kitchen area, at
     ground floor level, but the caterers have b e e n asked
     to clear that particular area well before the public
     are admitted on match days.
     b)      (i)        it was agreed in 1979 that the fans
     ventilating the lounges at first floor level should
     be fitted with intumescent grilles with smoke
     controlled shutters.               Those grilles and shutters
     were fitted although we see that two recently
     installed fans do not appear to have similar grilles
     and shutters.           As the form of fire protection from
     those lounges has already been agreed with the Fire
     Service, the Club are not prepared to have ducting
     installed, although the new fans should perhaps be
     fitted wi t h intumescent grilles and smoke controlled
     s hu t t e r s •
            (ii)        A close inspection of the gas supply pi p e ­
     work in the five bars revealed that four bars have
     valves fitted to the feed pipe or to the appliance
     when there is only one appliance in the bar.                                 The
     pipework in the bar nearest to the Spion Kop has
     been replaced recently but without a valve.
                        However,    t h e r e is a m a s t e r v a l v e ,   at
     ground       floor    level,    which     isolates the gas              supply
     to t h e w h o l e o f the f i r s t floor.            That valve was
      installed at t h e request of t h e F i r e Service                      in

      1980.
          (iii)         We confirm that all the timber facing onto
      the public circulation areas was treated with an
      intumescent paint during the w or k carried out in
      19 80.       Since then the walls ha v e been re-decorated
EASTW O O D »   PARTNERS                                          SHEET




       but this does not reduce the effect of the
       intumescent paint u n d e r n e a t h .
              (iv)         We cannot understand this comment because
       the paint store was constructed in its present
      position on the advice of the F ir e Officer.           A
       special *non-sparking'        light fitting was even
       installed on his recommendation.          It is not contem-
      plated to move the store again after spending money
      to build the store in its present position.
                (v)   We do not consider that the two laminate
      covered toilet kiosks present a hazard.            A s for the
      wooden cupboards,        they have been on the first floor
       for many years and no previous adverse comments
      have been ma d e b y     the Fire Service about their
       presence.
              <vi)    We agree that the holes round the cables
       should b e plugged with an appropriate fire resisting
      material.
             (vii)    As far as we are aware all doors leading
       onto the first floor and ground floor circulation
       areas we r e provided wit h 2 5mm rebates and the doors
       made up to a nominal one hou r st an d a r d .    That work
       was done in 19 79-80.
            (viii)    W e agree that the spaces above toilet
       accommodates should not be used for storage but
       believe that the club have now removed the stored
       materials.

       c)       we believe that clinbing over the existing low
       wall does not present any difficulty in the event
       of an emergency,        spectators will go over the wall
       whether there are gates or not.           W e do not consider
       that the installation of gates is necessary.

      d)        Escape through the rear of the stand has always
      been accepted by the Officer Working Party.         Further­
      more,      it has been readily accepted with the
      protection which has been provided so far to the
      escape routes.


      Automatic Fire Protection

                We will suggest to the Club that proposals
       should be put forward for the provision of a fire
      detection system but the system is not likely to be
       installed until the major re-development of the South
       stand which is planned for 19 91

       Emergency Lighting

                Testing of the emergency lighting system is
       being organised and we will be contacting the Fire
       Service in the next day or so to agree a date and
       time for carrying out the test.
                T h e testing of the general electrical circuits
       will also be organised over the next few weeks and
       a current IEE Certificate produced.

       Fire Alarms

                The Club was told by the Fire Service to p u t
       the call points in the bars in the stands.        Moving
       the call points again is out of the question.

       Inldcator/control Panel

                T h e Officer Working Party was asked, at the
        time of installation,     where the indicator/central
        panel should b e placed.     The Club was told that it
        should be located in the Police control centre,
        wher e it is now.     N o duplicate panel was asked for
        and it is not considered that o n e is necessary.

     Gates
             The comments about the gates are noted.


     The Club h a v e expressed to us their increasing c o n ­
cern that w i t h the introduction of each n e w member of the
Fi r e Service to the Officer Working Party new or
different recommendations are put forward by that officer,
which in some cases openly contradict the recommendations
offered by his predecessors.     Whereas we agree that    many
of the observations and recommendations are of a
subjective nature the Club cannot be expected to continue
spending money on matters which are purely a matter of
personal opinion.     Some consistency in the comments
offered by members of the Officer Working Party wou ld be
appreciated.

                                                                   i

Dear Sir,

Do you provide the best standards of Ambulance Care for the large tmftber of
^ployeea and Menbers of the Public wiilst they are on your premises?

Major Sporting Events have always relief heavily oa the resources vhicb are
provided by the Voluntary First Aid Organisatioas,

We acknowledge the very valuable contribution which the St Joha Afflbulance
sad B r i t i s h Bed Cross Society make. there are, however, areas where the
level of care which we can provide, of necessity, exceed those which can be
provided by the Voluntary Societies. These include Advanced Afflbulance Aid,
Treatment of Fractures with the most modern equipment available
(particularly Spinal Injuries), Stabilisation of patients with Heed
Injuries,         Intubation,  Istravenous   Iofusion,   Cardiac   Monitoring,
Defibrillation and the Administration of Drugs,

Can *e be of assistance to you ? If so, get in touch with Don Trueman on
Rotherham (0709) 828820 to discuss your requirements.

If we can‘t help with your immediate requirements, please place this letter
on file for eny future occasion whea we may be able to essist.

I am sure cbat you vill be more than happy with any the facilities vhich we
are able to offer.

Yours faithfully.

          THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

          ANNUAL INSPECTION OF SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB
          ON THE 19 th MAY, 1988

          I write with reference to the above sad following our recent site meeting
          and safety inspection of the named premises.

          I w o u l d confirm that while the general standard* of health and »«fety
          being maintained were found to be satisfactory a number of points did
          require attention.      I have itemised these below for your convenience.

           Spion K o p Development

                    The pylon situated co the left-hand side of the kop was not suitably
           1
                    protected from unauthoriaed access and climbing.

           2        To aeveral locations around the kop, accumulations of asaociated
                    £ i U « s wastes and stonework that could easily be obtained for use as
                    projectiles were noted.

           3.       At some positions within the new development, there is a d^ l ^ enc® in
                    height between a terraced area and radial gangway of over 600mm. I
                    ™ u ? d a d ^ T t h a t these areas be protected by a suitably c o M t n c f d
                    pedestrian guardrail.

           4        An area o£ stair nosing was found to have become defective upon the
                    W      part of the spion kop a«d s similar defect was located upon the
                    older radial gangway.

            5.      Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of minor
                     repairs.

               6.    A loose rainwater pipe and length of guttering were located to one of
                     the Penlstone Road turnstiles.

               7. An area o t glaring              °°e °£the Pe° lBtO0€       ^      t u r n 8 t U e hutS
                   has been broken.

               8     The club might consider the now combustible nature of much of the
                     vegetation Situated Immediately behind the aplon kop and take the
                     appropriate remedial action.

               9     The rendering to the entrance gate side wall was atill found to be in
                      a looae and defective condition.

               West Stand
                1     m   a number of cases terrace noaiogs require to be repaired.


                                                                        /Contd.*

                         INSTRUCTION TO STg-.’ARSS



Stewards must at all times wear their official waistcoat on duty.

Stewards must report for duty no later .than 14 hours before kick-off tiire.
Any Steward reporting for duty after this tire cannot ba guaranteed a job.
This provision iray be subject to a.Tendrrent in the event of m*jor fixtures
whereupon prior notice w i l l be given.

Whilst every endeavour will be rrade to allocate the ssrre job throughout
the season, you will be expected to carry out any alternative duty as
directed by the Chief Steward or his deputy, or an official or the Club.

Duties at specific locations:

(a)    Exit gates - to be manned at all tires throughout the match and
       opened at the specified tire to allow general exit and in the
       event of an eraargency.

(b)    Car park (south stand). Stewards must ensure that the one way
       system operates, the free passage is maintained for motor vehicles
       and supervise car parking.

fc)   Stands. Stewards are responsible for ensuring spectators sit in
       correct seats (as shown on tickets). Where this is not the cess,
       they have a responsibility in the first instance for requesting
       them to do so and only if there is a refusal should they
       contact the Police for assistance. Stewards are also responsible
       for ensuring that gangways and exits ar*L kept-dear. *

General Duties:

(a)   Preventing, so far as possible, standing on seats, and the clirbing
      of fences and other structures, where by virtue of the scale of the
      incident Stewards are unable t o c & r p -y with this requirement,
      they should without delay report the matter to the nearest Police
      Officer, or, if no Police Officer is pcesent, to the Chief Steward
      or designated club official.

(b)   Where more than one Ste'.vard is On duty at the sane gangway, one
      Steward is to remain at the fcottcm of the steps until at least
       10 minutes after kick-off, or until any rr\ash* is over, to ensure
      that the spectator uses the correct gangway and to remove any
      ticket stubs.

(c)   No gangway Steward is to sit down until at least 15 minutes after
      kick-off, and then only if there is a vacant seat on the end of
      a row in the immediate vicinity of the gangway - all other Stewards
      must sit as close to their allocated position as possible at the end
      of a row. no more than two Stewards may sit together.

(d)   Stewards are reminded that they should remain on duty until the final
      whistle and until their area     clear. The practise of Stewards
      leaving theix positions before the final whistle will not be tolerated.
      Only in exceptional circunstances (and with the permission of the Chief
      Steward) will a Steward be allowed to leave early. Except in an
      emergency Stewards should not leave theix place of duty without consent
      of the Chief Steward or. senior Police Officer present who should, if
      it is considered necessary, arrange for a replace.fent.
      (e)    No Steward is to beccme involved with crowd rrisbehaviour. This is a
             ratter for the Police - AND THE POLICE OfrlLY. Their assistance
             must be sought on all such occasions, and Stewards are required
             soley to identify persons who are breaking, or who are likely to
             break ground regulation. If Police assistance is retused, take a
             note of the Officar's mn bcr and rejorc iirmsdiately to the Chief
             Steward or his deputy. DO NOT GST INVOLVED.

      (f)    Stewards do not have a responsibility for ireinteining public order
             but should be'prepared to identify persons to Police Officers who
             are either creating a disturbance or whose prase nee i s likely t o
             create a disturbance - this covers a wide'range of activities
             contrary to ground regulations.

      (a)    At the end of the match Stewards ara responsible for ensuring
             the safe exit of st^porters, and where designated, assisting the
             Police in preventing pitch invasions.

      (h)    Reporting to the Chief Steward any ca.Tege or defect likely to
             cause injury or danger to persons in attendance.

 For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell


 Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                                                    Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                                       Barrier Testing 1988

                        Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988,                                                                 Lae fourth
 part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
 The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124,                                                                          124A,         125 to 128,
 128A,                   129 to 136,                136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
 the lower area of terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
 The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
 1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
                        The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
 procedure set out in Appendix C of the                                                                  'Guide to Safety at Sports
 G r ou nds '.
                        In all but one case the barriers tested,                                                        successfully
 withstood the applied load.                                                           A clip over the rail of barrier 124
 broke before reaching the full test load.
                        Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
 that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
 tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those tested on the
 Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
  load.

         The rail o n barrier 133 is badl y corroded and should be
  replaced now.       There was also a lot of xnoveinent of the rail on
 barrier 1 4 4 ,   w h e n tested,and ve also recommend that that rail
  is   a ls o replaced.
         A s agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to

Dear Mr. MacXrell*
                     Sefetv at Sporta Ground8 Act 197S
                           Barrier Testing 1955

     Over the four days 14,IS, 18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
pert of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
The harriers tested vere numbers 121 to 124, 124A# 125 to 123,
128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 167 all of which are on
the lower area of terrace at the tappings Lane end of the ground •
The location of the barriers tested ia shown on our drawing
1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
     The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
procedure set out 1a Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds' •
        In all but one case the barriera tested# successfully
withstood the applied load.     A clip over the rail of barrier 124
broke before reaching the foil test load.
        Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
that ease of the end* of the rails are corroded although those
tested on the Spion Rop laet year and also those, t ated on the
Leppings tan® terrace this year all safely supported the teet
load.

      The rail on barrier J33 1. badly corroded and .hould be
replaced now.   Th««, was al,e a lot of aovaaent of the rail on
barrier 144 , when tasted,and m       also recommand that that rail
i t also replaced.

     As agread we have arraaged for the clip on barrier 124 to
be replaced together with rail, on barrier, 133 and 1 4 4 , before
the start of the coming season.

     Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
results of the barrier tests.




                               Voore sincerely.

                         b y the Certificate of Grou nd Safety




          On 18 July 1988/                                1 made an inspection of the ground
d uring the t i m e t h a t this year's quota of cr us h barriers
were b e i n g test e d by m y firm.
          The r e s u l t s of the crush barrier testing are given
in a separate r e p o r t of today's date*
          I m a d e a v i s u a l inspection of all the m a i n structural
features of the ground.                                            Particular attention w a s paid to
gates a n d e n t r y a n d e x i t routes and to boundary walls and
fences.             N o s i g n i f i c a n t defects were noted.
          T h e roof of the So u th stand was inspected fr o m the ground
N o d e t e r i o r a t i o n in its condition was observed.
          I c e r t i f y t h a t in my opinion the various structures on
the g r o u n d are in a satisfactory condition a n d appropriate for
the stadium to be u s e d to the full capacity as laid down in
the C e r t i f i c a t e of G r ound Safety.

Deer Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds - Draft Revised Safety Certificate Conditions.

I refer to your letter of 13th August 1987 (your reference FPl9/2/4:RG/EB) in
connection with Safety Certificate Conditions.

I now enclose for your attention a copy of the final revised Safety Certificate
Conditions which as far as possible incorporate the comments oade in your
l e t t e r You will appreciate that the wording of certain of your con»nen.s has
had to be aoended slightly but I hope that the objective has none the less been
achieved.

There are four paints which require sooe further consideration:-

                U)          You say in your letter that an age range should be specified in
                            connection with stewards. I think however that the wording of
                            Condition U should be satisfactory without stipulating an age range.
                            No final decision has yet been taken on this issue and you oay like wo
                            consider it further;

                (b)         police knowledge of the whereabouts of a doctor - I believe Shis is
                            adequately covered in Condition 7;

                (c)          identifiable'^ of press I.V. and radio personnel - I an. no= sure o£
                             the justification for such a Condition and wonder if you have any
                             further comments on it;

                Cd)          the attendance of competent electrician - again I wonder what the
                             justification for this Condition would be.

    Would you please let oe have your coraoents on the new Conditions in due course

A
    Yours faithfully,

INTRODUCTION                                                 ..

This note has been prepared by the Sheffield City Council ia^order to inform
Certificate Holders a* to the general background of the Safety, Certificate
Conditions. The Counoil in dealing with Safety Certificate? takes advice from
the Chief Fire Officer, Che Chief ConscaMe, t h e Director of .health and Consumer
Services and the Council’s Building Surveyor.. These Officera-;and the Council
itself is concerned to aee as far as possible chac cha spectators at any
apecified activities are reasonably safe.

GUIDANCE                                                      'f   •

Where advice is given to the holder by any of the four Officers mentioned it
should be acted upon in accordance with the time constrainta given in the
advice. The holder is r e m i n d e d t h a t failure to take step* to ensure the
reasonable safety of apectators couid give rise co a prosecution.

The Chief Constable and his Officers have a particularly important role in
relation to "public order* situations the correct handling of which should
reduce any risk to spectator safety.

The Chief Constable must therefore be provided with appropriate facilities at
the stadium for control, crowd surveillance, detention and administrative
purposes. These facilities are u n c i a l if public order is to be e n t a i l e d
and the risk to spectators minimised.

The Chief Constable Bus£ also be informed at the earliest possible »«ment of Che
proposed date and content of all specified activities so that appropriate
planning can take place.

In addition there mast be consultation and agreement between the holder and the
Chief Constable well in advance of specified activities about the proposed
methods of ad»l-.l«.      the s e c t i o n of spectators. “
cake Diace if advance information is such that public order difficulties may
arise   2!           of this consultation it is possible chat the Ch ef Constable
may require, for reasons of preserving public order that the                 * ^ Vl 7
is "all ticket" or the specified activity should not be played at all at the
Stadium or the day and the tine of the specified activity s h o v l i be changed-

 The Chief Constable should also be able to use whatever aeans ^ a a?Pr^ r'ate “
 exetcise control over spectators for reasons of safety and as part of this
 control he and his Officers should be allowed full access to all areas o£ the
 Stadium.

  For the attention of Mr. D. S_heriff


  Dear Mr. Sheriff*
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football                                                               Club

                                                Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                                Barrier Testing 1938
                 Following your telephone call I an very pleased to enclose
   a copy of my report to the Club concerning the barrier testing
   at the west end of the ground in July, 1988.                                                               You will see from
   the carbon on page 2 that a copy of the letter part of our report
   was certainly sent to Mr. Butler in your department and to
    Mr. Bownes in the legal department.                                                            I know It is our normal
    practice to send you all the record sheets but if we did not do
    SO,         a full set is now enclosed.
                 I also enclose a copy of the test certificate from Sheffield
    Testing Works who checked the calibration of the testing equipment

     the previous week.

                                                                                            Yours sincerely.

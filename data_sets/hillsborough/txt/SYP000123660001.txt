HILLSBOROUGH - RE-SETTING OF THE TRIBUNAL DATE

1.   INFORMATION

On the 29 August 1991 Brigadier Pownall of the PCA contacted Headquarters
with a view to seeking the setting of the tribunal date for charges preferred
against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray.

Surprise was expressed at this request in view of the medical position with
regard to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield who was then and still is
certificated as sick with stress.

After much discussion it was agreed that contact would be made again after
24 September 1991.

2.   THE PRESENT POSITION WITH REGARD TO PREPARATION OF CHARGES ETC

Upon receipt of correspondence from the PCA dated 7 May 1991 (copy not
enclosed in the file) and 11 July 1991 (copy attached) action has been taken
with regard to the drafting of charges and the preparation of the tribunal
arrangements through Mr Stephen Walker of the Secretariat.

Mr John Trevor Sleightholme has been appointed as counsel with a view to
examining and commenting on the charges preferred by the PCA prior to the
service upon the accused officers.

In addition Superintendent Fell, Inspector Barker and PC Greenway have been
set aside to prepare the case in liaison with Mr Sleightholme.

In agreement with the PCA no disciplinary charges have been served and no
arrangements have been made for the tribunal pending the outcome of
consideration by Mr Sleightholme.

As indicated Mr Stephen Walker has engaged Mr Sleightholme to advise on the
wording of the charges and prepare the case and probably present it. Mr
Sleightholme has been to London and has conferred with PCA and I understand
they have accepted that he could not advise on the charges until he had read
the whole evidence in support of them.  It is anticipated that the
consideration of evidence would take at least 3 months and therefore any
progress beyond that would depend upon the outcome of those considerations.
Mr Sleightholme is on holiday until 25 September 1991 and then may well be
delayed by other commitments. Despite this our progress does depend
considerably upon Mr Sleightholme's advice.

3.   PROJECTED DEVELOPMENTS

Should Mr Sleightholme commence his reading of the work at the end of
September 1991 it is therefore to be expected that we would not be in a
position to serve charges until somewhere at the beginning of January 1992 .
Home Office Guidance at Annex H Para.12 indicates that officers must be
presented with copies of evidence in order to appear at a discipline hearing
as soon as possible after the decision has been taken to proceed with
discipline charges and goes on to say "and at least 21 days before the date
set for the hearing."

In this case it is doubtful that 21 days would be adequate to consider the
evidence supporting the charges preferred and it is more likely that a period
of 3 months would be more appropriate.  If this is accepted then we would
be moving to somewhere in April 1992 and then the case to be presented would
have to be prepared.

Projecting that situation it is not realistic for a tribunal to be set before
July 1992 dependent upon other difficulties which might not be foreseen.

However with regard to the above it is anticipated that the team set aside
for this work would be able to complete their role in the time scale
indicated.

4.   THE SETTING OF A TRIBUNAL DATE

There is nothing in regulations to preclude the setting of a trubunal date
once charges have been served under Regulation 8. however the only restriction
on the time of hearing is as indicated under Regulation 10 concerning the
service of documents which indicates that the officer charged has at least
21 days to consider those documents before the tribunal.

The enormity of the case in question dictates a longer period of time albeit
not by regulation and the time scale outlined above appears appropriate.

With this in mind it does not appear that there is anything to preclude the
setting of a date for the tribinal once the charges have been agreed and
served.

5-   THE SERVICE OF CHARGES TO OFFICERS CERTIFIED SICK

There is nothing in regulations which makes specific reference to the
procedure of service of charges on officers certified sick. However
consideration of the Home Office Notes of Guidance give some direction.

Firstly at para.9-18 mention is made of the advice given in Annex H to the
Guidance and to the fact that the twin aims of hearings is to be fair to the
accused and getting at the truth. In this instance the fairness to the
accused is most appropriate.

Moving on to Para. 9-19 of the Guidance emphasis is made again referring to
Annex H but to the provision of facilities for the accused officer and in
particular at A it indicates that adequate duty time should be given to
prepare his defence - note in this case duty time is not appropriate but I
would suggest that certified sick cannot be classed as any time for
consideration of these matters. At para B it indicates that the accused
should be given copies of all evidence in good time before the hearing and,
at para.D it indicates that hearing should be carried out in accordinace with
the requirements of natural justice.

Whilst regulations do not provide for specifics in service of charges it does
give indications so far as the decision to institute proceedings is concerned.
It is open to a chief officer to decide not to initiate proceedings where
evidence suggests that an officer's medical condition played a major role
in the commission of the alleged offence.  In this case there is nothing to
suggest that this applies however it does move on to give guidance at
para.9-33 of the Home Office manual to suggest that a similar approach may
be adopted where it is clear that an officer's medical condition is such that
the initiation of proceedings might lead to his medical breakdown.

At the present stage charges have not been served and it is only after the
service of charges that consideration can be given to the power to withdraw
under Regulation 9 (1) of the Police Discipline Regulations. Despite this
it is quite clear that the Guidance is aimed at giving some protection to
officers who are clearly affected in medical terms. However prudence would
dictate that perhaps m edical opinion in the cases of doubt should be obtained
as a guideline.

6.   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1)   Once charges have been set there is nothing to suggest that these cannot
     be served and a tribunal date fixed.

2)   The service of charges to an officer certified sick is one which is to
     be considered in the light of Home Office guidance and in particular in
     consideration of para.9.18 ie fairness to the accused and para.9-33 in
     considering as to whether or not such action might lead to a further
     breakdown                             -—

The considerations outlined above relate to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
and do not take account of the position with regard to Superintendent Murray.
So far as that officer is concerned there is nothing to preclude the setting
of a tribunal date providing charges have been prepared and can be served.
However consideration must be given to whether or not the intention would
be for a joint or separate hearing and until the matter with regard to Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield is resolved and both officers' counsel have had
the opportunity of examining evidence then it must be argued that that
decision cannot be taken. With this in mind the whole crux of the matter
rests upon the decision as to service on Mr Duckenfield in the light of his
medical condition and the probability that para.9.33 would be offended by
action leading to a further burden on the officer.

In regard   to all the circumstances it is felt that medical advice should be
sought as   to the affects of service upon Mr Duckenfield and if it is felt
that this   would add an extra burden upon the officer then charges should not
be served   and a tribunal date not fixed until such time as the officer is
medically   fit to respond.

                  SUBJECT:      hillsborough discipline tribunal


                   I believe that following my report of 30 September 1991 you caused
                   Chief Superintendent Mole to telephone Mr Ord, Deputy Chief Constable
                   of Cleveland to ascertain if any precedent was known for fixing a
                   date for a tribunal without charges being preferred. Chief
                   Superintendent Mole spoke to Mr Ord, who later telephoned Acting Chief
                   Inspector Brentnall asking to speak with me. I was unavailable, being
                   in conference with Mr Sleightholme at his chambers in Leeds.

                   I returned Mr Ord's call today. He told me that following his
                   conversation with Chief Superintendent Mole he had an afterthought
                   which he felt I should know, that is to say that when the charges
                   have been framed they should be sent in writing to the Police
                   Complaints Authority to secure agreement. This removes the possibility
                   of subsequent dispute in the event that they fail.

                   I took the opportunity of re-raising the original point with Mr Ord
                   as to precedent for setting a tribunal date before the charges were
                   fixed. Mr Ord's view is that the arrangements for the tribunal are
                   the statutory responsibility of the discipline authority for the Force.
                   He felt it would be best if once the charges are fixed then a date
                   set, an early date. Thereafter it would be a matter for the tribunal
                   to adjourn at the request of the accused, say because of medical
                   reasons. Mr Ord is to send a copy of a letter he sent to the Police
                   Complaints Authority concerning responsibility for tribunal
                   arrangements.

                   I took the opportunity of asking him whether there was any precedent
                   for serving the discipline form unaccompanied by the evidence
                   supporting the charges.  (I gave him a hint only of our difficulty).
                   Mr Ord felt it best that the discipline charge be accompanied by what
                   could be given and notice that further was to follow.

                   I thanked him for his interest.

                   I would urge that fixing a date for the tribunal should be contemplated
                   without delay.

NOTE FOR FILE

RE: HILLSBOROUGH TRIBUNAL

I have today discussed with Mr Jack Ord, Deputy Chief Constable, Cleveland,
the position with regard to setting of a date for tribunal and with a view
to identifying any previous precedent. At a discussion it was suggested
that we should not set a date for tribunal until such timeas charges  had
been formulated. Once formulated and whether or not service can beachieved
or not a tribunal date can be set. If, as the date approaches, it is not
possible to proceed then an adjournment can be sought before the tribunal
by the defending counsel setting out the reasons for the request. That
request may be based upon the fact that charges cannot be served due to
the medical condition of the officer involved or perhaps sufficient time
has not been given for considering the evidence etc.

The point made is that once formulated a date can be fixed and then
adjournments can follow if necessary.

     Following our telephone conversation of last week, I discussed with
     the Chairman your suggestion of a further meeting between presenting
     counsel and the Authority.   We gave careful consideration to your
     proposal but felt that it would, perhaps, be imposing too great an
     influence from the Authority on matters which are strictly the
     responsibility of the South Yorkshire Police.

     As an alternative way of guiding counsel on the case,as we see it, I
     enclose a note which the Chairman has drafted.    It is very much in
     note form but we hope it will provide some helpful guidance to
     counsel.

     I very much hope that you will soon be in a position to notify us of
     the dates of the tribunal so that we can nominate the Authority
     members.   I would be grateful if you would continue to keep me
     informed if any other difficulties arise.




     J L POWNALL
                           NOTES ON DISCIPLINARY CHARGES

                                         HILLSBOROUGH

The    charges     which   the     Police    Complaints   Authority    have   directed

against Chief Superintendent Dukenfield are very simple and easy to

understand.       This Authority appreciate that the overall enquiry gave

rise    to   a    vast    amount    of    paper-work.     The   case   against    Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield is concerned with a limited area namely his

failure to prevent over-crowding in Pens 3 and 4 and thereby to avert

the ghastly tragedy which resulted.              The charges which this Authority

have specified are deliberately framed so as to point to this failure

at three distinct stages, namely Charge 1. - to the time before the

crowds started to arrive;            Charge 2. - to the time between the first

arrival of the fans and the opening of Gate C;                  and Charge 3. - the

time after Gate C was opened.             The charges are specified so as to keep

the issues within manageable limits.               They are in no way intended to

suggest that no-one else was responsible for the tragedy.



Charges      1,   2 and    3 are    framed under Regulation       4 of the       Police

(Discipline) Regulations 1985.              In order to prove any one of the three

charges (and, indeed the separate charge against Superintendent Murray

which mirrors charge 3 against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield) the

presenter of the charges must prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the

officer charged:-



       (i)    was a member of a police force;             and



       (ii) that he was under a duty as a police officer to attend to

       or carry out certain things, namely in this case those things
    necessary for the proper control and safety of those members of

     the public who attended the match;           and



   (iii)    that, he neglected or omitted to carry out such

            things with due promptitude or diligence.



Proof of good and sufficient cause,           however,    lies on the officer

charged on the balance of probabilities.          Of these essential elements

in each charge (i) and (ii) apply           to all three equally.

(i) is unlikely to be the subject           of dispute.



(ii) May not be contested.



If it is, brief evidence may need to be called as to the fact that not

only had the police accepted responsibility for crowd control and

safety     on   behalf    of   the   Club   but   that    Chief   Superintendent

Duckenfield, who was in charge of the police, knew this full well -

and accepted    th is .




Evidence:-      Operational Order

                The pre-match briefings



Evidence from Club - and if necessary,            senior officers, if this is

disputed.



NB. Case of Harris v South Yorkshire          Police which is referred to in

Taylor's report at page 29.
Duckenfield's evidence before the Coroner with regard to safety at

page 41, 43,    71, 82 at which he said:-



     On page    41 re pre-match briefing to Inspectors:



          (E)    "We (the police) must ensure the safety o f

          the public inside and outside the                    ground."



          (F)    "I     cannot     stress        too    highly    the     word

                 1safety'".



          (G)    "Our     (the         police)    job     is     to   ensure     the

                 safety of spectators".



     On page    43 "Safety of supporters in this ground is                       paramount":



          (D    -G) re briefing to officers - same format.



     On page    71:              (D)     See passage.



     On page    82:              (C)       "Certainly     not    so much in      the

                                 pens, but the whole ground, monitoring of

                                 safety and levels was crucial".



In view of these answers and of the fact that police 'controlled' the

crowd, which must imply a responsibility for safety, in coxnmon-sense,

there may not be any dispute but that he was in charge of a police

operation which was concerned with the safety of spectators.
Hereafter references to his evidence before the Coroner which was

given on oath,   under     caution and after warnings         that he was not

obliged to answer will be by reference to the transcript with a page

number.



(iii)    In respect   of   the   three   charges    which   the    Authority have

directed and specified      - the particulars will differ because the

charges deal with different stages.         Particulars may be sought.          If

they are it is for Counsel to draft them.              The basic charge will

stand.    The charge must be proved but this does not necessitate the

proof of all particulars (cf Machent v Quinn 1970 AER 255) but it does

mean that each member of the Tribunal must be agreed as to the proof

of a particular before it can convict of the charge (cf R v Brown 1983

79 CR App R 115).



If particulars are not sought Counsel will have to decide whether to

deliver them or provide the defence with a copy of his opening.



I have set out particulars which illustrate the case as the Authority

would wish it presented.         Where appropriate I have put page numbers

in brackets indicating references to the transcript.              Where the number

has a (2) after it this means it is in the second sequence of numbers

dealing with evidence on 13 March 1991.            It is for Counsel to decide

what particulars he relies on.



Charge No 1



Chief Superintendent Duckenfield neglected or omitted to carry out his

duty as a police officer as alleged in that he:-
(a)   took   over as      operationalcommander           (47C)          in

      overall        command      (67G)     without          adequate

      preparation;



(b)   signed       the   operational      order       without     first

      visiting the ground;



(c)   relied    on an     operational       order      drawn up         by

      someone else without further enquiry and accepted

      it as 'tried and tested' on the basis that it has

      been     operated    satisfactorily        on    two   previous

      occasions;



(d)   failed to brief himself adequately or to prepare

      for emergencies;



(e)   failed to acquaint himself with the layout of and

      facilities at the ground so          as to be able to deal

      with     emergencies      (68C,   89(2),     90(2))        and    in

      particular:-



             (i)     did not know of association between

             turnstiles A-G and Leppings Lane Terrace

             (74C);



             (ii) did     not    know   where     Gate    "C"     was        (53C)   and

                     (25(2)B);
       (iii) did not acquaint himself with the sign-posting

       (68D);



       (iv) did not acquaint himself with Club requirement or

              know of print-out which the Club were able to

              provide (50 B);



       (v)    did not know of          the    'penning'     in LeppingsLane

              Terrace (44B and         C), (but cf 72 D or ignored it

                  79 ) ;



failed to appreciate the lay out of Leppings Lane

Terrace and in particular              of the effect of the

Charge No 2



This   charge   is concerned with   Chief   Superintendent Duckenfield's

neglect or omission during the period between the first arrivals of

spectators and the opening of Gate C.



Suggested particulars



       (a)   failed to monitor crowd security in Pens 3 and 4

             and to observe the build up of spectators      in

             those pens (60, 31(2));



       (b)   failed to get print out of numbers of spectators

             who had entered the ground (49H);
      (c)   gave an order to a police constable to ask people

            to move    forward and     spread out but       failed to

            ensure that this was carried out (52B);



      (d)   prior to the opening of Gate C failed to observe

            or to take action consequent upon the obvious

            over-filling of Pens 3 and 4 and the under use of

            Pens l, 2, 6, and 7 or to draw the conclusion

            from this that the spectators on the Leppings

            Lane Terrace were not, and could not, find their

            own level (4(2));



      (e)   failed to control        further entry by   spectators

            into Pens 3 and 4 by placing police officers at

            the entry to the Tunnel.

C harge 3



This charge is concerned with the failure of Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray to provide for the control and

stewarding of spectators coming through Gate C when it was opened.



Suggested particulars



      (a)   failed    to   provide   any   control   over    spectators   coming

            through Gate C.
(b)   failed    to   appreciate      that   these spectators          would be

      likely to go to the Tunnel.



(c)   failed to      observe that      Pens 3 and 4 were already,           and

      obviously,      overcrowded       -    and    that,      if further

      spectatorswere      to   enter    these   Pens,    there        would be

      danger of injury and death (3(2) C and D ) ;



(d)   failed to take any steps to monitor or control

      entry in Pens 3 and 4 (5(2), 6 and 7);



(e)   failed    to   inform    Superintendent      Greenwood     in

      whose sector Gate C the concourse behind Leppings

      Lane     Terrace   and   the   terrace    were    situated.

      (12 (2 ));


(f)   failed to inform the Club, or anyone else, of the

      opening of Gate "C" (13 D, E);



(g)   failed to observe a surge of spectators in Pens

      3 and 4 (22 (2) F - 23(2)C);



(h)   failed to observe overcrowding in Pens 3 and 4 or

      disparity between these pens and Pens 1, 2, 6 and

      7 or that anything was wrong before spectators

      came from Pens 3 and 4 onto the pitch (31(2)); or

      to take any action whether by relaying a message

      or otherwise (21(2) and 22(2));
     (i)   failed to exercise those reasonable qualities of

           command expected of an 'overall commander' in the

           emergency.        [This was, the PCA believe,      largely

           because      of     his   lack     of    preparation   and

           forethought, as particularised in Charge 1.]

         Following the events of Monday 13 January 1992, you will no doubt be aware that
         the Police Complaints Authority has agreed to exercise its powers under Section
         93(6) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act of 1984, and to allow discontinuation
         of proceedings against Superintendent Bernard Murray.

         All discipline matters in connection with the Hillsborough disaster are now finalised
         and your kind agreement to chair the tribunal no longer applies.

         I am sure you will share with us the relief at this decision on behalf of
         Superintendent Murray and whilst the decision does not bring particular joy, it is
         pleasing to note the apparent end of another chapter in what has been an
         extremely difficult time for the South Yorkshire Police.

1.   On 11 July, 1991 the Police Complaints Authority directed that

charges     of        neglect    of    duty     be     preferred    against   a     Chief

Superintendent and a Superintendent of the South Yorkshire Police,

in respect of their handling of police operations at Hillsborough

Football Stadium on 15 April, 1989.                    The Authority wish to make it

clear that their direction was not a finding of culpability, which

would be a matter solely for the disciplinary tribunal hearing the

charges to adjudicate upon.



2.   On 10 November, 1991 the Chief Superintendent was retired from

the Force on medical grounds with the consequence that he was, with

effect from that date, no longer subject to the Police Discipline

Code and, therefore, the disciplinary proceedings against him could

not continue.



3.   The South Yorkshire Police have now sought the leave of this

Authority        to    withdraw       the     single     charge    laid   against     the

Superintendent, who was subordinate to the Chief Superintendent at

the relevant time.



4.   The Authority have considered the request with great care and

conclude that it would be unjust and inappropriate to pursue the

charge against the Superintendent alone,                     in the absence of his

superior    officer.            We   have   therefore     decided    to   exercise   our

discretion,       in accordance with Section 93(6)                 of the Police and

Criminal Evidence Act 1984, to give the Force leave not to proceed

with the charge.
5.    The Authority do not resile from their original decision to

direct that charges against both officers be heard and considered

by a disciplinary tribunal.           We are satisfied that there was prima

facie evidence to support such charges.                The subsequent retirement

of   the   Chief    Superintendent,         on medical      grounds   has,    however,

substantially altered the position.



6.    The charges against the Chief Superintendent covered a number

of different matters.          The Authority directed that one of these

charges should be laid both against the Chief Superintendent and

the Superintendent,          as his   immediate subordinate.               This charge

alleged failure to control the movement of supporters subsequent to

the opening of Gate 'C ', which was opened in order to avert danger

to supporters outside the ground.



7.    We have made our decision to accede to the South Yorkshire

Police requests for the following reasons:



      a.     the background to the alleged failure to control those

      entering through Gate 'C' involved, inter alia, preliminary

      planning and preparation for the police operation which it

      would be impossible to assess fairly at a disciplinary hearing

      in   the     absence    of    the     officer    in   charge    of    the     whole

      operation;



      b.    the primary responsibility,               for controlling spectators

      entering      Gate      'C'     did     not     lie    directly        with     the

      Superintendent;
      c.      the precise nature of the Superintendent's responsibility

      cannot be adequately assessed in the absence of his superior

      officer at the tribunal;



      d.      what is, in effect, a joint allegation of neglect of duty

      cannot be fairly heard in the absence of the more senior

      officer;



      e.      the    Superintendent's ability to put              forward his     case

      fully     in    the    absence    of   his    superior     officer   would    be

      impaired; and



      f.      it would be       an    injustice to        the   Superintendent,    who

      conducted himself with dignity at the Inquest and throughout

      the investigations, for him to stand alone charged with being

      a cause of the tragedy which occurred and thus to appear to be

      a    'scapegoat'      for faults which may well be attributable to

      others.



8.    in reaching what we have found to be a very difficult decision

we have taken into account the interests and feelings of those who

have made complaints about the police conduct,                     the Hillsborough

Families Support Group, all those who have suffered bereavement as

the result of the tragic events and the public interest on the one

hand and, on the other, justice to the Superintendent and the sense

of   unfairness      which    would    result      from   continuing    the   process

against him alone in the absence of his superior officer.
9.   The Authority have therefore granted the leave sought by the

South Yorkshire Police not to proceed with the charge which we

directed against the Superintendent.

             After very careful consideration, the Police Complaints Authority

             at       Hillsborough                  Football     Stadium    on     15     April       1989     against         a

              Superintendent should be withdrawn.



             The Authority had directed that charges be preferred against both

             the Superintendent and his superior officer a Chief Superintendent.

             The retirement of the Chief Superintendent on medical grounds means

             that what is,                     in effect,       a joint allegation of neglect of duty

             cannot be fairly heard in the absence of the more senior officer.

HILLSBOROUGH TRIBUNAL

Following today's announcement by the Police Complaints Authority that the
disciplinary tribunal against Superintendent Bernard Murray will not now
proceed, the Chief Constable, Mr Richard Wells, says:

"The Authority's decision brings no rejoicing among the ranks of the South
Yorkshire Police service.

"There can be no winners from a disaster which claimed 95 lives.                There are
certainly losers.

"First and foremost, of course, are the bereaved families who lost their loved
ones that tragic afternoon.    Words alone will never be enough to ease their
pain and anger. We acknowledge this, though once again feel moved to express
our deep and sincere sorrow to them.

"Many others have been losers, not least members of the police service on
duty that day who, faced with the tragedy, attempted to deal with the horror
of the moment.    Some are still fighting that dreadful battle and we count
the cost weekly in ill-health retirements and in the number of men and women
who still need counselling to cope with their memories. This they share with
the families who lost friends and relatives.

"I echo the sentiments of Dr Hapgood who, at the Memorial Service, said that
no disaster was the fault of one organisation alone or of just one human being,
but rather a combination of factors and shared responsibilities.

"That is why I have never been convinced of the appropriateness of the
disciplinary tribunal. My feelings were strengthened by the Director of Public
Presecution's decision on criminal matters, by the findings of the independent
investigating team, the conclusions of the inquest and advice given by leading
counsel. I have never thought that the police alone should be blamed, although
we firmly acknowledged our own responsibilities by the settlement of the civil
actions against us.

"There were clearly mistakes. These mistakes have had awful human consequences.
The major questions have always been, in law, at which doors these mistakes
should be laid and whether they were culpable mistakes.

"I hold myself personally responsible for the South Yorkshire Police having
advised the Police Complaints Authority to review their decisions about holding
a tribunal and feel relieved that our argument about natural justice has been
so completely agreed.

    "Many, many people - police officers and those in the broader community -
    will sympathise with the decision to spare Supt. Bernard Murray the further
    burden of facing a tribunal alone. We will understand if some of the bereaved
    cannot share that view.

    "Bernard Murray has thrown himself into his command duties since the day of
    the tragedy with his usual energetic commitment to the community.

    "All of us in the South Yorkshire Police service are anxious not to forget
    Hillsborough, but to draw strength from its lessons and to move forward,
    particularly in the area of ground improvements for crowd safety, which are
    the real ways in which we can give some meaning to the awful loss of life
    on that afternoon."

STATEMENT OF SUPT. MURRAY


Following   today's   announcement   by   the   Police   Complaints                 Authority,
Superintendent Bernard Murray has issued the following statement:

"I am relieved at the decision that has been made by the Authority that the
charge against me should be withdrawn.   My relief comes not only because I
will not now have to face a tribunal, but also because many people, including
myself, will be spared the painful experience of having to go through the
harrowing details of the tragedy again.

"The decision does not change the sadness that I continue to feel and the
sympathy I have for the relatives and friends of the people who died.

"I know that some people will be disappointed with this decision.                      I fully
understand that but I feel that it was the correct and fair decision.                  It does
not diminish, in any way, the hurt and grief which I constantly feel."

In response to your faxed letter dated the 18th December 1991, 1 am writing
to confirm that my letter of the 12th December 1991 was forwarded in order
that consideration might be given to obtain leave of the Authority not to
proceed with charges against Superintendent Murray.

As you quite rightly indicate, leave was sought under- Section 93(6) of the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act of 1984, however, our reference to Section
93(7) of that Act was merely to indicate that should you seek tc exercise
your powers under that sub-section in seeking further information, then
of course we would respond promptly.

As you point out the reasons for seeking leave of the Authority under
Section 93(6) are as set out in paragraph 2 of my letter.

I trust this information clarifies the position.

              Dear Mr Moore
              Thank you for your letter of December 12 last. In it you request
              the Authority to consider exercising our powers under Section
              93(7) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to decide on
              the merits of the case as to whether or not proceedings against
              Superintendent Murray should be halted.      I presume that your
              reference to Section 93(7) should read Section 93(6) and that you
              are seeking leave of the Authority under that subsection, on
              behalf of the chief officer, "not to proceed with charges which
              ... subsection (5) above would otherwise oblige him to proceed".
              You give your reasons for making this request in paragraph 2 of
              your letter cogently and clearly. If you confirm that this is
              what you wish us to consider we will, of course, deal with your
              request with care and as a matter of urgency and will give due
              weight to all the points which you so helpfully raise.         it
              certainly raises matters which require serious attention.

              We are conscious of the fact that time is passing and that the
              date for the hearing approaches and, as yet, as we understand it,
              the charges and the statements have not been served.

         Whatever decision we reach with regard to proceedings with the
         charges, it is vital that it be made within the next few days.
         I would, therefore, be obliged if we could receive your reply
         before Christmas, so that we can make our decision at an early

Unaer separate cover l am writing to Brigadier Pownall about the matters
discusseo at our meeting on 29 November 1991, this letter, however, deals
W i t h a distinct aspect of the disciplinary process against Superintendent
Murray w m c h is outside the ambit of the team preparing the presentation
against that officer.


Now that C m e f Superintendent Duckenfield cannot in any likelihoou be brought
before a disciplinary hearing, it might be argued that it would >e contrary
to natural justice to proceed against Superintendent Murray alone.         Some
   1 alway s see Mr Duckenfield as the prime mover in the oiscste: and these
individuals will take no comfort from proceedings against Hr Murray whatever
the result may be.      -Likewise, others would consider it unjust to bnncr
action against 24r Murray when Mr Duckenfield will not be called to account."
Some will question whether a fair hearing can occur when such an important
witness is aosent, and will see the tribunal as a means of casting Mr Murray
as scapegoat for the Hillsborough Disaster.

Having regaro to these concerns, it would be remiss of me not to request
that you consider exorcising your powers under Section 93(7) of the Police
ana Criminal Evidence Act 1SB4, to enable you to decide on the merits of
the case as    to whether or not proceedings against Superintendent Murray
s iould now be halted.   Should you decide to exercise these powe/s, I will
ensure a fully reasoned response.

i hope that    I do not need to reassure you that the preparation for the
tribunal isproceeding with expedition       and rigour, it would nowever be
 ess than fair of me not to avail you of the opportunity offered ^y statute
to consider     at  this  time whether  it   is riqht to continue with   ne
disciplinary process against Superintendent. Mux~ray.

       Dear Brigadier Pownall,

       Further to my telephone conversation of 29 October 1991 with Mr P
       Moorhouse, I am writing to you to confirm that the Chief Constable has
       decided that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield will be medically retired
       from the South Yorkshire Police with effect from 11 November 1991*

       In order to progress the matters raised in my letter to you dated 24
       October 1991, it would be useful for us to meet and discuss the relevant
       issues as soon as possible.

       Chief Superintendent

       Discipline and Complaints
  RICHARD WELLS, CHIEF CONSTABLE OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE, says

  I understand Trevor Hicks’ and the families’ sense of impatience.       The 96 deaths

  resulting from the Hillsborough tragedy are constantly on our minds and we share the

 grief of those bereaved. Strong feelings like this have still tosubmit themselves to the

 processes of the world of legal detail.



 From the moment when the South Yorkshire Police were directed by the Police

 Complaints Authority to prefer charges against Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield

 and Superintendent Bernard Murray, we have let no grass grow under our feet.

 Immediately, in our role of preparing the case for a tribunal, we instructed counsel to

 prepare the evidence and draw up the charges. We have appointed a dedicated team

 of officers to assist counsel.   The evidence for consideration consists of 4,000

statements and reports, 8,000 questionnaires, 3,900 other documents, hundreds of

photographs and video tapes, and transcripts of 84 days of evidence given to the

Taylor Inquiry and the Inquest.



Provisional steps have been taken for the tribunal to begin at Sheffield Town Hall

during March 1992. However, it is very difficult for anyone to finalise arrangements

for the hearing while the details of charges have yet to be agreed between the South

Yorkshire Police and the Police Complaints Authority.           There is the further

complication of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield’s illness. As with anybody else

facing legal proceedings, he has to be well enough for the charges to be served on

him and well enough to assist in the preparation of his own defence.
 The assessment of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield’s illness is not a matter for police

 officers, it is a matter of medical advice. He was seen on Tuesday 22 October by a

police staff surgeon. We await the staff surgeon’s report and will be guided by the

findings. This is a process which has been followed in exactly the same way with

several officers suffering ill health in the aftermath of Hillsborough.



Referral of a patient for further medical advice would be subject to the professional

judgement of the staff surgeon.



In terms of commonsense and equity, the absence of Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield from his own tribunal because of illness is unacceptable. I must say that

in the light of the two years of statements emerging from Merseyside, the thought that

Trevor Hicks and the Hillsborough Families Support Group wish to spare David

Duckenfield the rigours of the tribunal has a very hollow ring indeed."

Dear Brigadier Pownall,

Rei    ittUttottMdl Disaster   »   Discipline Tribunal

In accordance with my latter of ? November 1991 yen will ba aware that
as of the 11 November, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield ceased to be a
member of the South Yorkshire Police following medical retirement.

The consequence of Mr Duckenfields retirement ia that he ie new no longer
subject to the police discipline regulations and, I am therefore unable
to proceed with your direction concerning discipline proceedings against
him as contained in your letter dated 11 July 1991*

Yours sincerely,




Assistant Chief Constable
Discipline and Complaints
NOTE   FOR   FILE




HILLSBOROUGH TRIBUNAL



The medical retirement of Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield was
determined by the Chief Constable in accordance with the Police Pensions
Regulations.  In making that decision consideration was given to the
pending discipline matters facing Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and,
it is clear from the Chief Constables statement that he considered the
effects of the case and felt that the public interest, the interests of
the force and the interests of the officer were such that they would be
better served by a medical retirement, despite the fact that this course
of action would preclude continuation of discipline procedures.

In appreciating that proceedings were directed by the Police Complaints
Authority under Section 93 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984^,
then consideration has to be given as to whether or not authority had to
be sought under Sub-Section 6 of Section 93; for charges not to be
preferred or not to be proceeded with.

The section does not make reference specifically to medical retirement
and, appears to be aimed at other considerations which might affect the
intention to proceed with discipline charges.

In an effort to seek further guidance reference is made to the 'Guidance
to Chief Officers on Police Complaints and Discipline Procedures', where
at Paragaph 9-33 and 9*34 reference is made to 'medical treatment'.

Paragraph 9-33 starts by dealing with the procedures to be adopted where
a Chief Officer decides not to initiate proceedings where evidence suggests
that the officers medical condition played a major role in the commission
of the alleged offence. These circumstances do not apply to the case of
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, however, the paragraph goes on to deal
with a situation where medical condition deteriates following the laying
of charges against an officer and, once again it is then open to the Chief
Officer to consider abandoning proceedings before any discipline hearing
takes places. He would exercise his powers under Regulation 9(1)
of the police discipline regulations, however, the guidance draws attention
to the need for care to ensure that the consent of the Police Complaints
Authority is sought under Section 93(6) of the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act, before withdrawing charges which arose from a complaints matter.
It is important to note that this application refers to circumstances where
charges have been laid. In this case charges had not been laid.
Paragraph 9*34 goes on to deal with medical retirements and indicates if
at any stage of the disciplinary process an accused officers medical
condition is found to be such that he would normally be granted medical
retirement, then the discipline process should not necessarily prevent
or delay retirement. The considerations given by the Chief Constable
in the circumstances in question then follow and, there is no reference
to any need to seek Police Complaints Authority approval.
It may well be that the Police Complaints Authority see a loop hole in
the law which requires them to be referred to where charges have been
preferred but, not where medical retirement has been decided upon.

In view of the fact that legislation under the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984 gives a requirement to seek leave not to prefer charges or not
to proceed with charges, it may well be that whilst we have acted correctly
in accordance with Home Office guidance under paragraphs 9-33 and 9-34,
we should consider writing to the authority after the retirement date of
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, advising the authority that we are no
longer in a position to proceed due to the fact that Mr Duckenfield is
not any longer subject to the Police Discipline Regulations. This course
of action is suggested in the light of Home Office guidance at 9•35, which
deals with information to the Police Complaints Authorities to the outcome
of the discipline proceedings. Whilst proceedings have not taken place
the termination and inability to continue proceedings may well be required
to be notified to the authority in order that they can close their file
formally. This course of action may be appropriate in the light of the
anomolies with regard to seeking approval for discontinuation as set out
in Section 93, Sub-Section 6.

RICHARD WELLS, CHIEF CONSTABLE, SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE SAYS:-

“I have today made the decision to retire Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield from the South

Yorkshire Police on medical grounds. That decision is effective from 10 November 1991.



My decision was taken after careful consideration of the medical report from the Police Staff Surgeon,

an independent physician whose service is retained for such examinations.



This unequivocal report left me in no doubt that Mr Duckenfield is too ill to continue service as a police

officer.



Details of his condition cannot be disclosed as I am bound by the rules of patient and doctor

confidentiality, but, in general terms, he is described as suffering from severe depression and post

traumatic stress disorder.



I quite understand that the bereaved relatives and friends wifl be angry at my decision since it rules out

Mr Duckenfield’s involvement in the planned disciplinary tribunal for which South Yorkshire Police have

been preparing for some months. David Duckenfield has become the symbolic focus of much of the

anguish felt by those who were so hurt by the tragedy but I must deal with the man, not the symbol.

The fact is, David Duckenfield is now too ill to serve.



A decision like this is not lightly made, the more especially in a case of such complexity and public

interest. The fact that David Duckenfield is so unwell has simplified that decision. There has been

enough suffering already and I can only hope that time will help to soften the terrible pain felt by the

families of the Hillsborough victims, and will help to heal David Duckenfield as well.



The Police Complaints Authority and the Hillsborough Family Support Group have been notified of my

decision."

 We have previously discussed problems seen as impeding progress towards the
 disciplinary hearing of charges arising from the Hillsborough tragedy and in
 my letter of 1 October 1991 I indicated that I considered it important to meet
 and discuss the way ahead.

 I have caused Superintendent Fell to prepare a paper which concentrates on
 the problem ami possible solution regarding the material. In the light of
 what he says I have talked with the solicitor to South Yorkshire Police
 Authority, Mr Stephen Walker, and both he and Counsel, Mr John Sleightholme,
 share my view that further discussion is desirable.

 You will be aware that there is movement towards a decision being made as to
 whether Chief Superintendent Duckenfield is fit to continue to serve and if
 a resolution occurs soon on that issue it will necessarily throw into sharper
 focus the question of the charge against Superintendent Murray.

* Mr Sleightholme has prepared charges and it would be beneficial if our
  discussion were also to encompass that issue.

 Accordingly, I should be most grateful for an early opportunity to come and
 talk with you and Judge Petre. I would suggest Monday, 28 October or Tuesday,
 29 October 1991 as appropriate dates for the meeting.

                        PROBLEM PREVENTING PROGRESS OF THE
                              HILLSBOROUGH TRIBUNAL


                              SUPERINTENDENT A FELL
                              SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE


 1.   The purpose of this paper is to set out the problem seen as preventing
      the progress of the Hillsborough Tribunal and to offer the solution
      so that problem and solution can be considered by those who will
      contribute to the making of decisions as to the way ahead.     The paper
      avoids detailed descriptions, references and explanations since it
      is aimed at a restricted readership that has knowledge of the relevant
      legislation, the particulars of the tragedy and the identities of the
      different witnesses.


 2.   The fundamental problem is that the Tribunal cannot proceed until
      charges accompanied by supporting statements of evidence have been
      served on the accused officers.     Such evidence does not presently exist
       in an appropriate form, that is as statements suitable for Regulation
      10 and Regulation 19 procedures.     A team of police officers conversant
      with the circumstances will have to be appointed to obtain such
      statements.    Such action after the Police Complaints Authority has
       certified on 15 August 1990 that it was satisfied with the investigation
       is difficult to countenance.


 3.   The background to this problem is that immediately following the tragedy
       the police officers involved were required to write out their
       recollections.   Some of these weresupplemented by further
       recollections.   Some recollections were perhaps influenced by advice
       as to what was required for the purpose of the Taylor Inquiry and civil
       litigation.




                                        - 1 -
Many members of the public, officials, club employees and others
completed questionnaires.   Some persons made signed statements; some
made unsigned statements.   Some key persons were interviewed under
caution and under Regulation 7 Notice and their evidence is largely
in the form of records of interview.


Most of the documentation has been entered on computer and the print
off of the computer version of some was used as 'statements' in support
of the report submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions on which
the decisions as to criminal culpability were made.   It was this report
and its supporting evidence which was used as the supporting material
for the report of the complaint investigation that was considered by
the Police Complaints Authority when the direction was made.     For many
of what appear to be witness statements the computer copy carries a
common heading of 'statement' and 'signed' and 'dated'.     This is
misleading as there are few statements that are signed, dated and
witnessed.   The date quoted is presumably the date that the material
was entered onto the computer.


This material is wide ranging in content and there is much in the
'statement' of a relevant witness that is extraneous to the disciplinary
charges.


Many witnesses gave evidence to the Taylor Inquiry and to the Inquest
that is in addition to that contained in their 'statements'.     In so
far as that oral evidence is pertinent to the charges, but not contained
in their 'statements', their 'statements' are incomplete.


In some cases there is an obvious need for amplification of what a
witness has said to establish what further evidence he can give.
The problem in relation to available evidence was raised in the report
of the investigating officer to the Director of Public Prosecutions
(Page 181) and his comments are revealing:-


"...many of the statements of witnesses obtained have been in the form^
of non-CJA recollections.       Amongst these are accounts from individuals
who may be considered to have some culpability in Criminal Law.        None
of these recollections has at this time been converted into CJA
statement or admitted under caution."


"Recollections, whilst a very efficient method of collecting evidence
early for Counsel to the Inquiry, are very unsatisfactory for a criminal
investigation.        This is not only because they are not protected by
the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, but also because they lack
the thoroughness which invariably follows an efficient one-to-one
interview.     Secondly, they have been subjected to review and possible
editing by persons who may be more minded to protect the liability
interests of the individual or organisation at Civil Law."


"A related issue centres on the evidence taken from individuals at
the Public Inquiry oral hearings and the transcripts made of what was
said...    As far as witnesses are concerned, their accounts, as recorded
in transcripts, have not been converted into statements."


"Furthermore, in giving evidence at the oral hearings no person was

put on o a t h ..."


There seems to be no alternative to obtaining appropriate and suitable
statements.     The discipline form served on an accused officer is
designed to include the requirements of Regulation 11.         Schedule 2
indicates the presumption that statements will be supplied at the same
time the discipline form is served.         Paragraph 12 of Annex 'H' states
that "... the accused officer must be presented with copies of the
evidence..."      By Paragraph 7 of Annex     'H' "...normally these documents
      should be served with the discipline form."   Obviously the discipline
      form containing the charges requires the officer to consider how he
      intends to plead, consider whether he should engage legal representation
      and indicate which witnesses he requires to be called.   He is in no
      position to make sensible decisions or be adequately advised on these
      issues without having the evidence to consider.


11.   Apart from being demanded by Regulations, the preparation of appropriate
      statements will produce real benefits since it will lead to smooth
      Tribunal proceedings occupying the least time and incurring the least
      cost, inconvenience and distress.   If the evidence the Tribunal is
      asked to consider has been put in the form of written, signed and
      witnessed statements containing the complete relevant testimony of
      the witness concerned with extraneous material omitted, both the
      presenter and the accuseds' representatives can have given earlier
      consideration to it and have suitably prepared the case.


12.   A further consideration is that the obtaining of appropriate statements
      will give an indication of the likely performance of witnesses.     It
      is possible that some witnesses will be unwilling to co-operate with
      such further investigation and indeed the Tribunal itself.   Possibly
      some witnesses from impairment will be unable to complete suitable
      statements.   Whether from unwillingness or impairment it is well that
      the position is known before the Tribunal begins.


13.   Suitable statements may enable Regulation 19 procedures to operate
       and this is crucial to the smooth conduct of the Tribunal's business.


14.    Regulation 19 procedures cannot occur without the consent of the accused
       officers and statements unsatisfactory from ambiguity, incompleteness
       or inconsistency with other testimony will make it unreasonable to
       expect such consent.   It may be, however, that for economic reasons
       the accused would have wished to have the procedure operate and being




                                      - 4 -
prevented from doing so because of the quality of the material can
be seen as unfair and so unsatisfactory.


Contemplation of the appointment of a team of officers to obtain witness
statements indicates the need to determine what witnesses are involved.
The conduct of the presentation would rely in large part on showing
that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray gave
accounts to the Taylor Inquiry and the Inquest that amount to admissions
when related to the discipline charges.    With regard to the technical
proof of the provenance of the transcripts (it is acknowledged that
general rules of evidence need not be scrupulously followed) one would
not anticipate difficulty in obtaining witness statements from the
transcribers.   Similar non-controversial statements will be needed
from witnesses to introduce in evidence other documents such as plans,
orders and photographs.


There is likely to be controversy as to whether it is proper for the
Tribunal to consider the testimony given by the accused officers at
the Taylor Inquiry.   Similar, but less powerful objection is likely
to be made to the consideration of their testimony given at the Inquest.


The admissions in relation to the charges (there are no admissions
at the Inquest in relation to charge five) form a major part of the
case against the two officers.


Some of the answers given by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield were
against his interests, but were untrue.    It appears he 'wilted* under
cross-examination and it would be wrong, counsel advises, to seek to
rely upon answers that are believed to be untrue.


A fairly remote possibility exists that the Tribunal might decide not
to hear evidence of the admissions made at the Inquiry and at the
Inquest.   It would be likely to attract severe criticism if the
presented case relied completely on admissions adduced by transcript
and then collapse because the transcripts were not admitted.       It follows
that evidence from sources other than the accused officers themselves
should be to establish the case.


Accordingly, Counsel considers that the case will be based not only
on the admissions made at the Inquiry and at the Inquest, but also
on the testimony of witnesses.     These have been identified as
including


Charge One (Planning):


(Possibly Mole, Sewell, Marshall), Mackrell, Lock, Charlesworth.


Charge Two (Monitoring):


Greenwood, Illingworth, Smith, Goddard, Bichard, Ryan, McRobbie,
Mackrell, Lock, Guest, Nicholson, Hendry, Lackey, Spearritt, Sutton.


Charge Three (Failing to Act on Overcrowding):


Greenwood, Creaser, Illingworth, Smith, Guest, Nicholson.


Charges Four and Six (Action after Gate C Opened):


Greenwood, Creaser, Bennett, Bain, Marsh, Sewell, Goddard, McRobbie,
Bichard, Ryan, Guest, Lock, Higgins, Delaney, White.


Charge Five (Disrepute):


Goddard, Bichard, Ryan, McRobbie, Mackrell, Kelly, Kirton, Jackson,
Robinson, Roworth, Smith, Smart, McGee, Brown, Ensor, Lewis, Lock,
Mole, Marshall, Sharpies.
In addition Counsel is considering calling a small number of supporters
who were present in pens 3 and 4 and perhaps Mr Hicks himself.


The numbers and the rank, status and publicity potential of some of
these individuals make it obvious that it is unlikely that the obtaining
of their statements can be done without it coming to public attention.
It is of obvious interest that the supervised investigation did not
explore what took place in the Board Room or later in the police control
box in relation to the allegation of connivance made against Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield and Assistant Chief Constable Jackson.


It would seem appropriate that West Midlands police officers who had
a duty to investigate the evidence supporting or contradicting the
complaints against police should continue this duty and obtain the
evidence relating to the charges arising from these complaints for
the purpose of the discipline hearing.    They have now the knowledge
of the background circumstances that it would take other officers time
to acquire.   Furthermore the West Midlands Police have the necessary
independence so that suspicion of cover-up or manipulation of witnesses
can be avoided.     The continuing supervision of the investigation by
the Police Complaints Authority will provide a further shield against
such accusations.     If West Midlands Police are to do this work the
funding might lead to public comment.


Unpalatable though it might prove, the Regulations must be followed
and the solution to the problem of obtaining suitable statements appears
to be that West Midlands Police should complete the investigation under
the continuing supervision of the Police Complaints Authority.     Unless
someone completes this duty the Tribunal probably cannot begin its
work.


It seems to be established by Paragraph 9*2 of the Guidance that the
responsibility for "the preparation of the case against accused
officers" lies with the discipline authority of the Force.     In so far
      as the obtaining of suitable statements can be regarded as "the
      preparation of the case" the decision to cause this action may rest
      with South Yorkshire Police.   In so far as the obtaining of statements
      from those who have not previously been asked to make statements, the
      obtaining of statements "following an efficient one-to-one interview"
      and the clarification and amplification of versions must all be regarded
      as investigation, the decision to cause this action may rest with West
      Midlands Police and the Police Complaints Authority.


26.   The possibility exists that when it is widely realised that there is
      a need to take further statements to be satisfactory for the purpose
      of the discipline hearing, questions may be asked whether (as the
      investigating officer indicated) they were unsatisfactory for the
      purpose of a criminal prosecution.   Perhaps there will be some who
      might claim that if the statements were unsatisfactory for a criminal
      prosecution they might not have been ideally appropriate for making
      decisions as to criminal culpability.   Far fetched though such
      speculation clearly is, it would be better if it never could surface.


27.   In the unique circumstances of Hillsborough and bearing in mind the
      interpretation that might by some be put on a new investigation
      supplementary to one already carried out and ratified by the Police
      Complaints Authority, there is clearly advantage in discussion and
      agreement being reached as to the way ahead before any decision is
      made and announced.

                  SUBJECT:      HILLSBOROUGH AFTERMATH


                   Enclosed herewith are copies of the letter of 26 September 1991 from
                   Brigadier Pownall with the copy letters to the complainants which
                   you forwarded for my attention. I have retained the originals.

                   I have noted the comments to Mr Jones and Mr Hicks and I recommend
                   that it would be precedentfor all conversations that you or Chief
                   Superintendent Mole may have with the Police Complaints Authority
                   regarding Hillsborough should be made subject of written record and

%                  a copy forwarded to me forinclusion in our records.

                   Normal   procedure now would be for the 'complainants letters'each
                   to go on the relevant complaint file and necessary administration,
                   including preparation of statistics take place.

                   In the particular circumstances you would wish to consider whether
                   South Yorkshire Police should correspond with the complainants
                   individually.

                  One might expect a reaction from individual complainants and a
                  sympathetic letter might pre-empt the charge of lack of care. One
                  might expect a referral to the media that needs monitoring and perhaps
                  our response predrafted. I have taken no action in these areas
                  awaiting your consideration.

                  May I show Mr Sleightholme this correspondence please?

    You will recall that we wrote to you on 3 July 1990 and again on 11
    July 1991 after receiving the report of the investigation into your
    complaints about the conduct of officers of the South Yorkshire Police
    at Hillsborough in April 1989.      As you know, the Authority have

    in the complaints procedure and some of the factors which are taken
    into account before a decision is reached.

    The aim of this letter     is to explain to you the outcome of your
    specific complaints.

    The investigation has shown that the officer patrolling the perimeter
    track about whom you complained has regularly policed football matches
    at Hillsborough and is familiar with the problems associated with
    capacity crowds.

   On 15 April 1989 this officer was not briefed specifically about
   potential overcrowding but was conscious of orders that the perimeter
   gates should only be opened under strictly controlled circumstances
   and on the command of a senior officer. He was relieved from his post
   on the track from 13.45 hours until his return at 14.50 hours when he
   says that Pens 3 and 4 had filled considerably. He did not consider
   supporters to be in any distress or to be affected by overcrowding at
   the time and describes the normal swaying movements of supporters.
   However, as the swaying and pushing became more marked and he heard
   cries of distress he attempted to contact the Police Control Room via
   his personal radio but when he was unable to hear any acknowledgement
   he opened the gate on his own initiative and assisted people onto the
   perimeter track.
The officer denied swearing at you or anyone else and there is no
evidence from any other source to support this allegation.

^      likely that due to the urgency of the situation your removal
from the actual playing area was carried out hastily and not with the
care which the police would normally take.    However, we think it is
unlikely that the police action caused you other than minor discomfort
  ,the investigation has shown that you refused treatment for your
injury until the match had been abandoned.

The Authority note that you have been unable to identify the two
officers involved from the video recording which you have been shown
and exhaustive enquiries have failed to identify positively either
officer.

The Authority have noted that the Crown Prosecution Service have
already^informed you that they do not consider the evidence sufficient
to justify criminal charges against any police officer.: The Assistant
Chief Constable has written to the Authority proposing that no
disciplinary action be taken against any officer because, in his
opinion, there is insufficient evidence on which to base any charge
and because the officers cannot be identified.

The Authority have carefully studied all the papers contained in the
report of the investigation and have concluded that disciplinary
action cannot be taken as a result of your complaints, although, as
I told you in my letter of 1 1 August 1991 two officers are to face
disciplinary charges arising from other complaints.

A copy of this letter has been sent to the Assistant Chief Constable
and to your solicitor.

      CHESHIRE,




         W l 1 1 recall that we wrote to you on 18 September 1990 regarding
     your complaints against officers of the South Yorkshire Police and I
     promised to write further concerning the actions of officers inside
     the stadium.     I enclose another copy of the note which explains the
     independent role of the Authority in the complaints procedure and some
     of the factors which are taken into account before a decision is
     reached.

     We have carefully considered your statement concerning the treatment
     of the man you describe as being bundled off the pitch on to the track
          fv.the grass. The Crown Prosecution Service have already decided
      nat they do not consider the evidence sufficient to justify criminal
     charges against any police officer and this decision has been conveyed
      o the person involved, who complained in his own right about the
     incident.

    Exhaustive enquiries have been undertaken into everything that
    occurred at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989. They show that while the
    incident you witnessed on the playing area was carried out with some
    naste, the circumstances were such that the police could not be as
    careful as they would normally be.   However, the investigation has
    been unable to establish the identity of either of the officers
    involved. The Assistant Chief Constable has written to the Authority
     o say that disciplinary action cannot, therefore, be taken.

        A?th(^i!:Y ^ aVe carefullY studied all the papers contained in the
    report of the investigation and have concluded that no disciplinary
    action can be taken.
   am sorry that it has taken some time to conclude this part of your
 complaint, but there is a statutory procedure laid down and we had to
 await the outcome of the inquest before we could consider the matter
 ourselves.

A copy of this letter has been sent to the Assistant Chief Constable.

   You will recall that we wrote to you on 15 August 1990 and again on
      July 1991 after receiving the report of the investigation into your
   complaints about the conduct of officers of the South Yorkshire Police
   at Hillsborough in April 1989.      As you know, the Authority have
   considered the disciplinary aspects of the case and I enclose another
   copy °f the note which explains the independent role of the Authority
   in the complaints procedure and some of the factors which are taken
   into account before a decision is reached.

   May I first of all express the Authority's very sincere sympathy at
   the tragic loss of your son John.

   The aim of this letter is to explain to you the outcome of your
         ^ comP laints and how that relates to the disciplinary hearings
   which the Authority have directed.

   Your first complaint was that Superintendent Marshall failed to
   prevent the build-up of fans in Leppings Lane and that he should not
   have requested the opening of the gates.

      giving his account of the situation, Superintendent Marshall said
  m a t at 14.15 hours the fans were moving along Leppings Lane in a
  controlled manner and he had no reason at that time to suppose that
   ney would not get safely into the ground before kick-off. However,
  on y two minutes later there was a sudden surge in the number of
             rs and at 1 4 - 1 7 hours he requested that the road be closed to
   rattie      There was some delay in achieving this, but the road was
         SS iY -£losed at about 14.30 hours. Even at that time the officer
           hat the crowd remained in good humour with no signs of panic,
   owever, the mood changed abruptly some fourteen minutes later to one
   i    ,llnPatlence and hostility and, despite broadcast requests, the
  p lce were unable to regain co-operation from the supporters in that
 upermtendent Marshall, who had no means of knowing the situation
inside the ground, was faced with the probability of fatalities in the
turnstile area, unless the pressure could be relieved.       As he was
unable to turn the crowd back, he had no alternative but to request
* ® °Pfnin9 of the gate in order to allow them to move forward.    The
Authority considered that from his perspective it was not unreasonable
for Superintendent Marshall to request Gate 'C' to be opened.    It is
the Authority's view that before granting permission to open that gate
rne implications of doing so should have been considered and steps
         d®al with the rush of fans which would ensue. Once authority
had been given for Gate 'C' to be opened and the supporters had moved
into the stadium they had gone out of Superintendent Marshall's sight
and his area of command.

The Authority have carefully studied all the available evidence
concerning the tragic events at Hillsborough, and have concluded that
no disciplinary action should be taken against Superintendent


You also complained that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield should not
 ave authorised the opening of the gate under any circumstances,
 owever, the Authority take the view that this decision was not in
       necessarily wrong but that before granting permission to open
tnat gate the implications of doing so should have been considered and
       .     to deal with the rush of fans that would ensue. This is
the basis of the charges being preferred against Chief Superintendent
uucKenfield, who was in overall charge of the policing arrangements,
and which I referred to in my letter of 11 July, 1991 rather than the
specific point about which you complained.

A copy of this letter has been sent to the Assistant Chief Constable.

                   S .lett:er is to explain   to you the     outcome   of the
   specific complaint which you made.

                        h^ S shown that the officer you complained about has
   regularly patrolled football matches at Hillsborough over the past
   w ? ^ n^Year^4.and 1S/ therefore, familiar with the problems associated

             f alt.Wlth minor over-crowding problems on his own initiative
   JL transferring spectators from the central pens to less crowded areas
   or the terraces.

                1 9 8 9 the. officer was not briefed specifically regarding
   p tentiai over-crowding but was conscious of orders that the perimeter
   JliJi          only be opened under strictly controlled circumstances
   anu on the command of a senior officer.

   I? ^ Y i Sv5 elieXed
   1               from his P ost on the perimeter track from 13.45 hours
            r "tUr" at 1 4 , 5 0 hours when he says that Pens 3 and 4 had
  filled considerably. He did not, at that time, consider the fans to
            dlStr\ss nor to be affected by over-crowding. The officer
  described how, when the teams came out, the surge of the crowd caused
       t to come open but no one attempted to leave the pen and he was
       to close the gate.       He said that it was only when the gate was
forced open a second time and had to be held closed that he heard
cries of distress and noticed that people were pressed against the
perimeter fence. He attempted to contact the Police Control Room via
his personal radio but when his message was not acknowledged he gave
instructions, on his own initiative, to other officers to open the
gate and allow people onto the perimeter track. Following the opening
of the gate the pressure of so many people attempting to escape
prevented an orderly exit and the officer stood on the advertising
hoardings where he shouted and signalled for the crowd to move back.

In the light of the officer's explanation it is likely that what you
saw was him pushing people back, not to prevent their escape, but to
try to free those who had fallen to the ground at the front of the
terrace and who were therefore delaying access to the track.

I am not sure whether you are aware that there are a number of
witnesses who have commended the officer for his prompt action once
he realised the serious nature of the situation.   The Authority are
of the opinion that there was nothing more he could have done in the
circumstances.

The Authority have noted that the Crown Prosecution Service have
already informed you that they do not consider the evidence sufficient
to justify criminal charges against any police officer. The Assistant
Chief Constable has written to the Authority proposing that no
disciplinary action be taken against the officer because, in his
opinion, there is insufficient evidence on which to base any charge.

The Authority have carefully studied all the papers contained in the

that disciplinary action would not be justified.    The disciplinary
charges I referred to in my letter of 11 July concern two of the
senior officers who had overall responsibility for the policing
arrangements.

         The aim of this letter is to explain the outcome of your specific
         complaint.

         Firstly, I would like to express the condolences and sympathy over the
         tragic loss of your son, Adam, not only on behalf of myself, but also
         on behalf of the Authority.

%        The investigation has shown that PC Illingworth has regularly policed

I am sure you will appreciate that with the noise of the crowd it
would have been impossible for him to identify any one cry for help
     the investigation has not revealed any evidence to indicate that
;*c Illingworth was slow to act or to neglect his duty.   In fact the
Authority are of the opinion that there was nothing more PC

   The investigation has shown that the officer subject of your complaint

    You will recall that we wrote to you on 15 August 1990 and again on
    11 July 1991 after receiving the report of the investigation into your
    complaints about the conduct of officers of the South Yorkshire
    Police. As you know, the Authority have considered the disciplinary
    aspects of the case and I enclose a further copy of the note which
    explains the independent role of the Authority in the complaints
    procedure and some of the factors which are taken into account before
    a decision is reached.

   The aim of this letter is to explain to you the outcome of your
   specific complaints and how that relates to the disciplinary hearings
   which the Authority have directed.

   May I first of all express my sincere sympathy at the tragic loss of
   your son Richard not only on my own behalf but also on behalf of the
   Authority.

   You complained that Superintendent Greenwood failed to brief police
   officers to monitor the pens for overcrowding inrelation to crowd
   safety.   I-t is not certain that this was part of Superintendent
   Greenwood's responsibilities but the investigation has shown that
   Chief Superintendent Duckenfield did stress the importance of public
   safety at his briefings.

   You also complained that Superintendent Greenwood failed to send
   officers to the rear of Pens 3 and 4 to relieve pressure.      The
   investigation has shown that he had no knowledge of the gate being
   opened and, therefore, was unable to take any remedial action.

   Your remaining complaints relate to his alleged failure to carry out
   his duty by placing himself in a position by the players tunnel and
   his lack of effort in mounting a rescue.    Superintendent Greenwood
   explained that his area of responsibility dictated that he be
   continually on patrol around the perimeter track and he decided that
   at approximately 14.50 hours his position by the players tunnel was
   he one which most required his attention and was a good vantage
 E01?!,* ?e P°lnted out that he was the first senior officer to react
 J ™    4-f1         n in Pens 3 and 4. Having failed to gain any response
 from the Control Box Superintendent Greenwood acted on his own
              t0 aPPr?ach the referee and stop the match.         It is clear
 m a t he then organised and directed groups of police officers in the
           eff°rts;        You w i l 1 appreciate that with the number of
              ^ y o i v e d and the very restricted exists available through
 which the police could relieve the pressure in the pens, the rescue
 °P®ration was unavoidably laborious.           Superintendent Greenwood sent
 officers into Pens 3 and 4 to direct people back through the tunnel
 as soon as it was practicable to do so.            His early arrival at the
 scene is confirmed by another officer and the video recordings.

 I   turn   now   to your complaints against Superintendent Marshall
                   co?trol of supporters in Leppings Lane. In giving his
account of the situation, Superintendent Marshall said that at 1 4 . 1 5
             fans wer® moving along Leppings Lane in a controlled manner
  nd he had no reason at that time to suppose that they would not qet
i    l     l    the ground before kick-off.     However, only two minutes
^ f n 1“here " as a sudden surge in the number of supporters and at
14.17 hours he requested that the road be closed to traffic.          There
was some delay in achieving this, but the road was eventually closed
    about 14.30 hours.       Even at that time the officer said that the
       -felnaip ed in good humour with no signs of panic.     However, the
                 abruPtly some fourteen minutes later to one of impatience
and hostility and, despite broadcast requests, the police were unable
to regain co-operation from the supporters in that area.

     '
     Authority have carefully considered all the available evidence
     frning the tragic events at Hillsborough and have concluded that
r>._clp *}ary action should not be taken against either Superintendent
Greenwood or Superintendent Marshall.

You make several complaints against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.
r*vL?°U atre^ y know' the Authority have directed that disciplinary
Si!! 9 6 8 s^ould be Preferred against Mr Duckenfield and another officer
     ^®r e ,ln overall charge of the policing arrangements.      As far as
       isci p l m a r y tribunal is concerned, it is the responsibility of
  .. °^ce ° arrange the hearing and they have informed me that the
                  . Present is that one of the two officers has been
       It    medically unfit. So the South Yorkshire Police have not yet
    e the necessary arrangements for the hearing.

I have spoken to the Assistant Chief Constable and asked him to fix
  aate and make all possible progress in the meantime.

        You will recall that we wrote to you on 15 August 1990 and again on
        11 July 1991 after receiving the report of the investigation into your
        complaints about the conduct of officers of the South Yorkshire Police
            Hillsborough in April 1989.     As you know, the Authority have
        considered the disciplinary aspects of the case and I enclose a
        further copy of the note which explains the independent role of the
        Authority in the complaints procedure and some of the factors which
        are taken into account before a decision is reached.

        The aim of this letter is to explain to you the outcome of your
        specific complaints and which of those are the subject of disciplinary
        charges against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent
        Murray and which are not the subject of disciplinary charges.

        May I first of all express my sincere sympathy at the tragic loss of
        Sarah and Victoria, not only on my own behalf but also on behalf of
        the Authority.

       You complained that Superintendent Greenwood failed to prevent the
       build up of supporters outside the gates but the investigation has
       established that his command responsibilities did not include the area
       of Leppings Lane outside the stadium.      You also complain that he
       failed to control the movement of supporters after Gate 'C' had been
       opened and that he was slow to respond to the situation and effect a
       rescue.   The investigation established that he had no knowledge of
       Gate 'C' being opened and, therefore, was unable to take any remedial
       action.   He was, in fact, the first senior officer to react to the
       situation in Pens 3 and 4. Having failed to gain any response from
       the Control Box, Superintendent Greenwood acted on his own initiative
       to approach the referee and stop the match.     He then organised and
       directed groups of police officers in the rescue efforts.     You will
       appreciate that with the number of spectators involved and the limited
       exits available through which the police could relieve the pressure
 the rescue operation was unavoidably laborious.        Superintendent
 Greenwood sent officers into Pens 3 and 4 to direct people back
 through the tunnel as soon as it was possible to do so.     His early
 arrival at the scene is confirmed by another officer and by the video
 recordings.

I turn now to your complaints against Superintendent Marshall
regarding his control of supporters in Leppings Lane and his failure
to control the movement of these supporters subsequent to the opening
of Gate 1C*. Superintendent Marshall says that he requested traffic
to be stopped from entering Leppings Lane at 14.17 hours, and again
at 14.22 hours, before traffic was finally stopped shortly after 14.30
hours.   He took this decision for the safety of the many fans in
Leppings Lane. Because there were so many fans outside the ground he
thought the stands and terraces must still have ample capacity and
that if he could keep people moving they would all be in position by
the start of the match.     Superintendent Marshall pointed out that
unless a breach of public order was threatened he has no legal power
to prevent anyone from using a public thoroughfare.     The Authority
considered that from his perspective it was not unreasonable for
Superintendent Marshall to request Gate 'C' to be opened.    It is the
Authority's view that before granting permission to open that gate the
implications of doing so should have been considered and steps taken
to deal with the rush of fans that would ensue.

Once authority had been given for the opening of Gate 'C' and the
supporters had moved into the stadium they had gone           out of
Superintendent Marshall's sight and his area of command.Due to    the
large number of people still outside Superintendent Marshall remained
in Leppings Lane but despatched some 30 of his officers into the
stadium.  He describes how when injured people began to be brought
from the West Stand he realised that a serious incident had occurred
and he then commenced to deal with casualties and fatalities.      He
remained in that area directing operations until he was summoned to
 ne police control box between 16.00 hours and 16.15 hours when he
briefed Assistant Chief Constable Jackson.

The Authority have^ carefully studied all the available evidence
concerning the tragic events at Hillsborough and have concluded that
no disciplinary action should be taken against Superintendent
Greenwood and Superintendent Marshall.

You have made several complaints against Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray who were in overall charge of
the police arrangements at the ground.   As I have already told you,
the Authority^ have directed that disciplinary charges should be
preferred against these two officers.    As far as the disciplinary
tribunal is concerned, it is the responsibility of the Force to
arrange the hearing and they have informed me that the situation at
present is that one of the two officers has been certified medically
unf!t. So the South Yorkshire Police have not yet made the necessary
arrangements for the hearing.
I have spoken to the Assistant Chief Constable and asked him to fix
a date and make all possible progress in the meantime.

A copy of this letter has been sent to the Assistant Chief Constable
of South Yorkshire.

             HILLSBOROUGH BHOUIRY

On Thursday 29 Auguft 1991 Assistant Chief Constable Mr Moore received
a telephone call from Brigadier Potmall at the PCA enquiring as to
the delay in setting the date for the Tribunal.

Suggestions were Bade that the Tribunal date should be set without
charges having been preferred and papers served and that every effort
should be Bade to progress the enquiry in this Banner.

As a consequence of the conversation will you please provide an up
to date report setting out the position with regard to your preparation
of papers and liaison with Counsel.

In addition I would appreciate your views concerning the propriety
of setting a tribunal date without charges bsing served and any
precedent for such a course of conduct.

A further aspect concerns the service of any papers upon an individual
on sick leave, particularly in the circumstances of Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield and any Information as to precedent in this
direction would also be of value.

In view of the attitude of the PCA there is some urgency in this matter
but It has been agreed that we will not respond until Mr Moore returns
from annual leave on the 23 September 1991 * In view of this can you
please prepare your comments as above for my attention by 13 September
1991.

                                « r -------- 1^ — --------   *

The present position respecting the disciplinary proceedings arising
from the Hillsborough disaster is that with the knowledge and approval
of PCA (which case from a telephone conversation) no disciplinary
charges have been served and no arrangements have been made for the
Tribunal, Mr John Mewing, Chief Constable of Derbyshire Constabulary
has agreed to chair the Tribunal and has been consulted (by telephone)
chi tribunal arrangements.


The responsibility for organising the Tribunal rests with South
Yorkshire Police Authority which will foot the bill# The arrangements
will be done via Stephen Walker. No arrangements can be set in motion
until there is a date organised and a notion of the timescale,
witnesses, technical needs of the Tribunal etc. Presently the thinking
is to use a local authority building (e.g Sheffield Town Hall) and
engage Messrs Harpham's for transcript requirements. The dates will
need to fit in with Mr Hewing*s timetable, PCA members' timetable,
Counsels' timetable and of course witnesses to be called by either
side.

Stephen Walker has engaged Mr Sleightholme of Counsel to advise on
the wording of the charges and prepare the case and, probably, present
the case. Mr Sleightholme has been to London and conferred with PCA.
They accepted at the time that he could not advise on the charges until
he had read the evidence to support the charges and this would take
at least three months. The timetable thus is dependent on that. He
will not begin really until he returns from his holiday in USA on
25 September 1991 and may be delayed by his other commitments,
Assuming the best scenario we should be in a position to serve charges
three months from 25 September 1991. I suggest a working date of say
2 January 1992, One would expect in the exceptional circumstances
of the case that the accused officers' representatives would seek to
have three months to consider the position (albeit outside the
requirements of Regulations) so that firm decisions as to the date,
duration and conduct of the Tribunal, or tribunals could be made say
2 April 1992. The case to be presented would by then hopefully have
been prepared.

There would need to be further time to prepare the cases for the
accused officers, say three months, so that an anticipated date for
the Tribunal actually to sit I would see as not before 2 July 1992,
with obviously further allowance for slippage.

The question of service of discipline forms on officers who are off
duty sick is one that is decided on the circumstances of any particular
case. The welfare of the officer would seem paramount and providence-
Indicates medical opinion in   casesof doubt should prevail.

I see nothing to say that the   date of the Tribunal should not be fixed
forthwith provided it was toa   date beyond the wildest dreams    of delay.
A more sensible course in my     view,however, would be to await an
opinion from Mr Sleightholme,   who might be able to liaise with other
counsel and counsel arrive at   an estimate cm which to base action.
There is a possibility that Mr Sleightholrae might advance a view on
the efficacy of the charges that might prevail on PCA to reconsider
the position. There is a possibility that the medical condition of
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield would in the future prevail on PCA
to reconsider the position. If a Tribunal date is pre-set this would
pre-empt any decision respecting Superintendent Murray. Once set it
is hard to envisage abandonment. Once set it is hard to bring forward.

Perhaps it is the Murray hearing that has caused the push by PCA for
a date while they know Mr Sleightholme is in America.

             THE HILLSBOROUGH DISCIPLINE PRESENTATION


At the conclusion of your discussions today with Mr Sleightholme you
asked me to set out briefly the problems identified with a view to
your contacting Brigadier Pownall and inviting him and Judge Petre
to come to Sheffield to see the material and discuss the issues.

The problems need to be addressed and an agreed method of solving
them formulated now so that:-

a.   it can be made manifest that South Yorkshire Police are anxious
     to ensure a thorough and proper presentation;

b.   the grounds for any future appeal from the Tribunal's decisions
     can be avoided;

c.   delay is minimised, and;

d.   the Tribunal runs smoothly because the problems have been
     previously ironed out.

The problems identified are:-

1.   The West Midlands Police enquiry did not produce witness
     statements that can be conveniently used for service under
     Regulation 10 or for Regulation 19 procedures.

     a.   Many of the 'statements' are unsigned and undated
          recollections or answers to questionnaires. For example,
          Kelly.

     b.   Much of the content of 'statements' is irrelevant to the
          discipline charges.

     c.   Many witnesses who obviously can give material evidence
          have not been asked for their evidence. For example, many
          of the people present in the Board Room (Charge 5) have
          not apparently been approached to give evidence.

     d.   Witnesses who give some evidence, for example Mackrell,
          do not expand the relevant points.

     e.   Many of the 'statements' do not contain material that the
          witnesses gave to the Lord Justice Taylor enquiry and the
          Inquest.
2.   Until it is established what the witnesses will say it is
      impractical to formulate charges and establish who are the best
      witnesses to prove the case and fulfil the duty to make it plain
      to the accused on what evidence the charge relies so that the
      accused can prepare his defence.

3.   Statements are needed to provide technical proof of what the
      accused officers said to Lord Justice Taylor Enquiry or to the
      Inquest.

4.   Statements are needed to provide technical proof of plans,
      photographs, documents etc to be used in presentation.

5.   The question of who is to obtain the testimony statements and
      the non contentious formal statements.

6.   It may be that West Midlands Police should be asked to complete
      this work, but that raises questions concerning West Midlands,
      Mr Sharp and the Police Complaints Authority supervision.

7.   The service under Regulation 10 problems-

     a.   Evidence in support ofcharges needs   to be determined so
           that service occurs at the time or   shortly after the service
           of disciplinary fora. Unrealistic    to consider 21 days -
           the accused will need considerable   time.
                                                                         *
     b.   Other statements. Difficult to comply with Regulation 10,
           so we rely on goodwill of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.

8.   Assistant Chief Constable Jackson obviously can give his account
     of the conversation In the police control box and the later
     conversation in the Board Room and perhaps other evidence relating
     to other charges. He has yet to make a statement. Who should
     take it?

              SEPARATE TRIBUNAL ISSUE


When discipline charges are to be preferred, decisions as to the hearing
rest with you.

You nay decide that officer A   and officer B facing charges arising from
a single set of circumstances   may be heard together or separate. In
arriving at your decision you   must have regard to the practicalities
and the need for fairness and   natural justice. You might of your
volition decide to separate.

When you decide not to separate, then:-

1.   Paragraph 14 of Annex H - either of the offlcrs may request you
     to grant separate hearings. You must decide whether to separate.

2.   Even if you decide the hearing should be together after receiving
     the request, the issue would be capable of being raised, in my
     view, before the presiding officer (or tribunal) as it touches
     on the fairness of the hearing, the presentation of evidence, the
     calling of witnesses, all matters I would suppose which are the
     responsibility of the presiding officer to ensure the fairness
     of the hearing.

HILLSBOROUGH


I saw Maureen Oades at her office in Barnsley today (24 July), and we spoke a
a variety of issues concerning Hillsborough.     In particular, we  iscusse
process of allowing our Counsel, Mr John Trevor Sleightholme, to have the
opportunity to comment on the charges preferred by the PCA prior to serving them
on Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray.

It was agreed that she would write to Counsel and ask him:-

     a)     if he was able to comment   on the charges immediately,

     b)     whether he would need a longer time-scale     to enable him   to
             reasonably comment on the charges, and

     c)     what was the likely time-scale within which he would      beable
             to comment on the charges for the benefit of the PCA.


It was agreed that until we had this information from Counsel it would not
possible to reply to Brigadier Pownall at the PCA, and that when a replj' was
received from Mr Sleightholme, Maureen Oades would contact me and I, in turn,
would consult with Brigadier Pownall.

REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE



FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS

1     Matter for Consideration

1.1   The   p r o v i s i o n of financial assistance to two police officers
       involved in disciplinary proceedings arising from the events at the
      Hillsborough Football Ground on 15 April 1989.

2     Background Information

2.1   Home Office Circular No77/1987,            published   on 4December    1987
      provides guidance to Police Authorities on the exercise of their
      discretion    i n c o n s i d e r i n g applications, on behalf of police
      officers, for financial assistance towards the cost of legal advice
      and representation arising from involvement in legal proceedings
      which result from pursuance, in good faith, of their duties or where
      the interests of the Force as a whole are involved.           A copy of the
      Circular is attached.

2.2   Exercising that discretion, members at the Police Authority Meeting
      held on 18 January 1991 decided:-

           (1)   that  applications    for financial assistance in
                 connection with legal proceedings from six officers
                 be approved in relation to the inquest into the
                 disaster;

           (2)   that  the level of representation be left to be
                 determined by the officers, but that it should not
                 extend to Leading Counsel;

          (3)    that in relation to those officers of Superintendent
                 rank who had insurance policies covering costs of
                 this nature, the Authority should meet their costs
                 only after such insurance cover was exhausted, exc ep^^^
                 that they each should be allowed to retain
                 from   s u c h insurance for legal r e p r e s e n t a t i o n T n
                 connection with any disciplinary proceedings.           In the
                 event that Police Authority monies were required by
                 an officer for representation at the inquest the
                 whole or any part of the retained sum not used in
                 disciplinary proceedings was to be repaid to the
                 Authority to the extent that such representation had
                 been funded by the Authority.

2.3   Subsequently, all the applicants were legally represented at the
       inquest    and the  legal costs of two of the officers, Chief
      Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray were such that
      only   th e           they    were allowed   to r e t a i n for legal
      representation in connection with any disciplinary proceedings is
      now available.
Correspondence was received on 12 July 1991 in which the Police
Complaints    A u t h o r i t y indicated it's decision to direct that
disciplinary proceedings be instituted against Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray following an investigation
carried out by Mr Leslie Sharp, the then Chief Constable of Cumbria
Constabulary, into complaints against a number of police officers
relating to the Hillsborough Disaster.

The hearing will be before a Tribunal made up of Mr John Newing, the
Chief Constable of the Derbyshire Constabulary and two members of
the Police Complaints Authority.   The two officers are entitled to
be legally represented at the hearing and both have indicated that
they would wish to be so represented.    It is anticipated that the
cost of such representation may well exceed the         Available to
each officer.

Comment

The decision to allow the officers to retain               of their
insurance cover to meet the cost of any d i scipl inar yproc eedi ngs
was, of necessity, arbitrary since the inquest was still taking
place and at the time it was not known whether any of them would be
charged with a criminal offence or indeed whether any disciplinary
action would eventually be taken.

Paragraph 1 of Home Office Circular 77/1987 advises that the Police
Authority has discretion to meet expenditure incurred by officers in
all kinds of legal proceedings where the officers have acted in
good faith in pursuance of their duties, or the interests of the
Force as a whole are involved.         The Disciplinary Tribunal is
required under Section 94 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984 and would appear,    therefore,    to be a legally constituted
authority with legally defined powers.

In arriving at the decision to provide financial assistance to all
six applicants at their meeting on 18 January, the Police Authority
accepted that they were all acting in good faith in accordance with
well established practices.    It was also accepted that the unique
nature of the circumstances had wide implications for the Force as a
whole.  The Police Authority may now wish to consider a commitment
to the funding of independent legal advice for the two officers
beyond t h e a v a i l a b l e to each so as to ensure that neither
officer is out of pocket.

Where   disciplinary    proceedings     are      concerned        officers of
Superintendent rank are at a disadvantage when compared          with members
of the Police Federation.       Members are entitled             to, and are
regularly provided with, free legal representation at             Disciplinary
Hearings.     No   such  facility    is   a v a i l a b l e to    officers of
Superintendent rank.

Financial Implications

It  is n o t  possible   at   this   stage to assess the financial
implications of this matter which will depend entirely on the length
of time the Tribunal sits.    There is no specific provision in the
Revenue Budget for this expenditure.

REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE


FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS

 1      Matter for Consideration

 1.1    The provision of financialassistance         to two policeofficers
        involved in disciplinary proceedings arising from the events at the
        Hillsborough Football Ground on 15 April 1989.

 2      Background Information

 2.1    Home Office Circular No 77/1987, published      on 4December    1987
        provides guidance to Police Authorities on the exercise of their
        discretion in considering applications, on behalf of police
        officers, for financial assistance towards the cost of legal advice
        and representation arising from involvement in legal proceedings
        which result from pursuance, in good faith, of their duties or where
        the interests of the Force as a whole are involved. A copy of the
        Circular is attached.

2.2     Exercising that discretion, members at the Police Authority Meeting
        held on 18 January 1991 decided:-

              (1)   that a p p l i c a t i o n s for financial assistance in
                    connection with legal proceedings from six officers
                    be approved in relation to the inquest into the
                    disaster;

              (2)   that the level of representation be left to be
                    determined by the officers, but that it should not
                    extend to Leading Counsel;

              (3)   that in relation to those officers of Superintendent
                    rank who had insurance policies covering costs of
                    this nature, tbe Authority should meet their costs
                    only after such insurance cover was exhausted, except
                    that they each should be allowed to retain
                    from such insurance for legal representation in
                    connection with any disciplinary proceedings. In the
                    event that Police Authority monies were required by
                    an officer for representation at the inquest the
                    whole or any part of the retained sum not used in
                    disciplinary proceedings was to be repaid to the
                    Authority to the extent that such representation had
                    been funded by the Authority.

2.3     Subsequently, all the applicants were legally represented at the
        inquest    and the   legal  costs of two of the officers, Chief
        Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray were such that
        only   the            they  were   allowed   to  r e t a i n for legal
        representation in connection with any disciplinary proceedings is
        now available.
Correspondence was received on 12 July 1991 in which the Police
C omplaints Aut h o r i t y indicated it's decision to direct that
disciplinary proceedings be instituted against Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray following an investigation
carried out by Mr Leslie Sharp, the then Chief Constable of Cumbria
Constabulary, into complaints against a number of police officers
relating to the Hillsborough Disaster*

The hearing will be before a Tribunal made up of Mr John Newing, the
Chief Constable of the Derbyshire Constabulary and two members of
the Police Complaints Authority.   The two officers are entitled to
be legally represented at the hearing and both have indicated that
they would wish to be so represented.    It is anticipated that the
cost of such representation may well exceed the         available to
each officer.

Comment

The decision to allow the officers to retain               of their
insurance cover to meet the cost of any disciplinary proceedings
was, of necessity, arbitrary since the inquest was still taking
place and at the time it was not known whether any of them would be

NOTE FOR F I L E :



HILLSBOROUGH - DISCIPLINE PROCEEDINGS



Met with Graham Moore, ACC(Staff Services), and A/Chief Superintendent Fell
to discuss the progress of the case preparation

1. The charges referred to in the PCA letters have now been correctly
   written and once agreed with the PCA will be served by A/Chief Supt
   Fell together with a letter pointing out the difficulties of serving
   supporting evidence on both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray.  This will
   be done, if possible, with their lawyers present.



2. The Secretariat are arranging for Mr Ben Nolan to present the case.
   He  is   from   the   same Chambers   as Mr Issacs who  will  defend
   Mr Duckenfield.    Stephen Walker assures us there is no problem in
   terms of probity, this being an issue he has specifically addressed.
   Our concern is how it will seem to the outside world accepting these
   arrangements are for the Secretariat to complete.  I agreed to raise
   this point again with Stephen Walker.



3. We considered     the draft Police Authority paper (attached) asking for
   financial aid     towards the legal defence by these two officers.   The
   draft may be      incorrect regarding the residual insurance monies of
   Superintendent    Murray.  I agreed to pursue this.

    Stephen Walker has agreed to examine the draft and alter, if necessary,
    and he will be consulted on this.     It is possible this can only be
    put to the Authority if the superintendents request this.    This needs
    to be checked, and if necessary, arranged - I will do.



4. A recent development is an offer from                 MMI to grant the officers
   ex-gratia payments towards their defence.             This is conditional on:-

          a.    they  having   spent   all    their     personal      insurance
                provision;

          b.    the Police Authority not themselves           funding     their
                defence beyond this limit; and,

          c.    Police Authority agreement to this.

    In the circumstances this will not be progressed until it is known
    whether the Police Authority are themselves there to offer financial
    support.



5. Regarding the queries raised by Mr Duckenfield,             to date the intention
   is:-

           a.   that the tribunal will       be   in   Sheffield    - possibly
                at the Town Hall; and,
                                       -   2 -



         b.   probable  dates   are  October/November  (it  is   now
              understood that Mr Issacs will be available).

   R egarding the request for Police Discipline Regulations and Home Office
   advice/interpretation ('blue book*), A/Chief Supt Fell is supplyinq
   these direct.

                 (Discipline & Complaints)


                 SUBJECT:     a fter   h il l sb o r o u g h


                 We spoke today respecting Hillsborough and you asked me to commit to
                 paper some thoughts concerning personnel.

                 It seems to me of importance that SYP support and preparation for the
                 Tribunal should be above reproach and I therefore seek appropriate
                 quantity and quality of personnel to carry out the task of producing
                 papers for presenting counsel and two defence counsel. The work of
                 these worthies might commence from 5 August 1991 •

                 (I have set in train action to equip an office at Hammerton Road from
                 which presenting officer might work and this will be alarmed.
                 Additionally a computer terminal will be installed to access the
                 material).

                 What needs to be done I feel is to set up a team consisting of Inspector
                 Barker of my Department and PC Greenway, also of my Department. I
                 foresee an officer of higher rank eventually becoming part of that team
                 which I guess will exist until the end of the disciplinary proceedings
                 say six or nine month^. The immediate problem is that Inspector Barker
                 needs to be replaced in Superintendent Stuart's investigating team.
                 May a suitable replacement be found please?

                 In the meantime these two officers will be fully engaged in sorting
                 the Hillsborough material following takeover, the logistics of preparing
                 for presenting counsel, sorting property, copying documentation,
                 addressing disclosure matters, etc, etc.

                 I have spoken with Chief Superintendent Lowe regarding an Inspector
                 to come into the Department.

       Thank you for your letter of 26 June, 1991 and for the various
       papers you enclosed. The Authority are also grateful to you. and
       Mr Fell for coming to our offices to discuss this matter.

       The Authority wish to assure you that we have given the most
       careful cons iderat ion to the representations made by yourself and
       Mr Fell.   We found these by far the most compelling arguments.
       Whilst we have considered Mr Sharp's letter of 16 May addressed to
       Mr Hayes, we did not feel it was altogether appropriate for the
       investigating officer to set out so fully his views on the
       disciplinary action to be taken.

       We have also taken into account the opinion provided by Mr Richard
       Payne.  It is our view that the extracts which he quotes and the
       opinions he expresses are selective and do not reflect soir-e
       important points especially some of those made by the Coroner who
       on more than one occasion separates the question of unlawful
       killing from the question of neglect, for example, pages 8, 48, 54
       on 21 March, 1991 and page 31 on 26 March, 1991.

       Since our meeting we have held a separate meeting at which the
       Chairman has fully rehearsed the arguments to be considered in
       deciding whether or not the Authority should direct that charges be
       preferred against any of the officers involved. We can assure you
       that we gave very serious consideration to all the points which you
       and Mr Fell raised. We are, of course, bound to set these against
       our duty to consider the complainants1 allegations of "neglect of
       duty" as defined in the Regulations.    We considered the question
       strictly in the context of complaints by members of the public
       against individual police officers and in accordance with the
       procedures and guidance laid down.
The Authority have decided in accordance with Section 93(3) of the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to direct that disciplinary
charges be preferred against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
Superintendent Murray as set out in our letter of 7 May, 1991 and
for the reasons explained in that letter.     We confirm that the
Authority do not consider it appropriate to prefer disciplinary
charges against any other officers.

The Authority hope that it will be possible to confine the
presentation of the case which is concerned solely with the
overcrowding in Pens 3 and 4 and Mr I uckenfield's alleged
discreditable conduct to within a week and that the hearing can be
arranged for early October.

I would be grateful if you would inform me of the date of the
tribunal as soon as you are able to arrange it so that I may

    Mrs Joan McBrien                           Our Ref:      COM 91/131/34

                                                            It . July, 1991
    CLWYD




                                      /

    I am writing on behalf of the Police Complaints Authority about the
    complaint you made about the tragic events at Hillsborough on 15
    April 1989 concerning officers of the South Yorkshire Police. The
    enclosed note explains the independent role of the Authority in the
    complaints procedure and some of the factors which are weighed
    before a decision is made.

    Following the investigation into your complaints,5and in accordance
    with procedures laid down, South Yorkshire Police have considered
    whether or not it would be appropriate to prefer disciplinary
    charges against any officer on duty that day, and have sent their
    recommendations to this Authority.

    We have now carefully considered their proposals and the Authority
    have used their statutory powers to direct that disciplinary
    charges be preferred against two officers.

    The Authority thought it right to give you this information to
    coincide with their press statement, but we will be writing to you
    again more fully concerning your own particular complaint in the
    near future.   I am sorry that it has taken some time to conclude
    this part of the process but there is a statutory procedure laid
    down and we had to await the outcome of the inquest before we could
    consider the matter ourselves.

    I am writing on behalf of the Police Complaints Authority about the
    complaint you made about the tragic events at Hillsborough on 15
    April 1989 concerning officers of the South Yorkshire Police. The
    enclosed note explains the independent role of the Authority in the
    complaints procedure and some of the factors which are weighed
    before a decision is made.

    Following the investigation into your complaints, and in accordance
    with procedures laid down, South Yorkshire Police have considered
    whether or not it would be appropriate to prefer disciplinary
    charges against any officer on duty that day, and have sent their
    recommendations to this Authority.

   We have now carefully considered their proposals and the Authority
   have used their statutory powers to direct that disciplinary
   charges be preferred against two officers.

   The Authority thought it right to give you this information to
   coincide with their press statement, but we will be writing to you
   again more fully concerning your own particular complaint in the
   near future.   I am sorry that it has taken some time to conclude
   this part of the process but there is a statutory procedure laid
   down and we had to await the outcome of the inquest before we could
   consider the matter ourselves.

                 SUBJECT;       POLICY FDR DISCLOSURE OF HILLSBOROUGH MATERIAL

                  1.   This paper is submitted to enable policy decisions to be made
                       for dealing with any request that is received seeking material
                       connected with the Hillsborough Enquiry.

                 SIZE OF PROBLEM

                  2.   Currently the force has received some fifty requests for material.
                       This does not include possible requests to West Midlands which
                       may not have been forwarded. This does not include the
                       "Hillsborough Steering Committee" requests which have never been
                       specified. It does not include the requests for return of
                       material that was surrendered on condition of ultimate return
                       such as tickets. It is believed that there are hundreds of these
                       conditional surrenders.

                  3.   One may anticipate that once it becomes known that South Yorkshire
                       Police are releasing material further requests will be received.

                 PROBLEM OF "OWNERSHIP"

                  4.   It is a question never resolved as to the status of this material
                       which would make it appropriate for South Yorkshire Police to
                       release it. For example a request was received for the release
                       of a pathologist's report that might have been dealt with by
                       referring the requester to the pathologist or to HM Coroner.
                       Another example would be photographs taken by press cameramen.
                       Would South Yorkshire Police act correctly to release such
                       material?

                 GENERAL PLAN

                  5-   Once the problem of "ownership" is resolved the general plan would
                       be to seek to classify requests by type and have a disclosure
                       policy according to that classification. Then when a similar
                       request falling into that classification is received it can be
                       dealt with in accordance with the determined policy.

                 PHILOSOPHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

                  6.   The legal position ^IwouM^su^posg^is that there is no legal
                       requirement for SoutK^York^hlre Police to disclose anything.

                 7-    The choices of policy are:-
                                                     a. disclose nothing
                                                     b. disclose anything on request
                                                     c. disclose selectively

                       A policy of giving on request is attractive since it shows an
                       openness that will find favour publicly and will comply with the
                       wishes of the requester. The material is innocuous and current
                       numbers are small.


GEN/2
 9. At the other extreme a policy of non-disclosure has benefits in
     that it is less costly of resources, avoids nice judgements that
    might give rise to criticism and avoids embarrassment or argument
     in the event of the requested material not being found.

10.   Any disclosure might become part of a gathering of material that
      could form the basis of a book or a programme exposing differences
      with the "authorised version" of events revealed by the Taylor
      Enquiry or the Inquest. The chance of this occurring piecemeal
      is exceedingly remote but any disclosure may lead to access to
      researchers seeking exactly this objective.

11.   If not an "all or nothing" policy then disclosure will require
      decisions on merits of individual cases. This may lead to South
      Yorkshire Police arbitrating on matters of good taste for example
       a request for a photograph showing dead son's corpse in situ.
      Probably any souveniers will be marketable.

CLASSIFICATIONS CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED

12.   The classifications currently identified are:-

      C1   Request for copy of statement made by the requester. Such
           requests have been received in the past ostensibly for inquest
           or litigation purposes and have not been actioned. It may
           be that the purpose has now passed. Probably none of those
           already received should be actioned unless fresh request is
           made.

      C2   Request for copy of statement made by someone other than the
           requester.

      c3   Request for copy of statement made by someone other than the
           requester when the maker has given consent for supply to the
           requester. Requests falling in both these categories have
           been received but like Cl the purpose may have passed.
           Probably none of those already received should be actioned
           unless fresh request is made.

           Request for return of ticket handed over to West Midlands
           Enquiry. Some requests by letter have been received that
           may relate to civil actions. Others arise from a form of
           receipt given by West Midlands at the time indicating the
           handover was conditional. There appear to be some hundreds
           of these. Probably none of those should be actioned unless
           fresh request is made.

      c5   Request for audio, photographic or video material. Requests
           have been received for photographs. There appear to be
           possible sub groups depending on the provenance of the
           material

           a.   South Yorkshire Police Material;
           b.   Media Material;
           c.   Fire and Ambulance Service Material;
           d.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Material;
           e.   Private Individual's Material;
           f.   West Midlands Police Material.
            Probably copyright considerations arise in relation to
            disclosure of any other than South Yorkshire Police Material
            and if a policy of disclosure finds favour then legal advice
            should be sought together with the approval of the "owner".
            Costs also arise as supply probably should be conditional
            on payment of fee. The administrative problems may be
            considerable in that if the requester does not have a
            reference for the photograph he wants it may be exceedingly
            difficult to trace.

           Requests for expert evidence such aspathologists report.
           Probably the answer to the "ownership" problemwould indicate
           that South Yorkshire Police should not disclose but refer the
           requester to the pathologist, etc.

      ^7   Requests for material made by policeofficers.    As far as is
           known no requests have been made by South Yorkshire Police
           officers who might feel they had grounds to sue the Chief
           Constable and would seek specific material to support their
           case.

DECISIONS REQUIRED

13*   The need for the following decisions to be made has been
      identified:-

      A - The "ownership problem" - needs legal advice as to status
          of this material

      ® ~ "Philosophical problem" - needs to be a decision on the
           fundamental stance of the force, all?, nothing?, selective?

      C ~ If selective then decision needed on whether to release
          on past requests or only any fresh requests.

      D - If selective then decision needed on whether classification
          plan is appropriate after which more detailed work will be
          undertaken in relation to each identified classification
          to enable a specific disclosure policy to be made on each
          classification.

COMMENT

14.   Any policy of disclosure can be implemented.

15*   The easiest course to take is to disclose nothing. The
      justification of that course, if justification is needed, is
      harder to supply.

                SUBJECT:      a f t e r t h e h il l s b o r o u g h   in v e s t i g a t i o n


                Further to our discussions today I felt it would be useful to set out
                intentions and circulate to all persons who have been involved in the
                various initiatives relating to the Hillsborough aftermath.

                If you are to be responsible for the Hillsborough material, with me doing
                the necessary work involved, it is important that all initiatives and
                decisions are made known to me that might effect the planning and
                implementation. I would ask that this policy operates forthwith.

                I believe that there are different types of material involved as follows

%               A.   Documents of the Dear Enquiry

                B.   Material supporting the Dear Enquiry

                C.   Property of the deceased

                D.   Property collected at the scene, identifiable and unidentifiable

                E.   Documents of the Wain Enquiry

                F.   Material supporting the Wain Enquiry

                I believe A, B, C and D material is indexed using the "West Midlands"
                computer and E and F material is indexed using the "South Yorkshire"
                computer.

                1.   With the co-operation of West Midlands Police the plan is to bring
                      material C and D to Hammerton Road, set it up in order, check it
                      and accept it. Target time is week commencing 3 June 1991 with
c                     the work to be completed by 7 June 1991•

                2.   Transfer material E and F from Castle Green to Hammerton Road, set
                      it up in order, check it and accept it. This will require approval
                      decisions and appropriate hand over from the person presently
                      responsible for it. The timing of this needs to be decided by the
                      person currently controlling and accessing this material. Will
                      you please discuss this with DCC to resolve the unknowns.

                3.   Obtain the "West Midlands" machine and data and set up so that the
                      index is accessible from the VDU located in Complaints and
                      Discipline. This work is currently being dealt with by Computer
                      Section. Target time is now until 1 July 1991 when it should be
                      finalised.

                4.   Once 3 is finalised with the co-operation of West Midlands Police,
                      training of personnel in the use of the "West Midlands computer
                      to be carried out. It is anticipated this will take 5 days and
                      the personnel involved would be Police Constable Greenaway and
                                      I There may be staff implications in such a proposal
                      that need considering.


    GEN/2
5-    Once 3 and 4 are finalised with the co-operation of West Midlands
     . Police, material A and B will be brought to Hammerton Road, set
       up in order, checked and accepted. Target for this is week
       commencing 8 July 1991 with work to be completed by 12 July 1991.

6.   As soon as material is housed in Hammerton Road, from that date
      the alarm system protecting the area needs to operate. Suggest
      keyholder for this should be officer in charge FI Control Room with
      the actual key housed in glass front holder (as with armoury key).

Will you formally approve this plan please or indicate those areas that
need modification. I will then circulate to interested parties and liaise
with West Midlands Police and others to secure implementation.

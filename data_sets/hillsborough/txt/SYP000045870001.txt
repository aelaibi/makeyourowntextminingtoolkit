    Dear Mr. Derricott,
                                                   Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground
                                                           Capacity of North West Corner
                 Please excuse the delay in giving a detailed response to your
   letter of 6 December 1989.                                                            I needed to have some checks made on the
   measurements of the terrace.                                                                 Arrangements were made for these
   measurements to be made on two occasions.                                                                                    Each time there was heavy
   rain all day.                              The work was completed just before Christmas.
                 By way of background, you will no doubt be aware that we did
   not carry out a survey of the Leppings Lane end of the ground when
   the original Safety Certificate was applied for in 1978-79.                                                                                                                The
  Club provided drawings prepared by their previous consultants
  of the North stand, the West stand the North West corner from
  which we made measurements.                                                               There were no drawings available of
  the older parts of the ground                                                                 (the Kop and the South stand) and
  we were commissioned by the Club to make the necessary measurements
  on site, for which we quoted a specific fee.                                                                                     This is all well
 documented in our correspondence with the Club at the time and in
 our report to them of January 19 79.
                 We have now measured the upper part of the North West corner,
 and there is a considerable discrepancy between the actual measure-

 merits and those scaled from the drawing based upon that
 provided by the Club.    Instead of the 2 900 which had
 notionally been considered to be the capacity of the upper
 North West corner,   the total area available would only take
 2242 on the basis of 54 spectators to 10m2 .
      The discrepancy between the drawing and the actual measurement
 is not in any way apparent from a visual inspection of the terrace.
 At the time when we were reporting in 1979, we were made
 aware that m    September 1970,   following a report by the Club's
 previous consultants the police had agreed a capacity for the
 elevated North West corner of 3,000 spectators.      That figure
 or a higher one had been used in all the major games from the
 World Cup in 1966.    There was thus no reason for us to be alerted
 in 1978/79.    We enclose a copy of the 1970 report and the Chief
 Constable's letter to the Club dated 30 September 1970.
     Obviously we have been concerned about the possibility that
 the calculations for the terrace in front of the West stand might
 also have been based on a misleading plan.     Our check measurements
 have shown that the actual area is such that it could accommodate
 the 'notional' number of spectators with a slightly lower density
 than 54 per 10m2 .

Dear Mr* Taylor,

                 Capacity of Hillsborough Stadium

     Thank you for your letter of P.Qth July enclosing a
copy of the Chief Constable’s letter uatcd 16th July in
connection 'with the Ground Capacity of Hillsbor.u^n
Stadium.

     I understand the words "scientific calculation1 were
used by your ^oodself in the ori^inrJL ter^s of reference
to us but in the absence of any known forniula we have
dealt with this matter by empirical iseans.

     We assembled a small crowd of people in our drawing
office to represent n snaple of a crowd standing reasonably
close to :etaer. v.'e then established a coefficient of 1.34
lineal feet per person on each step of terrace, each person
bein^ allocated the full depth of the terrace whatever its
dimension.

      We then referred to our detailed surveys of the terrace
fend we also measured on site the known usable length of the
terrace steps,         due allowance for f ^ n ^ a y s , passageways,
stairways, esc. and the length of eacn section was divided
by the coefficient to establish the capacity.

     We regard the forej.in^ r.3 an interin approach to the
problem, until such time as the coefficient could be checked
by the use of crowd counting devices.

                                Yours sincerely,

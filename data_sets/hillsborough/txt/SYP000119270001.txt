A s mor e and m o r e Liverpool            suppo r t e r s    filled the s tand and terraces

At about       1 p m I wen t        into the G y m for a hot m e a l , after w h i c h 1

beginning       to c limb       into the e l e v a t e d sect i o n of the N o r t h W est

the usual cracks and                jokes.    Several        fans   in the N orth S tand w a n t i n g

W h e n the teams came out for a w a r m up kick about the football                              chants

c l i mbing the fence that se p a r a t e s the N o r t h S tand fro m the Leppings

W i t h a couple of other officers,                   from the ones just co m i n g onto the

t r a c k , I went      into the Stand to try to prev e n t them f r o m c l i m b i n g

over.       These m e n wer e on the fence               just about       'A' entrance,        when I

reached them,          one ha d cl imbed b a c k , after shouts              that the Police w e r e

coming,      another wa s almost over and as I reached up to h i m he fell

h e a v i l y onto the seats of the s t a n d .              The fans on the other side of

the fence b e c a m e v e r y         host i l e at this t h i nking I had p u l l e d hi m

down.       I tried w i t h other officers               to d r a g this p e r s o n a w a y f rom the

seats but was u n a b l e to m o v e him.

He was v e r y h e a v y and a p p eared           the w o r s e   for drink,     as w e r e the fans

on the other side of the f e n c e .                  T h e s e were    trying to g r a b me and

t h r o w p u n c h e s at me.        W i t h the p o s s i b i l i t y that the fa l l e n p e r s o n was

injured I looked b ack                at the g r o u n d to see if I could c a t c h the

a t t e n t i o n of a S t . Johns a m b u l a n c e man.          I had m y bac k to the p itch

all    this time and was not aware of a n y t h i n g w r o n g at this time except

the fans near          to me w ere v e r y t h r e a t e n i n g and loud.

As I looked a r o u n d I saw wha t a p p e a r e d to be a p i t c h i n v asion from

b ehind the L e p p i n g s Lane goal w i t h fans c l i mbing over                  the p e r i m e t e r

fence and s p i l l i n g onto the pitch.

I d e c i d e d to go bac k dow n to the track as I went past                        'A'    entrance         in

the stand scores of fans were co m i n g out of it onto the se a t e d area

of the stand and p u s h i n g all b e f o r e            them.        I tried to tell       t hem to go

b ack but      it was u s e l e s s , the amount of people comi ng up the e n t rance

was u n b e l i e v a b l e .     The y kept c o m i n g out and p u s h i n g and ov e r f l o w i n g

onto the t r a c k .            I forc ed m y w a y onto the track and m a d e m y w a y to

the people on the pitch.                    I still    thou ght      it was a p itch       invas i o n but

w h e n I saw some of the fans close up I c o u l d see                      it wa s m o r e    than

that.      Howe v e r I tried to direct               fans back        into the terrace via Gate

p ale and g a s p i n g for br e a t h and           looked exhausted.              I still did not

realise wha t had h a p p e n e d and so I tried as best I c ould to p e r suade

fans to m o v e awa y f r o m the p l a y i n g area and to cal m them that a p p eared

distressed.

I then sa w pe o p l e - Police,                f a n s , s t e wards carry i n g bo d i e s a way from

s ome crying,        some     In shock and d i s t r e s s e d .         I still could not see the

by even ts as I cannot r e c a l 1 m u c h of wha t                  I did after         that.

to me I don't know,              but I do recall a m i d d l e aged couple wh o said

they were Liverpool              fans and had b e e n at the Heysel                  stadium,       come up

to me and thanked me for w hat                    I had d o n e .       Whatever      it wa s    I don't

k n o w but   I mus t have caught their eye b e c a u s e they said they had come

back just         to see me.          I felt v e r y o v e r c o m e at      their        c o m m e n t s .Fro m

then on I         was    in wha t     I can only d e s c r i b e as shock.

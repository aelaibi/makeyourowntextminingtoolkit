9-50 am    Attend briefing in North Stand.

11.00 am   Took up position at turnstile                         4, Leppings Lane entrance          to West

           Stand seating.              At this time the turnstiles were not open and the

           blue steel gates onto Leppings Lane were shut.                                As small numbers

           of spectators began to arrive the turnstiles opened and we opened

           the    gates       to the       turnstiles.           We were issued with black plastic

           dustbins for confiscated property.

           Spectators began arriving but during the first hour to 12 o'clock

           very few actually entered the ground.                              From where I was standing

           1 could see onto Leppings Lane where several people were standing

           around.          The number of people                 arriving steadily        increased until

           2     o ’clock,        at   which        time     fans      were    regularly      entering    the

           turnstiles.

           At    around       2.30     pm,    queues       for   the    turnstiles      had   formed.     The

           queues in the area in which I was standing reached about half-way

           back    to       the    gates     onto    Leppings       Lane.       I had    confiscated many

           cans of soft drinks but no alcoholic drinks.

           However,         I had      seen   people        throwing     unopened cans        of beer into

           the black bins at the turnstiles.                           I can remember a man walking

           up    to     the       turnstile     and        throwing     away     two    unopened   cans    of
Newcastle       Brown a l e .         He then walked back towards Leppings Lane,

and did not seem to be in any hurry to enter the ground.                                        At the

same time,        another man threw away a 1J litre bottle of beer, he

too    walked      away        from       the    ground     afterwards.           I    can     remember

seeing    two     crates           of Heineken        beer stood       on   the       ground    at   the

corner of Leppings Lane.

Up until        this    time,        approximately 2.30 pm,               the amount of people

queueing    to     get        into    the       ground was still          sufficiently         few for

people     to     be        able     to    walk      up   to   me   and     ask       directions      to

entrances, etc.

I cannot recall anybody approaching me who did not have a ticket.

Fans     seemed        to    be     congregating          outside     the   gates       on    Leppings

Lane.

After 2.30 pm, within the space of a few minutes, I can remember

suddenly        getting           busier        searching      people,      the       queue     at   my

turnstile       began pushing and as I looked up I                          saw that          the area

within the gates was solid with people.                             It seemed as if a large

number of people had materialised from nowhere.

The pushing at the                 turnstiles        increased and I can recall people,

particularly           older       people       or   people    with    children,        complaining

about the pushing.

Within a few more minutes all signs of queueing had disappeared.

I was stood with my back to the wall at the side of the turnstile

and I had stopped                  searching people because             there was no room to

do so.
                                               -   3   -




Because of the pressure of the crowd, people began jamming in the

entrance            to    the    turnstile         and as a result,                this slowed down the

rate at which people could enter the ground.

More       and more             people        began        to    complain      about    the   crush     and   I

noticed         that           the    situation            was    getting      more    serious     than     was

normal for a football match.

I was not able                  to do anything in the position that I was in and

the crowd pressure was                        increasing all the time.                   I decided to go

to the point               on Leppings             Lane where I had              last seen our serial

sergeant and advise him of the situation at the turnstiles.                                                 Our

serial      had          not    been      issued       with       radios.       I realised       that      if I

were       to       stay       where      I    was         for    any     longer      this    would    become

impossible           so I forced my way through the                             crowd.       This was very

difficult           even        though        people were          trying      to make way for me as

they realised what I was trying to do.

As    I got         to     the gates          a woman grabbed hold of my arm,                         she had

injured her                foot and she was panicking and in tears.                            I could not

get through                the crowd so I left her in a triangular clearing made

by the opened gates.                       I then made my way onto Leppings Lane.                             I

was    in       a        crowd       of   people           who    were     steadily      pushing      in    the

direction of the turnstiles.

I    can    remember             looking back              towards       the   turnstiles where I had

been and seeing what appeared                               to be just a crowd of people.                     I

was worried                because from this distance the                      people approaching the

ground would not see,                      or be aware of, the                 crushing at the front.
All the time people were pushing past me, adding to the crowd.                                           I

wanted       to tell        them that they              should hold back           for a while         and

although       some     did,       the    majority          didn’t.         I    then    looked    along

Leppings Lane          and       as    far as       I     could see it was             full of people

coming towards us.                It looked like a battering ram.

As     the     crushing          around       the         turnstiles became             more    obvious,

mounted officers             came       to the point             on Leppings Lane where I was

standing and began to                   form a cordon, presumably to hold back the

crowd and so relieve the pressure on the turnstiles.                                       I was stood

in a gap between two horses trying to prevent people from coming

through.

I    realised        that    3    o'clock       was       approaching because             I was    being

asked if the kick-off was going to be delayed.                                    I could not hold

people back and I was                   being pushed off my feet.                       I moved to the

stadium side of one of the horses.                               I could see fans scaling the

wall at       the    turnstiles          en masse.           I cannot say how many youths

got    in     this    way,       but     in    the      short     time     that   I     was    watching,

possibly 20 or 30 managed to gain entry this way.

Many    people       were        becoming      abusive       towards       the    mounted       officers

and    I     saw    several       struggles          as    people    fought       to     get    past   the

horses to the ground.                   I noticed that the majority of fans trying

to get into the ground at this time were youths.                                      When I had been

at    the     turnstiles          earlier      the        majority    of    people       entering      had

been older and better behaved.

After a        few minutes I saw                thatthe crowd at the turnstiles, both

for    the     West     Stand         seating       and    for    the terracing,          had    thinned
out.         I    did       not        realise       at    the       t im e, but        this    was       probably

coincident with the gates being opened.

I     then       saw       our    serial       sergeant,             Police      Sergeant       Whitlam,         and

almost       straight             away     he    told           us    of     a   radio       call    requesting

officers to enter the ground.                               I followed other officers through

the    turnstiles            and down the              side of the Leppings                    terracing into

the South Stand.                      At the entrance to the terracing at the corner

with     the      South          Stand,    I     saw       an    injured         girl    being      treated       by

officers.              Although          this    area       was       full,       I   cannot     say      that    it

looked       tightly             packed.         I        heard       fans       in   this     area       chanting

"shitty ground".

I then stood                 in a queue         of officers             waiting to enter the pitch

from    a walkway                in    the South          Stand.           I saw a crowd of officers

around the centre pen fencing behind the Leppings Lane goal and I

saw fans climbing over the fence onto the pitch.                                              I can remember

thinking         that       we        were dealing with a pitch                       invasion but then I

saw fans on the pitch with the Police officers.                                              These fans were

not    being       shephered            away as I would have                      expected with a pitch

invasion.              I     then looked at the centre pen and                            saw that it was

very     full.                   The people          inside          were swaying            forwards       and    I

realised that the officers were in fact helping people to get out

of the pen.

I have been a season ticket holder at Hillsborough for many years

and I can remember looking around the ground and thinking that it

looked       unrecognisable.                     I    had        never       before      seen       the    ground

anywhere near as full.
As we got onto            the pitch the match had already                     stopped       and the

players       had    left.        I    saw    two    young     boys     being       carried      away

towards       the   South Stand,         they       were   unconscious        and    their      faces

were    ominously blue.               At this point I realised that                  there was a

danger to life within the ground.                      I thought to myself that those

boys could easily have been killed, I realise now that they were

probably already dead.

The    gate    through the        fencing into the South end of the Leppings

terracing was opened and I followed Police Sergeant Whitlam into

the pen.

I made my way to the dividing                   fence with the centre pen where I

saw    people       climbing      over   to    our     side.      I helped          two    or   three

people over and then I climbed onto a safety barrier and shouted

to    the   fans     in    the   centre       pen    to move     back    up    the    terracing.

Somebody      who    climbed      over the      fence at         the side of me            shouted,

"There’s people           died    in there",         I took this to mean              that      there

were some injured people at the front of the centre pen and I was

shocked.

I climbed       over      the    fence   and    landed      in the centre           pen.        I saw

that many people were laid on the ground at the front of the pen.

They were motionless              and their faces and limbs were blue.                          I can

remember       being       puzzled atfirst          because    young-looking              people

d o n ’t die in large quantities all at once.

I went to a man who was laid at the top of the pile.                                      His waist

and    legs    were       trapped in         the pile      and    he    w asn ’t     moving.        I

wondered       why the people                ontheterracing weren’t doing anything
                                           -    7   -




to help him and as I got to him I realised that this was because

he    was    dead.         I straightened his                     head   out     and    I   felt    for his

pulse       at his       throat.       I opened his                left eye and I saw that his

pupil       was    dilated.          He was              about     30    years    old       and    he   had   a

moustache.              I was kneeling and I looked around, there were dozens

more like him and I didn’t know where to start.                                        The crowd on the

terracing         behind me        seemed to be just standing there.                                I heard

chants       of         "Murderers",           I        ignored     them.         I     heard      somebody

shouting,         "Get me out".                I looked and saw a man with his left leg

trapped in the pile of people.                             He was halfway between me and the

gate    onto       the    pitch.       I       could       reach his hand             and I pulled and

pulled.           I wouldn’t normally                    pull     somebody’s arm that              hard for

fear of hurting them.                  He couldn’t get free.                      I looked down and

saw that          the    ground between me and him was covered with tangled

up bodies and I walked on them towards the man.                                         I can remember

thinking that my Doc Martens were soft and that I wouldn’t cause

any serious             damage to the limbs I was treading on.                               I dug at the

pile around his leg with my hands and with his pulling we got it

free.       He too walked across                        the bodies towards me and back onto

the terracing.

I was    then stood about four or five feet away from the gate onto

the pitch.          I saw two officers leaning into the gateway trying to

pull a body free.              I can remember assessing my situation and took

the view that I would be of more assistance by remaining in the

enclosure         than making my way back to the gate.                                 I stayed where I

was    and helped the two officers                          to free the body.                This we did
                                          8




and   I    remained       there    and     helped       to get       several          more    out also.

One   of the officers             on the       gate    shouted       that       one    of people was

still     alive.      He wasn't          as blue       as    the others          and so we pulled

and   got    him    free.         All    the    time I was          frightened of             the crowd

behind me         causing another          crush and at this point I carried the

live person through the gates and out onto the pitch.                                         As I laid

him   down he       started       to    choke        and breathe.           I    stuck my fingers

into his mouth and cleared his tongue away.                             A WPC helped me roll

him   onto    his    side.         He    was     in    his mid-twenties               and     had black

short hair and wore a red jumper.                           As we tended to him, a plain­

clothes      officer      came     up    to     us    and    asked    if    the man           was       still

alive.       He told us to get him to the ambulances at the other end

of the pitch.

Other people nearby were                  carrying wooden boards                  and together we

lifted      the    unconscious          man onto a board and carried him to the

other     end of the pitch.               I shouted that we                had a live casualty

and he was immediately taken by the people around the ambulance.

I noticed that a lot of the other casualties who had been carried

here were being left, presumably because they were dead.

I   then     made    my     way    back        towards       the    Leppings          Lane     end.         I

assisted      in    carrying       more       casualties       to    the    kop        end.         I    then

joined      the    cordon    of officers mid-way across                     the pitch.                  I can

remember being approached by several groups of Liverpool fans on

the pitch who were asking if the game was to be abandoned.                                               They

also asked me how they could obtain refunds on their tickets.                                               I

couldn't think of a reply.
After the announcement was made to abandon the game I made my way

towards the lep to try and find my serial sergeant.          I saw a pile

of property near      to   the centre   gate of the pen.   I saw a youth

picking coins up from the ground.          I did not see him putting the

money with the other property.          I cannot say if he was looting as

I did not challenge him.

Our serial      then moved out of the ground where we were      stationed

at   the side    of the    temporary mortuary near to the river   at   the

side of the South Stand.

I then attended the de-briefing in the North Stand and at 7-00 pm

went off duty.

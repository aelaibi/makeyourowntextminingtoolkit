   Subject;-           Hillsborough Disaster.
                       Sheffield 15th April 19-89*


                        Constable



                   With reference to the above Officer, I report
       that he was in the ground during the disaster. He suffered
       crushing both inside and outside the ground and was trapped
       with persons dying around him. He was finally saved by
       being dragged up and over a fence by other supporters.

                   He reported for duty on Tuesday the 18th of
       April 1989 but during the course of that tour of duty it
       became evident." that he needed to recoup longer and asked
       for time off, he now has the rest of the week off and I
       would suggest that any interview be delayed at least to
       next week if at all possible.

                   1 therefore submit .this report for the information
       of the Post incident operations centre, at Police Headquarters 1
       Canning Place,                                               **;

PRIME MINISTER

HILLSBOROUGH - POLICE REACTIONS

The Home Secretary's office have rung to report on the position
on the police, as the Home Secretary promised last night.


The Chief Constable,            Peter Wright,           has now read the report and
has    decided     - subject      to    talking      it through         tonight      with   his
family       -   that    he    will     accept      the       findings     of the     report
.unreservedly; accept responsibility for the actions of his police
force;    and offer his resignation
                           .
                                    to the Chairman of the Police
                                       — •?


Authority.          If   Chief    Constable Wright            decides      to   do   so,    the
matter rests with the Chairman but the Home Secretary's view is
that     the     Chief   Constable       would not       be    dissuaded        even if     the
Chairman were to seek to make him change his mind.


The    Home       Secretary's     response         is     one    of     sadness      that     an
outstanding officer should end his career in this way.
But    he feels      that     the decision is very much in character;                       and
also that it is not something in which he should intervene in any
way.       He     also   feels    that        if   Peter      Wright     does   not    resign
immediately,        he would probably be hounded by the tabloid press
and forced to do so in undignified circumstances.
                                                                                            (• v7°
The Chief Constable is likely to announce his resignation at
tomorrow if he decides to go ahead.

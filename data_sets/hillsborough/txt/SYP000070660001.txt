            At 8.30am Saturday 15 April       1989 I commenced duty at Hackenthorpe

            Police Station in order to attend at the Hillsborough Football G r o u n d

            for the Football Association Semi-final               fo ot ba l1 match between

            Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

            At    10.00am that day I was assigned at the briefing as a member of

            serial 4 under the direct supervision of Sergeant 266 JACQUES.   1/ was
                                                     *
            deputed by Sergeant JACQUES to /work in company with PC 2679 AST/N on

            the main gates on Penistone Rdr leading to the car parK at the                        rear of

            the South S t a n d .   I remained/ on that duty from 11. 1i>am to the start of

            the match at 3.00pm (13 00 )J and because of a continued build up of

            fans outside the ground,       was instructed by Sergeant JACQUES to remain

            on that d u t y .   Shortly a f t e r , I was made aware of fans leaving the

            ground of a major       incident on the Leppings Ln side of the ground.                       I
                                                                            PAGE    2.

      ’ remained at the Penistone Rd gates and assisted with traffic flow and

        the entrance and exit of ambulances and emergency medical      services.

        I played no direct      part in the events within the ground and remained

        on Penistone Rd until      instructed to attend at the North Stand for

        dispersal   purposes.

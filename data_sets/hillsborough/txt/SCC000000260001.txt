               SAFETY OF SPORTS GROONDS ACT 1975 AS AMENDED

                          SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL

   SHEFFIELD UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB PLC. BRAMALL LANE. SHEFFIELD S2 4FU -
                        GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATE

Notice of consent under General Safety Certificate Condition 6 of the
General Safety Certificate issued to Sheffield United Football Club pic.

The Sheffield City Council hereby gives its consent to the removal of
three radial fences at the Bramall Lane Sports Ground. The radial fences
'in questionare shown on the plans attached to this notice.

This consent is issued subject to the conditions set out below:-

The works hereby approved must be completed by Saturday 9th September,
1989.

The radial fence on the Kop   (Plan A)

An additional support must be provided for the rail of barrier 42 at the
point where the radial fence is removed.

Part of the post at the top of the radial fence is to be left in (or
replaced by new posts) in order to maintain the stability of the
balustrading to the top gangway.

A return barrier is to be provided to the end of barrier 31, returning up
the radial gangway a similar distance to that on the return of barrier 32.

The lengths of barrier which have either been consequently altered or were
unable to be previously tested due to the proximity of the radial fence
must be tested on completion of the works and reports submitted to the
Council.

The two short radial fences on the Bramall Lane Terrace   (Plan B)

Condition 5 also applies to the removal of these two fences.

NOTE The replacement of the radial fences with suitably positioned radial
barriers should be considered by the Club and will be considered by
Council Officers in the fairly near future. It is also recommended that
consideration be given to the installation of two radial barriers on the
Bramall Lane Terrace set equi-distant from the centre of the goalmouth on
the Terrace.

Dear Mr Bownes,

                                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

                                               North Stand - Hospitality Suites

               Please find enclosed six prints of our drawing 11570/1
showing proposals for the refurbishment of three of the existing
refreshment bars into hospitality suites, at ground floor level,
in the North stand.                                  The intention of the Club is that they
provide light refreshments (no alcohol will be available) for
certain season-ticket holders before, during and after a game
with television and video facilities, in comfortable surroundings.
               The comments of the Officer Working Party would be welcomed,
especially those of the South Yorkshire Fire Service.                                                                                 The work
does not contain any structural work and as such we believe that
approval under section A of the Building Regulations 1985 is not
required.                 However, we will nevertheless make a submission under
section B, relating to fire, shortly.


                                                                Yours sincerely,

               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

       1.0     North Stand - Hospitality Suites

       1.0      The assurance of Eastwood & Partners that no alcohol will be available is
               noted.

       1.2     The layout and facilities in the kitchen areas is not shown on the plan 11570/1.
               A site inspection however has shown that existing gas services and gas
               appliances exist in these areas. I would prefer to see the removal of the gas
               service and the appliances before their use as hospitality suites.

       1.3     A Building Regulation application 89/1660B was deposited with my division on
               the 8th June 1989 and was subsequently withdrawn since it did not involve works
               to which the Building Regulations appliedj

       1.4     The headroom (under the inclined beams) for persons passing from one part of the
               lounge to another is shown to be 1.55 metres rising to 2 metres. A minimum of
               1.9 metres is considered to be necessary in this situation. A revision to the
               floor layout is therefore necessary.

       1.5     I trust the Fire Authority have considered the inclusion of automatic fire and
               smoke detection systems for these suites.

       2.0     Young Owls Club - Office Accommodation

       2.1     Drawing 11557/1was submitted through your office.

      '2.2     Drawings 11557/1A and 11557/2 were submitted for Building Regulationconsideration
               on the 5th July 1989 and have been subsequently vetted, but not yet formally
               determined.

       2.3     The site of the proposal at present consists of a partial walled and timber fenced
               enclosure where refuse bins are stored. Also within the enclosed area is a brick
               built gas meter house and a timber stairway which appears to be part of the means
               of escape from the first floor accommodation of both the flat and the public
               house (both presently vacant). The continuity and extent of the available roof
               area for persons to use,on the means of escape from the flat,needs to be
               clarified. The barbed security fencing would not be satisfactory. If the public
               house was re-used, signing of the escape route to the metal stairway to ground
               level would be necessary.                                      ''

       2.4     I understand that the base of the metal fire escape stairway (at ground level)
               is stewarded. Since this'area is available to the public on match days, it is
               necessary for the whole of the means of escape to be clearly defined, balustraded
               and maintained in a safe condition, even though the accommodation which it serves
               may be vacant.


                                                                                      Continued

2.5   A mechanical vent outlet from the present offices exists into the existing yard
      area. It appears that this will have to be trunked through the new construction,
      to reach external air.

3.0   General                                                                          f
      It may be advisable for the advisory group to.meet to discuss the above two      i
      proposals.

      It is also understood that Sheffield Wednesday wish to meet the advisory group
      as soon as possible to discuss the use of the Leppings Lane end, affecting the
      West Stand, West Terrace'and part of the North Stand.

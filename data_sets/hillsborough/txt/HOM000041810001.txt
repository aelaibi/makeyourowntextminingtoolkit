HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY

Issue

We have received the attached letters from relatives of the Hillsborough victims and
Dr Ed Walker, who treated the victims of the disaster, calling for you to appoint a new
person to head the Hillsborough Scrutiny in place of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. This
follows the publicity surrounding the Judge’s off-the-cuff comments at his meeting
with the families. Although the correspondence is marked for reply by officials, it
would seem more appropriate for a reply to be sent from your office. Hillsborough
disaster relatives have in the past received S of S replies.

Timing

2.      Routine.

Recommendation

3.     Draft letters, expressing confidence in the integrity of Lord Justice Stuart
Smith’s scrutiny, are attached for your signature [or for Private Secretary signature as
appropriate].

Consideration

4.      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s flippant remark to Mr Phil Hammond, a member
of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, about late arriving Liverpool fans received
widespread publicity. The incident occurred as he welcomed relatives of the victims
of the Hillsborough disaster to a specially organised event in Liverpool at which he
was to meet the relatives and listen to their representations.

5.     The Judge issued an immediate apology for his comments and the offence
caused and the meetings went ahead as planned. Inevitably, some of the relatives
consider that the Judge has compromised his position and would like a new person
appointed to head the scrutiny.

6.      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was appointed at the end of June this year to
conduct the Hillsborough Scrutiny. As well the event in Liverpool, he has received
written and oral submissions from the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG)
and other interested parties. He has also visited Hillsborough to see the site of the

disaster. Despite his unfortunate, off-the-cuff comments to Mr Hammond, the Judge
is very committed to the scrutiny and the draft replies to these letters express our
satisfaction with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s ability to conduct a thorough scrutiny.

Presentation/handling

7.     There are no additional handling considerations at this time.




                                             Peter Edmundson

Hillsborough Survivors Group




Thank you for your letter of 9 October about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s reported
comment during his recent visit to Liverpool.


I am sorry that you were upset by the Judge’s comment to Mr Phil Hammond. The
Judge has said on the record that he deeply regrets this remark, which he made off-
the-cuff and without any intention to offend or for it to be taken seriously. He has
made it clear that he entirely accepts Lord Justice Taylor’s conclusion that the
principal cause of the disaster was the failure of the police operation and not the
behaviour of the fans.


The Judge spent three days in Liverpool meeting the families of those who died and
listening to their concerns. He has said that he found these meetings fruitful and
constructive, and that they will help him to write his report.


I am satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will produce a thorough report in which
the families and the public can have confidence.

The terms of reference which I have given Lord Justice Stuart-Smith for the Scrutiny
will allow him to establish conclusively whether any material evidence was
overlooked in the consideration of the causes of the disaster or the consideration of
criminal or other proceedings. The Judge will also be able to recommend any other
action which should be taken in the public interest. I am confident that the terms of
reference will allow him to carry out a full scrutiny of the evidence which has been
submitted by the families and others.

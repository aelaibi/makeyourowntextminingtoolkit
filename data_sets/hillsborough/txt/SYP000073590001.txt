               On Saturday 13 April              1989 (150489)        I travelled to Sheffield leaving

               Liverpool at 12.00 M.D (1200)                I travelled in friends private car his

               name     is         and I knew he has already been seen.                  We travelled to

               Sheffield via the snake pass not stopped on route.                           I infact purchased

                Sheffield at 2.30pm (1430)     parking   in car off Middlewood Road.        We had       ,

                about a 10 or 15 minutes walk to the ground making us arrive at the

                entrance at about 2,

                On route to the ground I did not see anyone drinking alcohol             I myself

                had only one can in the car,      I was also was not directed to the ground

                by any police or escorted and I only saw two police whilst walking.

                Also whilst walking to the ground I did not see any drunkeness or

                disorder   in the cro wds.

                Upon my arrival at the grund whi ch was f rom the South into Leppi ngs

-5o £           Lane I immediately saw my entrance without any difficulty however,
 L L .          there was no orderly queues just a mass of peopLe waiting to get i n .

                At the time I arrived the outer gates w/a're closed and sgg,nrt?cl to be
PcT L \ G £ -
                controlled bygone     police horseman and I th^rrk by two o              who were—

                letting ayfple filter ii^fhrough the g a ^ s .      After a short while      it
L.c-
                was getting near kick off and people were getting agitated by not

                being allowed in.     A large number of other supporters arrived which

                caused a surge towards the outer gates which were then opened to allow

                the ground in towards the turnstiles.

                I then went through these gates and found myself to the right of the

                turnstiles.    I XJrfstn saw that the l^f^e exit gate on t h ^ s i d e   of the

                turnstiles v-asf open I walked t h o u g h this gate taking my ticket out of

G£.CWh          my pocket expecting someone to have it off me but they didn't.              When I

                wa l k e d through t he gate I would say^yfat there was only a               of

                hundred\wi/Ch m e .

                On going through the gate the only entrance to the ground that I could

                see was the turmel.      I thought that was the only way in I and the

                other fans went down it because we could see the pitch on the other
                         o r r
                side.  I went down the 1    side of the tunnel.  It seemed that there

                was a lot of people in there with me and upon reaching the end it

                seemed that the terraces were packed without us going down there.
                                                                            PAGE     3
                                                                            S17SS

Upon reaching the end of the tunnel     I was pushed by the crowd

following onto the terraces    int               The push was not

                                           d.




sideway as well as down the terraces,      I now knew that something

serious was happening and I was becoming frightened and wanted to get

out.   I kept looking round for a way out but I couldn't move and my

arm were trapped by my side.                                ^

Eventually,    I was pushed down the terraces to the^Sfentral       barrier

which came across ajfr hips and stomach.        The pressure of people behind

me and me being pushed against the barrier was taking away my breath.

I knew I would be seriously injured if I stayed there.           I started to

shout for help to the people in front to get me off the b a r .         Some of

the people then pushed me back from the bar so that I could drag

myself along    it towards the end of it to my left which was about 3 or

4 feet.   I eventually re-ached the end however,       1 found tjj& Z my right

leg was trapped in          ' support to the barrier c^^^tng it to be

twisted and pressures being placed across the top of it.

After a few seconds but it seemed a long time I got it free.            The

pressure of the crowd which didn't seem like a surge kept on coming

and I found myself being pushed towards the front.          I remember seeing

the gate to the pitch and     trying to make for it.     At this point       I'm

sure I felt someone um^r^     me but I never saw wjrfo it was.      I and    other

people were screaming for     help and to be goMT out.    At one point

I managed to get my arms out from my sides to shoulder height.

At this point I had a walkman radio with me.          I thought that if I

threw it onto the pitch I would have to go and get it so I threw it

over the front fence.     Somehow I was j^dw almost below thg,.

overhanging to^fhe front fence I decided to try and jjfixmp up to it
                                                                                                 PAGE    4

C i\T         which I did.     I was helped by tHe rest of the c r o w r t o       reach it and

JP-j£ ij/*^
        ^—    At this point I was dazed and not really aware of what was happening.

              I remember walking over to the side stand and sitting for a while.

              After about     10 or 15 minutes I was recovered enough to remember my

              friends so I went back out onto the pitch to find them but I couldn't

              find them at this time.            I told a policeman I wanted to get out but

              he told me that I would have to stay because someone would have to

              take some picutres.        I remained in the ground to about 4.00pm (1600)

              when I left.

              I eventually found my friends outside. Whilst            in    the   Pen I cannot

              remember much what was going on around             me.    Idid not   see anyone

              fall unconscious and I do not know what the person was like that was

              under me at one point.        I also did not       assist any of the injured.

              All   I can really remember is one policeman on            the top   of the fence

              saying push back and another by the gate to the front with it open.

              When I went into ground,       I did not see any police or stewards at the

              entrance gate or at the entrance or exit to the tunnel.                    I did see a

              few people climb over but not many also when I went in people were

              still   coming in through the turnstiles.

              At no time did I see any fighting or disturbance inside the ground and                         j

              I did not see anyone drinking inside the ground nor did I see anyone                           ,

              commit a criminal offence.

                                    from the outset that the whole incident was

                                                                             ganisation

         outside the ground before the match which you do not experience when

         visiting Anfield.          I believe that there was enough police outside the

         ground before the match but they were not doing anything just letting

         the crowd go i t ’s own way.          I also think that the Police forming a

         line across the pitch was unecessary and they should have been helping

         in this disaster and not leaving just the fans that were ok to help.

         I also want to say that the only announcement that I heard was Kenny

         Dalglish and nothing         informing anyone of what to do or what was

         happeni n g .

         I think there should be more emergency service to hand.            I myself was

         not seen but there were people who were worse off than me.

    and a mbulance who a pp ea r ed            to be going to the same                place.         I arri ve d

    at    the ground at around              1330.        I was    trying    to get    to the gym

    entrance      off Periistone Rd as              I knew that         this was     the    pre — desig na te d

    casualty treatment           and    clearing area for H i ll s b o r o u g h under                our

    Hillsborough       plan.       That     section of the ground was                 blocked by police

    vehicles,       fans and traffic.               I got    nowhere       near the entrance           to the

    gym so    I turned down the             road to the executive                 suites    leading to the

    back    of the stands.There was                 very    little       crowd down there a l t h ou g h a

    a lot    of   police officers and. vehicles and some ambulances                              were       corning

    from    the end to the exit             from the ground.               They    presumably        came    from

    the Leppings Ln and.               I saw about          two a m bu la nc es     coming    out and        one

    fire    tender.      I. went    down beyond the south stand and                        parked behind the

    police    control     box.      1 could see down trie d r i veway to Leppings Ln but

    not    behind the west         stand.       I saw two a mb ul an ce s           on the dr iveway which

    were    both stationary.            .1 walked up to them and saw that                     they were

    fully    loaded with       casualties.               By now it was about          1600.      I

    i nstructed both crews             to   leave and go straight                 to the hospital.            !hey

    were    still    in the    process        of assessing             casualties and       1 knew that        triey

    were    not the first amb ul an ce              there.        The    s it uation was mayhem.

    E v e r y b o d y wan te d an amb ul an ce and so delays                were    being    caused by the

    fans.     The    police were        on the a mbulances               restricting       casualties.         The

    two ambul a n ce s    lef t and         I went down the dr i veway to the L ep pings Ln

    end.     I was    being    jostled        by people          but    it was    not so crowded that              i

    was    unable    to make     progress,            I saw a group of about S bodies                   lying on

      onto Leppings Ln as             i could see about             five a mb ul an ce s     on L ep pi ng s Ln

      together with two more                fire    tenders.        The area around the Leppi ng s Ln

      entrance        to the ground was            heavily       congested.        It was very noisy with

      screaming and shouting,                   I went     on and    checked to make           sure that

      there were         no casualties          in that area.            I had seen the two ambul an ce s

      and eve ry bo dy else aro un d me did not seem to be                           injured,     I did not

      speak    to anyone         in any detail.            I was    looking    for a senior           police

      officer      so that       I could e st ablish what            the s it uation was         in the area.

      While .1 was at the Leppin gs Ln end                       I realised that. I really needed to

      remember who         1 spoke        to.     I was    operating       on channel        1 ERG,    the

      acknow le dg em en t.         The    point    of my message was to try to get everybody

      to qo    to the      gym from now on.               I then w al k ed back towards           the entrance

      to the stadium.             There were a gre^t              number    of fans     in this area and               1

The area        outside which             is under the north stand                contained a number                   of

casualties          being     treated on the floor             by a mb ulance men,               police,

doctors and St.              J o h n ’s am b ul an ce men.         This was       the first          I had seen

of the St. J o h n ’s a mb ulance                 men.     I sent the        doctor          into the gym while

I stayed outside.                  1 believe       I then saw Hr MO RL EY and                  I a sk ed him

where Alan HOPK I NS was                  located.        I knew that HOPK IN S was the most

w a n te d to see what             role he wan te d me        to take.          Mr MORLEY said that

H O PK I NS was      in the gym and so 1 went                 in there.           I noticed a lot of

dead     bodies          lying on the floor,             1 would estimate at                 least 50.          To my

left  I saw live casualties being treated by a mixture of personnel.      1
   N a n S 3
saw H oP KI NS and 1 asked him what he wa nt ed me to do and he said that

I should        go out and get             things    organised.          I presume           that he meant

organ is e      vehicles,          man    power and the e va cu at io n of              casualties.                 I went

out    to the yard.            There were          four ambul an ce s        outside.          The

a mb ul an ce s were still               having    problems with access and egress                         but       not            j

su ff iciently bad that                  they could not a j ^ u a 11y make              progress.           I then                  ^

saw that        itXwas       totally blocked with             police and ambulances                   trying          to

get    to the gw:.            As    I w e j/l   outside     I saw a police            inspector standing

in the       road neW' the Jirtt r a n e e .             I told him that          I wanted to section

off    the    road except           for ambul an ce s      to a ll ow them access and egress.

I said that              1 also wa nt ed the        central    reserv at io n         clearing        of    police

vans and transit              vans as       I wanted ambul an ce s           to mount          the   central

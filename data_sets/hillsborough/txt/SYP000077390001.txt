The    foilowing             morning           the    seven        of       us       left       my    home     and      walked          to    the

t4 e h a d a         couple       of    drinks        in t h e r e          and       waited          for     a taxi         which       we       had
                                                                       /"

Whilst          we    were     inside          the    pub       1/ s a w     there             other       Liverpool          supporters

in the          bar,       I saw       them       have     ahfout the                same       quantity          of    b eer      as    we       did,

perhaps          a    couple       of     pints,         thfy were               v er y well              behaved       and     caused            no

trouble          whatsoever.

Our    taxi          arrived       at    2pm        (1400)       and        we t h e n          travelled           together            to

Hillsborough                arriving           at    the    junction                 of    liiddlewood Rd a n d L e p p i n g s

Ln,        We    had       intended          to     travel       by     taxi          direct          to    the     turnstiles               tiut

would       have       found       it    quite        difficult              to       have       driven        through          them.

We    left       the       taxi    and       joined        the     crowds             moving          along       Leppings          Ln.           I

was    amazed          at    the       v ast      numbers        of     people             arriving.              i h ave       been         to

other       matches          there       and        I had       nev e r      seen          so    many       converging             on    the

ground          at   any     one       time.         The    crowds           were          quite          dense     although            my

passage          along       the       r o a d was       unrestricted.

As    we    neared          the    turnstiles              in L e p p i n g s             Ln    I saw       large       numbers          of

people          massed       together             oiAside        the        turnstile                blocks,        this      c r o w d was

particularly                dense       and       e/;tended w e l l              into          Leppings        Ln      i t self.         Just          as

I reached            the     junction             \f:i.th the      road          giving          access        to      the    turnstiles,

        ■t I w a s      approached            by a y o u t h     of a b o u t         16 or        17 y e a r s         of age,            he         asked

           me     if    I had a s p a r e          ticket       to    sell.           1 had        to     tell       him      that          I h a d n ’t.

           The     youth       was     a Liverpool             supporter             and     spoke        with a         's c a u s e ’ a c c e n t .

           I also           noticed        that    at    the    s ame      t i me     there        were       other          youths            about                  us

           also        ’t o u t i n g ’ for       tickets.           I d i d n ’t r e a l l y           find       this       unusual                 as          it

           seerris to         be a      regular         occurrence             at    good     c l ass      fixtures             which              ar e

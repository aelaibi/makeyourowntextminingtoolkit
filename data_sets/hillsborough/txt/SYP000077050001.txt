            I live at the above address with my parents as I attend^



            On Saturday             15th April   1989,    I trave 11 ed wi th jTiyytfiother , in a coach
                                                       ovr
            organised by the Harrogate and District Liverpool Supporter Club,                              to

            the F.A. Cup Semi Final between L\yerpool and Nottingham Forest, at

            Hillsborough in Sheffield.                   I have been a supporter oj£/T_iverpool for

            4/3 years,          and am a season ticket holder.                I got    ticket for the

            semi     final with the use of the voucher from my season ticket.                           It was

            a six pound ticket for the Leppings Lane Standing area.

            The bus I travelled in arrived at the main Liverpool                           supporters    car

            park near the ground at about                  12 Noon.        The journey had been delay

            free.      When we left the coach we were given general directions by
                                                                                       PAGE    2
                                                                                       S2131

          Police arid Stewards how to get to the ground.

          I walked directly to the ground and for sometime stood outside with my

          mother and other members of^Cne supporter       club.    My mother had a

          ticket for a seated a r a ^   and was guaranteed a place,         so I left her at

3 o £ ,   about   -1.15pm to go>fnto the standing area.      I had no difficulty in

          finding where £/riad to enter the ground,           no real difficulty in

          getting   in.y^I went through a tyrnstj/F’e, handed in my ticket,           which

          was takeW'and the stubs    ripped o>
                                                      ^AT      D | £ £ C D O N i D\<2f b J S
          Between the turnstiles and the standing areas, I saw no signs

          directing fans which way to go.  The only thing you see as you come

          in is the tunnel directly in front of you.        There were a number of

          Police on t h e y ^ o u n d side of the turnstiles and infact as I entered I
           6 0 D V C3                  £>*■/ ^CnuiCtS:
          was sea^cl-yra.    I was not given any instruction as to where I should go.

          Infact ^ went directly down Jme tunnel as I wanted to be able to

          stand behind the goal.     IT would be very shortly a f t e r ^ K l S p m when I

S o •£    took up a position in what     I now beleive was pen         3,    right next to

          the fence that dev ides   it from No 4, and quiie close to the
    3     rear of the ter races. Even at that time i l r was quite obvious that the

          pen I was in was quite full aijd between then and 2.30pm people
          '                      ”       I         /
          continued to come into the q r m ir y jr filling it up mor e . I was able to

          maintain my position as    I had the fence on my left and was able to

          hold on to it. Between 2.30pm and 3.00pm it j u s ^ ^ o t worse arid worse,

          even with me being able to hold onto the f^mce.          I was still being

          pushed forward for a few yards and haV'fng to fight my way back

          towards the rear of the terrace.

          I was never aware of a particular      crush or surge but on a number of

          occasions   I saw people who were pushed forward by the weight of the

          crowd fall over, and I don't know if they were able to get up again.

          The match kicked off, and although I was not aware of any particular-

          incident of death or injury I knew that the pert was to full.               I made
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    S2131
 Ca   t     my way back up t o w a r d / 1'the tunnel keeping   close to the fence then I
"TLW/s/^U
            got out along they^unnel.       I kept to the^right hand side and although

 o p w d    there were still a large number of atfople coming in through the tunnel

            I eventually was able to get o u t /      The tunnel was dark so I was not

            able to see if anyone was on t/n e       floor of the tunnel.

            I then made my way round to X h e     left hand side of the stand and got

            into what    I now know as p e p No       when I found there was pienty/of

            room.    I watched the match from this oersition unti 1 it was stepped, all

            I was    really aware of was that a^ople in the front of p e /fs 3 and 4
                        f v W O
            were    climbing over the f ro y ^ T fence onto the pitch.

            I stayed where I was l m       about 3.30pm and I m u s U ^ a y that I did not

            feel    that the emergency services      realised what had occured soon enough,

            and the organisation of the help to the injured was slow and again not

            organised.

            At about 3.30pm,    I left the ground and returned to the coach park,           I

            waited for a short time and eventually I met up with my mother.            It

            would be about 5.45pm before everyone         returned to the coach and we

            left for home.

                                                                                    SIGNED

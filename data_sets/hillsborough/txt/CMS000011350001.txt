STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS: FOOTBALL


Thank you for your note of 11 June attaching the draft amended
designation orders.


2.    We are content with the alterations and for the print
and laying of the designation orders to go ahead as suggested.


3.    You mentioned that we might also seize the opportunity
to assimilate some of the varying definitions in the orders.
I agree that this would normally be the sensible way forward
but our overriding need is to ensure that the orders are in
force at least by the dates which you have suggested.


4.    You will be aware of the difficulties we have had in
reaching agreement with G2 on definitions in Part I of the
Football Spectators Act 1989 (SI 731/1990) and I am concerned
that the further amendments you suggest might delay the laying
of these orders.


5.    In the circumstances therefore, it may be better that we
proceed with the amendment orders as drafted.



                           KEiii KO.K.'ir,';




                          KEIR HOPLEY

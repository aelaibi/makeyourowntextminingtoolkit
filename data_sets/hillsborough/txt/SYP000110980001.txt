                Commenced duty at 8.15am from home station to parade for duty 8.45am

                at Doncaster for transportation to Sheffield.             Travelled to Sheffield

                in double decked S.Y.P.T.E.        bus on hire.



                Arrived at Hillsborough for briefing          in North Stand attached to

                Following the briefing engaged on d u t i ^ ^ a J ^ E ^ d ^ ^ ^ R o ^ i and,

                Shenstone Road off Leppings Lane,         preventing unauthorised parking

                with barriers arriving ap pr o k imately 11.05am.         At that time J ^ v s m j s o o I

                fans arriving, many with packs of beer - la ge r.            Remained in that

                area mostly in company with PS Reynolds on foot patrol along Leppings

                Lane between the two roads above.          As time went by the volume of

                spectators arriving grew, many as ki ng for di rections to Public Houses

                and it was apparent to me that a large number of them d^d^jno_t have
        Ao
                tickets for the match.        I must have been asked at least 50 - 60 times
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            RH4

if I had any spare tickets.



There were groups of fans walking up and down Leppings Lane asking

others for tickets,     this went on from the time of my arrival at the

point until just before kick-off.        I saw several   instances of

spectators purchasing tickets I think £25 was the i                     ?



The mood of the fans arriving was generally happy/boisterous/singing,

obviously looking forward to the match.        I did not see any bad

behaviour as such but as time got nearer kick-off there were still

many asking for tickets



Front about         was with PS 1561 Reynolds standing      in front of a

private garage area almost opposite Eskdale Road just after I think

Bickerton Road.     This was a result of a complaint from an elderly

couple who were washing their car in the garage area regarding fans

using the garages as a toilet.



From that point we     could   see down Leppings Lane to the bottom         at the

roundabout at Penistone Road,      during that time there was a j^cmt^ijnuous

stream of fans arriving,       causing problems for traffic, on the road,

one fan was spoken to by       PS Reynolds for deliberately walking on the

road in front of a bus.        The mood was generally good natured and

enthusiastic.     There seemed to be no let up of numbers arriving and

about 2.50pm I made the point to PS Reynolds that there was no way

could they qet into the qround for kick-off, and for them to do so

the kick-off would have to be delayed.        About 3pm I heard on PS

Reynold's     radio that there was a large crowd at the turnstiles and
                                                                          PAGE
                                                                          R24

 As a result together with PS Reynolds,        PC Bradley and PC Severn we

 went directly to         the turnstile         large numbers of persons

Nthere,    I saw some   climbing up over the w a l 1 into the ground and many

 of them running up and climbing o v e r the turnstiles themselves.         The

^tifme then would be about 3.05pm just after the main bulk of them had

 bpen let in through the gate which had been opened.         Not knowing at

/that time that the gate had been opened I prevented several youths

 from climbing over the turnstiles and moved others to the other side

 of the gates in front of the turnstiles.         Remained there and sevj^al^

 'fans'    leaving the ground then informed m e that there were serious

 pro^b^ms^jjnsj.de, one described it it as being worse than the Heysel

 disaster.



 Many people leaving the ground now and the general attitude now was

 of anger and sheer hatred towards the Police, many threatening

 officers and calling us murderers,        the main were very hostile towards

 us, so much so that I was afraid for my own and other officers

 safety.     Many of them were in tears.



About 3.20pm I was in desperate need of the toilet,         so I went into

 the ground and walked down the side of the North Stand to the toilet,

 there were large numbers      leaving the stand by them, while   in the

 toilet    (alone)   I was subjected to a barrage of threats and abuse from

about 30 men, 3 or 4 told them to leave me alone as it was not my

fault,     if they had not done this I feel sure that I would have been

assaulted.      On leaving the toilet     I walked around the back of the

West Stand trying to find a way on to the playing area,         but not

knowing the ground could not get on.         Unable to get on to the   pitch I

then had to return outside the ground and join other officers there.*

Ambulances and fire tenders were arriving now and a steady continuous
                                                                                 PAGE       4
                                                                                 R24

         stream of people leaving the ground and the abuse and threats

         continued.     Some   coming up and asking me where the nearest pub was.

         I remained there until we were stood down and asked to regroup in the

         North Stand.     From there I walked with my serial to Claywheels for

         food and subsequent transport back to Doncaster.



         I feel that I should have been informed in,-the event of an emergency
       f<>
 f r J T ^ where to go in the ground - should I be needed.         It w^j^jm-M^ipned

         j^D^iil^ccK^es jjT^emerqencies, but,f did not know how to get on to the

         pitch and this is the main c r iti ci s m , not knowing the layout of the
                                     y'
         ground,  Also not havij^ a radio causing lack of communication - many
                                                        ■
         officers were ujnawg/e of the situation and did not know really what

         to do for the b^st.



         While standing outside the ground and being subjected to the threats

         and abuse,   I am sure that had it not been for the extreme        restraint

         exercised by all officers I think that further serial trouble would

         have occurred and I still        cannot understand how,   to my knowledge,    no

         one was seriously assaulted.

                    INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL     GROUND
                       SHEFFIELD ON SATURDAY 16 APRIL     1989

On behalf of the Chief Constable, Mr. Wright, I am gathering information to
enable the Force to present evidence to the forthcoming Committees of Inquiry.
This exercise has no connection with the investigation into the policing of
the F.A. cup semi-final which is being conducted by a team headed by Mr. Dear,
Chief Constable of West Midlands.

What I require from you is a self-written account of your actions on the 15th
April 1989.  Please note that this is not a CJA statement and it should be
written on plain paper.  It would be helpful if your account could include the
following information.

1.      What time did you come on duty?

2.      To whom were you responsible?

3.      Where were you deployed, and did you get deviated to any other
         location?

4.      What did you see   that is in   any way relevant to the incident?

5.      What did you do?

Please begin the account with your full name in block letters, your rank and
number and your sub-division/department.  Please conclude the account with
your signature.

The officer handing you thisdocument will   inform you how and when toreturn
it.   Please return it promptly and provide as accurate an account as you  are
able.

Please contact any of my staff if you have any queries or concerns in
completing the account.  Force Headquarters telephonists will connect you with
someone who can help.

Thank you for your' assistance.

                       into      the disaster at the H i l l s bo ro ug h football                     stadium.on Saturday

                       information           in regards          to my experi e n c e s at Hi 1 lsborough.



                       As      previously stated               in my Suppo r t e r s Questionnaire?           1 a r r i v e d outside

                       the Leppings Lane               entrance       to the H i l l s b o r o u g h stadium at about 2.50pm

                       <1450),        together with my travelling                        companions,

                                                                                                  fci363B

               ms    gale    i now know to be 6 a



Once     inside      the stadium,       I lo$rt sight       of my travelling           companions

except



M y s e 1f and                            r erna i rte d t o g e t her and e n t e r e d          nn e j

w hich    runs      u n d e r n e a t h the West S t a n d seating area.         We w e n y into    the

tunnel        because we       couldn* t see any signs          to direct       us a n y where    else,

We    followed the          large   crowd of supporters          who had also          entered    the

t u rtn el.



We got about          half-way along        the    length of the tunnel            without any

particular          difficulty,       then s u d denly our      pragress       through the       tunnel

was    slowed as we          became    packed     in wit h tXe       crowd    inside       the tunnel.

F rom this       point about        half-way along         Jme tunnel        I had no control       over

the d i rection         I was moving.        I was     being    carried along w i t h the          crowd.



I was     carried along         the    remaining     length of the W f m e l           and out onto

the    back of the          terraces at the        r i ght-hand/ s i*fe of^the         tunnel    exit
                                                              La .
point     into what         I now know to be pen numb'wr'r,hreel



As soon as I emer g e d from the tunnel ^snto the back of pen number three
                                        /
I got a good look at the pitch and I' saw the game kick off.     Having

seen the game           kick   off at the time         I emerged from the            tunnel,     I never

saw anyth i n g       else happen       on the     pitch    in regards       to the game.         1 have

no knowledge          of a n y thing    happening      on the    pitch       in regards       to the game

from anything           that   I can remember about            the    reaction of the supporters



H aving       seen the kick-off,         I was     then gra d u a l l y   carried forwards         down
                                                                                                    P A(ic.


the     terracing       towards    the    perimeter       fence and the        pitch.     At first            I

just went        forwards with the movement                of the     crowd.     A l t h o u g h the

terracing was           very    packed with        people at first,         1 w a s n ’t having any

d i f f i c ul t y a l t h ou gh the    crushing ar o u n d me was u n c o m f o r t a b l e .



I could still           see my friend                                  He was just         in front         of

me and. s l i ghtly over to my                right-hand side.                   was also        being

carried forwards           down the       terracing       towards    the pitch.



At a time which           1 can only estimate             to be about       three minu t e s after                I

had seen the game kick                 off,    I was about     half way down the          terracing,

still     being m ov e d gr a d u a l l y forwards,         w t o r i s w     some supporters who

were     positioned       to my    left-hand s i j ^ Z       These    supporters were          trying             to

pull     a girl       up out of the       cro^rn.      I could see      that the girl         had

fainted.         My    left arm w a s / p i n n e d down against my side.               1 m a n a g e d to

force my       right arm up/out           of the      crowd and      I twisted to my         left and

took     hold of this /girl with my right                  hand and tried to          pull    her
                    /
upwards     out of /Che crowd.                We m a n a g e d to puli, the    girl's'Upper         dody

clear     of the heads of the             people a r o u n d her,     but then her         body became

stuck and we were unable                 to    lift her    up any further.



As    far as     I can remember          this girl a p p e a r e d   to have only fainted.                  Her

colour was        normal.        I did not think          that she had been         injured.           As

best as     I can remember             she was a young white           girl,   about     eighteen

y ears    old.        She was as best as           I . can recall    of average       build.        She     had

dark     brown hair which was straight and                    long    reaching    just     past her

shoulders.            I think    she was wearing a brown jacket which                    I was

holding.         I think       it may have been a corduroy material.



W ith    the other       supporters        I just kept      the girl     held up in this

position about          half way out          of the crowd.         Although        I never    heard any

sound from the girl,             I am sure        she was     breathing at that            time.



I was    holding       onto    this girl      for a time       I can only estimate            to have

been about       one or two minutes,              I still      had not seen a n y t h i n g        of the

game.     It was at this          time    that    I caught      sight       of some    people about

three    or four feet          in front       ofrne who were       screaming        out    in pain.

Although       I couldn't       see one       I knew that these         people were         trapped up

a gai n s t a crush barrier,             At this time         I was    positioned about

twenty feet back          from    the front       perimeter       fence and       I could see            the

gate    in the    perimeter       fence was       p o sitioned to my          r i ght-hand side at

an angle of about             forty-five      degrees,



1 was moving       g ra du a l l y forwards       towards      these    people       who    I knew

were    trapped up against              a barrier.        It was then that            I let go of

the    girl    I was    helping    hold up and bent down towards                    the ground           in

a hope    that    I w ould be pushed under               the barrier,          I was      in fact

pushed under       the    barrier       because    I caught       sight      of one of the upright

stantions as       I went       u nderneath      it.     As    soon as       I knew that      I had got

under    the barrier          I forced my way          back upwards         to a g a i n stand upright

w ith my head out         of the    crowd.



As soon as       I got myself           upright     once a gain I looked behind me                 to my

left to see       if the girl            I had been helping was             still     okay? but      I

couldn't      see her,         I have    no   idea what       h a p pened    to the girl.



When    I first    got myself       onto my feet on the               other    side of the         crush

barrier       I was about       eight    or ten feet away from the front                    perimeter

fence and the gate             in the front       perimeter       fence w a s ( still       over     to my

right-hand side at about a forty-five                       degree angle.

W hen    I got    into   this    position w hich           1 have marked using a figure one

on the     separate      grid    plan?     I looked at the            pitch for     the first time

since     I had seen the kick-off and                  I saw that the game was                still       in

p lay.



 In position number            one   I had     lost sight of my friend

I had     last seen him just            before    I had ducked down             into    the    crowd to

get     under    the   crush barrier.



At    position one       the    crush around me was very severe a l t h o u g h                  I was           not

having any d i f f i cu lt y breathing.                It was when        I got to this         position

that     I was aware      of a lot of          panic      in the     crowd around me?          a lot of

people were        screaming,        not only those who were               stuck up against               the

crush barriers?          it was      in this     position that           I first    realised that the

s i tuatio n was       so severe       that    I thought         p e o p l e ’s lives were     in danger,

t hrough     the gate a t / 4 h t i f e e ?      just      the odd one or two and              1 saw

policemen trying          to X m s h    some    people      back     into the    pen whe n they were

’trying    to    climb rai\k    of the gate        in the        perimeter    fence.



 I had only been         in position number               one for about       one   or two minutes

when     1 saw a Li ve r poo 1 fan run onto thie pi tch and a p p r o a c h the

L iverpool       g oalkeeper Bruce G R O B H A L V E R .          1 saw GROBH A L V E R    go to the

down    into the terraces.            I am not sure what              he did after       this.     I

never    saw a n y thing     else    of what      occurred on the          pitch.



After about another minute                I found myself          in a position where            1 could

stretch my arm out and touch the                   front       perimeter    fence.       I have marked

this    position with a figure             two on the separate             grid   plan which       I

produce        (Exh No          ) (Exh Ref



In position number           two the      crush ar o u n d me was very severe and                 people

all    around were        panicking?      although       I never      saw anyone at       first who        I

thought was        in serious       difficulty.



When    I first     got to     position number           two w hich   I can only estimate was

just after        the game    had been stopped?            I    was aware    that I was        standing

on top of things.            I could feel         that    there was       something      lying on the

terracing?        a l th ou gh at first      I did not know what            it was.



People     in front       of me and around me were all                  holding   onto    the front

perimeter        fence?    trying    to    pull   it down.        I joined    xny^iso        trying    to

pull    the fence        inwards and up.          We were       doing    th^*tfpx    sqae    tirne^

al t h ou gh    I c a n ’t say exactly how         long.        Ev^rfftually s ome     police

o fficers       came and started trying            to ki^jyfT this section of f e n c i n g

inwards        from the    pitch side.        Evetrj^al ly the fencing            gave way and the

people at the front           of me       c 1 imbrffKi out through the hole           in the

perimeter        fence and onto       th^r t r a c k .



As the area        in front    of me started to             clear     I became aware         that what         I

had felt u n d e r ne at h    my feet was bodies.                 There were a large          number o+

bodies     lying on the        terraces ar o u n d me and the            closer      1 looked towards

the wall        beneath the    perimeter fence             the more      bodies     I saw.       Ihey were

piled up on top of each other against                     the wall.



I cannot     say the exact          position     I was     in at this           time?     other    than to

say    I was by the section of fencing                 that was         pulled up and as            I looked

at the    pitch at the Liverpool              goal,    the      right-hand side            post as you

look   from L e p pings Lane was            positioned to my            right-hand         side.     I was

not aware at that            time of the dividing              fence    between       pens      numbers

three and four.



There were       such a large number            of bodies        in this         pile?    I could not

describe any of them.



As the area       in front       of me had      cleared and the fans behind me were

holding     people back and           I became aware           of this       pile    of b o d i e s in fran

of me?    I just went         to the     body lying      closest        to me to see            if I could

help the      person.        This   person was       lying      face    down on the          terraces

p o sitioned s l i ghtly        to the      left of the main           pile of bodies            I have

previou sly described.              I turned the        person over             to face him upwards.

He was     lying about         four feet back from the front                     perimeter w a l i ?

parallel     wit h       the wall   with his head towards               pen number         four and the

pile    of bodies w h i c h were         in the a rea where            the      fencing    had been

pulled up



As    I turned the         person over       I saw his face was a dark                   blue    colour.

His    eyes were         open and staring and his m o u t h was                  open.     1 could see

that    his tongue was          swollen.        I have    had first aid training at schooi

             was     doing,    a l t h ou gh    I   have    no idea who he was,            I thought h e 'must             have

              him,    a policeman         pulled me away and started wit h another                           policeman           to

              try to help out.             As soon as this               happe n e d    I climbed out        of the      pen

              through the hole            in the      perimeter- fence a no. went              onto    the    pitch.         1

W hen    I got out onto         the    pitch      I stood on the North S tand side of the

pitch just outside             the    18-yard bo,'-; of the L i v e rpool         g o a l , u             after

getting     out onto the         pitch      1 )4a.s a p proached by                                     and

shouJ,cl get out of           he w a y «



At some     time   later?       1 c a n ’t say what       time?     we saw s u pporters             running

over to the S pi o n Kop end of the ground to                       pull a d v e r t i s i n g    hoardings

down to use as          stretchers.           Myself                           and

ran over and helped             in carrying a d v e r t i s i n g    hoardings        back       to the

L e p pings Lane       end of the ground.



I went with a group of other                   supporters     and ^/Sid our          hoaraing           down on

the     pitch next      to the       body of a girl wh^/was            lying      close to where               I

had first     stood on the            pitch that       i j f on the N orth Stand          side      of the

L e p pings Lane       end goal       close    toyfhe    corner     of the     18-yard box.                The

girl was     not being a t t en de d J C o ,         She was' lying face upwards.                       Her

lips were     blue.         She a p p e a r e d to me to be dead.            We    placed the g i r 1 o n

t h j j a s m t ^ ying         fy n g      upward,.      w.   lift.d the h c a r d i m , up, about

six of us were          carrying        the hoarding,         I did not know any of the                       other

supporters.        we    y /kn across       the    pitch towards       the    corner      of the North
                        /
S t a n d and the jSpion Kop.              As we    ran the girl's        head was        towards          the

front of the/ h o a r d i n g        (Spion Kop end).          1 was     carrying        the     front

right-hand      corner        (South>Btand side)          of the hoarding,
                   G s u L y
We    carried the hoarding to an area behind                      ine North S tand

w hich was under            cover,     .We laid the hoarding           down?      leaving        the girl             on

the     hoarding and then            returned      to the Leppings Lane end of the ground,

When we     placed the hoarding               down there were also a lot of other                          oodies

in the area.           I never       saw anyone a p p r o a c h the hoarding we had                     placed

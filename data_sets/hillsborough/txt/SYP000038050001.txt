Dear Mr Patrick

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

My Chief Constable, Mr Geoffrey Dear, who is presently away, has received
two letters from a I       lofl             ISheffield.

I am presently leading the inquiry on a fulltime basis on behalf of
Mr Dear.  I have responded to|        |by quoting from our press release
which formed the basis of my contact with the news media on Wednesday
16 and Thursday 17 August 1989.

In my contact withN the media I said "the criminalinvestigation which
will be undertaken by the West Midlands Police will examine the possible
culpability of all parties not just the police".

I was questioned more closely in the press conference and my response
was that all persons, including fans, would be considered for criminal
proceedings if evidence came to light that they were culpable.

If you receive any further letters from          Dr others and you think
I can help, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely




Assistant Chief Constable
(Hillsborough Inquiry)

Dear

I refer to your letter to Mr Irvine Patrick of 19 August 1989> a copy of
which you have forwarded to my Chief Constable.

In my contacts with the news media on 16 and 17 August I said "the
criminal investigation which will be undertaken by the West Midlands
Police will examine the possible culpability of all parties not just the
police".

I was questioned more closely in the press conference and my response
was that all persons, including fans, would be considered for criminal
proceedings if evidence came to light that they were culpable.

I trust this answers the question you raised.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
ANTHONY DAVID BLAND (DECEASED)
Many thanks for your letter dated 12th January enclosing the
report on autopsy of Dr Lowe. He refers to a further report when
neuropathological and histopathological results have been
obtained. I believe that it is the later report to which Dr Lowe
referred in the inquest and I should be most grateful to receive
a copy of this.
With many thanks for your assistance.
Yours faithfully

Dear
ANTHONY DAVID BLAND (DECEASED)
I refer to your letter dated 24th January and thank you for the
further report of Dr Lowe. I am sorry to trouble you again but
this in turn refers to the Neuropathology report and results of
microscopical examination (at the bottom of page 1) which are the
matters of interest. I should be grateful if you would forward
a copy of these.
Thank you for your assistance.
Yours sincerely

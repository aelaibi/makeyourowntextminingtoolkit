Dear
                I am very sorry it has been considered necessary to have an
 investigatiow to establish whether or not criminal charges should folIow the
IFi11sborough disaster but I am relieved to hear that you will not overlook the
role of the fans*
                For whatever the short comings of the Police and the ground auihoritie
 im this matter* 95 people would wot have lost their lives if the fans who gathered
at the fatal end had accepted Police appeals for patience and discipline awd
behaved themselves*. Noone who ^fetched the W coverage of the affair caw rightly
draw any other conclusion*
              N oone compelled these fans to turn up late in such large numbers,
many "high" on alcolol ^nioowe compelled them to create a situation which led to the
gate being opened in order to avert calamity, noone compelled them to surge through
that gate and on1 to a terrace which they must have seen? was already full,, and
noon* prevented’them from giving way at the back when the pressure could wet be
relieved from the front because of the fencing*
              Lord' Justice Tlaylor has done a grave wrong to the Vest Yorkshire
Police by laying the main blame for the tragedy at their door*. Why did he die so?
Was he afraid of iffesmding Liverpool? Or was- he merely patting into practice
the increasingly popol a(f~doctrine that we need no longer fear being held
responsible for our„ngT-misbehaviour tut,m»ith the help of the larw, can always
get someone e>lae to bear the responsibility?
              The Policemen? on duty that day took the decisions they believed to be
right when faced with a situation it would have taken a. few riot squads #o
centril*! believe they were right* Btet even if they erred in seme r e s p e c ts ? — and
bow easy it is to Judge after the veveo* whew there is no longer an imperative
for instant decision — they should not be open? to criminal charges that will
ruin their lives. It is just as if the first time a> batsman failed to score
M s team sacked him for good* The prospect of someone who did their best being
charged with a crime is alarming*
               Is to the ground authorities I cam only say this* For a hundred
years and more Hillsborough has been handling bigger crowds and there has been
no trouble* !hy? Because the fains h&ve behaved themselves* The fans on the day
Liverpool were te play Nottingham Forest diid not behave themselves*
               Incidental 1y* I read that Mrs Nicola Barrism speaking for the
Hillsborough Solicitors Gfroup Says any eventual conviction would help the claims
fir compensation! VHat kind of a horror is she? As though money can compensate
for the loss of a child* Or are we on the point of bree<Rimg children so a» to
plunge them into disasters and then get the money* Miy notva market in
disaster children!

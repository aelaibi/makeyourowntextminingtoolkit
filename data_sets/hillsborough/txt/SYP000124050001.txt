 WHAT STEWARDS * DIRECTIONS DID YOU WITNESS AT THE TURNSTILES?

 AFTER PURCHASING TICKET RETURNED TO TURNSTILES,           AT ABOUT 2.30PM   (1430).      IN

 THE    "STAND * TURNSTILES APPROACH,   MARKED 1-16 ON MAP, THERE WERE TWO CIVILISED

 QUEUES.     HE WAS DIRECTED,   BY POLICE OFFICER,      TO TURNSTILES A/G AND WAS

 CONFRONTED BY OFFICER ON HORSEBACK BLOCKING THE GATE WITH HIS HORSE.               THE

 NUMBER OF PEOPLE REQUESTING ENTRANCE INCREASED RAPIDLY.            THE OFFICER APPEARED

 TO BE CONTROLLING THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE ENTERING BY MAINTAINING A GAP BETWEEN

 THE PERIMETER GATE AND THE REAR OF A LARGE MASS OF PEOPLE AT THE

 TURNSTILES.        THE CROWD OUTSIDE BUILT UP VERY QUICKLY AND DEMANDS WERE MADE TO
     ,   •                                                              PAGE   4

 BE ALLOWED THROUGH.       ISOLATED INDIVIDUALS WERE BEING ABUSIVE TO THE OFFICER.

 THEN A COMBINATION OF PROBLEMS FOLLOWED AMD THE O F F I C E R ’S HORSE SOMEHOW WAS

 TURNED IN 90 DEGREES AND SUPPORTERS MOVED EITHER SIDE.              THERE WAS PRESSURE OF

 MOVEMENT FROM BEHIND.       TWO OTHER MOUNTED OFFICERS TRIED TO^©#GANISE THE QUEUE.

                ONLY SAW ONE OR TWO FOOT OFFICERS.    HE RECOGNISED AT LEAST ONE AS A

 C R O W D , BUT ALL THAT HAPPENED WAS PEOPLE FILLEl/’THE GAP HE LEFT.  THE HORSEMEN

 FAILED TO GAIN CONTROL AND THE CROWD MOVEQ/FORWARD MAKING THE CRUSH AT THE

 TURNSTILES MORE SEVERE.       PEOPLE SOON GOT INTO SERIOUS DIFFICULTY,        SOME

 SCREAMING,      OTHERS SHOUTING FOR PEO PUB. TO MOVE BACK.       EVERYONE WAS TIGHTLY

 PACKED AND SWEATING PROFUSELY.        CMmE PERSON FAINTED.       THE CRUSHED CONiXNUED

 fUliHT UPTO THE TURNSTILES AND MANY PEOPLE WERE BEING CRUSHED UP AGAINST THE

 WALL AND GATES.       I HEARD A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT TELLING PEOPLE TO MOVE

 BACK.       THE SOUND WAS ALMOST INAUDIBLE,   OF POOR QUALITY AND THE ANNOUNCER HAD t

BROAD YORKSHIRE ACCENT.        I WAS CLOSE TO THE TURNSTILES AND COULD HARDLY HEAR

 IT.

BEHAVIOUR OF PRESS

PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS WERE MORE INTERESTED IN TAKING PICTURES OF THE INJURED A M

DYING THAN ASSISTING.        HE FELT THAT THEY DID NOT BEHAVE PROPERLY AND IN FACT

CAUSED TEMPERS TO FRAY BECAUSE OF THEIR BEHAVIOUR



 DID YOU EXPERIENCE ANY DIFFICULTY       IN FINDING YOUR ENTRY POINT?

 YES

 TOs LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR

 HILLSBOROUGH    INQUIRY

 DEAR SIR

 PLEASE FIND ENCLOSED A COPY OF MY HILLSBOROUGH EVIDENCE.        I SENT THE

 ORIGINAL TO LIVERPOOL FC WHO WILL PROBABLY FORWARD IT TO YOURSELF.            I HAVE

 NOT CONTACTED EITHER THE MIDLANDS POLICE INQUIRY OR THE MAKIN/LIVERPOOL

 INQUIRY IN LIVERPOOL.     I MAYBE JUST BEING BAD-MINDED BUT I QUESTION THEIR

 IMPARTIALITY.

       A REASONABLY EXPERIENCED FOOTBALL SPECTATOR HAVING BEEN IN MANY STADIUMS

 IN BRITAIN AND A FEW IN EUROPE.     I AM ALSO A CHARTERED ENGINEER AS WELL AS


Q2Q

 A LONG-STANDING LIVERPOOL FAN.     HILLSBOROUGH AFTER HEYSEL IS REALLY TOO MUCH

 TO BEAR.   IF I CAN BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE AT THE INQUIRY,      I FEEL IT IS MY DUTY

 TO ATTEND IF REQUESTED.     I AM CERTAIN MY EMPLOYER [~              |WOULD ALLOW ME

 TIME-OFF TO ATTEND.

 I HAVE TRIED TO WRITE MY EXPERIENCES AND THOUGHTS DOWN BEFORE READING THE

 DEEPLY OFFENSIVE NEWSPAPERS OR SEEING THE MEDIA COVERAGE.

 RECALL.

 VERY SLOW ARRIVING.

 Q54

 0     THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL. IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS TOTALLY WRONG WHICH WAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE PART OF

 THE GROUND ALLOCATED TO LIVERPOOL FANS,

 THE LACK OF POLICE ORGANISATION BEFORE THE MATCH WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY DOWN TO

 SENIOR POLICE OFFICERS.

 THE MAIN REASON FOR THE TRAGEDY    I FEEL WAS PEOPLE BEING LET IN THROUGH THE

 TUNNEL AFTER 2 PM (1400).

 HILLSBOROUGH IS OBVIOUSLY THE WRONG CHOICE OF GROUND FOR A MATCH LIKE THE FA

 CUP SEMI FINAL.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A C RIM INAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 053

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I C A N ’T REALLY SAY BUT I FEEL THAT THE POL ICfjXJDTSI DE THE GROUND COULD

 H^^I BEEN REDEPLOYED INSIDE TO HELP.         JMt-RE WAS ALSO IN MY OPINION A LACK

 OF COMMUNICATION.              C u l n V '

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL        IS 'VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 NOT APART FROM WHAT I HAVE ALREADY SAID.

 AT ONE POINT THE POLICE WERE LITERALLY TRYING TO PULL THE PERIMETER FENCE

 DOWN BUT I FELT THAT THIS WAS WASTED EFFORT WHICH MIGHT HAVE RESULTED IN MORE

 F^ALITIES.       THERE WAS ALREADY A CONCRETE WALL TO WHICH THE FENCE WAS CLOSE

 TO.   EVEN FROM WHERE I WAS I COULD SEE SPACES TO MY LEFT AND RIGHT,        ALL IT

 NEEDED WAS TWO STEWARDS TO DIRECT THEM.

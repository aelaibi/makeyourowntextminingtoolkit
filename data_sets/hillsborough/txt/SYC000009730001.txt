M R   FR AZER :       -- (inaudible) to drive, but I don’t want to do that 15 days.


CORONER:              No, but I’m thinking of the families. So, a bit like two hours
                      for the duration for Liverpool to ...


MR FRAZER:            Well, of course, as I say, a third of them are not Liverpool so




MR JONES:             Well, I was going to say with a lawyer parameter in listening
                      would be to see in fact in the order of the day whether we
                      can actually get the geography of the those at St. Helens are
                      perhaps a bit easier than the ones on the Wirral.


CORONER:              Yeah, that’s right. Yeah.


MR JONES:             Or some that are local to here even.


CORONER:              I mean the mixed geography is really difficult.


MR FRAZER:            It is probably the most difficult part of it in logistical terms.


CORONER:              Yes.


MR FRAZER:            I don’t know.


MR METCALF:           I would have been inclined to suggest a start at 10.00 but be
                      prepared to sit later rather than starting at 9.30.


MR FRAZER:            Yes, I think that’s ...

                                                                                          2
CORONER:              Yes, I fear that I agree really. I mean bear in mind if we sit
                      without a jury we can go on as long as you like but as soon
                      as you sit with a jury you’ve got to stop for coffee and then
                      you have to go to the loo - which I don’t blame them - and
                      they get tired. Anyway, we’ll just have to do the best we
                      can. If we find we can’t manage (inaudible), we’ll have to
                      adjust it and if we find that we can do more then we will be
                      halfway.


                      The witnesses, of course, will be paid in the usual way,
                      reporting whatever they can (inaudible). There won’t be that
                      many witnesses. I think it’s only fair to say. Normal
                      witnesses, and that includes family, will not be funded. So,
                      they’ll have to either find another way of profit or seek to
                      forgive me (inaudible) assuming that they are able to do so
                      as a matter of fact. Or get it from the fund. All I’m saying is
                      that we won’t be in a position to fund them. What happens
                      about it is a matter for them.


MR JONES:             Do you want to just mention the possibility, not the
                      probability, of another week being set aside for --


CORONER:              Oh yes. Yes. W e’ve chosen the dates because they suit us
                      from a practical point of view. We want to finish if at all
                      possible before the bank holiday, so 4 May is our target day
                      for finishing. We haven’t tended to reserve another week
                      beginning, I think, on 21 May.


MR JONES:             Something like that, so the week beginning the Spring Bank
                      Holiday.

CORONER:              To either take the stragglers or --
00:03:12
MR JONES:             Because they might be on holiday or something.


CORONER:              Yes, that’s right. So, it may be that all our careful listing and
                      everything else, we will then find that there will be a handful
                      or a dozen - however many it is - who we will do towards the
                      end of May as opposed to the end of April. That is a
                      mopping up operation. If we don’t need it then we won't use
                      it. Yes, thank you for mentioning that.


MR JONES:             Well, you never know if illness or something like that.


MR FRAZER:            If you get, say, like today where people can't get across the
                      Pennines for the wind.


MR JONES:             Yes, might lose a whole day if there was --


MR FRAZER:            It is quite easy; it is quite likely to happen.


MR JONES:             Hopefully the weather by April will be better than it would
                      have been when we would have originally started the
                      inquest --


MR FRAZER:            In January, yes.


MR JONES:             It’s a good few months.


MR FRAZER:            Yes, I must confess I wasn’t looking forward to 15 January
                      start.

MR JONES:             Fair enough, it hasn’t been all that bad.


MR FRAZER:            No, it’s been very mild since but there it is; you’ll never
                      know.


CORONER:              I agree. We did think about it and we realised we’re in the
                      middle of winter but it was difficult to know when else to
                      start.


MR METCALF:           There’s always something or other.


MR FRAZER:            There’s no good time to start an exercise like this.


CORONER:              Would you like, before we break up, for me to just quickly
                      walk around this building, just this top floor, so that you can
                      see a little about the space? It is of much less interest to
                      you than it is ... but please join us if you will. Do you want to
                      see it now?


MR FRAZER:            Yes, please. Yes.


MR METCALF:           I’ll join you if I may.


CORONER:              The length of the (several inaudible words) --


MR FRAZER:            You needn’t switch your machine off presumably.


CORONER:              The jury will sit over there.


MR FRAZER:            Yes.

C O R O N E R :       This bench will be the press box, so that’s everybody else,
                      the public, and this will be (inaudible) solicitors. The
                      entrance from the lobby is that door and so I would expect
                      people to be brought in and sat down through that door.
                      Now, having done our inquest my present plan is to take -
                      excuse I’ll look at my (inaudible) - to take the group who
                      we’ve just finished with, you know (inaudible) or the ushers,
                      and instead of taking them out through that door, to take
                      them out through this door. This is normally the exit to the
                      jury room but (several inaudible words). W e’ll move it.
00:05:49
MR METCALF            Yes, that’s ...

                      [no speech]

CORONER:              ... would come in through this door here, and (several
                      inaudible words) down this corridor and they’re going to sit
                      back over there.

CORONER:              No, I’m very grateful to you.


MR FRAZER:            Thank you for the invitation.


MR METCALF:           Yes, I hope it’ been useful.

Dear


     May I on behalf of all my colleagues in Liverpool and the other
Departments thank you and your colleagues most sincerely for the tremendous
help and assistance you have given providing refreshments at both the Drop-in
Centre at Vernon Sangster and the Helpline here at Hatton Garden.

     It has been greatly appreciated that your organisation rallied round
and provided the kind of support that is so little talked about and so
desperately needed. We do all want to say how much staff wanted this service
to be acknowledged.

     I hope you will accept my apologies for not writing before, and at
the same time ensure that your colleagues who have given so valiantly of
their time and goodwill are made aware of my note.




                               Yours sincerely,




                         DIRECTOR OF SOCIAL SERVICES.

                                              MR.   CATCHPOLE


     There has been a brief reference to the system that
was employed on the day, and again I am not sure how much
criticism, if any, was made of the Club in relation to
that system.  Certainly I do not think it came very thick
and fast and was not put to Hr. Mackrell ....

     MR, KING:   Can I say, sir, far from it.   I make my
position clear, that the evidence of Mackrell, Lock,
Seamen, I would submit indicated a different system they
were expecting from the system which was employed on the
day, and that is why I submitted to you, sir, that if
system was a cause the're was evidence - it is not for me
to say which way a Jury would go - but there was evidence
that a reasonably prudent person of the expertise dealing
with plans would know that the system on the day had the
risk of overcrowding inherent in it, because of the fact
that Mackrell, Lock, Seamen, Eastwood, were expecting a
different system in certain respects.   If that helps my
learned friend ....

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   It is very helpful. I have got a
series of factors which I would have put to you as there
being a lack of evidence for a person in the position of
Mr. Mackrell, but I think it is now plain it simply has
not been put to Mr. Mackrell that he should have perceived
there was an obvious and serious risk, and as such I d o n ’t
think there is any evidence, with respect, that could
establish any mens rea against Mr. Mackrell/the Club, in
relation to the system if that system is to be found at
fault, and I make no argument about that.

       So in the round, whether it is the opening of Gate C
or the system itself, there is simply no evidence on which
a n y reasonable Jury could come to the conclusion that a
reasonably prudent person in the position of Mr. Mackrell
would have perceived the obvious and serious risk to which
I have referred and in the manner in which I have defined
it.    As such, with respect, there should not be left to
this Jury the verdict in respect of Sheffield Wednesday of
unlawful killing, and they should be directed as my
learned friend Mr. Maxwell has suggested in relation to
the Sheffield City Council.

     Unless I can assist you, sir - as I say, I have got a
number of factors for the circumstances but I d o n ’t think
in the light of that intervention that I need to go
through them, and I have been much shorter than I
anticipated.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   My submission is relating to the
Inquest into the death of my son John McBrien at
Hillsborough Football Stadium on 15th April, 1989,
                                                       18

                                               MRS McBRIEN


     Thank you for giving me the opportunity to make a
legal submission on behalf of my family, as I am only a
lay person.  Also, I am grateful that I have had the
opportunity to study the submissions made by Mr. Richard
Maxwell, QC, on behalf of Sheffield City Council.  I wish
to utilise a large amount of those submissions as they
relate to the law in general to develop my theme and put
my case.

     My submission relates only to the possibility of the
Jury being directed to consider a verdict of unlawful
killing.  For the purpose of this Inquest a verdict of
unlawful killing would be justified if the Jury was
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that some person or
persons whom the Jury must under no account name or
identify, had brought about the death of John McBrien, as
a result of committing the offence of manslaughter.

     If the Jury are to be directed to consider a verdict
of unlawful killing, on the basis that John McBrien died
as a consequence of manslaughter, then the Jury must be
warned in terms that they are being directed to consider
whether a criminal offence of manslaughter had been
committed.  They must be given the appropriate direction
as to the standard of proof for manslaughter, and the
appropriate direction is the simple one, that they should
be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt, or as is
sometimes said satisfied so that they are sure that all
the necessary elements of the offence are proved, and that
the verdict of unlawful killing must not be returned
unless they are satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that
such elements are proved.

     The question is whether the Jury should be directed
to consider a verdict of unlawful killing based on
reckless manslaughter.  That is to say to consider whether
the Jury are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that some
person or persons whom they must under no account name has
brought about the death of John McBrien as a result of
recklessness.  If the Jury are to consider whether some
specific individual committed the offence of reckless
manslaughter then the Jury have to consider firstly
whether that person by his conduct, that is some act or
omission to act where there was a duty to act, was a
substantial cause of the death of John McBrien.

     In order to prove causation the following matters
must be established*  (1) that but for the conduct of the
person under consideration the death of John McBrien would
not have occurred; (2) that although the conduct of the
person under consideration need not be the sole or the
main cause of death, it must be a substantial cause.
                                                            19

                                                MRS McBRIEN


     The Jury's function is to establish how John McBrien
came by his death and they are concerned to find out what
circumstances are directly responsible for his death, that
the events occurring at the Ground on 15th April, 1989,
from 2.30 p.m. onwards were foreseeable.   The events
referred to are the sudden introduction of a large number
of fans en masse into an area of the terraces which was
already crowded and full.  Prior to the opening of the
exit gate, Gate C, at 2.52 p.m. approximately 52,000 fans
had been safely accommodated within the Stadium that day
and had been admitted by turnstile etitry. The admittance
of the remaining 2,000 or so fans should have continued by
the same safe method of turnstile entry, and not in the
form of a sudden in rush by the^opening of an exit gate.
The breaking of the rules that day to enable fans to enter
the Stadium ....
     THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, you were doing very
well, exceedingly well, but you are now beginning, in fact
not beginning you are well into an address on the facts,
1 did warn you twice because I know how difficult it is,
but I am not going to let you address me on the facts.   It
is not proper or fair to 94 other youngsters, or indeed
older people, because 94 other people have also died and
they are just as precious to their families as John is to
you.  It is quite improper that I should allow you to
break all the rules, if I don't let Mr. King break them.

     I don't know what is coming next but at the moment
you are telling me facts.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   I was going to lead up to the point
of the alternative of opening the gates, that there was an
alternative.

     THE CORONER:   No, that is an address on the facts,

     MR. CATCHP0LE:   Might I   suggest perhaps we could
rise for our coffee break and   meanwhile Mr. Kins and
myself will have a quick look   over Mrs. McBrien s
submission and see whether we   can be of any assistance.

     THE CORONER:   Thank you.  Please understand, Mrs.
McBrien, I am in a terrible difficulty over this.  I don t
want to muzzle you, if that is the right word, but on the
other hand I have also got to stick within the rules.
That is very kind of you, Mr. Catchpole, and a good idea.
Shall we have 20 minutes?

     MRS, McBRIE N;  Sir, I think almost all of it does
relate to the law though.

     THE CORONER:   If Mr. Catchpole and Mr, King are
happy to look at it ....

     HRS. HcBRIEN:   I would not like the theme that I
have changed in any way.

     HR. CATCHPOLE:   I can promise Mrs. McBrien I would
not dream of attempting to alter the theme*

      THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, let's make this quite
clear.   What Mr. Catchpole and Mr. King, or indeed anybody
is going to say to you, is not binding.      You can say,  Get
lost".   You can even say, "I d o n ’t want you to look at
it", but if you have an offer of help then you must
consider it and either accept it or reject it as you wish,
but you must also bear in mind that when I come back after
ray coffee break if I am not satisfied that you are dealing
with law I am going to stop you.

                     (Short Adjournment)

     MR. CATCHPOLEi  I have had the opportunity, sir,
of briefly looking through Mrs. McBrien's submission.
She was in fact right to say that the vast majority of
it does relate to the law. There are passages relating
to the fact which, as written, sounds like a speech but
I think, as I have tried to explain, they are actually
intended to illustrate Mrs. McBrien's theme that there
is evidence the Jury could properly consider in
reaching a verdict rather than addressing you on the
facts.  They are not very lon^ passages-
     THE CORONER:  I take it though, from those of you
who have looked at it, you are not going to jump and
complain if I listen?
     MR. CATCHPOLE:   It is only me that has looked at
it, sir.
     MR. KING:  I suggested an approach by which we
could solve the problem and I left it to my learned
friend, Mr. Catchpole, to continue only because on
reflection, given my particular position I did not feel
I ought to go any further because I did not want any
conflict arising out of my position.

     THE CORONER:  I look to you then, Mr. Catchpole.
I have heard what you say. Mrs. McBrien, carry on,

     MRS. McBRIEN: Sir, there is just a little to put
in a different way that I was referring to before.

     THE CORONER:  I have heard what Mr. Catchpole has
said and I am reassured.
     MRS. McBRIEN:  It is the law.  I have read the
submission of Mr. Hale and I have listened carefully to
the submissions of Mr. Isaacs and my submission is that
there is evidence on which a reasonable Jury, properly
directed, could conclude that John McBrien was
unlawfully killed.

    There is evidence to suggest that the opening of
Gate C was the cause, or substantial cause, of the
death of John McBrien. For example, some 50,000 fans
were already in the stadium and there was the
uncontrolled entry through Gate C at 2.52.  In
addition, there was the evidence of Dr* Nicholson about
the increase in the rate of flow into the ground.

    The second matter to be considered is the mental
element involved in reckless manslaughter.  The Jury
should be directed to consider whether the doer of the
act acted recklessly in so far as before doing the act
                                                          22

                                                MRS* MCBRIEN


he either failed to give any thought to the possibility
of there being any such risk to the fans within the
stadium, or, having recognised that there was such a
risk, he nevertheless went on to do it anyway*

    This can be compared with driving a motor vehicle
on the highway-  The example I give is that we have
evidence that about 52,000 had entered or been driven
into the stadium by 2.52 by the safe speed limit, that
is, turnstile entry.  That had been observed at the
time but at 2.52 the speed limit was exceeded
considerably, that is, the rate of flow of fans was
dramatically increased. That was a reckless act. That
was driving at excessive speeds causing injuries and
deaths.

    The Jury must be satisfied that the defendant was
in fact driving the vehicle, that is the mass of
people, in such a manner as to create an obvious and
serious risk of causing physical injury to some other
person, namely John McBrien, who was using the road,
namely the Hillsborough Football Stadium, at the time.
In driving in that manner the defendant did so without
having given any thought to the possibility of there
being any such risk or, having recognised that there
was some risk involved, had none the less gone on to
take it*

    It is for the Jury to decide whether the risk
created by the manner in which the vehicle was being
driven was both obvious and serious and in deciding
that they might apply the standard of the ordinary,
prudent motorist as represented by themselves.   If
satisfied that an obvious and serious risk was created
by the manner of the defendant's driving, the Jury are
entitled to infer that he was in one or other states of
mind required to constitute the offence and will
probably do so, but regard must be given to any
explanation he gives as to his state of mind which may
displace the inference.

    The second question you have to decide, was the
driving that caused those injuries reckless? If so,
then it is manslaughter.  To amount to reckless driving
mere negligence is not enough. His conduct must go
beyond the question of compensation between citizens
and amount to criminal conduct requiring punishment.
You have to be satisfied upon the question of
recklessness that he drove in such a manner as to
create an obvious and serious risk of causing physical
harm to some other person who might be using thfe road
at the time.
                                                           23

                                                 MRS. MCBRIEN


    Once you are satisfied that the manner of his
driving was such as to create an obvious and serious
risk of causing physical harm to a person using the
road at the time you also have to be satisfied that
driving in that manner he did so without having given
any thought to the possibility of there being such a
risk or, alternatively, having recognised that there
was some risk none the less went on to take it*   In
other words, he was reckless.  He reckoned not of the
consequences.

    In determining the quality of his driving, you
apply the standards of the ordinary, reasonable
motorist.   You, of course, take into account all the
evidence including his explanation.   If you are
satisfied so as to be sure that the first question is
proved, that is to say, the act of X was a substantial
cause of the death of John McBrien then the second
question you have to decide is, was the act that caused
his death reckless? If so, then it is manslaughter.
    His conduct must go beyond the question of
compensation between citizens and amount to criminal
conduct requiring punishment.   You have to be satisfied
upon the question of recklessness that he acted in such
a manner as to create an obvious and serious risk of
causing physical harm to John McBrien who happened to
be using the Leppings Lane terrace at the time. You
also have to be satisfied that acting in that manner he
did so without having given any thought to the
possibility of there being any such risk or,
alternatively, having recognised that there was some
risk involved none the less went on to take it.   In
other words, he was reckless. He reckoned not of the
consequences.

    In determining the quality of his act you apply the
standards of the ordinary reasonable person who
happened to be in the same circumstances as X. You, of
course, take into account all the evidence including
his explanation.

    In order to constitute the offence of manslaughter,
the risk of death being caused must be very high and
such a remark should be made to the Jury here.  There
is evidence on which a reasonable Jury could conclude
that there was a real possibility of a sudden inrush of
fans using the central tunnel as that was the direct
means of access to the Leppings Lane terrace.  It was
also known that the terrace had a high perimeter fence
at the front and radial fences dividing the terrace
into pens, and having radial gates that could become
obscured.
                                                           24-2

                                                 MRS. MCBRIEN


    Where manslaughter is charged and the circumstances
are that John McBrien was killed as a result of the
reckless driving of the defendant on a public highway,
that is Hillsborough Football stadium the Judge should
give the Jury the appropriate direction but in order to
constitute the offence of manslaughter the risk of
death being caused by the manner of the defendant's
driving must be very high.

    In deciding whether or not the risk was obvious the
Jury should have regard to whether the risk would have
been obvious to an ordinary, prudent individual in the
relevant circumstances.   The Jury should be told that
they may take into account what any witness has told
them was obvious or not to that witness as a risk.   The
witness's perception of the risk can provide an
indication of whether or not the risk was obvious to an
ordinary prudent person and especially so if the Jury
conclude that the witness in question was such an
ordinary, prudent person.

    For this purpose, witness includes a person whose
conduct has been called into question at the Inquest
and the Jury can take into account an explanation by
such a person. The Jury should only be directed to
consider a verdict of unlawful killing based upon
reckless manslaughter if the Coroner concludes, as a
matter of law, that there is a case fit to be left to
the Jury and whether the Coroner concludes, as a matter
of law, that a reasonable Jury, properly directed,
might bring in such a verdict-

    The death of each deceased must be considered
individually-  Before the Jury may be invited to
consider a verdict of unlawful killing in respect of
John McBrien the Coroner must direct himself as to
whether or not there is a prima facie case so far as
John McBrien is concerned. A verdict in the case of
each deceased is required and if unlawful killing is to
be left to the Jury it must be considered by the Jury
in relation to each of the deceased.

    The Jury should be directed that if, having
considered the circumstances of death affecting each of
the individual deceased, they are satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that some or all of them may be
considered as a group of persons whose death was caused
as a result of reckless manslaughter committed by some
specific individual or individuals, who must under no
account be named or identified, then similar verdicts
may be returned in the case of each member of such
group. There will, therefore, be 95 verdicts but some
or all may be in similar terms.

       However, the jury must be directed that it is
improper to consider unlawful killing in relation to the
9 5 deceased as a whole or to any group of the deceased
without first considering the individual circumstances
of the death of each particular deceased.

      The jury must be warned that no short cut is
available to them permitting them to proceed on the
presumption that they are entitled to consider the
circumstances of death of the 95 deceased as a whole
or of any group of the deceased as a group unless some
cause is shown why they should not do so.

      That would reverse the order in which relevant
consideration should be dealt with.

      They are concerned with the Inquest relating to
the death of John McBrien at the H il lsborough Football
Stadium disaster as an individual case.

      There is no presumption that a verdict in common
form is applicable to the 95 deceased persons.  Only
after careful consideration of each individual case can
the jury establish what verdict is appropriate.

      The jury must be directed that they can return a
verdict of unlawful killing only if they can attribute
the ingredients of the relevant offence, reckless
manslaughter to some individual person or persons
whom they should on no account name or otherwise
identify.
      In this context the jury should consider the position
of each single person who may be a candidate taking each
such person in turn and coming to a conclusion.

      in this context the jury must be warned that
whatever person is being considered, and be that person
a corporation or a natural human being, the ingredients
of manslaughter must be established by proving the
necessary mental element and criminal conduct of man­
slaughter against it or him by evidence properly to
be relied on against it or him and a case against any
person cannot be fortified by evidence against another
person. No aggregation of criminal culpability is
permitted*

      If unlawful killing is to be left to the jury
as a possible verdict then the Coroner should indicate
to the jury that they must deal with that issue first
and that they should approach therefore initially the
question whether or not they are satisfied so that they
are sure beyond a reasonable doubt thht the verdict
of unlawful killing may be returned in respect of
John McBrien.
                                                            27


                                     MRS. MCBRIEN




      The jury have heard a variety of different persons
and such criticisms have been voiced wholly or mainly
in cross-examination.

      Representation of certain persons whose conduct
was likely to be called into question has been permitted.

      The case of any such person whose conduct has been
called into question then unless a reasonable jury properly
directed could conclude that such person committed the
offence of manslaughter against any or all or some of the
deceased, the jury must be directed in terms either:

       (1) To exclude that person from their consideration
of the issue whether or not they are satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that the verdict of unlawful killing is
appropriate; or

       (2) To consider such a verdict only in the case
of some other person or persons who should be named in
the direction but not of course in the verdict and not
to consider such a verdict in the case of any other
person.

      The reasons for discriminating in this way are:

       (a) For reasons of justice and humanity there
should be no question of any risk arising that a verdict
of unlawful killing where the jury are forbidden to name
any culprit might be understood in the context of the
evidence to refer to one or more of those persons whose
conduct was called into question at the Inquest, but in
respect of whom no reasonable jury properly directed
could conclude that such person had committed the offence
of manslaughter.

      Such a risk does arise where there have been
criticisms of and suggestions express or implied of
negligence against a variety of persons and all the more
as where the verdict of unlawful killing involves a finding
of recklessness which the jury and the public may be at
risk of confusing with negligence.  There must be no risk
of those who are innocent of criminal culpability of being
caught up with any whom the jury may regard as criminally
responsible.

       (b) The converse of (a) is also true, namely that
in the case of a person whose conduct the jury are rightly
scrutinising to see whether they are satisfied so as to
be sure that such conduct is criminal, any allegations
against or criticism of any other person might give rise
to prejudice.  Such a case does arise where the jury may
be tempted to aggregate fault.

                                        MRS. McBRIEN




       (c)       Without discrimination and exclusion of persons
who ought not to be regarded as candidates in terms of
criminal culpability there is a risk that the 3 W       .
be confused by an unnecessarily and erroneously wide choice
of candidates.

      That concludes my submission.

      THE CORONER?    Thank you, Mrs. McBrien.

      MISS ADDLEMAN:  Sir, can I say that in due course
what I will seek to do is to adopt many of the submissions,
indeed if not all the submissions made by my l e a r n e d friend
Hr. Russell.  Perhaps I will then have some amplification
to make.
      I am in your hands, sir, but we feel down this end
that Mr. Russell should go first.

      THE CORONER:    I will be very happy to hear Mr, Russell
before I hear you.
      MR. RUSSELL:  Sir, I have sought to prepare a
skeleton argument of my submissions and you will see cast           g
your eye over it that it covers many of the points which
I will be able to pass over very quickly indeed because I
don't see any point in rehearsing submissions which have
been made concisely and forcefully by those further up
the line.
      Sir, perhaps the quickest way is to move through
this skeleton pausing to elaborate matters where either
you require further guidance of what I am trying to say
or where I feel the point is not covered sufficiently
in the skeleton.
       The intention of these submissions is made clear first
 of all. The sole concern of these submissions is to
 establish that Mr. Greenwood is not a person in respect
 of whom the jury should be permitted to consider returning
 a verdict of unlawful killing and is made with this
 proviso, that it is not concerned with the positions of
 other persons whether human or corporate.

       Sir, the first point that I come to is the importance
 of excluding ineligible persons and two authorities are
 referred to in the skeleton, ex. parte Gray and the case
 that is referred to in that case within the body of the
 judgment, that o£ ex parte Thompson.
       Sir, I don't think it is necessary to read out the
 whole of the judgment in ex parte Gray,  You are familiar
 with it and have shown yourself to be familiar with it,
 but you will recall in ex parte Gray what Mr. Alan Jones

      MRS. M c BRIEN: Sir, I would like to add to ray
submission the application of the "but for   to the
following possible cause.

      But for the closing of Leppings Lane to traffic at
about 2.30 the congestion would not have arisen outside
the Leppings Lane turnstiles which led to the opening of
the exit gate, Gate C, so not only was a dangerous vehicle
created but it was also driven in a reckless manner causing
injuries and death-  Than); you.

      THE CORONER:    Thank you,H r s . McBrien.

      Miss ADDLEMAN: Sir, only two points I think.
Both are referable to comments made by my learned ^riend
Mr. Payne and can I say on the whole that I agree with the
matters which my learned friend Mr. Payne has f o u g h t to
your attention in his second aaaress, but can I take issue
sir with something he said so far as the authority
ex parte Higgins is concerned.

      As I understood it, I may be wrong about this, but
my learned friend Mr. Payne seemed to be suggesting to
you that this was a case where there was no evidence in
the view of the Court to support a verdict Oi unlawful
killing.
      In my respectful submission, sir, it seems clear
to me at any rate, that it was a case of insufficient
evidence and I gain support for that view particularly
from page 245, halfway down the page, the paragraph that
begins "Mr, Goghlan for the coroner ---- "

       THE CORONER:   Yes.
       MISS ADDLEMAN :        submitted that nevertheless
       there was evidence upon which a jury properly
       directed could have come to the conclusion that
       a verdict ofunlawful killing was the    proper
       verdict.  In    this hewas supported by
       Mr. O'Connor.   Both of them referred us to
       all such passages of the evidence as they were
       able to suggest might amount to sufficient
       evidence to justify a verdict."

 Sir, clearly that submission was rejected but clearly there
 was some material on which the Court came to the conclusion.

       Sir, I think that in my respectful submission could
 be an important point and one to be borne in mind.

       Secondly, sir, can I say that I agree with the
 remarks made by my   learned friend Mr. Payne with regard
 to those passages of the Kong Cheuk decision which he
 drew to our attention yesterday on pages 25 and there again
 on page 26.

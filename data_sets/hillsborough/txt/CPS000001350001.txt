  Dear Mr Enzor

  Adlington -v- Duckenfleld and Murray
  Leeds Magistrates’ Court - 21 December 1998

  We refer to your letter of 18 November and note the advice contained therein.

  In regard 10 the CPS conclusion that “we should not intervene to lake over any o f the
  charges” we are bound to say, as per our detailed letter of submissions dated 9 October
  1998, that full and detailed reasons for the decision taken aie required to be made known in
  this situation and we reiterate the request for those reasons.

  We ask for confirmation that the evidentiary test applied by the CPS in coming to its
  conclusion was that set out in your letter of 27 July 1998 to HFSG, specifically “there is
  clearly no case to answer". It may well be implicit that this is the case, but you will
  appreciate the desire for us to clarify the basis for the CPS decision before taking matters
  fbrther.

  Insofar as the letter of 27 July 1998 maintains that the CPS policy in this case builds on that
  contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, please advise which aspects of the Code have
  been considered in coming to the conclusion reached, and the weight given to any such
  factors.

  You will appreciate that as the criminal prosecution is proceeding, we are bound to take any
  appropriate steps following receipt of your letter with all due expedition, and accordingly
  would be grateM if you could let us have the advice requested by return. We are aware of a
  letter sent by the solicitors to Mr Murray, Walker Morris, on 18 December 1998 and
  notwithstanding any response you may care to give to that correspondence, we would ask
  you to deal specifically with the issues raised in this correspondence.

             Taithfiilly

          PROSECUTION): HILLSBOROUGH 1 9 8 9

          I write in response to your letter of 3 December 1998 which you
          discussed with the Attorney General in his room at the House of
          Commons yesterday.

          The Attorney General has carefully considered your letter and its
          enclosures.    He endorses the approach adopted by the Crown
          Prosecution Service and the conclusion it h as reached. During the
          discussion, he specifically confirmed his view th at, even if it is lawfully
          open to the CPS to effect a partial intervention, it would not be
          appropriate to do so in the circum stances of this particular case. He has
          noted the em phasis placed by those who seek discontinuance on the p ast
          history of the m atter. He is fortified in the conclusion reached by the
          CPS and himself in th a t the courts have in recent years developed a very
          wide approach to the doctrine of abuse of process such th a t these
          m atters would be susceptible to a judicial remedy. Such consideration
          would be on an in ter-p a rie s basis and after argum ent. The Attorney
          General considers th a t to be an additional reason for not intervening.

Subject:            Hillsborough chronology update

Attached are the latest actions and events updated to this morning.

Also attached is a copy of my letter to Hammond Suddards requesting their analysis of police generated
documents on CPS possession, for the purpose of voluntary disclosure by us. Their telephone response this
morning is that ACC Daines is now on leave until 4.1.99 as is the reviewing solicitor Peter Metcalfe. They are
therefore unable to assist us until some time after 4.1. They will contact us again early in the New Year.

You may feel that we are unable to make a fully informed disclosure decision for the HFSG until we have
established the status of the many police documents.

The only other documents held that are not subject to PI I or legal privilege are transcripts of evidence of various
judicial proceedings, and reports and judgements from those proceedings. I have ascertained that there is no
problem with Crown copyright re disclosure of any documents.

I will be in the office until 1600 today a nd am then on leave until my return on 5.1.99. However I can be
contacted at home on                       Answerphone) or on my mobile or

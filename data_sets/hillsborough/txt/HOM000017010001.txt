Dear Mr Patten

You wrote to Mr Moynihan on 16 May 1989
enclosing one from your constituent, Mrs
       I about the Hillsborough Stadium
Disaster. Miss Bannister, in her letter of 31
May 1989, mentioned that your letter and your
constituent's had been copied to me as the
Secretary to the Inquiry.

I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice
Taylor who has noted it.

                                Yours sincerely



                                (

      The Home Secretary has asked me to thank you for your letter
of 16 May with which you enclosed this one from your constituent,
Mrs              of                             Abingdon, about the disaster at
Hillsborough.   I have passed on copies of this correspondence to
Mr Robert Whalley, Secretary to the Inquiry set up under Lord
Justice Taylor to investigate the events at Hillsborough, in
order that the Inquiry team may take into account the points your
constituent makes.

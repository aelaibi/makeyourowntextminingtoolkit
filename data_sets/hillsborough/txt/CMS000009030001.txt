           Dear

           Thank you for your recent letter to Mr Moynihan
           which has been passed to this department in view of our
           responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act. I
           apologise for the delay in replying to you.

           Unfortunately I am unable to send you a copy of Lord Justice
           Taylor's Final Report on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster.
           However, it is available for Her Majesty's Stationery Office
           bookshops (code no ISBN 0 10 109622 4) at £10.50. Your
           nearest HMSO is at 9-21 Princess Street, Manchester, M60 8AS.
           I also enclose a copy of the recommendations and the
           Government's initial response to them.
           I hope this information is of use to you.

                                                                                   Yours sincerely




                                                                                   MR S BILBE
                                                                                   (Fire and Emergency
                                                                                   Planning Department)

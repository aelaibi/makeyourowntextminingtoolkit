supporters           entering              the      ground-           After         2pm       the     build         up    of     supporters

increased           dramatically                  and    by 2 . 3 0 p m        all       I could          se e      was    a mass           of

bodies     outside            pushing            and     shoving.              When         I first          got     to    the        turnstiU

and    opened        it     up     there          was- tw o        policemen             by m y        turnstile           outside               the

ground,        and    two        inside           the      ground.            After       2,30pm            I did        not        see    the

Police     officers              as      it w a s       absolutely             chocker              block.          After        2.30pm           it

was     such    a    crush          outside          the     ground           t hat      the        police       told      me        to     let       th:

supporters           in for           both        the      North      Stand,          and       the     West        Stand,           and     that

they     would       direct           t h e m as        they       c am e     t h r o u g h as         it was        impossible                  to

send     them       back.           The       situations             got      completely               out     of    hand           these        were

people      jumping           over         t he     turnstile             without           tickets.             What      tickets

people      had      I took           and      gave        them      p ar t     back.           The       situations                got

completely           out      of      hand        there      were         people          jumping           over     the        turnstile

without        tickets.               What        tickets           people        had       I took          and gave            them        there

part     b a c k.     I would              say       that      a   very       large         r,,,u.,er of         supporters                 got

in to    the    ground           without             tickets,          as     soon        as     the      police         caugnt            one

inside      another            at       lea s t      got    away,         into       th e      ground.           Some          of    them        were

coming       through           the         turnstile           in t w o ’s.              I was        unable        to     do       anything

 turnstiles.               People           were        getting        forced            into       the     turnstiles                and    they

 were     very       distressed                with      the       pushing          through           people        trying            to    get

 into     the       ground,           it      slowed       the      flow       of     supporters             who         had     tickets,

 with     those       who        did       not      have     them      trying            to     get    in.         T h e y w e r e n ’t

 policeman           told me             to    close        up.       I closed            up a n d        collected              my       tickets

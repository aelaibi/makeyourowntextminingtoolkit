                                                        Sheffield

                                                        16th April 1989.

Dear Sirs,

Before  I continue, may I firstly express my sorrow for the very many
supporters of Liverpool F.C. who lost their lives in a most awful      way
at  our  football   ground;  once  a   fine example of an extremely safe
ground. Of course my sympathy extends to the relatives of those     people
but  I never   feel   that  anyone   deserves more than those to whom an
incident happens.

The fault, why and wherefore of y e s t e r d a y ’s incident will no        doubt
come  out together with recommendations in the forthcoming weeks             after
the various inquests have been held. Perhaps this          is  not the       right
time  to bring these matters to your attention as certainly the              horse
has bolted.

I, as a shareholder and being one whom has supported the club in mind
if not    in body    over      the  last 25+ years feel I have to uphold the
integrity and reputation of our club including the stadium as         having
the   safest ground I have seen. It is incidental that I regularly used
to have a season t i c k e t ’s prime seat in the  North  Stand up   to  two
years   ago.  That   for      the  two seasons prior to then, having seen no
improvement in our play since our second division days, together with
the   increased  costs      incurred,   after  15 years I let my status as a
season ticket holder lapse.

When I firstly took out a season ticket, I used       go    on   the   Leppings
Lane  end   and in fact stood there for several years before I switched
to the Kop where most of my friends used to stand.          From    the Kop    I
moved  in   79-80 to the North Stand where I was under cover but I can
always remember my many years at the Leppings Lane end. Outside            there
it ALWAYS    has  been    a bottle   neck   on big match days where severe
congestion can and does take place. Even then when        inside,     we   young
boys in order to see would stand near the front near the wall. I think
that this could have been a danger area. Coupled with the           congestion,
is the constant pushing and jostling which takes place both inside and
outside and which perhaps now will be sorted out.        We    need   safe   and
isolated   areas for youngsters. Outside there is currently a very poor
system of queueing. There always has been. Older, enthusiastic teenage
supporters   just d o n ’t queue.  The   rough   necks,     mixing with these
supporters shove their way to the front      and   this coupled with         the


                                    Page   1
lateness of the supporters generally make it sheer havoc at that end.

Now no      one has said so, perhaps they know but are reluctant to admit
that y e s t e r d a y ’s episode was completely due     to whoever    let    in   the
melee   via       the big gates. The opening of the gates never could be an
answer. As anyone who has experience of the ground should know, to do
so can simply transfer any problem on crowding from outside the ground
to inside (not that they could            foresee  what     would  happen).    In my
opinion      it was        not   the  fault  of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. (on the
assumption that our employees know our ground) but that of the police.
They are supposed to be there to control the crowds, the one lesson to
be learnt from this is that the police C A N ’T control crowds             in    every
circumstance,           every   time!  If the police c a n ’t divert people all the
time, it is up to in this circumstance ourselves to do it. Now I d o n ’t
profess     to know all the ideal answers nor in fact to be a designer of
crowd shepherding systems but to me it seems that if possible we ought
to  shepherd the spectators in controlled pathways to various parts of
the ground. In the context of            Leppings  Lane,     perhaps  each    section
should have           its   own   entrance/exit.  That    could   at least stop the
stampede into one small area of the ground.

Ultimately the answer is for everyone to arrive early and probably           to
have     all seater stadiums as I believe they had at Middlesborough and
know they have in France. In France I have been on       several     occasions
with my       friend and   French Wednesdayite to see his local club Paris
S.G. I have been to semis, finals and internationals over there           where
we     sit and in England I can remember going to semis where we would be
in place on the Kop or in a stand at 1.45pm - 2.00pm to wait          for   the
Kick     Off.   Several of these semis were here at Hillsborough. There is
always a last minute rush even for our own home games and that is           the
danger     time. Even I ’m not a symbol of virtue everytime as in my youth
I can remember rushing into a clenched fist       behind   the   South    Stand
from a Manchester United supporter. That day I was late having been to
play badminton at Stocksbridge       Sports  Centre  before    the   game   and
becoming      caught up in the traffic on the way to the Kop. Whatever, no
one can put a price on safety and now safety is       a prime      factor.   If
they     really want    to   see a game, people will pay whatever it costs.
D o n ’t be afraid to increase prices. Alright some may stop coming         but
I ’m    sure the generated extra income should outweigh the lost support.
To keep the young and future supporters of the club, one or more           safe
and     subsidised   areas should be allotted for say under 1 4 ’s, whatever
is thought appropriate. Perhaps now a        feasibility   study    should be
started.

On this occasion one point which does hold a great deal of validity is
that „the tannoy system should have been u sed to control the crowd      and
to urge    people      to move.  I w a s n ’t at  the game but watched it on
Grandstand and only once heard the tannoy        used.  Excuses  were  given
that   we d a r e n ’t use  it as   crowd dispersal could have impeded the
emergency services. Nonesense! There was no reason for the crowd being
told at    that time that the game was to be abandoned. If they w e r e n ’t
told then no one could have been sure that the game would have         been.
No   supporter     of a club    is going to leave such a momentous fixture
without definite confirmation; your secretary had given that as a bad


                                       Page   2

I trust   that my opinions a r e n ’t totally wasted and trust you to make
the right decisions for the long term betterment of the Club.

Yours faithfully,




                                 Page   4
excuse      in answer to one question. To him I say be calm, collected and
d o n ’t put any feet where mouths should be or in fact put mouths   where
zips     should be. I can well see we could and probably will become the
defendants in a compensation claim for damages from relatives;      simply
say     the   television  pictures  and  speculative comments in the press
speak for themselves. It seems to me quite obvious whom was      to blame
for the trouble.

Whatever  comes     out  of  this weekends episode please, please try and
ensure we d o n ’t take criticism that i s n ’t due.   I have    more   than   a
sneaking  suspicion that the ramifications will be felt throughout the
British soccer world and we will find ourselves without a semifinal at
Hillsborough     for many   years  to  come.     That due to incompetence of
others, not ourselves. I have seen the te l e v i s i o n ’s diagrams   of   our
Leppings  Lane     end and to see them everything looks so clear cut and
obvious. Of course they are wrong. The diagrams d o n ’t show         the  true
picture  of the entrances etc and with nothing having been said to the
contrary, the whole country can understand how plainly that end was            a
deathtrap set and waiting.

I repeat I am sorrowful for those predominantly young people that died
at our home but the world  goes  on.  Sheffield Wednesday   is bigger
almost godlike in our eyes by comparison. Much bigger than one or more
of us. By the grace of god it will exist long after we  are  dead  and
hopefully  live  on  to the time of armageddon in one form or another.
Lessons should be learnt from this tragedy by everyone and have safety
drilled into the minds of ALL our supporters. Perhaps the supporters
of Liverpool have learnt, maybe football in general will but we must!

Lastly may    I say     that  your   excellent  judgement    in    obtaining
Mr Ron Atkinson     as our new manager was just like ’Manna from H e a v e n ’ .
He has a very good understanding of the game and has saved us for this
year   from  the    ignominy  of relegation. We cannot financially afford
ever to have relegation again at Hillsborough as I understand that          it
can   cost up to £250,000+ in one way or another. I suffered the defeat
as much as you in the 1966     Cup   Final,  supported   the  team   through
relegation   to Division     Two   then Three, nearly Four and enjoyed the
revival under Jack Charlton to Division Two. I was        shocked   when    he
left   the job incomplete but applauded your choice in Howard Wilkinson
when we gained promotion even though we should have been Champions. He
established   us once more as a run of the mill First Division team but
now   after Mr     Eustace,  the   club needs   that   inspirational   magic
Mr Atkinson h a s . I have read in the newspaper today that we could have
offered him a salary of £100,000 per year to stay with us.        Personally
I   feel  that IF he keeps us up, he should be easily given that amount
and made relatively "Au Fait" with all financial aspects of the        club.
In my    terms the manager is a Production/Managing Director of a club.
He should know all necessary figures re      costs   and  income   and with
projections should be able to budget for the years ahead. I for one am
already thinking of returning on a fairly regular basis       although    not
as before, and I believe that there are many more grown ups, who being
ex Wednesdayites would pour back to Hillsborough if a new          Liverpool
team emerged in Sheffield 6.

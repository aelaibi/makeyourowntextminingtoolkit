As     I got      to M i d d l e w o o d Road at the j u n ction wit h L e p pings Lane                         I could

see     that there was a large                 volume       of traffic     obviously             to do with           the

s t a t i o n a r y venicies.          1    could see that          there were        large        crowds      of

s u pporters        sat on walls and grass                  verges with         cans and bottles                of

beer,      but     I did not        see any disorderly behaviour,                     all       the fans       seemed

to be well          behaved and ge nerally              in good h u m o u r .         I could see             that a

number       of    people were         sitting       in their       vehicles       still,        with the        doors

open and they ware also                    drinking     from cans and            bottles.            As     1 passed

one     of the      cars     I could see a youth was                 fetching       beer        from the       boot     of

the vehicle and              I would say that there were at                      least 3-4 trays                of    cans

see     that      there was a large            queue    of football        supporters              outside       the

to tell         which football             supporters       they were,     they may even have                    been

mixed.          I would estimate             that    it was    probably about            1340 hours at                this

closer to Leppings Lane                     I was aware       that    there were         large         crowds

m a k ing to wa r ds t he ground.               I co u 1d n *t a ct u a 11y see t he en t ra nee                     gates
                                                                                                                             P AG E    :
                                                                                                                             S39 OS

              and t u r n s t i l e s as       I passed         the   top of the        road,      but as Ilooked        down

              towa r d s      the     ground     I could        see   that    the    crowd       had              led out of

              the      gro u n d and onto         the    road o b v i o u s l y w a i t i n g    to enter       for    the

              match.          I was     surprised        that    there were         this m a n y fans          still    waiting

              to get        inside,         it was    obviously       the fact       that       they had a r r i v e d       late.

              A    lot still          seemed    to have        cans wit h them         even at         this    late    stage.

              I carried          on,    on my     route     towards      town a n d      1 argained passed             the top of

              Leppings         Lane at a b o u t        1510 hours.          A number       of^-bi'tfer pool      s upporters

              boarded         the     bus    on M i d d l e w o o d Roa d to head towards               town,    they looked

              d i s t r e s s e d and       told me     that    they had      not    got    into       the    ground    but there

              had      been    problems        inside     and    people were         dead and          injured.        I dropped

              these youths             in the     centre        so they      could    catch a train home.

              On the        day of the         disaster         I. recall    that     the w e a t h e r was good,             it was

              a war m sunny            day.

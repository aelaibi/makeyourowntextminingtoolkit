                  Sheffield


                  Dear Superintendent Chidley,
                  Hillsborough Disaster
                  I am delivering with this letter four ring binders.   Two of
                  the ring binders contain original signed statements, one
                  contains transcripts from the tape kept at SYMAS Control, of
                  the radio and telephone conversations between 3.00 p.m. and
                  4.40 p.m. on Saturday 15th April. The last bundle contains a
                  variety of documents. I should be grateful if you could sign
                  a copy of this letter and copies of the indices to the
                  bundles to acknowledge receipt.
                  As far as the statements are concerned. There are a few more
                  from Trent RHA and SYMAS which are awaiting signature and I
                  shall deliver these to you as soon as possible. We are also
                  obtaining short statements from personnel involved from other
                  ambulance authorities which I shall give you when they are
                  available.
                  We have not had the opportunity to double check the
                  transcripts against the tapes.   If, having listened to the
                  tapes and read the transcripts there are any necessary
                  amendments please let me know and I shall arrange for this to
                  be done.   The transcripts are on our word processors and
                  there seems little point in you having these freshly typed.
                  When delivering the documents to you I shall go through the
                  contents of the fourth bundle fairly quickly in order to
                  explain what the documents are, and what their relevance is.
                  If, having read the statements, there are any points which
                  you or the Treasury Solicitors wish to raise with the makers
                  of the statements could you please contact us. We can either

Continuation


Date   9 May 1989


       put any relevant points on your behalf, or if you do want to
       see any of the makers of the statements arrangements should
       be made through me and I would wish either one of my
       colleagues, or one of the SYMAS officers to be present.
       Obviously I would prefer that witnesses should not be
       interviewed again if that is possible.
       Finally, I should be grateful for an early indication of
       which witnesses the Treasury Solicitors would wish to call,
       and when it is likely that they will be asked to give
       evidence. Having said that, however, Trent RHA and SYMAS are
       to make a further application for leave to be granted
       representation before the Inquiry and if representation is
       granted I am uncertain as to who will take the decision as to
       which witnesses to call.
       Yours sincerely,




       A. J. CALLAGHAN

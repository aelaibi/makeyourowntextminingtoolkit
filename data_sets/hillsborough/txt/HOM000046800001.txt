Thank you for your letter of 30 August, in which you asked for a meeting with Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will be in Liverpool early in October. We have arranged for you
to have a personal discussion with him in the Boardroom on the 3rd floor of the Merseyside
Maritime Museum, Albert Dock, Liverpool, between 3.45 and 4.15 pm on Tuesday 7
October. Because Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s time is inevitably limited, I am afraid that it
may not be possible for us to reschedule this appointment.

You may wish to be accompanied by other people, including the Aspinalls and the Steeles
with whom you recently wrote a joint letter to the Judge, and/or a legal representative. That
is of course perfectly acceptable, although we would prefer it if you did not - aside from Mrs
Aspinall and Mr and Mrs Steele - bring any more than three other people with you. You
should have this letter with you when you come.

We have arranged for stenographers to take a verbatim record of your discussion with the
Judge.

This appointment for October 7 is as well as your invitation, and the Aspinalls’ and Steeles’
invitations, to the session in the Lecture Theatre at the Museum the previous morning.
Please write to the address above, or telephone Mike Ward on 0171 273 3612, to let us know
whether you will be able to come.

I have taken the liberty of sending a copy of this letter to the Aspinall and Steele families.

We look forward to meeting you.

Thank you for your letter, which we received recently via the Hillsborough Family Support
Group, asking for a meeting with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will be in Liverpool early in October. We have arranged for you
to have a personal discussion with him in the Boardroom on the 3rd floor o f the Merseyside
Maritime Museum, Albert Dock, Liverpool, between 10.15 and 10.45 am on Wednesday 8
October. I hope this is convenient. Because Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s time is inevitably
limited, I am afraid that it may not be possible for us to reschedule your appointment.

You may wish to be accompanied by other people, including your legal representative. That
is o f course perfectly acceptable, although we would prefer it if you did not bring any more
than four other people with you. You should have this letter with you when you come.

We have arranged for stenographers to take a verbatim record o f your discussion with the
Judge.

This appointment for October 8 is as well as your invitation to the session in the Lecture
Theatre at the Museum on Monday the 6th. Please write to the address above, or telephone
Mike Ward on 0171 273 3612, to let us know whether you will be able to come.

We look forward to meeting you.

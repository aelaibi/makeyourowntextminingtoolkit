When      I entered               the    ground        it w a s        very          quiet       i nside,        and       I walked         with

When      I found my               seat,       I decided              to    have a walk                 around        to     see    if     I knew

anyone      and        to     p as s     some       time     before             the    kick        off.        At     t his    time        the

qround was             very        empty.           The N ot t in g h a m             Forest          end a pp e a r e d       to    be

to me.

1 then went              for       a walk       with                        and       had a        chat       with      some       stewards

At about          1.4C$tm                       ind     I went             t«    the    front           of    the     seating        area         and

nearly       full        to       capacity                  people          were       able        to m o v e        around        in them.

I saw      some        pushing                  jostling              at    the       front        of    the        p e n s , but    t his

j us t    appeared            to    be    the       normal        sort          of a c t i v i t y       with        people        trying         to

get a      good        position.               The     side       pens          at    t his      time        were      empty,       there         may

have      b e e n 5 or 6            people          in t h e m        but       not    more.

I then walked                 back       up    the     stand          and       spoke       to     some       stewards         and

movement.              It a p p e a r e d          to me          t h a t as m o r e      people           came      into      the       back       of

the       pen,    the     crowd          just          moved       forward and            they       filled          the      pens       even

thought          that     there          was       a    bad       crush and         that       people         would        filter         across

to    th e    side       pens       which were                 still      comparatively                  emp t y .       I only          looked

at    the     terraces             for    a     few minutes               before         I returned             to m y        seat       because

I sat        in my       s eat a n d          I saw          that     the w h o l e       ground          was      beginning             to    fill

up.        From     my    seat          I had a very                limited         view       of    the     West        Stand

about        2.55pm       there          was       a    sudden        influx        of    supporters               into       the W e s t

of    people        in the          stand .

The       game    kicked           off at          about          3.00pm      and     I then         concentrated                on      the

match,        w hi c h was          difficult                to    see    because         of    th e      number         of    people          in

the       stand.         At    about          3.05pm          Peter       Beardsley            hit       the N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t

cross        bar.        After          thi s      had       happened         I noticed             about       a half         a dozen

lads       climbing           on    the       fence          at    the    front y e t       the      terraced area                  trying          to

get       on the       pitch.            My     initial            t h o u g h t {ias t h a t        a    pitch       invasion was

taking        place.

I then        saw a       lad       trying             to    climb       from    pen 4         into       pen 5 at            the     side.

As    he w a s      doing          so    I saw a u ni formed                    police         officer,            who     was      wearing

            Shortly          after       thi^had              happened         I began           to       hear    shouting           and
                                               //
            screaming             from    the       terraces            and    there was              a    deluge        of    people       trying          to

            climb       the       fe nce.          They were            flooding          onto        the    pitch and              it w a s     at    t h is

            point       that       I realised              that        something          was     obviously              very wrong.

            At    this       p o in t    the       game       was      stopped.           I looked           at     the       pitch,       but    my

            view was          obscured             by     th e     people      standing           in f r o n t          of me a n d        because          I

            was    some       distance             from       the      pitch,       I was,        however,              able    to    see       that    the

            pitch was             packed with              people           around       the     area       of    the        goal.        I saw       that-

            some     people         were       lying          on    the      floor ,      but     I thought              they       had    fainted.

            At    about       3.20pm          some       Police         Officers          ca me       onto       th e    pitch and          formed a

            line     across         the       pitch        near        to    the    half       way        line.         By    now    I could

            S-'fee t h a t    some       people          on      the    pitch w^re             being        given mouth              to m o u t h      and

            fans     were         ripping          down       hoardings Jta              make     stretchers.                  I d o n ’t k n o w w h y

        J   but    the P o l i c e        j ust         seemed         to y 4 t c h      from     the       half        way    line,       they

            w e r e n ’t h e l p i n g        to    get       peo pi sr out         of    the     terraces.                  People       were

C   O       e v e r y w h e r e , I c a n ’ t real l y y u e s c r i b e                 any     indi v i d u a l s w h o           were    on    the

            pitc h .         I also       noticed             the p r e s s p h o t o g r a p h e r s w h o w e r e v e r y b u s y

            taking       photographs,                   b u t / d i d n ’t a p p e a r      to    be       helping           in a n y way.

            There       was       nothing          I could          do,      being       in the           stand,        so                 and    I

            decided          to    l e a ve    the       ground.            We w a l k e d       down       the     stairs          and    went       out

            of    the    rear       gate       into        Leppings.               There       were        crowds        of    people       standing

            around       and       leaving          the       ground.          I f elt         completely               numbed and          just

            walked       back       to    the       car.           We w a i t e d at        the       car    for        some    time       to    check

            if    people          who    we    knew        and      who     were      parked          near       us w e r e     alright.          At

            about       5 . 0 0 p m we        left S h e f f i e l d .

            On    the    day       of    the m a t c h           I was      wearing         blue          jeans,        and a       red

            sweatshirt.                 I would          describe           myself        as     a white          male,        I am 39          years

            old    but       I look       as       if    I am       in m y     late 2 0 ’s.                I have        black       hair       which       i<

               greying      and   is    collar     lengt h.      I have a      black      moustache   and    am    of

               medium      bu ild.      I am about                     tall.

               In m y   opinion        I feel    that     if the P o l i c i n g   outside    the   ground       had    been

               organised      better,       then    the    problems      inside     the    ground   would    never       have

               arisen.

               I am     prepared       to a t t e n d at a n y   enquiry     if    I am    required   to    do    so.

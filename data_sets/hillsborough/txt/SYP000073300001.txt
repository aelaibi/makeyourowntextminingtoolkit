           only     recall        seeing about 6 more Police                      (unmounted).            We    passed through

           the    turnstile at 2,.35 pm                (1435 hrs)           but    I can only surmise               that    the

           s it u a t i o n at     (A)    by 2.45      pm    (1445 hrs)           must    have    been extremely

           serious.          It    is my judgment            that       the P o l i c e m e n who    decided        to open the

           gates adjacent            to these         turnstiles           had no option.            If he had not           I

           consider       there      could have         been     loss       of    life    in this area.

       A R R I V A L AT P O S I T I O N    <E).



We a r r i v e d at      this s t a n ding        position at 2.40          pm   (1440 hrs)         to find

that    this      sector was       only about          half    full.       However      on looking across

at the standing a rea d i r e ctly behind the L e p pings Ln goal                                 several

factors       were     immediately obvious :



The    two    caged areas         behind         the goal     looked danger o u s l y         compressed a nd

p rompted me to actual l^y^r^'mark to people ar o u n d                          that    I   did not      like

the    look     of the s i t uation at             position     (G).



If    I could see the           potential          d a n g e r , why was    it not obvious           to the

s tewards and Police.



Compared        to    position      <G) areas         (E) and     (H - corner        flag areas          of the

terrace)        were     only half         full.



4.     S C H E D U L E D KICK-OFF         TIME    (3.00 PM)     (1500 HRS).



By this       time     it was     easy to         recognise     that a desperate              si t u a t i o n was

devel o p i n g      in areas     <G>.       Numerous       arms were       being waved          by those

spectators           to attract      the a t t e n t i o n of the Police Officers who were

patrolling along             the track           behind the goals.           These      pleas     brought        no

.immediate        response      froiri’ the Police,
                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                            Si 755

By 3.02      pm    ("1502 hrs)      several     people       (10       20)        were atte m p t i n g     to

climb over         the    perimeter    fence      to escape         from the          compressed

ter r a c i n q . For     several    minutes      these      people were            being    restrained           by

the    p o l i ce from gaining access             to the ground side                  of the    fence.           In

fact    the Police were a c t u a l l y         pushipg       people         back     into the       terracing.



Why were         the Police,       broug+tT    in s p e c i f i c a l l y    to    control     the    crowds          and

ensure     collective        safety,       unable    to tell        the difference             between a

hooligan,         and a person trying           to make a desperate                   climb to save             his/

h e r 1 if e .



I found      it hard to believe what                I was     seeing.



P r e cious minutes were            lost    before     the    police        finally       realised that

there was a critical               1 ife-death struggle             in that          terrace.



I cannot         understand why the ground               security           cameras,      nominally

i n stalled to monitor             crowd behaviour,           were     not able          to detect         this

crisis?      perhaps       their    pictures were          just     ignored.



       REC 0 G N 1 7 10N 0 F A CR I S I S     (3.06 P M )(1506 H R S ) „



Once    it was      realised there was a real                 crisis         in the a r e a . D e h i n d       the

goal    Police asked         the    referee     to stop the           game and then began                  to

extricate         spectators.        Ho wever     they were also              severely h a n d i c a p p e d by

the    perimeter         fence and fay the        narrowness          of the         emergency       exit       gate

to the     pitch.        Then the Police          in that area,             with Saint Johns

Ambulance,         stewards,       ball-boys,       and unhurt          spectators,          all     dia    Ineir

best    to help the         injured.

However       it was     difficult        to u nderstand why the                  public address           system

was    not    used to better           effect.           For    example,        if the N o t t i n g h a m Forest

fans    had been a d v i s e d of the            serious         neature        of the     crushing,       surely

there would          have     been no need of a n a p p r o x "15 Q - strong                      c o n t i n g e n cy of

6.     SOME KEY Q U E S T I O N S



Why was       the    sudden     rush of Liverpool                fans at about 2.30 pm                 {1430 hrs)

not directed          towards      the    corner     flag areas            of    that     terracing.



why was       there     no s u p e r v i s i o n of the         incoming        fans at the        entrance        <D)

to the       tunnel     to re direct          them to the          less     crowded        corner areas.



Why were       there     no    large     posters a t t a c h e d        to the      back of the Leppings

Ln stand advising              fans    how to get          to the       various      standing areas.



Why were       there     no officials          in my standing area                  (E)«       If there      had

been they would have               seen the developing                  crisis.

of the serious           s i tuation w ould have                precluded the           ridiculous        need for

150    police across           the halfway        line.



Why was       the Leppings Ln tunnel                entrance           constr u c t e d    in such a way that

it gave       no provision for a l t e r n a t i v e             routes     once a fan was             committed

                    case    of emergency.            How was         it ever        passed as safe            in the   first      place.



                    what    took     the Police and officials so                       long to recognise            the gravity             of

                    the    situation.           I have     since heard that               conditions were           bad   in the

                    area    behind    the goals as             early as 2.15             pm     (1415 hrs)



                    Do the approp r i a t e a u t h o r i t i e s           realise      that     if it takes 5 seconds                for

                    this    rate     fans would have              to begin entry at               1.20 prn (1320 hrs)            at a

                    constant       rate to be all            inside         for the      kick-off



                    More    to the    point,       only 2520 fans would                    be able       theoretically       gain

                    entry    in the 2.30 - 3.0 0               pm    (1430 -- 1500 hrs)             period.        T h erefore     there

                    In my opinion there was a complete                            lack of o r g a n i s a t i o n at      this    game.

                    Since    I understand          1100      police were            involved       in controlling          this

                    event,     one has      to ask where were                  they all         deployed and how many were

                    really familiar             with Hi 1 Isbo rough.

W hilst at that           lp-tation I noticed that                    the     football       fans w ere     in good

humour and ws'fl behaved a l t h o u g h a good number                              of them were          carrying

beer were drinking               from them.            T hese     fans were         not d isplaying         the

usual     signs        of drunkeness.            As    the    time got         n earer 3pm       (1500?     the

to a vo i d     conge s t i o n we      returned to H a l i f a x Rd.                 Our transit         became

stationary            in heavy traffic           in Hali f a x Rd below the                  railway bridge.

E m e r g e n c y vehicles       heading       towards        the ground were             having     difficulty

in negoti a t i n g       the    build up of heavy traffic.                         In an effort          to make a

clear     passage        for    those     vehicles          officers        from our      serial     d i reeled

traffic and a short                time    later       this     conge s t i o n was       eased to such an

extent      that we were           no   longer        required to direct               it.

Our    serial         then/went     d i r e c t l y to the ground              (the entrance         near/Co           the

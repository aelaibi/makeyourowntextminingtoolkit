I refer to various conversations between our offices in connection with the forthcoming
m eeting on Wednesday 4th April at 3.15 pm between the Home Secretary and representatives of
T he Football Association and The Football League.

As requested in your letter of the 27th February, I -list below those attending from our two
organisations:

The Football Association:                        M r F A Millichip                                        Chairman
                                                 M r R H G Kelly                                          Chief Executive
                                                 Mr A R Titeombe                                          Head of Competitions and Regulations
T he Football League:                            M r W Fox                                                President
                                                 M r A Sandford                                           Chief Executive
                                                 M r J D D ent                                            Secretary

A lthough we would anticipate a fairly broad based discussion wc would suggest the following
topics for your consideration:

a)           T he implementation and constitution of the Football Licensing Authority.

b)           T h e implementation of Lord Justice Taylor’s recommendations for all-seater stadia.

c)           T he implementation of recom m ended Public O rder offences relating to obscene/racist
             chanting, trespass on the field of play and the throwing of missiles. In addition, the
             use of electronic tagging and action against ticket toms.

d)           Financial provisions.

e)           Planning permission both for refurbishment and relocation of stadia.

f)          T he possibility of an inter-departm ental working group.

1 trust this will be of some assistance to you.

TAYLOR INQUIRY: THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION AND FOOTBALL LEAGUE


Further to Ms Dent's letter of 27 February to the Chairman of
the Football Association, this is to confirm that I have now
arranged for Mr Millichip and his colleagues along with
representatives of the Football League to meet the
Home Secretary at 3.15 pm on Wednesday 4 April. Mr Moynihan
also hopes to attend the meeting.

2.    I should therefore be grateful if you could provide
briefing, in the form of points to make, to reach this office
by close of play on 3 April. You also kindly agreed to attend
the meeting.

LETTER DRAFTED FOR SIGNATURE BY Private Secretary to the Home Secretary
                                    (NAME OF SIGNATORY)



                 The Home Secretary has asked me to. thank you for your

                 letter of 19 February.               He has noted that you consider

                 some     of    Lord    Justice        Taylor's     strictures             to     be

                 unfounded but he is pleased that the Association has

                 responded       so    positively        to    other   aspects         of        the

                 report.



                 The     Home    Secretary        will    be    very      happy       to        meet

                 representatives of the Association and of the Football

                 League    and    I will     be       contacting    you     separately            to

                 arrange a date and time for the meeting.                         It will be

                 helpful if before the meeting you could let me have a

                 note    of the matters which you particularly want                               to

                 raise    together      with      a    list    of   those      who    will        be

                 attending        and      their         positions        in         the         two

                 organisations.

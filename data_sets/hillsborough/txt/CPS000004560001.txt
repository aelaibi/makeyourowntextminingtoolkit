      Dear Chief Superintendent Foster

      Hillsborough

      Following receipt of your letter of 21 May 1990 I have now
      received Counsel's advice on the points which were raised by
      the Solicitors representing interested parties in the civil
      proceedings.

     I enclose a copy of the advice which has been received and
     which I have already faxed to you and discussed briefly on the
     telephone.

      If there are any matters which arise please do not hesitate to
      contact me.

      Yours sincerely




      M G Kennedy

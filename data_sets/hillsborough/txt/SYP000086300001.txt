On arrival               I examined               the a r e a a n d           identified              t h at      there       were       several

One      of     these was              the    R o y a l 'Hotel , w h i c h               is    situated            on Bradwa^. R o a d,

premises            drinking            beer.           As a       resblt       of       this        1 deployed              two     of m y

eye      on the          s i t u a t i o n at       the R o y a l         Hotel.

I remained               at    this       location            for m o s t       of        the       t i m e as    I had        the      only

radio         for     the      serial.

1.1 w a s       obvious          that        there       was       g o i ng    to    be a       problem with                  supporters                at

t h is     location and                 I informed             ground          control          of      the       numbers          on    the

•footpath a n d               t ha t    there       may       be    problems             later.

As    the       morning          progressed,              t"he n u m b e r s         both       inside           and     outside             the

Royal         Hotel       increased               and    1 kept          gVmjmd          control          aware         of    this.

At    approximately                    12.30       pm t h e r e w e r e         scmte         10S     people        stood          outside             the

Royal         Hotel       and       inside         there       were a          large          mtjnba? r of         people.              By       this

time       they were             becoming           more       and more             boisterous               and    there          was       a    great

deal       of      singing          and      chanting          coming          from       inside          the      pub.

At    about         this       t i me     I noticed            that      many        of       the     people were              drinking                the

extra         strength           larger           from    bottles             and were          in f a c t         buying          it    by       the

estate          car      pull       up at         the    side       of    these           p r e m i s e s ner to         the       rear           gate.

 The       driver         got       out      of    the    vehicle             and    started            to     unload         something

■from the           rear.           Several         of    the       people          who       were      drinking             outside             the

premises            went       up      the    car       and    came      away        carrying             cans      of       lager.

I went          over      to     the      car a n d       saw       t h at     the       man    had a            large       number          of

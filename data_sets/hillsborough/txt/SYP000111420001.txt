             On Saturday,            15th April       1989,     I c o m menced duty at A r m t h o r p e at

             8 . 1 5 am and then to D o nca ster DUG for 8 .45 am.                            We were   then

             transported          to H i l l sborou gh,        where a briefing was             carried out.               I was

             on serial         No.     3, w ith PS 2 627 A s h t o n       in charge.          Our   duty was       foot

             patrol       around the         roundabout at the            j u n ction of P e n istone Road,

             L e p p i n g s Lane and Herriss Road,,                 At this     location we were            to    prevent

             any trouble          between         rival    fans.

             A fter     briefing we had a packed meal                     at the    ground and then at about

             11.00 am took             up our      position as directed.              I was a c t u a l l y situated

             at the j u n ction of Pen i s t o n e R o a d and Herries R o a d »                     At this       location

             coaches        carrying Notts.           Forest       fans were     discharging         their    passengers

             on the Herries Road Bus Garage.                         Coaches     carrying Liverpool               fans were

             travelling         down P e n i s t o n e Road from the M »1 around the                    roundabout              back

             onto Pen i s t o n e Roa d and onto C l a y w h e e l s Lane where                  they disch a r g e d

             their      passengers.           T h e y were then to walk            down Leppings Lane             to enter

             the ground.

             E v e n at     11.00 am there was a steady                   stream of fans a r r iving              by coach

             and      private     cars.       While       the m a j o r i t y seemed to be making            their way

             d i r e c t l y down L e p p i n g s    Lane .to the ground.             It was also        noticeable

             that a.l arge           number       of Liverpool       fans were      hanging ar o u n d the area,
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     R 71

especially         in front       of the garage at the beginning                 of L e p pings Lane.

There    did not appear            to be any trouble among                the fans or between the

different         factions.        The m a j o ri ty of s u pporters         I saw were      the

L i v erpool      fans walking          down from P e n i s t o n e Road      A l t h o u g h they were

boisterous         there     did not appear         to be any trouble          from them.           It, was

n oti c e d though that a large number                  that, were just sitting ar o u n d or

walking about- were all                 in p ossession of       cans of beer and that               those

arriving       in the      time    leading      up to kick      off were hastily trying               to

f inish their         cans      before they      reached the ground.

One    incident      that was       reported to an officer                in our vicinity was a

young    lad reporting a theft.                  A p p a r e n t l y he had a r r i v e d without a

ticket,       he was      offered one for          sale but when he handed over the

money,     the seller           ran off with both ticket            and money.         This young          lad

was    taken to the Police Room wit h i n the ground to make a complaint.

A cc ording       to officers who a t t e n d e d the         semi-final        last year,      they

e x p ected the m a j or it y of the            crowd to be in the ground just after

.2.00 pm.         Last    year    evide ntly     the streets were           empty after 2.15          pm

But    this    did not appear            to happen this year.              A l t hough the    coaches

seemed to stop a r r i v i n g after about H. 00 pm.                      It, was noti c e d that

betw e e n about 2.1 5           pm and 2 . 3 0 . pm large      numbers of Liverpool

supporte rs        star t e d    coming     down P e n i s t o n e Road    in droves.        We did not

k now where        they were       coining from but were walking                down   in their

hundreds       it seemed.          This     seemed to     carry on until about 2.5 0                pm.

There a p p ea re d to be no trouble                from them,      but there was         plenty of

shouting and singing.

It was also         during       this time that all          traffic was        stopped      from

entering L e p p i n g s        Lane,    I a ss u m e d this was due to the number              of

suppo r t e r s    on the       road.     It was also      noticed that even up to about

2.45    pm private         cars with Liverpool            supporters were still              arriving

and expecting            to find    parking      places    near    the ground.         It was       seen

that a m a j o r i t y of the occupants were                    drinking       from cans    of beer        or

lager„

One    incident       that    happened was a private                  hire    car dropping    off 4

L iverpool     s upporters at the                  roundabout.        It was    obvious    they had all

been drinking and one of the m had to be s u pported by his friends.                                            He

seemed     incapable         of walking            on his own.        The y were all      spoken to and

advised     re offences           of trying          to enter    the ground drunk.           Later        that

a f t e r n o o n after    the tradedy occurred,                I again saw the one          that     had to

be assisted,,         in the ground,               near the gym/ he was          being helped       to an

a m bulance with what a p p e a re d to be a leg                      injury.     He had o b viously

got    into the ground.

At about 2 .45         pm it was obvious                  from message we heard on the              radio

that there was            problems at the L e p pings Lane                   end of the ground.            The

m e s s a g e s were excited and eve rybody was                   speaking at once,          but     it

s eemed there was            d if f i c u l t y    in the    crowd entering       the ground at this

location       E v e n at this time there were                   still       large numbers     of

Liverpool       s upporters walking                 down towards       the Leppings Lane

turnstiles.           It was      during          this    period that we heard on the           radio

repeated      requests        for the        gates        to be opened at the L e p pings Lane

end,    but we were          not aware            for what    reason.

At 3.00     pm our        serial      was    planned        to walk    down Leppings Lane and

there    join a Force C oa c h for standby duty before a meal.                                In view of

the    radio message,           we made           our way straight awa y at 3.00            pm to the

L ep p i n g s Lane    turnstiles.                While    enroute,    I heard a message        on the

radio    r equesting         serials        that were m e a l i n g at, Clay w h e e l s    to go

i mm e d i a t e l y to L e p p i n g s Lane        end as    there was fighting          taking     place.

On arrival       at, the L e p pings Lane                 turnstiles    there was       only a small

number     of suppo r t e r s aro u n d the entrance.                   Our    serial   wa i t e d with

other    serials at this              location for           further    instructions.         At this

point we were          not sure what was                  happening.

A short      time    later,     only a matter          of minutes,      a South Yo r k s h i r e

a m bu l a n c e a rr iv ed at the Leppings Lane               end.     It was d i r ected      into the

ground.       When     it was       inside    1 saw one       person being a s s i s t e d to      it

wi t h a leg     injury.        It was at this           time that a stream of

s upporters      started       to    leave the ground at this             location.        They were all

saying    that      it was     bedlam       in there,     that     the game had been stopped

and   people were        injured.           We still     did not      know what    had happened,

but   then we were           ordered       into the Lepping Lanes terracing and onto

the   pitch,     but    I must admit          I did not know for what             purpose.

W h e n we went      into     the    ground behind the West Stand,                there was a

steady stream of             people    leaving.        At the      back of the stand there was

a small      number     of    people stood and           laid about.       Some    o b viously     in

distress      but some        laid on the ground quite                still.    I along wit h other

officers      made my wa y through the                crowd    in the West S t a n d and onto the

pitch behind         the g o a l .     While    going      through the      crowd,     a large amount

of verbal      abuse was        being       d i r ected at us.

As soon as       I got onto          the    pitch,    1' could not believe what            I saw.

There was      large     sections          of the    crowd milling about and about               twenty

people    laid on the          ground.        At this      stage    I saw a number       of Police

Officers      giving     mouth to mouth             r es us ci t a t i o n to people   laid out on

the   ground.        It was     obvious at this           stage that a large           number    of

people had been          injured.

I immed iately a ss i s t e d with some               of the     injured but      it was      obvious

that a large         number     of people       laid out were          dead.    One    person    I went

to assist was          blue    in the face and his m outh was stuck wide                       open.            It

was also at this             time    that    1 felt a huge hatred from a large                  number

of the L i ve rp oo l        s upporters      t o w a r d s .the Police and the        club

stewards.        T here was also a g g r e s s i o n towards Notts.               Forest      fans at the

far   end,    and a number           of supporters        tried to race to the far              end to

confront      them.
                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                   R7-1

At this     time there was            utter      c o n fusion   in the area between the goal

a nd the     terracing,        people wre         spilling      out and      could not- help

tripping      oyer     people    laid out on the            grass.         It was then that       the      v

first member          of the Fire Service             a r r i v e d with     resuscitation

equipment.           I direc t e d one of them to a person w ith b r e athing

difficulties.
It was obvious          that    the    casualties w o u l d have to be m oved              from this

location,      a l t h o u g h a large number were              dead,      but there was     no

di r e c t i o n as to where         to take them.          There    did not appear        to be any

rank above S e r g e a n t      on the      pitch and the          club stewards        had no    idea

where    to take them.           I was aware          the first aid           room was at the other

end of t-he ground near the gym and                      by this     time s upporters and          police

officers were          carrying       casualties        on mak e s h i f t    stretchers   in that

direction.           I a s si st ed with the         carrying      of one      person on a m a keshift

s tretche r    to the        gym area.        It was     obvious      on arrival     at, the gym that

he was      dead.

O n arrival at         the    gym area      I stayed       there a s s isting with         casualties

that were      still     alive.        A number were            placed     in the gym    itself,     but

some    had also       been brought and just               left    lying on the      ground around

the gym.       One young        boy aged about           12 years        had been   left    lying on

his    back and had diff i c u l t y breathing.                   I a s s i s t e d him and directed

an amb u l a n c e    team to him.

I have      to state     that    even at this           stage and this          location and with a

number      of higher        ranks    in the area        nobody seemed to be organising                  the
                                                                               '                           !
injured.

By this      time a large        number       of a m b u l a n c e s were a r r i v i n g at the ground

and the      injured were        being      loaded on.           I travelled wit h one ambulance

to the H a l l am sh ir e      to assist wit h a badly              injured      person.     On my

return to the ground,                all   the    injured       had been removed        to hospital

a n d the    dead to t-he gym.

            I mu.st state         that      I was s u r prised    how many of the Liverpool                      fans

            a r r i v e d so   late     for the match.         It was      obvious         that      there was     no way

            they w ould all           get    into the ground        before       3 - D O   p m   -    I w o u l d never

            dream turning          up so      late for a game wit h an obvious                        capacity ground.

            It was also          obvious      that a large       number      of those arriving                after 2„00 pm

            had been drinking.                You   could see the Liverpool                  supporters walking

            down trying          to drink       from their     cans as quickly as                    possible    so they

            w ere     not    c o n f i s c a t e d at the ground.     I    remember when we                  finally     left

            Clayw h e e l s    that     evening,     looking     up Pen i s t o n e Road towards Wadsley.

            B r i d g e an d seeing- the walls            covered w i t h empty            cans and bottles             that

            had been left.

            I w ould also state that a l t h o u g h myself and other officers                                  received a

            torrent         of verbal abuse and threats              from a large number                     of Liverpool

            suppo r t e r s w h i l e    on the     pitch,'I     never     saw any actual               violence

            offered to the Police.                  Later while      in the area aro u n d                the gym,       I saw

            a Liverpool          s u p porter    go up to two       club stewards and spit                     in their

            faces and t h r e a t e n them.           'This person was           then forcibly               ejected     from

            the ground by myself and another                     Police Officer.

            I have a t t e n d e d a number          of   large matc h e s at H i l l s b o r o u g h and have

            b een on duty at            various     locations     inside and outside                   the    ground.

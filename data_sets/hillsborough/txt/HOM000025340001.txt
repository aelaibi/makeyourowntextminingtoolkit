Dear Mr Walker

Thank you for your letter of 30 November to Mr Whalley in which
you ask about the membership of the technical working group
established by Lord Justice Taylor to examine a range of issues
associated with ground safety. The working group, chaired by
Professor L Maunder OBE (one of the two Assessors to the
Hillsborough Inquiry), has the following terms of reference:

     "To review technical aspects of the Guide to Safety at
     Sports Grounds;   identify areas needing clarification
     or amendment;   and recommend accordingly".

The following additional members make up the group:-

     M G T Dickson Esq BA MS CEng MIStructE
     Buro Happold - on behalf of the Institution of Structural
     Engineers.

     L N Bush Esq FRICS CEng MIStructE FIAS
     City Building Surveyor, City of Liverpool.

     Dr C E Nicholson PhD CEng MIM
     Deputy Director, Research & Laboratory Services Division,
     Health and Safety Executive.

    B A Stickley Esq CEng FIStructE
    Directorate of Works, Home Office.

    W H Carter Esq
    George Corderoy & Co, Quantity Surveyors - on behalf of the
    Football Association.

    J Sweet Esq (Secretary)
In its meetings to date, members have concentrated on examination
of such issues as perimeter fencing, ingress and egress, and all-
seater stadia.  It is not the intention of the working group to
engage in wholesale re-drafting of the Green Guide, although in
its own report to the Inquiry, it may recommend such a course.
The working group is, of course, aware of the references to
communications in Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report, and in
particular, of interim recommendations 31-34 which deal
specifically with that topic.

                                        Yours sincerely




                                        J C SWEET

 Dear Mr Whalley,

 Thank you for your letter of 10th November.

 I was not aware that Lord Justice Taylor had established a technical working
 group and, if it possible, would appreciate being advised of its composition
 being particularly concerned that the expertise of the technological industries
 may be adequately represented.

 Yours sincerely,




 Ken Walker MBE.,
 Chief Executive.

•        'D i e s       Mr

    HILLSBOROUGH


    We spoke about the attached letter which I have had from Ann Adlington, solicitor to the
    Family Support Group.

    2.     She asks in her first paragraph about the report on Hillsborough by Mr Phillips. She
    suggests that we supply the Group with a copy of that report, of which it seems the families
    were previously unaware.

    3.      You said you would be writing to me about the origin of this report. It was, I think
    you said, commissioned by Mr Wright as chief officer of South Yorkshire in anticipation of
    civil actions against the force. My initial view, having briefly read the parts you sent (I do
    not have pages 9 to 149) is that it is unlikely to contain any ‘new’ evidence about the disaster.
    We would like to see the parts we have not yet had, but I doubt whether they will prove to be
    of much interest in Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny.

    4.     But I think it would be helpful to meet Ms Adlington’s request. Do South Yorkshire
    have any objection to the Group having a copy of the report (in full)? If not, I think it would
    be more sensible for you to send it to her yourselves.

    5.      Ms Adlington asks also for a copy of the report which your force provided to Mr
    Howard before the General Election. This is, I think, the two volumes of material attached to
    Mr Wells’s letter of 3 February to Paul Pugh at the Home Office. Would there by any
    difficulty about that? If not, it would again help us if you could let her have the papers
    direct.

    6.    Ms Adlington’s last paragraph takes up the subject of the statements by Houldsworth
    and Walker. I know you are actioning this. But it might help if I confirm that, as Mike
    Ward said in his letter last week, there is no objection from the point of view of Lord Justice

    G:\HILLSBOR\MAIN\SYORKS.Q27
Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny to the release of currently existing documents and photographs to
those who have a need to see them. We have no difficulty with your force policy on this
you have outlined it to us.

7.       I hope this is not too burdensome.

        Dear Mr Bone

        Further to our recent telephone conversation I would confirm that
        Ian Daines, Assistant Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police has
        provided me with a copy of a letter to him from your office dated
        30 July 1997. That letter contains an acknowledgment of receipt
        of a report on the flisaster by David Phillips/ then Deputy Chief
        Constable of Devon and Cornwall Constabulary.   I should be
        grateful if you would supply me with a copy of this report.

        In addition, the former Home Secretary Michael Howard asked the
        Chief Constable of South Yorkshire to provide him with a detailed
        report of all the points raised in the Hillsborough programme.
        Are you able to furnish me with a copy of the report?

        Finally, please find enclosed copies of my written requests to
        South Yorkshire Police asking them to forward statements made by
        Roger Houldsworth and Dr Ed Walker. As discussed I am extremely
        concerned at their delaying tactics and would ask you to bring
        this matter to the attention of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

        I thank you for your assistance.

        Yours sincerely

General Expenses


The second quarter figure has been revised downward to reflect
the fact that the Sheffield City Council bill for the Town Hall
facilities has not yet been received.     I understand that it will
be sent to us shortly and will therefore appear in the third
quarter figures.    As previously indicated,   it is likely to be in
the region of £15,000 - £17,500 per week and is included in this
sub-head on the advice of Mr Preston.     In total,   it is likely to
amount to some £140,000.


2.    We have also yet to receive the final bills for the legal
costs to the two parties whose costs will be met by us.       Revised
final estimates from the firms show these costs to amount to
approx £350,000 (rather than the £200,000 previously allowed
for ) .   Again, these costs are now likely to be met in the third
quarter.


3.    Additional bills have been received in respect of COI
Regional Services (amounting to some £11,000) and these, too, are
reflected in the third quarter figures.

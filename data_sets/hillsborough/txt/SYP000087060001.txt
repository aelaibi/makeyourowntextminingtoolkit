                 I commenced duty at MaiIby Pol Stn,           from where   1 was transported to

                 our intention was then to                                    r meal,   however,

                 were   instructed by S u p e r i n t e n d e d CHAPMAN to stand by at the junction
                                                                                         PAGE

of H er r is s Rd 3 and Peni.stone R d .



At 3.03pm (1503), that date, w*? were told to go into the ground and

onto the pitch.             On the pi.tjni I was told to join other Officers and

form a cordon across t h e /> it ch .             I could see that there was what

appeared to be a maj or ^u bl ic disorder problem in the Lappings Ln end

and people were spilling out onto the pitch from the standing area*

We maintained general control of the pitch area,                       preventing any

further advance of the Liverpool supporters on the pitch towards the

N o 11 in g ha m F o r re s t fa n s .



I then realised that m ^ y               people had been hury-and some were dead,,

     ether with POL PC j/uRAN I went to the g<y5l mouth at the Leppings Ln

      where I saw many dead bodies laid ouIf behind the goal.                         I assisted

     carrying one of the bodies from lihe/p itch to the gy m na s ium , w h e re a

     tuary had been set up.              Outside W e     gymnasium there were many

people and scuffles were breaking out between these people and P

Officers.          We then returned to the pitch and I was again told to join

a co rd o n .



Most of the potential trouble between fans passed and then myself and

POL PC MORAN returned to the gymnasium area where we were told to

stand by to recover more bodies from the tunnel area on the Leppings

Ln end.          We remained in the gym for some time, but were never directed

to leave.



At 3 . 2 0 p m    (1720),    that   date,   we   r eturned   to the H a i n S t a n d for a

d e br i e f i n g a nd   later   returned to Maltby.

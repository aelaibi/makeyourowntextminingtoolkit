              As   the time       for    the    kick off       closed      in the       crowds    outside     the Leppings

              M any   older      people were       passing me and stating                   that they had no

              i nt e n t i o n of trying        to get     in through the L e p p i n g s Ln entrances as

              they were       being      pushed and jostled an d made                    very uncomfortable.            All

           T o rr en ts      of abuse        and di s p a r a g i n g      remarks were          directed at me by

           L iv er p o o l      suppo r t e r s    w al k i n g   by me.       Rema r k s   such as       "I hope y o u are

i
I          the    usual,          "Black B a s t a r d s ” and similar abuse.                      I did not have any

           k n ow le dg e       of what      had o c c urred at            this an d      the    criticism and a buse was

           that     bit more          dif f i c u l t   to accept.



           At    this       point     I find       it d i f ficult         to e x p l a i n how     I felt as        I knew

           nothing          about what        had happened.                I s u r m i s e d s o mething     drastic       had

           passed       on the        spur    of the moment               by a n g u i s h e d fans.      I made      no   comment

           to a n y     of the        persons        dishing        out    the abuse.           By this time a number              of

           s up p o r t e r s     very upset at            not     being able       to    1ocate r e latives and

           friends          they'd gone           to the game with a p p r o a c h e d me to assist                    them.



           I then went             into    the football             ground, thro u g h       the L e p pings Ln gates            to

           enquire          for    them and at           this      time was      still      not aware       of the     extent      of
    CA-T   the tragedy.               I was       d i re ct ed to the g y m n a s i u m where            I had just a

           glimpse          of what       had occurred.              I could see          numerous       bodies      on the

           floor      of the        g y m na si um      covered      in plastic          sheeting,       most    of w h o m were

           o b v i o u s l y deceased.



           I stayed          for    only a mat t e r          of seconds as           it was       obvious      that my

           a t t en d a n c e     there w o u ld only             cause more      problems        for the       persons

           for    the       persons who had              requested my a s s i s t a n c e         and when       I returned to

           them     they had a lr e a d y been                reunited with          their       relatives.          I then

              I only       caught       slight, glimpses                 of the a c t i v i t y   inside      the ground at           the

              L e p p i n g s Ln end and            cannot assist              r e g arding    these,       I did not         take any

              part      in the       pr o c e e d i n g s    in the gymnasium.



              I can only describe                   the whole            exper i e n c e   that   day as one        that      I w ould

              wi s h    I never       had     contact wit h again.                   I felt as a P o l i c e m a n a sense             of

              disappointment              in the fact            that       I had not gone           into the ground to

              render a ssistance.                   I am aware            of the fact         that   1 had no k n owledge             of

              the      nature     or extent           of the disaster              but     that   is small       consolation.              I

              was      only a matter            of fifty yards               from w here       the    crux of the           tragedy

              o c c u r r e d and was o b li vi ou s             to      it until      it w o u l d appear       it was       too

              late.      I concede          that      one P o l i c e m a n might          not have made any            difference,

              but      that   d o e s n ’t a l l e v i a t e     the      sense     of e m ptiness       in my     involvement

              wit h this         event.

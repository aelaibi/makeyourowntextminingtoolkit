              I am a Police Sergeant         in the South Yorkshire P o l i c e , presently

              stationed with Sheffield Road Traf f i cy Dj.AHrtTi'pn, Claywheels Lane,

              Sheffield,      where   I am in charge of the Sheffield Motorcycle Wing.



              Qn Saturday 15 April         1989 (150489),       I was on duty in connection with

              the F A Semi Final        between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at

              Hillsborough Football Ground.             I was engaged on supervisory duties

              regarding the Nottingham routes towards the ground.                   Our brief was

              to take a meal at Driving School,               Attercliffe during the game and at

              some time just after 5?6o prtK( 1500)., whi 1st taking meal,              all traffic

              and beat officers were         instructed to attend at Hillsborough for

              ’Operational S u p po rt ’.     That was the extent of our knowledge of the

              situation,      so believing     it to be public order,         I did not go to my
                                                                                     PAGE         2
                                                                                     S 1897

motorcycle,   but attended in the lead Range Rover,              as I had knowledge

of the ground to be able to lead the convoy to the gate requested by

Operations Room.

On arrival at the ground,       I entered via Penistone R o a d , which leads to

the area behind the North Stand and on leaving the vehicle,                   I went

between the stand and the Spion Hop onto the pitch.                  It was then

that I saw that injured people were being              carried across the pitch

from the Leppings Lane te r r a ce.     The   injured were being carried on

boards by fans and then put down on grass near to the Hop.                    Some were

being attended to by what       I deduced to be Liverpool           fans and others

were left to be attended to by first aid representatives or police

officers.

I assisted with two badly injured male persons who had difficulty in

breathing.     I put these people      in a recovery position,          comforted them

and sought the aid of ambulance         personnel      to take over the role and

remove to hospital.

I ifhen saw a male      person being   carried over by about eight fans and

 hen placed to the ground.        The man appeared dead.            His face was

purple.     A doctor    came over and after feeling his pulse,             indicated

tbfat we   could try to revive him.       One i                                          est

massage whilst    I gave the kiss of l i f e .      We did this for quite a few

minutes but still       considered that we were too late.            The doctor

returned and after       checking the man,    he indicated that he was dead and
                                                  —-      -                     ■—     ''
there was nothing further we could do.            The fan who had been giving

the chest massage was angry about our failure and seeing bubbles from

the m a n ’s mouth,    he wanted to carry on.       I told him it was merely my

breath coming out and that the man was dead.               Everyone then left,

apart from the two fans who stayed with me.              They were^very upset.                I

 sked if they knew him and they replied “No".                 TJxr^ m a n was well    built,

aged about 26 to 32,       17 stone,   wearing blue/Xrousers
                                                                             PAGE         3
                                                                             SI 897

                     , belt,   underpants and a short sleeved shirt,           which

was white with pastel      coloured background patterns.

I told the two Liverpool       lads that we would make the dead man

respectable by                                       generally tidying up his

clothing.   One of the lads took off his sweatshirt and placed it over

the dead m a n ’s face.     I then stayed with them and tried to comfort

them.   I insisted that we did not move him until a stretcher became

available as he was so heavy,       he might have fallen off the makeshift

board that he was lying on.

When a stretcher was free,              and the tw<^ \~y<fer\p^jcHT^fa n s , along

with others,   carried \h $ S fn a j\ to the gym^asium^^wTlTel^e he was placed with

numerous other dead people.

I stayed with the two Liverpool       fans for a while to comfort them, and

took them for a cup of tea.        They asked me my name, which I gave them.

Following a short conversation and ensuring that they were alright,                   I

returned to the pit ch.

1 did return to the gymnasium at about 7.00 pm (1900)            that day,

in order to identify with the dead man,        but the emergency system

introduced did not enable me to establish anything.

The following week,       I attended at the Medico Legal Centre        in an

attempt to identify the man,       but the process established for the

inquest had been introduced and they were unable to allow me to check

the photographs that had been obtained.

There followed a numbe                      isional meetings   chaired by

Chief Superintendent f            n our traffic    policing was organised.

I organised the traffi___________________ersions along with signs        (off

the motorway)    in liaision with the A.A.     I went out with the A.A.     to

implement.



On the 15 April    1989 (150489) my duties were supervisory motor        cycle

sergeant    covering the Nottingham routes.    Prior to attending a

briefing at Driving School at 9am (0900).        I checked certain roadworks

which had been in operation and would have affected a divertionary

route if not completed.     These had been removed and the road re­

instated.    Following the briefing at Driving School       I had a separate

briefing with the Motor Cyclists within my S e c t o r to explain what      I

expected and to detail the diversions       in our area.



Between 1                  10.30am (1030)    the motor   cyclists   in my Sector

went out onto their areas which contained locations where police

offcers had points and such were also under traffic supervision.



I checked my routes for signing and I had occasion to move one sign at

Fir Vale which was in contradiction of our signed routes and I

instructed one of my officers to move a further sign at Rutland Road

for the same reason.     These signs had apparently been erected by

Divisional Personnel.



The traffic movement was quiet until about       11.30am (1130) when

problems occured in the city at Park Square.        A tailback started to

occur on the Parkway and Sheaf Street where buses were transporting

supporters from the railway station.        I summoned bikes into the area

and I worked traffic until about 1pm (1300), when with organisation
                                                                                   PAGE    3
                                                                                   SI 897A

with other units and the implementation of directions we returned

traffic flow to normal.



I ascertained that there were problems             in the Attercliffe Road/

Pitsmoor area with standing traffic so I attended at Gower Street/

Burngreave Road which was the point causing the delay.                 Again I

summoned more bikes         into th«» area and took o vjm ''"t raf f i c points.     I

worked traffic until about g.4Qpm (144LD when all the Nottingham

traffic had been cleared.             During this time I monitored all other

Nottingham routes.          It eased by 2.20pm (1420) and all the

backlog had gone by 2.30 pm.             I stayed until 2.40 pm and checked the

nearby routes until being given standdown for meal about

2.55pm         (1455) when I went to Driving School at Attercliffe,

before attending         I did ascertain that there were no traffic problems

in my area, and there were none elsewhere that I was made aware of.

W h i l s *'      Drivin9 School    taking meal we were summoned to attend at

Hi 1 Is bo rough for     ’Operational Support*.      Believing    it to be public

order      I did not attend on my motor cycle but went           in the lead range

rover of the police convoy as I had knowledge of the gate we had been

requested to attend.          On arrival at the rear of the North Stand I got

out to enquire what was            required but there was no one in charge to

communicate any specific            request.   I went down between the North Stand

and the Spion Hop ^onto the pitch and looking across towards Leppings

Lane.          I could see a police    line across the centre of the pitch, and

in front of the Leppings Lane terrace there were hundreds of fans and

police.          I still did not know what had happened until        I saw injured

people being         carried across the pitch on makeshift hardboard

stretchers.         The injured were put down on the pitch in the corner

where      I had entered.     I assisted in breaking up advertising hoardings

to facilitate ambulances trying to gain access               to the pitch,    and then
                                                                               PAGE   4
                                                                               51897A

I became occupied in attending to two male persons who were badly

injured and having difficulty breathing.         I was with these two for

some time before I moved towards a man b rought across on the

stretcher.    His face was purple and he appeared d e a d .       I could not

detect a pulse beat.    A doctor indicated that we could try reviving

him so I gave mouth to mouth whilst another fan ’pu mp e d’ his              chest.

After some time the doctor    returned and indicated
                                                 ■ ---that the man was
dead.    There were numerous fans in attendance and they were very angry.

All   but two returned towards Leppings Lane terrace.          The two that

remained were very upset although they did not know the identity of

the dead man.    I assisted in consoling them in their grief.                We t idied

up the dead mans    clothing before obtaining a stretcher and

taking him to the gymn asi u m .     I stayed with the two fans for a while

and obtained them a hot drink before returning to the pitch to see

what further assistance was        required.



There were no futher    injured persons that I could assist but when I

walked up towards the half way line I had to prevent fighting between

Liverpool    fans on the pitch and some at the front of the North Stand.

The ones I spoke to were very emotionally disturbed and I merely

talked to them to calm them down.         I then entered the North Stand to

speak with Liverpool    fans who were having     ’h e a t e d ’ arguments.     Again I

merely calmed them down.     They were agitated because they had not been

told what was happening on the public address system.             I then returned

to the pitch and finally left when all the police in the centre area

were stood down.



On leaving the ground the vehicle        I had arrived in had left.           I spoke

to two pressmen from London and they took me back to Driving School on

their way back to the motorway.
                                                                      PAGE    5
                                                                      S 1897A



Once I had returned to my bike there were no specific        instructions

from Force Operations so I returned to points which were causing

traffic    problems by the departing fans.      I worked the junction of

Upwell Street/Brightside Lane          e^etting     a traffic warden to take

over.     I then went to Herries Rtfad
                                    ad outside the Northern

Hospital where traffic was tailing back from Fir Vale.



This was    causing problems for ambulances and hospital staff arriving

in response to an emergency call out.        I summoned bikes   into the area

to assist me set up a diversion and keep the area clear for

emergency vehicles.     About 6.3Qpm   (183Q)   the area was clear of any

problems so I resumed.     I established that there were no other traffic

problems elsewhere before turning to Hillsborough.         I returned to try

and identify with the dead man I had attended to earlier but the

procedure since    past action prevented me from doing so.



I stayed at the ground for a while because I was affected by what           I

had been involved in earlier on the pitch.



I then returned to Claywheels Lane where eventually I was stood down.

I mention in my previous statements seeing the body of this man being

carried by about eight fans.             I do not   recall seeing any Police

Officers with the stretcher,            however the area was very crowded.         I

could have been mistaken or I could have first seen the body after the

Police Officers had left the body.



Certainly the series of Photographs above appear to show the body of

the man that I dealt with down to the colour of his              clothing,   the

striped shirt    (which I have orginally described as white with pastel

coloured background patterns - but which is undoubtably the same

shirt) and the state of the clothing.

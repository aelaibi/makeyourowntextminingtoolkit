                 final a was                 informed that          I would have a good chance of getting a

I don't         know anyone & was          not taking much                      notice.          I cannot       recall          the

We    then      continued to S h e f f i e l d & were                directed              past S h e f f i e l d    towards

B a r n sl ey which       look    us quite a bit out                   of           our way causing us              to be a

lot    later       than we should         have       iseen.



In a small          village      on route       back       towards S h e f f i e l d             I d o n ’t know the

name we got          stopped by Po lice O f f icers S U s ^ c o a i c h was                            s e a r c h e d for

certain       type    of sticker      we    canjtffnued our                 journey.             We were      stopped

again but as soon as thev/^faw our sticker                                          we were a l l o w e d to continue



We    parked the       coach a p p r o x 1
                                         ' one and a half miles                               from the ground

having a r r i v e d about         1.30    pm    (1330 hrs).                    The      coach was       parked        on a

road    in what       looked      like an       industrial             estate.



A P o l i c e m a n got    on the    coach       &    told us how to get                       to the ground.



I left       the    coach with my friends,                  although                          had got off           ea r 1 i er

to see       if the    pub was      opened S we met                 up wit h him               later as the            pub was

closed.



On    route      to the ground       I saw about              10 Police O f f i c e r s               but we w e r e n ’t

                direc t e d or escorted.                  I saw one       or two      fans   drinking alcohol             on route

                from     cans.



                There was          no problems           on route,       there was       no fighting        or a n y t h i n g &

                t he h um o u r was         good.

                Unfortunately          I had           been unable       to g e V ^    ticket     on the      coach & had

                wa l k e d   down to the           ground hoping          tpr get a ticket           there.     The      lads

                stayed w ith me             for about         10 m i m A e s   & then       left me & they all             entered

                the ground & I stood                   over     the   road by the        bridge.



                1 then saw a man across                    the    road    inside      the    perimeter      gate    of     the

                ground       in the    compound area              I thought       he had a ticket           for sale           so    1

                w a l k e d across     the        road to him.           He did    not      have a ticket &         it was           then

                t hat    I notice d p e o p 1e .



                I then stood          in this           compound a.rea^& by about 2.33                 pm    < 1435 hrs)            it

star t e d to feel myself                       getting         crushed,          I was unable to move                     freely           &•

was       starting         to     have        d if f i c u l t y    breathing.

deci d e d that            I was       going        to get out.



1 then became aware                      of a gap opening                   up behind me & 1 made a dash for

it go ing o u t of                t h e co mp o u n d a r e a ba ck onto L e ppi n gs L n                                 & Icame o u I

I was          standing         inside        the      shop for about              S rni nutes / W h e n         1 noticed that

were       opened.



I t h e n walked, b a c k              o v er     to    the     bridge       as    I didn't          by t h e n w a n t         to     go

i nto      the    g ro u n d     due     to     the     e a r 1 i er    crush.



I stood          there      for     about         half     an      hour.       I knew         something          was      wrong

inside          due   to    the     noises          coming         from     the    ground          & then       people         leaving

By this           time    it was about            4 o ’clock          (1600)       & the    two middle       pens were

v ir tu al ly empty.               There were         no    people          lying    on the floor          injured or

dead    &     I just          looked      for    my friends.               I spotted                &             S1 i I Xf1Q

in some           seats       in the N o r t h S ta n d so            I made       my way onto the          pitch via

the    e me rg e n c y gate & went & sat                    by                 &



I stayed              there    until   about       4.3 0    pm    (1630 hrs)          & then the 3 of us              plus

of    people           by now were & we had a good twenty minute walk ahead.                                          We

then    left           the ground & made             our way back              to the      coach.



By about 6 o ’clock                 <1800 hrs)                   ere       s t i 11 wa i t i n g for t w o 1ad s f r o m

there were              not very useful.              The    P /n .   ice     horses were more            of a

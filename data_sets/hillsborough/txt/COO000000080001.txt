A.     Introduction

1.   Football continues to raise a knot of         policy issues which arouse
a high level of public concern and media attent      :ooliganism in connection
with matches abroad continues to damage ots           iiding internationally.
Hooliganism at home regularly occupies substantia]     ce resources throughout
the football season.    It also makes more diffic t the resolution of the
problems of crowd control and public safety at football matches highlighted
by the Hillsborough tragedy and Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.

2.   This paper reviews the Government's response so               _these issues,
previews developments in Government policy already in trar           nvisaged and
raises for consideration some outstanding issues.

B.     Background: recent and expected hooliganism

3.   At Annex A is a digest of events in recent years. As for ti
there was serious hooliganism in connection with the Sweden v Eng]
in Stockholm on 6 September. At the match itself there was no trov
early press reports of the behaviour of English supporters in Stockholm
exaggerated. But English supporters were involved in drunkenness, fight
and damage to property, abroad the Tor Britannia Ferry from Harwich to

Go the         3 September (43 arrested; 8 charged; one man jumped overboard
and dro'         In Stockholm before and after the match 104 English, and 104
Swedish we          rarily detained; one Englishman was charged. No trouble
was report         ;e matches on 6 September between Yugoslavia and Scotland,
Finland and W;         Northern Ireland and Hungary.

4.    The domesti^/p^Crure has been more peaceful. The opening weeks of the
League season hav>s\l3een relatively free of violence although the British
n’rancArtrf Police ronrtrf
Transport          report aa rvtimHof P

Risks of hooliganism for            est of the football season

5.    A list of the matches
of the season is at Annex B.-
                                 Q      fed by the four home countries for the rest
                                           match that offered the highest risk of
violence - the Holland vs Em               ^friendly arranged for 13 December in
Rotterdam - has been cancelled               request of the Minister for Sport

6.   Arrangements are in hand, incl\       iaison with other national police
forces, to prepare for the World Cup        involving all four home countries
on 11 October and the England v Italy f1      at Wembley on 15 November. All
of these involve some risk of trouble          bly less than that threatened
by the Holland match now cancelled. The fc       authorities are reported to
be considering whether to proceed with the        iviously risky match on the
list: the England vs Scotland match at Wembl         esday 22 May.

7.   The best estimate that we can offer is t h ^ ^ n e domestic season will
probably follow the pattern of the last two seasoft^: about 6,000 arrests; 6-
7,000 ejections; and some more serious trouble, such as occurred at the end
of last season.   (Annex C gives details.) Existing measures are likely to
contain the problem but more serious violence on occasi^S^yannot be ruled

                    Parliament will debate the scheme twice further
                    it can be implemented.

            Partg-sTF/of the Bill is intended to prevent a convicted

            outside EnglaManii Wales. The Bill also makes provision to

National Football Intelligence Unit (NFIU)

9.   We have recently appointed the Superintendent to heaa/fcfi new central
police team to co-ordinate police intelligence on more serio    )persistent
football hooligans.   The NFIU will work closely with the e;        British
Transport Police 'TREVI’ office (paragraph 12), strengthening t      mge of
information and intelligence with other countries. The Superin         will
take up post on 1 October.

             ent action to improve international co-operation

11.             ooliganism in the context of international matches can only be
dealt with<       ively with the full support of the countries concerned. The
UK has been          ;ental in setting up through the TREVI group of EC law
enforcement Mi;      s and officials, a network of permanent correspondents to
exchange info:         relevant to policing football. The UK correspondent is
a senior British        port Police officer. A discreet but increasing role is
being played by       ce liaison officers travelling to their country's away
matches to advise    e local police on the identity and tactics of hooligan.
we both send and receive such officers.

12. The UK is also a fo        signatory of the Council of Europe Convention
on Spectator Violence at            Events, whose official standi^       .^ e e
is chaired by DoE. The               encourages parties to adopt policies and

E.   Government action on safety: th^          Inquiry


Tavlor's Interim Report

13. On 4 August the Home Office circulated tt         im Report to the police,
the local authorities concerned, other emerges       esyices, clubs and major
sporting bodies urging them all to take actior         implement the Report's
recommendations without delay. Feedback received'      far, primarily from the
police and Fire Service, has indicated no lack p f willingness to implement in
full the Report's recommendations.

14. There have been some practical difficulties and           fficulties of
interpretation.     This was to be expected given the           ion between
grounds. The Home Office is keeping the situation under           The option
to enforce relevant recommendations of the Report by re               safety
certificates to contain mandatory terms and conditions remains
not been ruled out.

Tavlor's Final Report

15. It is expected that the Final Report will be available at about th^ _
of the year.   The Inquiry has already indicated that it will— address.
wider safety issues of football membership schemes, supervision of lgc
authorities in the exerrise of their safety responsibilities and new and.alj

         adia. More specific issues such as the content of the "Green Guide"
          at sports grounds, pre-match drinking and ticket touts are also
like!        addressed. Acceptance and implementation of recommendations on
any or         these matters may involve further legislation.     It may also
have res       triplications both for the public sector and for sport. A
measured           from Government to the Final Report will be required.


        Preview o       rnment action in the coming months

16. The programme       f work over the next 12 months will focus on four main
areas:-

          (i) completing th       age of the Football Spectators Bill
              and bringing          I and II (the national football
              membership            and restriction orders)      into
              operation;

         (ii) bringing the Nation        ;ball Intelligence Unit fully
              into operation;

       (iii) strengthening internatio:         iperation in preparation
             for the World Cu p in Italy         ear.

        (iv) considering and acting on Lo          ice Tavlor’s final report

Of these the first is far advanced wifch^kfrt^e scope for major policy
revision. The second is well in hand and shoi^^£»s producing results by the
end of the year.   The third is more open to^n^/'initiatives because much
remains to be arranged. An inter-Departmental vpacing group of officials,
chaired by DOE, on which the police and the'football authorities are
represented is already co-ordinating UK measures to reduce the risk of
violence in Italy. Action on the fourth must await publication of Taylor's
Final Report at the turn of the year.

17.    In order to strengthen co-operation abroad we shall^

        (i)   urge, through TREVI, the adoption of new guidelines ,.      __
              by the UK on policing international matches;

       (ii)   press the signatories of the Council of Europe Conven
              on Spectator Violence at Sporting Events to identify
              prosecute spectators who commit criminal offences; and

      (iii)   strengthen international liaison on intelligence on
              football hooligans through the newly established NFIU.

      Outstc          Issues for consideration

19. He belie, 3e^3?iat the measures already taken and in hand provide
opportunities foit^^fective action to reduce hooliganism at home and abroad.
He are also sometimes pressed to:-

        (i) urge the withdrawal of England from the World Cup;

       (ii) seek the abai;            of the England v Scotland match at
            Wembley next

      (iii) withdraw passports<£^^jpnotorious hooligans.

20.   Considerations affecting t t          ree issues are:-

        (i)     there is a strong likeli       some violence. Many England
               supporters will travel            with or without tickets,
               But withdrawal would not pri      hose hooligans determined
               to cause trouble from travel          Italy and focussing on
               Scotland or other teams.     Hi          is for the FA.   We
               cannot force them to act.                  might be against
               withdrawal. On our present asses          e are inclined not
               to press the FA to withdraw;

       (ii) holding the match on a weekday e v e n i ^ should reduce the
            risk of trouble. The football authorities may decide to call
            the match off voluntarily. If they do not, we are minded
            nearer to the event to consult Scottish              and the
            police, and review the case for asking for          ch  to be
            cancelled;

      (iii) Although we wish to stop football hooligans atfc
            matches abroad, withdrawing or endorsing passpo
            hitherto been held to be a disproportionate
            because, if effective, it would stop all travel abroa^
            the people concerned. Action could only be taken agail^
            previously convicted hooligans, probably a small minority.^
            The Government’s preferred solution is the more targeted
            approach in Part II of the Football Spectators Bill, in any
            case, the ready availability of British Visitor's Passports
             (BVPs) and 'no-passport' excursions would make general
            passport restrictions ineffective. At least until the


                                 CONFIDENTIAL
COT^ufe^iOTtion of passport offices has been completed the retention of BVPs
as an a&afcpl^tive travel document will be essential.- We are not inclined to
       G


CONCLUSION

21. We invite a       tes to note the programme of work set out in paragraphs
16 and 17 above.

22. We also invite their views on the outstanding issues set out           in

On a separate timetable, the              rities are proceeding towards a
selection of the ccupany that will         scheme on their behalf, They intend
to reduce their present short-list of       one within the next three months but
a binding contract will not be made                 .1 Membership Authority is
appointed - probably early February 1990.

She Government's declared target for inpleaa^^Kai of the scheme (subject to the
availability of appropriate technology) is "traTearly months of the 1990/91
season”. The football authorities say that th^ beginning of the 1991/92 season
is the earliest achievable date. Our realistic objective should be to achieve
implementation before the end of the 1990/91 season.

Part II: TtesrtrHction Orders and reporting

Following Royal Assent we will need to establish the                 farcing authority
(vSio will issue requirements to report to those subject             action orders)
and give guidance to the police (who will register the a-              of repartees)
and the courts (who will impose restriction orders). We                    >lete these
arrangements early in the New Year.

We intend to follow that quickly with Orders in Council allowing                ions in
Scotland, Italy and other countries to result in restriction o:                   land or
Wales. Ihe key target is to establish arrangements with Italy                      the
World Cup in June 1990.

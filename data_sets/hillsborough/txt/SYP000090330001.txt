           I usual ly play rugby football but on 15th April            1989 (150489)    lament

           with some friends to the FA Cup Semi Final between Liverpool football

           Sheffield.   I had not got \Jficket but my friend told me it would be

           easy to get a ticket         in a pub or from touts outside the ground.



                            hired a car and two

           together.          We left home at about    11.30 am (1130) / 12 md <1200) and

           had quite a good jouro<fy to Sheffield although the traf f i c was quite

           bad.       We stopped ajr a pub about 5/7 miles from the ground a nd had some

           food, and I hadJfne pi n t .       We then went on and parked the car in a

               road a short distance from the ground.                  I had no contact with any

               police either on my journey to Sheffield or while walking from where

               we parked the car to the ground.                 I was never given any instructions

               of where to go.



               I suppose>$e arrived outside the Leppings Laffe turnsti les at a bout

               2.30 jjrffi.     (1430)    I had been trying to get a ticket as we walked to

               the ground huJfT had not got one by the time we arrived.                            I remember
               C/vr                      Arr ^ /l_
               seeing o n y p o 1i ce officer on a horse outside the ground.                           Outside the
cat
               ground you just had to go with the crowd, and I lost all the others

ctovjD         and was jusl^frapped in the crowd and being forced along with them.                                   I
 iW
               did not go through a turnstile but I remember the crowd just took me
v M ^ v r tt
               through a/Cide blue g a t e .         I realised I was on the inside as I was the

               ground side of the turnstiles.              I did not see how the gate 1 had

               entered through was opened or who had opened it.



               In the area between the turnstiles & the tunnel to the terrace I met

                p again with the young                     and the lad I know as                          We went

CAT      /     then with the crowd to the tunnel giving access to the ter race.                               I did
TV
               not see any Stewards or police in this area, and I was never told

               where to go or where            I could not go,         did not see any signs telling

               me where to go.           C A f=\~               O^s)



               We all three went along the tunnel and went                 into what           I now know to be

                  n No 3 .      We eventually stopped about half way down the pen &
S .O.cL
               directly behind the goal.             As we got to this point the game kicked off

               so I suppose it must have been just 3.00 pm.                    (1500)



               The crush in the pen just got tighter & tighter,                   there was never a big

               surge but it just got very very tight.                  I am quite big and so my head

           was above the others & I could breath,      but the other two, one each

           side of me, were complaining and saying they we re going to die.               I did

           not take muci> notice of what was going on around me as I was

           concentrating on the two with me.       I was able to get each one of them,

           the yousro           &      into my arms and lift them up a bit so they

           could Jbreath but then I would get t i rjpd & have to put them down.           The

           lad          then just pulled himseIf Jro and seemed to run across the

           hsUds of all the fans in front        him & got to the front fence and I

            hink got over.      The young         I e v e n t u a l l y was able to lift up

           and he was pulled up into Jrne stand a b o v e .   I was still trapped but

           eventually the crush seajped to ease off and I was able to get to the

           back of the pen & back through the tunnel and out of the ground.



           When I was     in the area between the turnstiles & the end of the tunnel

           people started to bring fans out of the pens, some of them had items

           of clothing missing.      I started to put fans I found laying on the

           ground into more comfortable positions,      I did not find anyone who

           could have been he 1ped with first aid at that time.

TO           rernefTlb er one incident when a police officer who was attending to a

           fan was abused byyefther f a n . He left the person he was treating and
COM MITT® ran after the        rson who abused him.   When he returned I asked why he
?>
           had run afty'r someone when there were fans to be helped.           He s a id in a

           rather superior way,     "No-one talks to me like that .”



           I helped all     I could by putting things under fans heads as they were

           on the ground.      Then I saw one fan with his clothing over his face, as

           the clothing was pulled down I realised that he was dead.             I just

           panicked then & got out of the ground.       I would not be able to give

           descriptions of any of the fans I helped or I saw who may have been

            dead.      I could not say what time 1 left the ground.   I eventually went

        f   back to where we had parked the car & met up with the people      I had

            gone to the ground with.

            I felt guilty about going into the ground without a ticket,      but as

            I ’ve said I just got trapped in the crowd & had to go in with them,

            There is nothing else I can say,

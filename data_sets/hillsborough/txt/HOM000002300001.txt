fighting          1 can          best        describe           these       fans      as    being       stupid         drunk        and

w o u l d n ’t    listen           to    advice          and     instructions.                   By    2pm      the    build        up    of

 It w a s    about              this    time        that     I saw         some      fans      climbing          over        th e w a l l

W n x 1 st    inside            1 neard         snouts    from       the       turnstile               operator        nearest            to

Gate     ’C ’ t h a t           fans      were    getting       in by          no t      paying.             Those     fans        were

immediately                held      by    Police      Officers           and       ejected            through        Gate       ’C ’ .        I

saw    some         of     those       fans      climb    over       th e      turnstile               barrier        an d    some were

crawling            underneath,             through       the       legs       ot     people           who     had    t i c ke t s.




I then went                oack      outside       through          Gate       ' C ' ,     as     I did        so    i was     asked           by

the    gatemen             on    this      gate    tor    advice.              They        informed me               that     stewaids

from     Liverpool               Football         Club    were       seeking             admission             to    the     ground         by

showing            t h e ir     stewards         passes.        Whilst           the       Sheffield            Wednesday

stewards            ha d      allowed       some       access       to    the       ground         they        believed          tne

stewards            were        then      collecting          the    passes           and       taking         them    outside            for

other        people           to use.           1 told    the       stewards             t ha t    if     t h is     was     the    case

t he n no m o r e             persons        should      be    allowed           access           to    the     ground        by

showing            a stewards             pass.



At     this        time       there       was    about    30 p e o p l e         outside           Gate        ’C ’ w i t h      stewards

passes.              Some       of   these       had    children          with        them and were                  trying        to

 gain    admission.                  The y were         all    refused           on m y         a dv i c e .




 I then m a d e m y w a y                 back     towards       the      roadway            at    Leppings           Lane.         As      I

 did    so     f an s      were        streaming         through         an     open        perimeter           gateway            towards

 Gate        *C'     and      the      turnstiles         there.          This           in e f f e c t      caused        the     orderly

one      purpose        and       t na t      was     to get         i n to    the       g ro u nd .




Many       fans      were     milling              about       outside         with       no     tickets       and were

shouting            it a n y o n e       nad       any     spare        tickets.




I could          see     that       the        fans      converging            on    tne g r o u n d         were      of    such       a

of     vehicles.             I tried            to get         through         on    the       radio        to a s k    for       Leppings

Lane       to    be    closed           to v e h i c u l a r       traffic.          I was        receiving            no    response,

was      then       joined         by    Superintendent                  Marshall           and    I asked          him      to get         the

road       closed.           He     agreed           witn me         t h at     it s h o u l d     and       got    thtough            on h is

 I have         worked        in    Leppings               Lane    at    football           matches          for    the      last       eight

years         and     the     rush        of     spectators             at    this       time was           so b a d    that       this

as    people        came       through.               This      caused        the       crowd        outside       to     thin         to

safe     numbers         and        we     then       shut      the g a t e        completely.                 It w a s     at        this

W h e n we got        into       the      enclosure            I gave       the y o u n g girl            mouth         to m o u t h

resuscitation             and      go t    her     breathing           again.            I was     a s s i s t e d b y a youngj

When    I had       brought          th e y o u n g w o m a n         round        I then      saw that           the

down     tne       side     or     tne       ground.



'i’his we        did      and     all       other        ootiies a n d        casualties              brought       ou t   ot     t h a *.

side     of      tne      ground        were        brought           to    t n i s area.



Ambulances             were       then        brought        rrom          Leppings       Lane        into    the    sterile          area

     ^     x. ed     casualties               and    carried           on d o w n    the       sterile        area     past       tne

players          entrance          etc.



At    t i rs t     I decided             which       casualties              should       go    into      the      ambulance          but

I was      t he n         joined       by     a Doctor          of A s i a n       appearance           who     after      treating

people        decided            in h i s      professional                 opinion       should        go    to    hospital.




I also        ar r a n g e d      for       one     of    the    Police         transits          to     take      peopie       who

were     not       seriously             injured.



I cannot           say w i t h          any    authority              how ma ny      people           received        treatment              at

this      end      of      the    ground          but     it w a s         quite    substantial.




 Eventually when                  al l      the     injured were               taken       away       I was     left       with     te n

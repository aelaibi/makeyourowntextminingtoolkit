P e n i s t o n e Road.      On o c c a s i o n during          our    patrolling we had to                pass     the

V i c t o r i a Public H ouse         on N e e p s e n d Lane and the Owl                  Pu b l i c H ouse at

H i l l f o o t Bridge.        Outside       of both these             public houses were                large

groups     of N o t t i n g h a m Forest        s u p p o r t e r s who were         d r i nking    heavily.

Approximate        numbers        outside          these    premises w ould have                been one

hundred outside            the Owl,         and s ixty outs i d e            the Victoria,          the    latter

being     the most        rowdy,      shouting,         singing and giving abuse                    to    passing

motorists.         Especially           receiving          abuse      were    passing       vehicles

containing L i v e r p o o l         supporters.

A r o u n d 2pm that a f t e r n o o n traffic              had     built     up in the area,             the side

streets      that we were            patrolling        had filled with               parked      v e h icles and

along    the m a i n      roads      there was a st e a d y            stream of traffic              trave l l i n g

towards H i l l s b o r o u g h      football        ground.          This    traffic       soon became

heavily       c o n gested at         the j u n ction      of     N e e p s e n d Lane and P e n i s t o n e       Road

w here a      uniform officer was                  on traffic          duty. S h o r t l y a fter         this     time

he was     joined at this             point     by a Po l i c e m o t o r c y c l i s t       and a Police

R ange Rover w h i c h         contained a further                  traffic        officer an d Chief

Road towards H i l l s b o r o u g h         in order         to ease        the    congestion.

At a r o u n d 2 . 3 0 p m that a f t e r n o o n N o t t i n g h a m Forest              supporters       were

still    outside       the     two    previ o u s l y m e n t i o n e d      public       houses a l t h o u g h    not

in such stren g t h as            they had been earlier.                      There were         still     large

numbers      of s u p p o r t e r s making         their way          towards       the    ground,       a distance

of some       one to one and a half miles.

By 2. 5 0 p m that        a f t e r n o o n most    of the        football supp o r t e r s        had     left    the

area and traffic             conge s t i o n    had eased           considerably around Neepsend

the Owl Public House                 o n . H i llfoot Bridge,               a r r i v i n g a r o u n d S.55pm.        The

public house at             this     time a p p e a r e d       to    be quite        empty     but    there were

numerous        glasses       and    bottles        from these             premises      s c a t t e r e d a r o u n d on

the street         outside.

At the C o m m u n i c a t i o n s    C a r a v a n at this           time was Chief            Inspector

Mc R obbie who         left    shor t l y after           our arrival.               Whilst we        had been on

patrol      in the N e e p s e n d a rea we              had    been       in possession          of a personal

radio and had been m o n i t o r i n g Channel                        19 w hich       had been d e d i c a t e d as

the CIB       channel       for -the FA Cup Semi                 Final.         It was whilst           we were at

this     location that we             ove r h e a r d t r a n s m i s s i o n s      on Channel       25 and

became aware          that     there were           problems          at    the ground.

We were       then joi n e d        by DS Buxton and DC Hirst who were                             both e nga g e d

on mobile        patrol       duties        involving          crime.        T o g ether w i t h them we then

listened to further                 transmissions              on Chan n e l      25.      It became all             too

obvious       from what we were                hearing         that a serious            incident, had

occur red at the L a p p i n g s Lane                end of the             ground and that            numerous

people had been             injured,         some    quite       seriously,           some a p p a r e n t l y   dead.

After     liaising w i t h DI Tawell                 by radio,             DS Bu x t o n and DC H irst           left

vehicle and drove              back        to Harnrnertan Roa d Police                  S t a t i o n w h e r e we

numerous Exhi b i t Bags              and one        of the Major              Incident Boxes.

I then made my way               to the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y F o o t b a l 1 G r o u n d at

Hillsborough          toget h e r wit h DS Ellis,                    DC S t e v e n s o n and DC Wa i k e r

Together       wit h these          other      officers         I went       to the g y m n a s i u m w i t h        the

In the        centre     sect i o n of the             gym I saw a m b u l a n c e       crews and medical

teams at t e n d i n g      to numerous               injured        persons.         I also    n o t i c e d at least

two doctors who were                    in the        gym and      they seemed to be exa m i n i n g the

obvious        dead and        p ronouncing            life extinct.

M a n y of the Police               officers          I saw    inside      the gym at this               time were

k nown to me and some were                       personal       friends.          The m a j o r i t y of these

officers        appeared        to be         in a severe         state      of shock and a small                    number

we re^reduced          to tears.              T o g ether w i t h DC S t e v e n s o n       I then       began to

distribute         body      labels,          string and         rubber      gloves      to the         officers          who

were    dealing with            the       deceased          persons.       Whilst      doing      tâ– â– i s I ma u e

time    to speak         to officers             I    knew    p e r s o n a l l y who a p p e a r e d    to   be

shoc k e d and       in a daze.

I then a s s i s t e d       in moving           the    deceased        persons wi t h i n        the     gymnasium,

after    they had been                 placed        into    â€™body    b a g s â€™ and    p r o n o u n c e d dead by

the    doctors       who were           on hand.

I was    then asked           together           with       officers     from my department,                   to

a r r a n g e a number         of      chairs        in the    centre      sect i o n of the            gym    for

"relatives and friends                    to sit trn.          After     I had      put the       last        chair       in

place a short man who                     had been standing              nearby with a vicar                   suuaenly
                  âœ“
rushed forward-s and began                       kicking       the    chairs around.              He was        also

shouting        ob s c e n i t i e s    and     I too!-:: hold of         hirn in order         to      try and        calm

him and to         prevent          him      causing        injuries      to himself         or others.              He

then    turned       his anger            towards       me by s w e aring and            threatening            me,       this

man    smelled s t r ongly              of    intoxicants         and     from his       demeanor          it was

        At a r o u n d 5. 4 0 p m     that a f t e r n o o n   I became      involved        in speaking .to

        relatives and friends                 of persons who were miss i n g at the ground.                            I

        then a c c o m p a n i e d a number         of these      preople to H a m m e r t o n Roa d P olice

        Station,       together        w ith other       officers        trave l l i n g    on the F orce       coach.

        On arrival          at H a m m e r t o n R oad the friends and              relatives went           to the

        wit h them.

        1 then went to the CID office w hich had been turned into a large

        i n terview     room.       Here     I spoke      to friends and            relatives who           were

        reporting       people m i s s i n g      that    had been with           them at H i l l sborough.

       Ar o u n d 7.30       pm that      evening      together w ith other                officers    I attended a

       briefing       at the      station,        by Det.       Superintendent             McKay.     A fter    that

       briefing       I was      stood by       in the CID office at H a m m e r t o n Roa d                 pending

       a n o t h e r matter      not    connected wit h the H i l l s b o r o u g h           incident.

       On S a t u r d a y    15 April      1989    I was work i n g        the   football       duty as a CID

       Leppings       Lane     end.      When     it first       became     apparent         to me what        had

       â€¢happened that a f t e r n o o n         I found        it hard     to believe         that    such a thing

       could have           h a p p e n e d and on such a large            scale.

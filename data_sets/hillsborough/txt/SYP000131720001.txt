Following the screening of the ‘Cook Report’ on Thursday 2 June 1994, research has been carried out
at this office to establish whether the programme revealed any new evidence from the events
surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.

Our in-depth examination of the programme contents established quite categorically that there was no
new evidence upon which to base any further enquiries. South Yorkshire Police do not find that
surprising. Lord Justice Taylor’s inquiry was thorough and far reaching, apportioning blame and making
recommendations. Lessons were learned. The inquest into the circumstances surrounding the victims
of the disaster was painstakingly conducted and the South Yorkshire Police co-operated fully with the
inquest proceedings. The application for a judicial review into the inquest findings,; which as you know)
was refused, examined pertinent issues surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.

In addition, you will be aware that the independent Poli^q Complaints Authority supervised the
investigation conducted by the West Midlands Police and they have indicated their satisfaction with the
investigation.

Our research into the ‘Cook Report’ disclosed a number of discrepancies and I feel that some remarks
expressed in the programme were incorrect and misleading.

You may be aware that the South Yorkshire Police on learning that the ‘Cook Report’ was being
produced, requested an opportunity to assist or take part. That request was refused by the programme
makers.

It is felt that had the South Yorkshire Police been involved then a number of inaccuracies could have
been avoided, the effect being to give a more balanced view and cause less distress to a number of
interested parties. Those parties include bereaved families, people assisting on the day of the tragedy
and, of course, police officers involved, some of whom are still suffering.

The programme produced no new evidence or facts but my understanding of programme making is that
some footage gathered before the preparation of the programme is not always used in the final
transmission. You may wish to make that footage available to me for examination with a view to
shedding any further light on the accuracy of your programme and any other material you consider
would be helpful.

                                                                                             continued

the immediate future to discuss those issues and for me to indicate to you the inaccuracies in the
screening of the ‘Cook Report’ on Thursday 2 June 1994. A similar invitation has been extended to
Sir Malcolm Thornton, the Member of Parliament representing Crosby, who also appeared in the
programme.

You will remember that I wrote to you on 10 June 1994, inviting you or your representative
to meet with my senior officers to discuss the contents of the 'Cook Reporf screened on
Thursday 2 June 1994. An invitation was also extended to Sir Malcolm Thornton.

David Allford, one of your Assistant Producers, met with members of the South Yorkshire
Police on Monday 20 June 1994, but it was rather disappointing that Sir Malcolm Thornton's
commitments would not allow him to attend. However, a meaningful discussion of the
issues in the 'Cook Reporf did take place and although David did not accept all the points
raised by the South Yorkshire Police he did concede that there were a number of material
discrepancies within the programme which failed to give it the necessary balance.

In particular, the performance of Debbie Martin on the programme and the allegations she
made were of interest to David Allford. David was shown video evidence of Debbie in the
gymnasium on the day of the tragedy and he agreed that she was in fact traumatised and
looking like a zombie. (Her words, you will recall from your programme). David was also
shown timed video evidence that Debbie Martin could not by any stretch of the imagination
have carried out the procedures she described in your programme and the allegation that
you make, on three occasions, that Kevin Williams was alive at 3 55pm has been refuted
beyond a shadow of doubt.

The 'Cook Reporf also attempted to portray Debbie Martin as an experienced police officer
when in fact she was a special constable of two years standing at the time of the tragedy.
As a special constable she was allowed to work a maximum of four hours a week and to
place her in the category of an 'expert witness' was misleading to say the least.

You will no doubt discuss our meeting with David and I hope he will convey to you our
sincerity in wishing to portray the facts as already established by the Lord Justice Taylor
inquiry, the inquests and, of course, the application for a Judicial Review. Whilst the
meeting did generate some heat at times, I feel that a great deal of light was also shecj to
enable David to have a greater understanding of the facts as we know them.

Following the meeting, and at our request, David promised to seek advice on the availability
of any further information which he may have for our perusal. He also said he would
discuss matters with his lawyers and others with a view to letting me know your response to
the meeting.

Your programme showed nothing new and the facts as we presented them to David Allford
were gleaned from documentary evidence already in existence. I still feel that the
programme gave unrealistic expectations to bereaved families, particularly Mrs Williams,
creating a hope that a further inquiry would be launched.

All this is played out against the background of the South Yorkshire Police having
discovered by chance that you were making the programme and that when we asked if you
required our help, this offer was declined. I am sure you will wish to comment on this
refusal in the light of yesterday's meeting. Local media are pressing us for a revelation of
the outcome of our discussions and I hope to be able to answer them as soon as possible.

        23 June 1994


        Dear Chief Constable,
        Thank you for your letter of 21 June with reference to our
        programme on Hillsborough. I should make it clear at the outset
        that this programme was extremely carefully researched and we
        stand by it. To that extent, we are content to let it speak for
        itself, but there are a number of inaccuracies in your letter
        which require correction.
         David Alford did not accept that there were            'material
         discrepancies' in the programme, nor that it lacked balance. We
         dispute both propositions.    Certainly, there were a number of
         unexplained discrepancies in the various accounts of events at
         Hillsborough: that was the point of the prograpie. The families
         want these discrepancies explained, and you will recall that it
         was one of those families who brought the story to us.    So far
         as your reference to 'unrealistic expectations' is oncerned, the
         affected families we have spoken to have been highly supportive
         of the programme.   We did not suggest that an inquiry would be
         forthcoming: only that it should be.
         Debra Martin was not put forward as an expert witness, and it is
         quite unfair to suggest that she was.    She was simply giving a
         first-hand account as someone who was there, and we made it clear
         (twice) that she was a Special Constable.    As Debra Martin was
         told by the police that she was not even at Hillsborough, the
         emergence of a restricted video, in which she appears, merely
         serves to reinforce the points she made in th** programme.
         Debra's account to us is in fact perfectly consistent with your
         own footage. She insists that Kevin Williams was alive, in the
         gymnasium, way beyond 3.15, after she had helped to carry him
         there.

          Dear

          Following  the screening of the'Cook Report'   on Thursday 2 June 1994,
          research has been carried out at this office  to establish whether the
          programme  revealed any new evidence  from the events  surrounding  the
          Hillsborough tragedy.

          Our   in-depth   examination of   the   programme contents established      quite
          categorically that there was no new evidence upon which to base any further
          enquiries.     South   Yorkshire  Police    do   not    find that    surprising.
          Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry wasthorough and         far reaching, apportioning
          blame and making recommendations.      Lessons were learned.    The inquest into
          the circumstances surrounding the victims of the disaster was painstakingly
          conducted and the South Yorkshire Police co-operated fully with the inquest
          proceedings.    The application   for a judicial      review into the inquest
          findin 7 s, which   as you know    was   refused,   examined  pertinent    issues
          surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.

          In addition, you will be aware that the independent Police Complaints
          Authority supervised the investigation conducted by the West Midlands Police
          and they have indicated their satisfaction with the investigation.

         Our research into the ’Cook Report' disclosed a number of discrepancies
         and I feel that some remarks expressed in the programme were incorrect and
         misleading.

         You may be aware that the South Yorkshire Police on learning that the 'Cook
         Report' was being produced, requested an opportunity to assist or take part.
         That request was refused by the programme makers.

It is felt m a t had the South Yorkshire Police beer, involved the.-, a nur.ber
of inaccuracies could have been avoided, the effect being to give a more
balanced view and cause less distress to a number of interested parties.
Those parties include bereaved families, people assisting on the day of
the tragedy and, of course, police officers involved, some of whom are still
suffering.

Since the Cook programme was transmitted South Yorkshire Police officers
have met on two occasions with the Producers of the ’Cook Report' requesting
any  further,  additional   evidence  other  than  that transmitted  in  the
programme.  No such evidence has been forthcoming.

In the circumstances, therefore, the South Yorkshire Police are to make
a formal complaint to the Independent Television Commission concerning
inaccuracies in the programme.   Apart from that the South Yorkshire Police
will take no further action in this matter other than to await any further
legal developments that may be raised by others.

It is understood that an early day motion was introduced in the House of
Commons on Friday 24 June 1994, and a number of members have signed. There
are calls for a fresh inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster and the early
day motion is one aspect of the campaign to look again into the events on
that fateful day.

This letter is intended to give you a brief insight into why the early day
motion was introduced and I trust you will find it helpful.

Yours

Statement from South Yorkshire Police re:



"Cook Report" programme on Hillsborough


The account of former special constable Debra Martin, along with claims about
delays in providing medical care for the victims, have been widely reported by

the media nationally since February 1992.


They were considered in detail in November 1993 when the High Court dealt
with claims by the families of six victims that the original 96-day inquest by Dr
Stefan Popper had been improperly conducted. On 5 November, the High Court
judges dismissed the claims and said that there had been no improper conduct
during, nor suppression .of evidence for, the original inquest.


As far as we are aware, the Cook Report contains no significant new evidence
which has not already been presented for scrutiny in court.


However, we have not yet seen the programme and were not asked to
participate in it, even though we offered to do so this week after learning by

chance of its production.


Of course, if this programme or any other research uncovers firm new evidence
of any miscarriage of justice, we will examine it rigorously. The victims' families

    are entitled to that.


    What we could not condone would be the raking over of old embers for the sake
    of entertainment. This does no-one any good, including those police officers
    made ill by their Hillsborough experiences, who are also now trying to rebuild

    their lives.

                                                    FOR n ' R T H E R   I N F O R M A T I O N (’ O N T A C T

                     The Cook Report on Hillsborough




Since the Cook Report on the Hillsborough disaster was broadcast on 2
June, investigators at South Yorkshire have been carefully examining the
contents of the programme. The Chief Constable had pledged that every
point would be scrutinised to establish whether the report contained any
new evidence.


The careful examination has confirmed senior officers’ impressions, after
their first sight of the programme, that it contained no new evidence.


However, in order to be sure that nothing has been missed and that no
new evidence is contained in untransmitted material or research prepared
for the programme, Mr Wells has written to the head of Central Television
to invite him, and the Cook Report team, to discuss the contents face-to-
face. Sir Malcolm Thornton, MP for Crosby, has also been invited to the
meeting after his call on the programme for an analysis of the recent claims
of some witnesses.


The Chief Constable wants to reassure them that the issues have been

exam ined in detail and to explain the findings of that work.

2 June 1994

Cook Report screened by Central Television.

Programme content examined in some detail.      No new evidence, the main
thrust of the programme being that Kevin Williams was alive after 3.15 p.m.
Allegations about witnesses not traced, evidence suppressed, pressure
placed on Debbie Martin and Police Constable Bruder changing his statement.
All were examined in some detail at the mini inquest into Kevin Williams
or at the application for a Judicial Review.



10 June 1994

Letter to Central Television and Sir Malcolm Thornton, who appeared in
the programme, inviting them to the South Yorkshire Police Headquarters
to discuss the programme content and point out inaccuracies and a lack
of balance in the programme.



20 June 1994

David Allford, Assistant Producer   of the   Cook Report, meets with senior
police    officers    of    South    Yorkshire.      Sir Malcolm Thornton MP,
unfortunately, could not attend.

David Allford admitted that mistakes had    been made in that they had a
number of times which were incorrect,       they should not have included
David Duckenfield in the programme     and  they should have accepted our
request to take part in the making of the programme.



21 June 1994

Letter from South Yorkshire Police to the Editor of         Central   Television
outlining the content of the meeting on 20 June 1994.



23 June 1994

A reply from Central Television in the main refuting what took place at
the meeting on 20 June 1994 but it was significant that the ground was
begining to shift, particularly with times involved.



25 June 1994

A request from Sylvia Jones, Producer of      the   Cook Report,   for a further
meeting with the South Yorkshire Police.

At that time Sylvia Jones said that she accepted that mistakes          had been
made  and  that   she would   not  have made   the  programme in        the way
Peter Salkeld, the original Produer, had transmitted it.
26 June 1994

A   second   meeting   at   Police   Headquarters     with   Sylvia Jones        and
Peter Salkeld.

No new evidence was forthcoming and they        had   nothing    other   than    the
material transmitted on 2 June this y e a r.



28 June 1994

Letters from this office to all Sheffield    Constituency M P 1s         informing
them of the position to date. Merely for their information.



29 June 1994

A complaint has been made to the Independent Television         Commission      about
the content of the Cook Report on 2 June 1994.

Following the screening of the ‘Cook Reporf on Thursday 2 June 1994, research has been earned out
at this office to establish whether the programme revealed any new evidence from the events
surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.

Our in-depth examination of the programme contents established quite categorically that there was no
new evidence upon which to base any further enquiries. South Yorkshire Police do not find that
surprising. Lord Justice Taylor’s inquiry was thorough and far reaching, apportioning blame and making
recommendations. Lessons were learned. The inquest into the circumstances surrounding the victims
of the disaster was painstakingly conducted and the South Yorkshire Police co-operated fudy with the
inquest proceedings. The application for a judicial review into the inquest findings, which as you know
was refused, examined pertinent issues surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.

In addition, you will be aware that the independent Police Complaints Authority supervised the
investigation conducted by the West Midlands Police and they have indicated their satisfaction with the
investigation.

Our research into the ‘Cook Report’ disclosed a number of discrepancies and I feel that some remarks
expressed in the programme were incorrect and misleading.

You may be aware that the South Yorkshire Police on learning that the “Cook Report’ was being
produced, requested an opportunity to assist or take part. That request was refused by the programme
makers.

It is felt that had the South Yorkshire Police been involved then a number of inaccuracies could have
been avoided, the effect being to give a more balanced view and cause less distress to a number of
interested parties. Those parties include bereaved families, people assisting on the day of the tragedy
and, of course, police officers involved, some of whom are still suffering.

The programme produced no new evidence or facts but my understanding of programme making is that
some footage gathered before the preparation of the programme is not always used in the final
transmission. I have asked the programme makers to make that footage available to me for
examination with a view to shedding any further light on the accuracy of the programme together with
any other material they consider would be helpful.

                                                                                             continued -

Kfcr Vtte',

You will remember that I wrote to you on 10 June 1994, inviting you or your representative
to meet with my senior officers to discuss the contents of the 'Cook Reporf screened on
Thursday 2 June 1994. An invitation was also extended to Sir Malcolm Thornton.

David Allford, one of your Assistant Producers, met with members of the South Yorkshire
Police on Monday 20 June 1994, but it was rather disappointing that Sir Malcolm Thornton's
commitments would not allow him to attend. However, a meaningful discussion of the
issues in the 'Cook Report' did take place and although David did not accept all the points
raised by the South Yorkshire Police he did concede that there were a number of material
discrepancies within the programme which failed to give it the necessary balance.

In particular, the performance of Debbie Martin on the programme and the allegations she
made were of interest to David Allford. David was shown video evidence of Debbie in the
gymnasium on the day of the tragedy and he agreed that she was in fact traumatised and
looking like a zombie. (Her words, you will recall from your programme). David was also
shown timed video evidence that Debbie Martin could not by any stretch of the imagination
have carried out the procedures she described in your programme and the allegation that
you make, on three occasions, that Kevin Williams was alive at 3 55pm has been refuted
beyond a shadow of doubt.

The 'Cook Reporf also attempted to portray Debbie Martin as an experienced police officer
when in fact she was a special constable of two years standing at the time of the tragedy.
As a special constable she was allowed to work a maximum of four hours a week and to
place her in the category of an 'expert witness' was misleading to say the least.
You will no doubt discuss our meeting with David and I hope he will convey to you our
sincerity in wishing to portray the facts as already established by the Lord Justice Taylor
inquiry, the inquests and, of course, the application for a Judicial Review. Whilst the
meeting did generate some heat at times, I feel that a great deal of light was also sheci to
enable David to have a greater understanding of the facts as we know them.

Following the meeting, and at our request, David promised to seek advice on the availability
of any further information which he may have for our perusal. He also said he would
discuss matters with his lawyers and others with a view to letting me know your response to
the meeting.

Your programme showed nothing new and the facts as we presented them to David Allford
were gleaned from documentary evidence already in existence. I still feel that the
programme gave unrealistic expectations to bereaved families, particularly Mrs Williams,
creating a hope that a further inquiry would be launched.

All this is played out against the background of the South Yorkshire Police having
discovered by chance that you were making the programme and that when we asked if you
required our help, this offer was declined. I am sure you will wish to comment on this
refusal in the light of yesterday's meeting. Local media are pressing us for a revelation of
the outcome of our discussions and I hope to be able to answer them as soon as possible.

                   'THE COOK REPORT'— Thursday 2 June 1994

 Following the screening of the ’Cook Report' on Ihursday 2 June
 1994 research has been carried out at this office to establish
 whether the programme revealed any new evidence from the events
 surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy,

 Our in— depth examination of the programme contents established
 quite categorically that there was no new evidence upon uihich to
 base any further enquiries, South Yorkshire Police do not find that
 surprising, in view of the cumulative evidence gathered by Lord
 Justice Taylor's inquiry, the inquest, the West Midlands enquiry
 supervised by the independant Police Compiasnts Authority and the
 application for a judicial review into the inquest, which as you
 know was refused.



 The South Yorkshire Police, on learning that the 'Cook Report' mas            #
 being produced, requested an opportunity to assist or take part.
 That request was refused by the programme makers.

 It is felt, had the South Yorkshire Police been involved, then a
 number of inaccuracies could have been avoided, the effect being to
 give a more balanced view and cause less distress to a number of
 interested parties- Those parties include bereaved families, people
 assisting on the day of the tragedy and of course, police officers
 involved, some of whom are still suffering,

 On 20 June 1994, a representative from the ’Cook report' met senior
 officers at Force Headquarters when a number of discrepannes in
 the programme were discussed.A1though not accepting fully ail the


 points made by the South Yorkshire Police, the Producer did
 acknowledge certain serious discrepancies within the 'Cook Report',
 particularly with the timing of events which proved that certain
 actions alleged by the programme to have taken place could not
 possibly have occurred.
    The programme makers are now to consider their position and will
    respond within the immediate future. You will be informed ot
    further developments.

    A public response to media enquiries by the South Yorkshire Police
    awaits the courtesy of a formal response to our criticisms by the
    programmes chief executive.

            Dear Chief Constable/
            Thank you for your etter of 21 June with reference to our
            programme on Elllsbor^nigh, r should make it clear at the outset
            that this programme 1 as extremely carefully researched and we
            stand by it. To that extent, we are content to let it speak for
            itself, bat there ar< a number of inaccuracies in your letter
            which require correct .cm.

           David Alford did tjot accept that there were 'material
           discrepancies' in the programme, nor that it lacked balance, We
           dispute both propositions, certainly, there were a nnabe:c of
           unexplained discrepan ;ies in the various accounts of events at
           Hillsborough: that vac the point of the programme. $he families
           want these discrepanc; .es explained, and you will recall that it
           was one of those fami Lies who brought the story to us. 8 0 far
           as your reference to '1 nrealistic expectations' is concerned,
           affected families we have spoiken to have been highly supportive
           of the programme. We] did not suggest that an ineruirv would be
           forthcoming: only thai: it should be.
           Debra Martin was not it forward as an expert witness, and it is
           quite unfair to si       that she was. she was simply giving a
           first-hand account as >meone who was there, and we made it clear
           (twice) that she was    Special constable. As Debra Martin was
           told by the police    lat she was not even at Hillsborough, the
           emergence of a restr, bted video, in which she appears, merely

        You hav* stated on two occasions that our programme contained no
        new evidence when the (reverse is plainly the case. New evidence
        included the ambulanc*, not revealed in the footage shown to the
        inquests confirmation that Kavin William* may well have been
        alive long after the kroner's cut-off point? and the pressure
        placed on Debra Martin and PC Bruder to change their statements.
        Clearly, one can sianly accept, as the polio© have «y»no oniy
        those accounts which fit a thesis and dismiss the rest. That is
        not our approach.
        Finally, I would reiij^rate that our programme referred to Mr
        DucJcenfield, and the criticisms made of hiin by Lord Justice
        laylor, together with the way in which West Midlands Police and
        others handled the endiuxries into the Hillsborough disaster. It
        was not an attack on Ifcmtb Yorkshire Police, and it is a natter
        of some regret to us t|:

         Dear

         Following the screening of the     'Cook Report' on Thursday 2 June 1994,
         research has been carried out at this office to establish whether the
         programme  revealed   any new evidence  from the  events surrounding the
         Hillsborough tragedy.

         Our  in-depth    examination  of  the   programme   contents established    quite
         categorically that there was no new evidence upon which to base any further
         enquiries.     South   Yorkshire  Police    do   not    find  that   surprising.
         Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry was thorough and far reaching, apportioning
         blame and making recommendations.     Lessons were learned.     The inquest into
         the circumstances surrounding the victims of the disaster was painstakingly
         conducted and the South Yorkshire Police co-operated fully with the inquest
         proceedings.    The application   for a judicial       review into the inquest
         findin 7 s, which   as  you  know  was   refused,    examined  pertinent   issues
         surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.

         In addition, you will be aware that the independent Police Complaints
         Authority supervised the investigation conducted by the West Midlands Police
         and they have indicated their satisfaction with the investigation.

         Our research into the 'Cook             Report' disclosed a number of discrepancies
         and I feel that some remarks            expressed in the programme were incorrect and
         misleading.

         You may be aware that the South Yorkshire Police on learning that the 'Cook
         Report' was being produced, requested an opportunity to assist or take part.
         That request was refused by the programme makers.




ADM/1 The m em ber of staff dealing with this correspondence is                       Ext
It is felt that had the South Yorkshire Police been involved then a number
of inaccuracies could have been avoided, the effect being to give a more
balanced view and cause less distress to a number of interested parties.
Those parties include bereaved families, people assisting on the day of
the tragedy and, of course, police officers involved, some of whom are still
suf fering.

Since the Cook programme was transmitted South Yorkshire Police officers
have met on two occasions with the Producers of the 'Cook Report' requesting
any  further,  additional   evidence  other  than  that transmitted  in  the
programme.  No such evidence has been forthcoming.

In the circumstances, therefore, the South Yorkshire Police are to make
a formal complaint to the Independent Television Commission concerning
inaccuracies in the programme.   Apart from that the South Yorkshire Police
will take no further action in this matter other than to await any further
legal developments that may be raised by others.

It is understood that an early day motion was introduced in the House of
Commons on Friday 24 June 1994, and a number of members have signed. There
are calls for a fresh inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster and the early
day motion is one aspect of the campaign to look again into the events on
that fateful day.

This letter is intended to give you a brief insight into why the early day
motion was introduced and I trust you will find it helpful.

Yours

              'T H E COOK REPORT'       -     THURSDAY 2 JU NE 1 9 9 4             -    UPDATE



Message    concerning       the     'Cook    Report'       was    circulated           to    the    force     on

Wednesday 22 June 1994            outlining         action       taken     at      that      time     and     an
indication      that      further    information          would    be     circulated          as    and   when

it became available.


Since the Cook programme was transmitted South Yorkshire Police officers

have   met    on    two    occasions        with    the    Producers          of    the     'Cook     Report'
requesting any further, additional evidence other than that transmitted

in the programme.           No such evidence has been forthcoming.


In   the   circumstances,           therefore,       the     South      Yorkshire           Police    are     to

make   a     formal       complaint     to    the     Independent             Television           Commission
concerning         inaccuracies,       misrepresentation                and        unfairness        in      the

programme      content.       Apart    from        that    the    South       Yorkshire       Police        will

                                                P R E SS RELEASE



Following the screening of the                   'Cook R e p or t 1 on Thursday 2 June this year,

the South Yorkshire Police examined closely the contents of the programme

to discover whether any new evidence was available which would materially

alter the result of enquiries into the Hillsborough disaster.


The    material     contained      in     the    programme     is not       new.        The    issues   raised

have    been examined        in some detail          in the past either at the inquest into
the     circumstances          surrounding           the      deaths        at        Hillsborough,          Lord

Justice Taylor's         report,     or    the     application        for    a Judicial         Review which

attempted to have the inquest findings overturned.


The programme featured, primarily, the circumstances and events surrounding

Kevin Williams.          A    special     mini     inquest     into    his       death   was     held   by    the

Coroner and evidence taken in detail.                        The Cook programme shed no further

light on the inquest findings.


Since    the   Cook     programme was           transmitted     South Yorkshire              Police officers
have    met    on     two    occasions      with       the    Producers          of    the    'Cook     Report'

requesting      any     further,    additional         evidence       other      than    that    transmitted

in the programme.            No such evidence has been forthcoming.


In    the    circumstances,        therefore,        the     South    Yorkshire         Police    propose      to

take    no    further    action     in    this     matter     other    than       to    await    any    further

legal developments that may be raised by others.

Thank you very much indeed for your full letter of 13 October, explaining why the ITC was unable to
accept our objection to the Cook Report programme “Kevin’s Mum11shown on ITV on 2 June this year.

The detailed nature of your letter allows us some insight into the Commission’s reasoning and, although
it is evidently not a clear-cut decision, I see why you draw your emphases in the way that you do. We
saw the ‘up-date’ programme as an opportunity for the Cook Report programme to have said that they
were wrong, rather than simply adjusting the times to greater accuracy; after all, the times had been
the very essence of their investigative work in the first programme. We felt that the whole tone of the
programme could have been made more honourable by offering a more ‘up front’ correction than they
did.

However, we have decided to accept your judgements with good grace and to allow the matter to rest
there.

Would you please pass our thanks to ITC members for their courtesy and consideration in listening to
our concerns. Although the decision has not gone our way, officers and members of the public will at
least be able to see that the Commission has considered representations with thoughtfulness and effort.

ITEM FOR GENERAL ORDERS


The Cook Report

Following transmission of the Cook Report from Central Television on 2 June this year,
entitled "Kevin’s Mum" (reflecting on the Hillsborough disaster), a formal complaint was
made to the Independent Television Commission concerning the lack of accuracy and

fairness in some aspects of the programme.


Members of the Independent Commission (ITC) have looked into the complaint and
conclude that, "on the substantive points of the complaint, there were no breaches of
the statutory and regulatory requirements for due impartiality and fairness in the

programme".


The South Yorkshire Police still consider that the programme was flawed and that it
gave a biased account of some of the happenings on the day of the tragedy, but the

ITC do not agree with that view.


I now believe that I have taken our objections as far as is practical and so have,

although with reluctance, accepted the ITC’s judgement.

        SUBJECT:     The Cook Report


 The contents of the letter from the Independent Television Commission make disappointing
 reading, although I must say I am not particularly surprised.     I am not a person who
 usually sees spiders in every cup and conspiracies in every corner but I do feel the
 relationship  between   the  Independent  Television   Commission  and  the  Independent
 Television Companies is not as impartial as we would like to see.

 Having said that we did try our best to rectify an injustice to members of the South
 Yorkshire Police, some of whom are still suffering the effects of the Hillsborough
 disaster.  Sometimes our endeavours do not meet with success but I am sure that will
 not prevent us from addressing similar issues in the future.     We should not distress
 ourselves with the fact that we were unsuccessful on this occasion but I do think the
 time has arrived when we should, as you so eloquently say, 'swallow it now'.

 There are no material inconsistencies in the letter upon which to contest the
 Independent Television Commission decision and the interpretation they have made on
 the information placed before them.

 If you agree then I suggest the only action remaining is for an acknowledgement to
 the Independent Television Commission of their decision and an item for Force General
 Orders informing everyone within the South Yorkshire Police Service of the decision.
 I have prepared a draft for your consideration.

      ^ (A^V /           "C (/(>,
I have now completed consideration of your complaint of 4 July
about an edition of The Cook R e p o rt: K e v in 's Mum, shown on ITV
on 2 June this year.       I am grateful for the assistance
Mrs Radcliffe gave my staff in providing additional information
which helped us understand the complex background to the
Hillsborough disaster and subsequent events.          The necessity to
go back both to your office and to Central has lengthened the
process of investigation and I am sorry therefore not to have
been able to reply to you sooner.

As you know, it is the ITC's responsibility to ensure that the
requirements of the Broadcasting Act 1990 and the ITC's Programme
Code are complied with in respect of programme standards. These
requirements include due impartiality on controversial^matters,
fairness, accuracy, taste, decency and so on.     Accordingly, we
have looked carefully at the original programme, the relevant
section of the update programme, and, as I have said, sought
additional information from your office and from Central.

I now turn to the detail of the complaint in the order in which
you summarise it in your letter of 4 July.


1.    South Y o r k s h ir e P o lic e w ere n o t i n v i t e d t o p a r t i c i p a t e     in
      th e programme, and t h i s was u n f a i r and m is le a d in g .

Central Television say that it was unnecessary to invite the
South Yorkshire Police to take part because the subject of the
programme was not the actions of South Yorkshire officers at
Hillsborough. Rather it was claims from victims' families that
the 3.15 pm cut-off point set by the Coroner failed to take into
account the possibility that some victims might have been
rescuable beyond that point, and that these families believed
they were owed an investigation into events after that time.

I do not agree that the programme relied only on Debra Martin's
evidence on this, though I accept that her interview did form a
central and powerful element. Ms Martin's evidence was presented
in a straightforward way and viewers were told that it conflicted
with her second statement.
Cook's introduction is a stylistic device to summarise the
programme in terms that will engage the audience; we do not
believe this demonstrated that the programme was biased from the
outset. Investigative programmes such as The Cook R e p o rt do
present their conclusions in a decisive style. The question is
whether the evidence on which those conclusions are based is
sound and properly tested, and not misleadingly presented.


4.   In a c c u r a c ie s

Central Television now accept that there is no substantive
evidence to suggest that Kevin Williams was still alive at
3.55 pm, as the original programme claimed.          They believe
however that the programme d id offer convincing evidence that
Kevin was alive well after 3.15 pm.       Nevertheless, the three
separate references to Kevin being alive at 3.55 pm in the
original programme were incorrect and inconsistent even with
Debra Martin's account, not included in the programme, which said
". .. and by this time it was about ten to four when I'd been told
he was dead..."     This was clearly an error, but the difference
of five minutes did not undermine the material put forward in the
programme about the 3.15 pm cut-off point. The update programme
did carry the corrected information.

We believe, on the available information, that it was likely that
witnesses, including Debra Martin and PC Bruder, genuinely
believed Kevin to be alive and recoverable at the time they first
had contact with him after 3.15 pm.   What cannot be established
at this stage is whether the 'signs of life' they thought they
detected were post-mortem effects, or whether - though alive -
Kevin's injuries were already so severe that recovery was very
unlikely.   There seems a sufficient margin of doubt to justify
the programme exploring the families' claims that the matter was
not properly investigated.


5„   F u r t h e r P o in ts and In fo r m a tio n

Gillian Radcliffe's letter of 8 September makes further points
which we have examined. We have looked at the update programme
again in the light of your view that it was unfair and inaccurate
to portray your doubts about Debra Martin's account as
accusations of lies.    That is not however what the programme
said. The commentary said: "... South Yorkshire Police... have
said... that Debra... isn't a credible witness". Cook then asks
Debra Martin: "    the police are now saying your first statement
can't be believed. Do you still stand by it?
                                               -   2-




It was in the ITC's view legitimate for The Cook R e p o rt to
investigate these claims, and. to consider1 information that might
indicate that the investigation by the West Midlands Police was
flawed in some respects.   The programme did refer to^the actions
of South Yorkshire Police at the scene but this was justified in
my view by the need to describe the wider context for the
specific questions posed about the appropriateness of the 3.15 pm
cut-off point. The references to the South Yorkshire police were
not central to the main theme of the programme - which considered
the case for a further enquiry - and you do not dispute their
accuracy.     In our view Central's attempted interview with
Mr Duckenfield added nothing to viewers' understanding of the
issues raised in the programme. It was irrelevant to the main
subject.
It was always open to Central Television to involve the South
Yorkshire Police in their preparations for the programme and to
have sought a recorded interview, but it was not in our view
necessary for them to have done so in order to comply with the
requirements for fairness and due impartiality.  We do not find
that such an omission demonstrated bias or misled viewers.


2.   O n - a ir p r e s e n t a t io n   and        b illin g s   w ere   d e ro g a to r y   and
     i n a p p r o p r ia t e .

The presentation announcement which immediately preceded the
programme in the Yorkshire Television area according to YTV's
records was: "Now, The Cook Report." The R ad io Times billing for
that week does describe Cook as "that scourge of the crooked and
corrupt".    This is a generic billing used when details of
individual editions are not available at the time R ad io Times
goes to press. Viewers are sufficiently familiar with the series
to know that the programmes include a diverse range of
investigations in which criminal activity is not always the
subj ect matter.

3.   The programme sought t o p ro v e a p r e -d e te rm in e d outcome on
      l i m i t e d e v id e n c e and t h e r e f o r e d e m o n stra ted b i a s .

The available evidence indicates that a number of witnesses
(including the two temporary stretcher-bearers and PC Bruder)
believed Kevin Williams to be alive and recoverable for some time
after 3.15 pm. The original programme gave considerable emphasis
to the belief that Kevin was still alive at 3.55 pm, based on his
mother's statement. In the event this was unsubstantiated, but
there does seem to us sufficient other evidence to support claims
that he might have been alive for some time beyond the 3.15 pm
cut-off point.    The victims' families obviously feel that the
Coroner's decision denied them an opportunity to know more about
what happened and it was not inappropriate to a i r these views and
beliefs in the programme.    We noted that Sir Malcolm Thornton,
Mrs. Williams' MP, supported her case.
                                   -   4-




Although this provides no detailed background to the doubts about
the evidence, it does we believe accurately summarise your views.
The piece also later includes the suggestion that she may have
been too traumatised to have an accurate recollection of events.

On the question of the 'missing' ambulance, it appears from the
inquest transcript that the police evidence identified only two
ambulances: one at 3.15 pm and another at 3.20 pm.        As the
Coroner confirmed in his interview in the programme^ neither
fitted with PC Bruder's firm recollection of the passing of an
ambulance at 3.37 pm. Yet the time-coded video extract shown in
the programme clearly identifies the ambulance on the pitch at
3.37 pm.   If this film was shown at the inquest the question
arises as to why it was not recorded in the transcript and why
the Coroner found such difficulty in reconciling PC Bruder's
evidence with the available video pictures.    Perhaps the brief
appearance you mention was indeed that of the same ambulance, but
at 3.20 pm not 3.37 pm. You also say the crew were traced and
interviewed.   The programme did not claim that they had never
been interviewed, though we understand they were interviewed, not
by West Midlands Police but by solicitors on behalf of the
ambulance service, and that the general statements taken were not
produced as evidence at Kevin Williams' inquest.     We therefore
believe that the programme was not materially misleading on
either point.
I conclude that, on the substantive points of your complaint,
there were no breaches of the statutory and regulatory
requirements for due impartiality and fairness in this programme.
The inaccurate references to Kevin Williams' condition at
3.55 pm, subsequently corrected in the update programme, and the
irrelevant attempt to interview Mr Duckenfield lessened its
authority but in other respects I judge this to have been a
legitimate investigation into a matter of public interest.

I am copying       this   letter   to       Robert   Southgate   at   Central
Television.

Yoi^rs sincerely

                    The Cook Report

The contents of the letter from the Independent Television Coaaission make disappointing
reading* although 1 mist say x u not partioalarlysurprised.       Z a m n o t a person who
usually sees spiders in every cup and conspiracies in every corner bat I do feel the
relationship between the independent Television Coamission and             the Independent
Television Companies is not as impartial as we would like to see.

Having said that we did try our best to rectify an injustice to members of the South
Yorkshire Police, some of whoa are still suffering the effects of the Hillsborough
disaster.  Sometimes our endeavours do    not Met with success but 1aa sure that will
not prevent us fron addressing similar    issues in the future. We should not distress
ourselves with the fact that we were unsuccessful on this occasion but I do think the
tine has arrived when we should, as you so eloquently say, 'swallow it now'.

There are no Material inconsistencies in the letter upon which to contest the
Independent Television Commission decision and the interpretation they have aade on
the information placed before then*

If you agree then 1 suggest the only action remaining is for an acknowledgement to
the Independent Television Conaission of their decision and an item for Force General
Orders informing everyone within the South Yorkshire Police Service of the decision.
X have prepared a draft for your consideration.

                                    The Cook Report


Following transmission of the Cook Report from Central Television on 2 June this year,
titled 'Kevin's Mum'   (reflecting on the Hillsborough disaster), a formal complaint
was made to the Independent Television Commission concerning the lack of accuracy and
fairness in some aspects of the programme.

The Independent Television Commission have looked into the complaint and conclude that,
on the substantive points of the complaint, there were no breaches of the statutory
and regulatory requirements for due impartiality and fairness in the programme.

The South Yorkshire Police still consider that the programme was flawed and gave a
biased account of certain happenings on the day of the tragedy but the Independent
Television Commission do not agree with that view.

I have now completed consideration of your complaint of 4 July
about an edition of The Coolc Reports Kevin's Mum, shown on ITV
on 2 June this year.              I am grateful for the assistara*
Mrs Radcliffe gave my staff in providing additional information
which helped us understand the complex background to the
H ills b o r o u g h disaster and subsequent events. The necessity to
go back both to your office and to Central has lengthened the
process of investigation and I am sorry therefore not to have
been able to reply to you sooner.
As you know, it is the ITC's responsibility to ensure that the
requirements of the Broadcasting Act 1990 and the ITC's Programme
Code are complied with in respect of programme standards. These
requirements include due impartiality on controversial matters,
fairness, accuracy, taste, decency and so on.    Accordingly, we
have looked carefully at the original programme, the relevant
section of the update programme, and, as I have said, sought
additional information from your office and from Central.
I now turn to the detail of the complaint in the order in which
you summarise it in your letter of 4 July.

1.   South Yorkshire Police were not invited to participate in
     the programme, and this was unfair and misleading.
Central Television say that it was unnecessary to invite the
South Yorkshire Police to take part because the subject of the
programme was not the actions of South Yorkshire officers at
Hillsborough. Rather it was claims from victims' families that
the 3.15 pm cut-off point set by the Coroner failed to take into
account the possibility that some victims might have been
rescuable beyond that point, and that these families believed
they were owed an investigation into events after that time.

necessary for them to have done so in order to comply with the
requirements for fairness and due impartiality.  We do not find
that such an omission demonstrated bias or misled viewers.

2.   On-air presentation    and   billings   were   derogatory   ami
     inappropriate.                                                 i
Hie presentation announcement which immediately preceded the
programme in the Yorkshire Television area according to YTV'B

to know that the programmes include a diverse range of
investigations in which criminal activity is not always the
subject matter.

3.   The programme sought to prove a pre-determined outcome on
     limited evidence and therefore demonstrated bias.       ~
The available evidence indicates that a number of witnesses
(including the two temporary stretcher-bearers and PC Bruder)
believed Kevin Williams to be alive and recoverable for some time
after 3.15 pm. The original programme gave considerable emphasis
to the belief that Kevin was still alive at 3 .55 pm, based on his
mother's statement. In the event this was unsubstantiated, but
there does seem to us sufficient other evidence to support claims
that he might have been alive for some time beyond the 3.15 pm
cut-off point.   The victims' families obviously feel that the
Coroner's decision denied them an opportunity to know more about
what happened and it was not inappropriate to air these views and
beliefs in the programme.    We noted that Sir Kalcolm Thornton,
Mrs. Williams' MP, supported her case.

I do not agree that the programme relied only on Debra Martin's
evidence on this, though I accept that her interview did form a
central and powerful element. Ms Martin's evidence was presented
in a straightforward way and viewers were told that it conflicted

Cook's introduction is a stylistic device to summarise t|gi
programme in terms that will engage the audience; we do nil
believe this demonstrated that the programme was biased from the
outset. Investigative programmes such as The Cook Report Ap
present their conclusions In a decisive style. The question !*
whether the evidence on which those conclusions are based it
sound and properly tested, and not misleadingly presented.

4.   Inaccuracies
Central Television now accept that there is no substantive
evidence to suggest that Kevin Williams was still alive at
3.55 pa, as the original programme claimed.         They believe
however that the programme did offer convincing evidence that
Kevin was alive well after 3.15 pm. Nevertheless, the three
separate references to Kevin being alive at 3.55 pm in the
original programme were incorrect and inconsistent even with
Debra Martin's account, not included in the programme, whicti said
"... and by this time it was about ten to four when I'd been told
he was dead..."    This was clearly an error, but the difference

We believe, on the available information, that it was likely that

had contact with him after 3.15 pa.   What cannot be established
at this stage is whether the 'signs of life' they thought they
detected were post-mortem effects, or whether - though alive -
Kevin's injuries were already so severe that recovery was very
unlikely.   There seems a sufficient margin of doubt to justify
the programme exploring the families' claims that the matter was
not properly investigated.

5.   Further Points and Information
Gillian Radcliffe's letter of 8 September makes further points
which we have examined. We have looked at the update programme

to portray your doubts about Debra Martin's account as

To assist in responding to item 1        in that latter 1 have enclosed copies of the
Introduction prepared by Lord Chief     Justice Taylor for his interim and final report
and the Introduction to the report prepared by the Chief Constable, Mr Dear.

in respeit of item 2, unfortunately, there is no video footage of the    activity   taking

    refer below.


    Mr Wells makes much of the alleged 'bias' of the programme.
    This         is quite           unfair.           We       have         looked,             objectively         and
    fairly, at all the evidence. This is in contrast to the
    police treatment of Debra Martin, including the ludicrous

                                  Kevin would have been twenty one this week.
                                  Instead he died at Britain’s worst soccer
                                 disaster.        His ashes lie below the Kop and
                                  beneath the Liverpool goalmouth.



                                 The      inquest   held       that   Kevin   was amongst

          ROGER COOK
          And    that's      not    all.      The       Cook    Report
          investigation        into the      last half hour of
          Kevin's life,        shows that he died when he
          might have been saved.



          Mum's still got the ticket that took Kevin
          into Sheffield Wednesday's home ground and
          down     the    tunnel     to    disaster        in   those
          hopelessly overcrowded terraces.



          Ninety five people were officially dead by
          three fifteen.           Kevin, circled in red, was
          pulled out at three twenty eight.



          Two men who carried him across the pitch
          say he was still alive.



          So does an off-duty policeman who gave him
          the kiss of        life twenty minutes after he
          was supposed to be dead.



          And    so   does    Debra       Martin    -    much    later
          still.      More than enough evidence to make
          Kevin's mum and her MP want a new inquiry.

                    walk away from             you   now,       I ’ve   nothing
                    further to say.



                    ROGER COOK
                    Well the suggestion is you walked away from
                    your responsibilities then.                 is that what
                    you're proposing to do now?



                    I mean what have you to say to families who
                    say that had you done your job.



                    MR,_DUCKENFIE LD

                       ...as could be expected of you, their loved
                       ones might have survived.



                       Mr. Duckenfield is now retired on a twenty
                       five        thousand     pound   pension      -    though
                       instead of exercising command on the day,
                       he'd just frozen, according to the Taylor
                       Inquiry which also criticised senior police
                       officers for the quality of their evidence.



                       After       Lord Justice Taylor*s       Inquiry,         the
                       parents were outraged when the inquest jury
                       returned a verdict of accidental death.



                       The coroner decided not to examine events
                       after        three     fifteen   b e c ause   he       said
                       whatever happened later all the casualties
                       had suffered the injuries that would lead
                       to their deaths by then.



                      However,           the three fifteen cut off point
                      also meant that the question of blame was
                      never considered.

                      The whole lot of it was a farce from day

                                meant that the families were denied a full
                                inquiry into how their loved ones died and
                                indeed, if their loved ones might have been
                                saved.          It also ruled out any inquiry into
                                events post three fifteen when we know that
                                the chaos was at its worst.

                          smiled at me again,                  she says,      yes,       we've

                          But it w a s n ’t nicely tied up - there were
                          more witnesses saying Kevin was alive after
                          he was taken from the terraces.

                          You knew he was alive, there was no doubt
                          about that, no doubt about that whatsoever.

                          When    I got          there,       he was       lying   on     ..on

                       Steve    Hart       on   the    right       was    helped   by
                      off-duty fireman Tony O'Keefe - the man in
                      the middle.



                      TONY O'KEEFE
                       I think he was alive.                To this day I think
                      that we wouldn't have dragged him across,
                      not with two policemen,                raced across fifty
                      sixty yards of football pitch and put him
                      down if he wasn't alive.



                      ROGER COOK
                      After the stretcher bearers put Kevin down,
                      twenty minutes after he was supposed to be
                      dead, off-duty policeman Derek Bruder found
                      a pulse and gave him the kiss of life.                       As
                      a    serving         officer,          he     was    refused
                      permission to talk to us but he ha% talked
                      to Kevin's mum.



                      ANNE WILLIAMS
                      The first thing I asked Mr. Bruder was, did
                      he   remember        Kevin.           He    said    he'd   ..he
                      remembered       Kevin right down              to his boxer
                      shorts.          I   asked      Mr.        Bruder   why    he'd
                      changed these statements, why he'd changed
                      all the signs of life.   Mr. Bruder said he
                      hadn't changed these statements,                     that the
                      West Midlands Police came to him and when
                      they came to him, they came with a brief to
                      get him to change his mind.

                        P.C. Bruder also claimed that an ambulance
                        had past at three thirty seven when he was
                         tending Kevin but the evidential film shown
                         to   the     inquest,              didn't     include        that
                         ambulance.         We found it and a member of its
                         crew.



                         TONY EDWARDS
                         I remember seeing these people desperately
                         trying to save their friends and probably
                         their relatives, trying to get them back to
                         life and they were desperately banging on
                         the side of the ambulance pointing to the
                         people       that    they         were    looking after       and
                         we'd been told that we ..we mustn't stop.



                         ROGER COOK
                         Which tallies completely with PC Bruder's

                          He tried to stop                  an    ambulance    that    was
                          passing at three thirty seven to put my son
                          in it but it wouldn't stop for ..for Kevin
                          um and at the end of the day, I asked him
                          would he put it in writing and he said no,
                          but    if     I    had       a    new     inquest,     he    was
                          wondering          why       he    was    never     called    to
                          Kevin's inquest.                 He said he'd been waiting
                          to be called         but          if    I had an inquest on
                          Kevin,      he would stand up in court and say
                          that      Kevin     was          convulsing,      he'd      found
                          pulses      in Kevin's neck,               he'd vomited and
                          that my son was alive.

                   But P.C. Bruder's evidence didn't deserve
                   much credence according to the coroner.



                   nR STEFAN POPPER
                   There were a number        of   anomalies    in his
                    evidence including a problem with the entry
                    and exit of the ambulance; it didn't quite
                    tie in.    Nobody's actually picked that
                    point up but there is a difficulty with his
                    evidence as far as I remember with regard
                    to the timing.



                    ROGER COOK
                    May I pick you up here?



                    nR STEFAN POPPER
                    Yeah.



                     ROGER COOK
                     We've found the ambulance.

                     ROGER COOK
                     It doesn't      appear   in   the   police    video
                     strangely     but   it does   absolutely     tie   in
                     with r.C. Bruder's evidence.         It was there
                     when he said it was.

                             Well fair enough but at the time, we were
                             ••we didn't         ..I did      ..I accept that.              if

                             we   didn't        know    it    and    we   were    worried
                             because if he was in error if you like on
                             the ambulance, he might have been in error

                            Or P.c.       Bruder       and Kevin's        mum might       be
                            right.      However, the coroner wrong over the
                            ambulance       insists      he   was    correct not        to
                            believe Debra Martin heard Kevin say 'mum'.

                            I don't know how much half an hour or so
                            later,      twenty         minutes      later,      I can't
                            remember      the    timings,      sitting up with a
                            fractured       larynx       in   four    places      raying
                            'mum' and opening his eyes and dying in her
                           .arms and that's all he did, he just sat up
                           said     'mum* and opened his eyes.                  it isn't
                           credible in the         light of the rest of the

                         We're       not   talking      about      complicated
                         articulation,         we're    talking      about    his
                         uttering the word 'mum' and the word 'mum',
                        you can try         it yourself,    can be er said
                        without any movement of the tongue at all,
                        the tongue resting motionless on the floor
                        of the mouth - 'mum*.            That coupled with
                        the evidence I've er seen particularly from
                        WPC Martin,        I believe that he did say the
                        word 'mum' and if he said the word                'mum',
                        as you say, then he must have been alive at
                        that time.



                        ROGER   COOK

                       As Debra Martin had claimed.              However,    one
                       senior police officer from the Hillsborough
                       investigation,        finds     it hard     to   believe
                       that any of the officers             involved     would
                       brow beat witnesses.

                       I would like to see the programme, I would
                       like     to   see   exactly     what's    being    said
                       before I decide personally what I think but
                       also it would        be a matter not for me to
                       decide what should take place as a result
                      of whatever your programme reveals.



                      ROGER   COOK

                 I think if there is any new evidence of any
              kind when ninety five people have died it's
              only right          that      that    new    evidence       is
              examined.



              ROGER COOK
             And Kevin's case is the best documented -
             He was alive, he was recoverable and he was
             not alone.



             PR.    IAIN WEST
             There may well            have been others who were
             alive     not   just      in   terms     of   their   heart
             beating and respiration                occurring um but
             who were potentially recoverable beyond the
             three fifteen period.



             ROGER   cook          .
             But the effect of the three fifteen cut off
            means that none of this was ever inquired
            into.



            DR IAIN WEST
            As I understand no.



            ROGER COOK
            So     would    you   then      support    calls   for    a

                                               disaster.                   Nobody       will    ever    erase      the
                                               memory - but a number of families who have
                                               co-operated in this investigation,                            believe
                                               a proper               inquiry would make              it easier to
                                               live with.                  Sandra Stringer lost her son,
                                               Paul.

                                              They said he was brain dead,                             the coroner
                                              said he was dead before three fifteen.                                 I
                                              believe my son was unconscious in the bed.
                                              He      couldn't             have     been       dead    if    fie   was

                                              don't let me die' so he couldn't have been
                                             dead,          a dead person can't talk                          and I
                                             want         to         know what     happened       to him       after
                                             three           fifteen.             But    no    one'll       tell   me
                                              ...I've just had to go through videos and
                                             videos and                ...I just can't           ..I    just want
                                             the truth so that I can begin to grieve for
                                             him.

COOK REPORT- •HILLSBOROUGH"/25/CD
                       THE REPORT



INTRODUCTION



On Saturday 15 April 1989 a football match to decide a

semi-final round of the Football Association (FA) Cup

was to be played between the Liverpool and Nottingham

Forest Football Clubs. The venue selected was the

Hillsborough Football Stadium, the home of Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club.



After six minutes of play at Hillsborough the game was

stopped when it became apparent that spectators on the

West Terraces at the Leppings Lane end and behind the

Liverpool goal had been severely crushed.   As a

consequence ninety-five died and over 400 people underwent

hospital treatment for injuries they had received.     Two

of those injured are still in deep coma and are not

expected to recover.



The policing arrangements for the match were the

responsibility of the South Yorkshire Police.    In the

immediate aftermath of the disaster the efficiency of

those arrangements was called into question.    As a

result it was decided that the investigation should be
 conducted by an independent force.   The Chief Constable

 of the West Midlands Police was invited and he accepted

 that investigation responsibility.   He appointed an

Assistant Chief Constable to take full-time charge.



THE INVESTIGATION



On Monday 17 April 1989 the Right Honourable Lord

Justice TAYLOR was appointed to carry out a Public Inquiry

into the circumstances.   His terms of reference were as

followss-



     "To inquire into the events at Sheffield

     Wednesday Football Ground on 15th April

     1989 and to make recommendations about the

     needs of crowd control and safety at sports

     events."



The role of the West Midlands Police was to undertake

the gathering of evidence for Lord Justice TAYLOR by the

supplying of statements of evidence to Treasury Solicitors

supporting Counsel to the Inquiry.    Where West Midlands

Police Officers interviewed witnesses, the statements were

taken under the provisions of Section 9 of the Criminal

Justice Act 1967 (CJA).   However, because of the speed

with which the oral hearings were to take place - one

month after the disaster - some witnesses elected to
 provide written recollections through their solicitors.

 Notably were South Yorkshire Police officers who

 supplied recollections without Criminal Justice

 Act endorsements. Those recollections have not since

 been converted.     From a criminal investigation

 perspective this is clearly unsatisfactory but had such

 a course not been pursued at the outset it would have

been impossible for Lord Justice TAYLOR to proceed.        He

deliberately set himself a tight timetable because the

disaster raised urgent questions of safety and there

was a need to report before the start of the following

football season.



West Midlands Police involvement was also to take

responsibility for the coronal enquiries.     These enquiries

were undertaken in conjunction with those for Lord Justice

Taylor and have continued since.     The objective of the

coronal inquiries has been the identification of the

deceased, the location where they died, the cause of death

and continuity issues.     Her Majesty's Coroner for

South Yorkshire (West District) in whose jurisdiction the

disaster occurred is Dr Stefan L POPPER, LLB, B Med Sci,

BM, BS, MRCGP.     Dr POPPER has opened the inquests and

has adjourned them pending the completion of the police

investigation.     However, since that decision it has been

agreed that the Inquests will be re-opened in Sheffield

on 18 April 1990 for the purposes of taking evidence of

medical cause of   death, location of deceased and related
continuity issues.

                                                                168
The West Midlands Police investigation began on

Wednesday 19 April.   An early priority was to establish

contact with people who had evidence to give.

Consequently, an Incident Information Centre was opened

in Birmingham with a "freephone” number advertised

nationally for potential witnesses to make contact.      A

total of 2,666 persons responded.    Once witnesses had

started to be identified teams of police officers were

despatched to Sheffield, Liverpool and other parts of

the country to undertake interviews.    In each case a

questionnaire was used and in all nearly 8,000 have

been completed.   On the discretion of the officer

completing the questionnaire if the witness had

relevant evidence to give a CJA statement was taken.

A total approaching 5*000 statements and/or

recollections have been obtained.



Safety issues were obviously a major focus of

attention and consequently 1,740 relevant documents

have been seized, studied and catalogued.



An unusual feature of this disaster investigation has

been the amount of visual and oral evidence available to

record precisely what occurred during those fatal minutes

of Saturday afternoon.   As is well known the BBC were

recording and transmitting live pictures and sound of the

match on nationwide television.     In addition, Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club and South Yorkshire Police had

video cameras operating in and around the stadium.     A

total of 71 hours of film were recorded covering the

periods before, during and after the disaster.

Furthermore, press photographers were in abundance taking

photographs during the same periods and particularly once

the disaster had been recognised.     (It will be recalled

that some such activity was the subject of severe

criticism.)   In addition two South Yorkshire Police

officers were in attendance charged with the

responsibility of taking photographs for football

intelligence purposes, a normal and proper deployment.       A

total of 2,411 still photographs have been passed to the

investigation team.   These have been examined in great

detail and catalogued.     Copies of audio recordings of

police messages have also been obtained; a total of 905

forty minute tapes have been prepared, all of which have

been examined and relevant parts transcribed.



With much of this evidence in hand Lord Justice TAYLOR’s

hearings began on 15 May 1989*     They continued, sitting

long hours, for 31 days.     They were concludedon 29 June

followed by a half day of closing submissionson

14 July.   Lord Justice TAYLOR published the Interim

Report of his findings on 4 August 1989.     (The

Interim Report has been followed by a Final Report

which in no way materially affects this investigation.)
 Lord Justice TAYLOR'S Interim Report was based on his own

 interpretation of what he heard and saw both before and

 during his oral hearings.   Much of what he says is

 uncontrovertible and therefore frequent reference is made

 to relevant parts throughout this report.    The evidence

on which Lord Justice Taylor drew his conclusions has

not been added to significantly nor contradicted by our

investigation findings since the publication of his

Interim Report.   Notwithstanding there are aspects of

this disaster which in the opinion of the Investigating

Officer may not have been given sufficient prominence;

for example, the role of supporters.     (NB: Where

opinion, conjecture or the experience of the

Investigating Officer is recounted in this report, it

will be clearly identified as such.)



On the publication of the Interim Report, the Chief

Constable of South Yorkshire Police wrote to the Director

of Public Prosecutions and asked whether a criminal

investigation should follow.   As a consequence the Chief

Constable of the West Midlands Police was invited to

continue and pursue any complaints against police as

well as to establish whether there was any responsibility

in Criminal Law by any of the parties involved.       The

full criminal and disciplinary investigation formally

commenced on Wednesday 27 September 1989 . Those

investigations have continued and this submission

represents the findings at this stage.    No formal

interviews under caution of persons who could be

construed as "principles'* have yet taken place.

                                                             171

Dear Mrs Radcliffe
Complaint by South Yorkshire Police about 'The Cook Report', 2
June 1994
As we discussed on the phone today,        I attach fov your
consideration and comment the response we have received from
Central Television to Richard Wells' complaint of 4 July about
the edition of The Cook Report shown on ITV on 2 June, Kevin's
Mum.  I also attach a transcript of the programme.

In addition to any comments you may wish to give us on Central's
response, it would assist us if you would provide the following
information:
1.      a brief background to the scope and remit of both the
        Inquiry conducted by Lord Justice Taylor and that conducted
        by the West Midlands Police at the request of the South
        Yorkshire Police,

2.      say whether there is any video evidence in your possession
         of the temporary mortuary in which Debra Martin can be
         identified in the period immediately before 3.50 pm. (e.g.
         between 3.30 pm and 3.50 pm.)        If so, was this made
         available to Central Television when you met them after the
         main programme was shown?

3   _   give the reasons why Mr. Wells declined to be interviewed
         for the update programme, if invited to do so by Central
         Television.

We look forward to hearing further from you in due course.

Yours sincerely




 Senior Programme Officer

             wells' letter to the Commission is also misleading in that it
             lies    at the very least,           that the two meetings with members
         ofP our team, after transmission of the programme were held for


                                                  - 2 -
the purpose of seeking an apology from us. That is very far from
being    the   case.     The' initial   correspondence        shows    that   South
Yorkshire Police believed we had no new evidence and wished to
explore our material with us. We did so at their request. The
second meeting was held on a Sunday for the express purpose of
discussing a possible interview with Mr Wells,                   for inclusion m
the update.      In such an      interview Mr Wells         could have .stated,
publicly and for the record, his views on this whole matter. He
chose not to do so,         for the wholly unsubstantiated reason that
he claimed "not to trust" The Cook Report.


For     your   convenience,      we   will   deal   with    Mr    Wells'   detailed
complaints in the same numerical order.


1       We have already answered this complaint. We approached West
        Midlands       Police,    the    coroner,     and        ex-Superintendent
        Duckenfield.      There was no reason to           seek a response from
        South Yorkshire.



 2      We give below verbatim a transcript of the announcement we
         made before transmission of the programme:-


         "Kevin Williams died in the Hillsborough disaster but did
         he have to?"


         Short extract of programme:-


         "The Cook Report reveals that evidence was altered and the
         truth covered up. 8.30 tonight on ITV."


         The reference in Radio Times is purely generic.



    3    It is quite incorrect to claim that the programme set out
         to    'prove'   that Kevin Williams was           alive    beyond 3.15pm;
         this complaint really does illustrate the fact that South

     miscarriages           of      justice      we    have      seen        recently,       many       of   T
     which have resulted in the prosecution of police officers.
     We    are,     frankly,        shocked       that this           approach seems to be
     endorsed by a Chief Constable. Against that background,                                            it
     is simply insulting to claim that we approached this matter
     with      a     'predetermined              attitude'            and     were        less        than
     objective. We investigated Debra's account very thoroughly
     indeed,        as   well       as   taking       careful         legal .advice          on       the
     divergence in her statements. Her insistence that the first
     statement is the truth is convincing and is corroborated.


     We therefore concluded that Debra Martin told the truth, as
     she insists           (not just to us)             in her first statement,                       and
     was bullied into changing it. The discrepancy between her
     statements          is      graphic      proof         of    that,        and     there          was
     corroborative evidence of the treatment                                  accorded to her.
     Any objective observer cannot fail to be struck by those
     discrepancies.           It is simply not good enough to ignore the
     first     account,          which     she    insists         is     the       truth,        simply
     because it does not fit. The 'bias' lies in those who seek
     to do just that, and not in the programme.                                    It was fear of
     precisely that kind of manipulation which led to the local
     ambulance        service        refusing         to    allow       their       staff        to    be
     interviewed by the police at all: statements were taken by
     their own solicitors.


     In any event,            it is simply not true that Debra's account
     was    inconsistent            with   the        video      evidence          taken     in       the
     mortuary.       On Mr Wells'           admission            that       footage    begins          at
     3.50pm:       leaving       ample     time       for     Debra's         attempt       to    save
     Kevin,        which      she     described         to       us     in     a    way     totally
     consistent with her first statement

     must have been about eleven or twelve, because, well he was
     small to my point of view and what stood out on him was the
     fact that he'd got a necklace with a little horn on it. He


                                           - 5 -
was laid there and this police officer looked at me and he
went "Oh, he's had it".


These boys were screaming "you've got to help him, you've
got to help him", and I said "I'm trying to do the best I
can". I bent down and I felt for a pulse, I could hardly
feel anything in his wrist at all, so I felt at his throat.
I applied a bit more pressure, and I actually got a little
flutter.   He was still pale,          but you could see a slight
greyness   coming     into   him    and   he'd   got    vomit   round   his
mouth.

We managed to get him into a recovery position. This other
policeman turned      round and said, "come             on we'll take him
into the gym". I had the bottom end,                   hetook thehead end
of the bill board and we ran.


We went into the gym and there was just bodies laid all
around and I think there was a doctor there. By then they'd
started cordoning the dead ones off the live ones.


I'd already started mouth to mouth on the actual pitch. I
started mouth to mouth again. As I say I continued CPR on
this little boy,      I had no idea what his name was and he
actually got a little bit of colour. And I don't know what
it was,    I   just   looked   at    him   and   Ipicked     him up.    I
actually cradled      him, and I thought "you are not going to
die, you cannot die".


I remember holding him and I thought "no he's only a baby,
it can't be happening".            So I held him,        and he actually
opened his eyes. It wasn't a definite stare at me, his eyes
just fluttered and he looked and he made a noise,                   and I
thought "I've got him, I've actually got him alive". As I
say, he made a noise and I looked again and I bent my head
down to him, and his eyes opened and he looked straight
ahead and he went "mum", and then his eyes fluttered again,


                               - 6 -
and he just seemed to slump back in my arms again. And I
just, I looked at him and I thought "no, there's something
wrong here".

I laid him flat again and gave him heart massage.                         This
police officer came up to me and what I didn't know was
there was a doctor there and he must have made a sign.to
him. I remember someone patting me on my back, and he said
"leave it love, he's dead". I went "no, he can't be", and
I know I continued with CPR. I was really going at him,
giving him mouth and a heart massage again, and then I was
pulled back and told "he's dead". Then I heard somebody's
voice saying "all the police officers with bodies, you've
got to stay in the gym".


I remember standing up and I thought "I've got to get out
of here, I really have", and then the other half of me was
saying "be sensible you've got to stay with your body".
That's what we were told,             you've    got    to stay with        the
bodies all the time.


So we stayed with the bodies, and by this time it was about
tan to four when I'd been told he was dead,                       and then a
doctor came round who had to certify proper death, and that
was    after   four    o'clock.      I remember       it    was   after   four
o'clock because I looked down at my watch, because again it
was a note that I'd got to make in my pocket book."



The evidence that Kevin was alive well                     after 3.15pm was
also supported by the evidence of PC Bruder,                      to which we
refer below.


Mr Wells makes much of the alleged 'bias' of the programme.
This    is   quite    unfair.   We    have   looked,        objectively    and
fairly,      at all the evidence.       This    is in contrast to the
police treatment of Debra Martin,              including the ludicrous


                                - 7 -
assertion that she was        not even at Hillsborough.              As Mr
Wells now accepts that Debra was seen in the police video,
that is demonstrably wrong, and we should repeat that the
investigating force involved has made no complaint.                      This
aspect of the matter does not concern South Yorkshire at
all. At the end of the day, what matters is that Debra


Martin was asked to sign a second statement which she did
not believe - and does not believe - to be the truth. This
is common ground.



Debra's original account made it clear that her attempt to
save Kevin was over just before 3.50pm,                 and not 3.55. We
made this abundantly clear in our update programme. Those
five minutes are entirely immaterial when set against the
Coroner's cut off point of 3.15.


Mr Wells' letter again shows how the evidence of PC Bruder
was 'massaged' to fit the police thesis, and this requires
little further comment from us. Again, Mr Wells ignores a
now corroborated statement which does not suit his purposes
in favour of a later ex post facto explanation put to PC
Bruder by police, while accusirfg 'The Cook Report' of bias
and a lack of objectivity. In fact, the Coroner himself now
accepts that PC Bruder's original statement that Kevin was
alive after 3.15 is corroborated by video footage, showing
the ambulance to which he originally referred. That footage
was available to the inquest, but was overlooked. We found
it,   and the Coroner very fairly admitted to us that                     it
removed the principal reason             which    cast     doubt    on    Mr
Bruder's evidence at the time.


Our   experience,    sadly,   does       not    bear    out   Mr   Wells'
statement    that   he   accepts   the    right    to    question    what
happened    at   Hillsborough.     We    knew    this    subject    was    a
sensitive and painful one, not least to the families, and
     we would not have made the programme unless our lengthy and
     painstaking research process had shown that the families
     had good reason to question the assumptions made in the
      aftermath of the disaster. We only set out to look at that
      aspect,    and our evidence was endorsed by expert medical
      opinion,        local   people,   first     hand     witnesses,     and
      politicians. In conclusion, we must say that we strongly
      reject     Mr    Wells' * imputations     upon     our   fairness   and
      integrity, coming as they do from someone who in his letter
      appears to endorse a manner of obtaining evidence which
      would not be acceptable to any court.



We stand by the programme 'Kevin's Mum': and we can present the
evidence in support of it should the Commission wish us to do so.


Yours sincerely

  anne    williams

  Dear Mr. Cook,           my name is Anne Williams,             I
  lost my fifteen year old son...



  EQGE r _c o o k
 Anne Williams lost her son Kevin                        at   the
 Hillsborough Football Disaster.




 And this with good               reason was a plea           for
 help.



 ANNE WILLIAMS
 I feel I have been lied to from the outset.
 I don't believe- that either                     I or   Kevin
 deserve this treatment.



ROGER     cook


And      neither      do    we.        T o ni g h t   evidence

still be alive today.

                                   And that's             not     all.      The   Cook    Report
                                    investigation           into the       last half hour of
                                   Kevin's         life,    shows that he died when he
                                    might have been saved.



                                    Mam's still           got the ticket that took Kevin
                                    into Sheffield Wednesday's home ground and
                                    down       the       tunnel     to    disaster   in    those
                                    hopelessly overcrowded terraces.



                                    Ninety five people were officially dead by
                                    three fifteen.              Kevin, circled in red, was
                                    pulled out at three twenty eight.



                                     Two men who carried him across the pitch
                                     say he was still alive.



                                     So does an off-duty policeman who gave him
                                     the kiss of            life twenty minutes after he
                                     was supposed to be dead.



                                     And      so     does    Debra       Martin   - much    later
                                      still.         More than enough evidence to make
                                      Kevin's mum and her MP want a new inquiry.

                              say that had you done your job.

                        ...as could be expected of you, their loved
                        ones might have survived.



                        Mr.    Duckenfield         is now retired on a twenty
                        five        thousand        pou nd      pension   -    though
                        instead of          exercising command on the day,
                       he'd     just       frozen,      according to the Taylor
                        Inquiry which also criticised senior police
                       officers for the quality of their evidence.



                       After        Lord    Justice       Taylor's    Inquiry,    the
                       parents were outraged when the inquest jury
                       returned a verdict of accidental death.



                       The coroner decided not to examine events
                       after         three       f i f t e en   because   he     said
                       whatever happened              later all      the casualties
                       had suffered the injuries that would                      lead
                       to their deaths by then.




                       However,           the   three    fifteen     cut off   point
                       also meant that the question of blame was
                       never considered.

                       There           a treatment one can give even in
                       the    field       for    this   type       of    injury,       it's
                       just merely to create an airway below the
                       level      of      damage,       a    knife,        a    pair    of
                       scissors        is sufficient          to create         it,    you
                       can even stick a needle through it, through
                       er a membrane            just below the voice box and
                       that would g i v p         enough air or a series of
                       needles,        wii]      give       enough       air    to    keep

                       So Kevin needn't have died?

                      It's possible that he could have been saved
                      if he had been .treated early enough,                          given
                      one    of     the    two    procedures            which   can     be
                      carried out          in this      situation;         if one of
                      them had been             carried     out,     he could have
                      been saved.

                      injured away from the crush.                      This went on
                      for almost half            an hour,      the period which

                            And I always remember her looking at me and
                            smiling     she       says    oh    there     is one message
                             I've     got    to    give    you.           I    says   'what's
                             that'?         So    she    says,      'we       don't   believe
                             you''.     So       I said    'I'm     sorry       you've     lost
                             me'.     She says          'we don't believe you',             she
                             says     'we think we've ..you've made ..you've
                             made     it all      up'.         I says         'made all what
                             up'?      so she says         'your first statement as
                             a matter        of   fact we don't               even think you
                             were at Hillsborough'.                     I says    'but I was
                             at Hillsborough'.                 So she says        'well,    the
                             message from my boss is he doesn't believe
                             a word you've said,                he thinks you've made
                              it all up.          He seems to think and I seem to
                              think that you're just doing this so that
                              you can get a bit of attention' and I just
                              broke    down,       I     just    couldn't        believe     it.
                              She says,       'we don't want to take your first
                              statement          into consideration,             we want you

          I think he was alive.             To this day I think
          that we wouldn't         have dragged him across,
          not with two policemen,             raced across fifty
          sixty yards of          football pitch and put him
          down if he wasn't alive.



          ROGER COOK
          After the stretcher bearers put Kevin down,
          twenty minutes after he was supposed to be
          dead, off-duty policeman Derek Bruder found
          a pulse and gave him the kiss of life.                      As
          a    serving       officer,          he     was    refused
          permission to talk to us but he ha^ talked
          to Kevin's mum.



          ANNE WILLIAMS
          The first thing I asked Mr. Bruder was, did
          he   remember       Kevin.          He     said   he'd     ..he
          remembered      Kevin     right     down     to his boxer
          shorts.        I    asked     Mr.        Bruder    why   he'd
          changed these statements,                why he'd changed
          all the signs of life.               Mr.    Bruder said he
          hadn't changed          these statements,          that the
          West Midlands Police came to him and when
          they came to him,         they came with a brief to
          get him to change his mind.

                                  t ry i n g      to save           their      friends     and    p ro bably
                                   their relatives,                  trying to get them back to
                                   life       and      they were             desperately        banging      on
                                   the      side       of     the       ambulance pointing             to the
                                   people          that       they        were       looking     after      and
                                   we'd been told that we                          ..we mustn't stop.

                                      passing at three thirty seven to put my son
                                      in    it but          it wouldn't stop for                 ..for Kevin
                                      um and at the end of the day,                             I asked him
                                      would he put              it in writing and he said no,

                                      wondering               why       he     was     never     called        to

                                       Kevin,         he would           stand up in court             and say
                                       that        Kevin        was          convulsing,         he'd       found

                                       that my son was alive.

                               said     'mum' and opened his eyes.                        It isn't

                     We're         not       talking           about        complicated
                     articulation,                    we're     talking       about      his
                     uttering the word                  'mum' and the word 'mum',
                     you     can       try       it    yourself,      can    be   er    said
                     without any movement of the tongue at all,
                     the tongue resting motionless on the floor
                     of the mouth                -    'mum'.        That    coupled with
                     the evidence I've er seen particularly from
                     WPC Martin,             I    believe      that he did say the
                     word      'mum'     and          if he said the word           'mum',
                    as you say, then he must have been alive at
                    that time.



                    ROGER COOK
                    As Debra Martin had claimed.                           However,     one
                    senior police officer from the Hillsborough
                    investigation,                    finds    it   hard     to   believe
                    that any of the officers                          involved      would
                    brow beat witnesses.

                                          means that none of this was ever inquired

                                memory       - but a number of families who have
                                 co-operated         in this        investigation,             believe
                                a proper        inquiry          would    make       it    easier      to
                                 live with.              Sandra    Stringer         lost her son,
                                 Paul.

                                 They    said       he was       brain    dead,       the coroner
                                 said he was dead before three                        fifteen.          I
                                 believe my son was unconscious                          in the bed.
                                 He     couldn't          have     been       dead        if   fie    was
                                 climbing           up    the      chap's       legs,          he     was
                                 fighting for his life screaming                          'please God
                                 don't       let me die'          so he couldn't have been
                                 dead,       a dead       person     can't      talk       ....and      I
                                 want    to    know       what     happened         to     him      after
                                 three       fifteen.             But    no    one'll          tell    me
                                 ...I've just had to go through videos and
                                 videos       and    ...I      just can't           .*.1 just want
                                 the truth so that I can begin to grieve for
                                 him.

Following the screening of the ‘Cook Report’ on Thursday 2 June 1994, research has been carried out
at this office to establish whether the programme revealed any new evidence from the events
surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.

Our in-depth examination of the programme contents established quite categorically that there was no
new evidence upon which to base any further enquiries. South Yorkshire Police do not find that
surprising. Lord Justice Taylor’s inquiry was thorough and far reaching, apportioning blame and making
recommendations. Lessons were learned. The inquest into the circumstances surrounding the victims
of the disaster was painstakingly ccrducted and the South Yorkshire Police co-operated fully with the
inquest proceedings. The application for a judicial review into the inquest findings/which as you know')
was refused, examined pertinent issues surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.         v

In addition, you will be aware that the independent Police Conplaints Authority supervised the
investigation conducted by the West Midlands Police and they have indicated their satisfaction with the
investigation.

Our research into the ‘Cook Report’ disclosed a number of discrepancies and I feel that some remarks
expressed in the programme were incorrect and misleading.

You may be aware that the South Yorkshire Police on learning that the ‘Cook Report’ was being
produced, requested an opportunity to assist or take part. That request was refused by the programme
makers.

It is felt that had the South Yorkshire Police been involved then a number of inaccuracies could have
been avoided, the effect being to give a more balanced view and cause less distress to a number of
interested parties. Those parties include bereaved families, people assisting on the day of the tragedy
and, of course, police officers involved, some of whom are still suffering.

The programme produced no new evidence or facts but my understanding of programme making is that
some footage gathered before the preparation of the programme is not always used in the final
transmission. You may wish to make that footage available to me for examination with a view to
shedding any further light on the accuracy of your programme and any other material you consider
would be helpful.

                                                                                              continued

To that end, I invite you or your representative to South Yorkshire Police Headquarters some time in
the immediate future to discuss those issues and for me to indicate to you the inaccuracies in the
screening of the ‘Cook Report’ on Thursday 2 June 1994. A similar invitation has been extended to
Sir Malcolm Thornton, the Member of Parliament representing Crosby, who also appeared in the
programme.

You will remember that I wrote to you on 10 June 1994, inviting you or your representative
to meet with my senior officers to discuss the contents of the 'Cook Report screened on
Thursday 2 June 1994. An invitation was also extended to Sir Malcolm Thornton.

David Allford, one of your Assistant Producers, met with members of the South Yorkshire
Police on Monday 20 June 1994, but it was rather disappointing that Sir Malcolm Thornton's
commitments would not allow him to attend. However, a meaningful discussion of the
issues in the 'Cook Report did take place and although David did not accept all the points
raised by the South Yorkshire Police he did concede that there were a number of material
discrepancies within the programme which failed to give it the necessary balance.

In particular, the performance of Debbie Martin on the programme and the allegations she
made were of interest to David Allford. David was shown video evidence of Debbie in the
gymnasium on the day of the tragedy and he agreed that she was in fact traumatised and
looking like a zombie. (Her words,you will recall from your programme). David was also
shown timed video evidence that Debbie Martin could not by any stretch of the imagination
have carried out the procedures she described in your programme and the allegation that
you make, on three occasions, that Kevin Williams was alive at 3 55pm has been refuted
beyond a shadow of doubt.

The 'Cook Report also attempted to portray Debbie Martin as an experienced police officer
when in fact she was a special constable of two years standing at the time of the tragedy.
As a special constable she was allowed to work a maximum of four hours a week and to
place her in the category of an 'expert witness' was misleading to say the least.

You will no doubt discuss our meeting with David and I hope he will convey to you our
sincerity in wishing to portray the facts as already established by the Lord Justice Taylor
inquiry, the inquests and, of course, the application for a Judicial Review. Whilst the
meeting did generate some heat at times, I feel that a great deal of light was also shed to
enable David to have a greater understanding of the facts as we know them.

Following the meeting, and at our request, David promised to seek advice on the availability
of any further information which he may have for our perusal. He also said he would
discuss matters with his lawyers and others with a view to letting me know your response to
the meeting.

Your programme showed nothing new and the facts as we presented them to David Allford
were gleaned from documentary evidence already in existence. I still feel that the
programme gave unrealistic expectations to bereaved families, particularly Mrs Williams,
creating a hope that a further inquiry would be launched.

All this is played out against the background of the South Yorkshire Police having
discovered by chance that you were making the programme and that when we asked if you
required our help, this offer was declined. I am sure you will wish to comment on this
refusal in the light of yesterday's meeting. Local media are pressing us for a revelation of
the outcome of our discussions and I hope to be able to answer them as soon as possible.

                                      23 June 1994


                                      Dear Chief Constable,
                                      Thank you for your letter of 21 June with reference to our
                                      programme on Hillsborough. I should make it clear at the outset
                                      that this programme was extremely carefully researched and we
                                      stand by it. To that extent, we are content to let it speak for
                                      itself, but there are a number of inaccuracies in your letter
                                      which require correction.
                                      David Alford did not accept that there were              'material
                                      discrepancies' in the programme, nor that it lacked balance. We
                                      dispute both propositions.    Certainly, there were a number of
                                      unexplained discrepancies in the various accounts of events at
                                      Hillsborough: that was the point of the prograpne. The families
                                      want these discrepancies explained, and you will recall that it
                                      was one of those families who brought the story to us.      So far
                                      as your reference to 'unrealistic expectations' is ■’oncerned, the
                                      affected families we have spoken to have been highly supportive
                                      of the programme.   We did not suggest that an inquiry would be
                                      forthcoming: only that it should be.

                                       Debra Martin was not put forward as an expert witness, and it is
                                       quite unfair to suggest that she was.    She was simply giving a
                                       first-hand account as someone who was there, and we made it clear
                                       (twice) that she was a Special Constable.    As Debra Martin was
                                       told by the police that she was not even at Hillsborough, the
                                       emergence of a restricted video, in which she appears, merely
                                       serves to reinforce the points she made in thp programme.
                                       Debra's account to us is in fact perfectly consistent with your
                                       own footage. She insists that Kevin Williams was alive, in the
                                       gymnasium, way beyond 3.15, after she had helped to carry him
                                       there.

You have stated on two occasions that our programme contained no
new evidence when the reverse is plainly the case. New evidence
included the ambulance, not revealed in the footage shown to the
inquest: confirmation that Kevin Williams may well have been
alive long after the coroner's cut-off point: and the pressure
placed on Debra Martin and PC Bruder to change their statements.
Clearly, one can simply accept, as the police have done, only
those accounts which fit a thesis and dismiss the rest. That is
not our approach.
Finally, I would reiterate that our programme referred to Mr
Duckenfield, and the criticisms made of him by Lord Justice
Taylor, together with the way in which West Midlands Police and
others handled the enquiries into the Hillsborough disaster. It
was not an attack on South Yorkshire Police, and it is a matter
of some regret to us that you have chosen to interpret it in that
way.

           Dear


           Following  the screening of the   'Cook Report' on Thursday 2 June 1994
           research has been carried out at this office to establish whether the
           programme  revealed any new  evidence  from the events  surrounding  the
           Hillsborough tragedy.

          Our   in-depth  examination of the      programme    contents  established   quite
          categorically that there was no new evidence upon which to base any further
          enquiries.      South   Yorkshire Police       do   not   find that    surprising
          Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry was       thorough and far reaching, apportioning
          blame and making recommendations.        Lessons were learned. The   inquest into
          the circumstances surrounding the     victims of the disaster was painstakinqlv
          conducted and the South Yorkshire Police co-operated fully with the inquest
          proceedings.      The application for a      judicial   review into the inquest
          findinis,   which   as you   know   was   refused,    examined  pertinent   issues
          surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.

          In addition, you will be aware that       the independent Police Complaints
          Authority supervised the investigation conducted by the West Midlands Police
          and they have indicated their satisfaction with the investigation.

          Our research into the 'Cook Report' disclosed a number of discrepancies
          and I feel that some remarks expressed in the programme were incorrect and
          misleading.


          You may be aware that the South Yorkshire Police on learning that the 'Cook
          Report' was being produced, requested an opportunity to assist or take part.
          That request was refused by the programme makers.




ADM/1 The m em ber of staff dealing with this correspondence is
It is felt that had the South Yorkshire Police been involved then a n-nber
of inaccuracies could have been avoided, the effect being to give a "more
balanced view and cause less distress to a number of interested parties.
Those parties include bereaved families, people assisting on the day of
the tragedy and, of course, police officers involved, some of whom are still
suffering.

Since the Cook programme was transmitted South Yorkshire Police officers
have met on two occasions with the Producers of the 'Cook Report' requesting
any  further,  additional   evidence  other  than  that transmitted  in  the
programme.  No such evidence has been forthcoming.

In the circumstances, therefore, the South Yorkshire Police are to make
a formal complaint to the Independent Television Commission concerning
inaccuracies in the programme.   Apart from that the South Yorkshire Police
will take no further action in this matter other than to await any further
legal developments that may be raised by others.

It is understood that an early day motion was introduced in the House of
Commons on Friday 24 June 1994, and a number of members have signed. There
are calls for a fresh inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster and the early
day motion is one aspect of the campaign to look again into the events on
that fateful day.

This letter is intended to give you a brief insight into why the early day
motion was introduced and I trust you will find it helpful.

Yours

Statement from South Yorkshire Police re:



"Cook Report" programme on Hillsborough                                       2 Jut



The account of former special constable Debra Martin, along with claims about
delays in providing medical care for the victims, have been widely reported by
the media nationally since February 1992.


They were considered in detail in November 1993 when the High Court dealt
with claims by the families of six victims that the original 96-day inquest by Dr
Stefan Popper had been improperly conducted. On 5 November, the High Court
judges dismissed the claims and said that there had been no improper conduct
during, nor suppression .of evidence for, the original inquest.


As far as we are aware, the Cook Report contains no significant new evidence
which has not already been presented for scrutiny in court.


However, we have not yet seen the programme and were not asked to
participate in it, even though we offered to do so this week after learning by
chance of its production.


Of course, if this programme or any other research uncovers firm new evidence
of any miscarriage of justice, we will examine it rigorously. The victims' families
are entitled to that.


What we could not condone would be the raking over of old embers for the sake
of entertainment. This does no-one any good, including those police officers
made ill by their Hillsborough experiences, who are also now trying to rebuild
their lives.

                          The Cook Report on Hillsborough




Since the Cook Report on the Hillsborough disaster was broadcast on 2
June, investigators at South Yorkshire have-been carefully examining the
contents of the programme. The Chief Constable had pledged that every
point would be scrutinised to establish whether the report contained any
new evidence.



The careful examination has confirmed senior officers' impressions, after
their first sight of the programme, that it contained no new evidence.


However, in order to be sure that nothing has been missed and that no
new evidence is contained in untransmitted material or research prepared
for the programme, Mr Wells has written to the head of Central Television
to invite him, and the Cook Report team, to discuss the contents face-to-
face. Sir Malcolm Thornton, MP for Crosby, has also been invited to the
meeting after his call on the programme for an analysis of the recent claims
of some witnesses.


The Chief Constable wants to reassure them that the issues have been
examined in detail and to explain the findings of that work.

                            SEQUENCE OF EVENTS


2 June 1994

Cook Report screened by Central Television.

Programme content examined in some detail.      No new evidence, the main
thrust of the programme being that Kevin Williams was alive after 3.15 p.m.
Allegations about witnesses not traced, evidence suppressed, pressure
placed on Debbie Martin and Police Constable Bruder changing his statement.
All were examined in some detail at the mini inquest into Kevin Williams
or at the application for a Judicial Review.


10 June 1994

Letter to Central Television and Sir Malcolm Thornton, who appeared in
the programme, inviting them to the South Yorkshire Police Headquarters
to discuss the programme content and point out inaccuracies and a lack
of balance in the programme.


20 June 1994

David Allford, Assistant Producer   of the Cook      Report, meets with senior
police    officers    of    South    Yorkshire.        Sir Malcolm Thornton MP,
unfortunately, could not attend.

David Allford admitted that mistakes had been made in that they had a
number of times which were incorrect,      they should not have included
David Duckenfield in the programme and they should have accepted our
request to take part in the making of the programme.



21 June 1994

Letter from South Yorkshire Police to the Editor of           Central   Television
outlining the content of the meeting on 20 June 1994.


23 June 1994

A reply from Central Television in the main refuting what took place at
the meeting on 20 June 1994 but it was significant that the ground was
beginrjing to shift, particularly with times involved.


25 June 1994

A request from Sylvia Jones, Producer of      the   Cook   Report,   for a further
meeting with the South Yorkshire Police.

At that time Sylvia Jones said that she accepted that mistakes            had been
made and   that   she would not have     made  the  programme in          the way
Peter Salkeld, the original Produer, had transmitted it.
26 June 1994

A   second   meeting   at   Police   Headquarters    with   Sylvia Jones      and
Peter Salkeld.

No new evidence was forthcoming and they       had   nothing   other   than   the
material transmitted on 2 June this year.



28   June 1994

Letters from this office to all Sheffield Constituency MP's            informing
them of the position to date. Merely for their information.



29 June 1994

A complaint has been made to the Independent Television        Commission about
the content of the Cook Report on 2 June 1994.

Following the screening of the ‘Cook Report1on Thursday 2 June 1994, research has been carried out
at this office to establish whether the programme revealed any new evidence from the events
surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.

Our in-depth examination of the programme contents established quite categorically that there was no
new evidence upon which to base any further enquiries. South Yorkshire Police do not find that
surprising. Lord Justice Taylor’s inquiry was thorough and far reaching, apportioning blame and making
recommendations. Lessons were learned. The inquest into the a'rcumstances surrounding the victims
of the disaster was painstakingly conducted and the South Yorkshire Police co-operated fufiy with the
inquest proceedings. The application for a judicial review into the inquest findings, which as you know
was refused, examined pertinent issues surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.

In addition, you will be aware that the independent Police Complaints Authority supervised the
investigation conducted by the West Midlands Police and they have indicated their satisfaction with the
investigation.

Our research into the “Cook Report* disclosed a number of discrepancies and I feel that some remarks
expressed in the programme were incorrect and misleading.

You may be aware that the South Yoncshire Police on learning that the “Cook Report’ was being
produced, requested an opportunity to assist or take part. That request was refused by the programme
makers.

It is felt that had the South Yorkshire Police been involved then a number of inaccuracies could have
been avoided, the effect being to give a more balanced view and cause less distress to a number of
interested parties. Those parties include bereaved families, people assisting on the day of the tragedy
and, of course, police officers involved, some of whom are still suffering.

The programme produced no new evidence or facts but my understanding of programme making is that
some footage gathered before the preparation of the programme is not always used in the final
transmission. I have asked the programme makers to make that footage available to me for
examination with a view to shedding any further light on the accuracy of the programme together with
any other material they consider would be helpful.

                                                                                            continued -

time in the immediate future to discuss those issues and for me to indicate to them the inaccuracies
in the screening of the ‘Cook Report’ on Thursday 2 June 1994. A similar invitation is extended to you
and perhaps you would let me know if you are available.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER        COOK REPORT


Just after forwarding my report to you I received a
copy of a letter (obviously at your instigation) regarding
the programme we discussed.

As a Government Minister I am unable to sign Early Day
Motions, but the enclosed booklet and my Briefing Note may
be helpful in putting EDMs into correct perspective.

However, I note the letter from your Discipline and Complaints
Department was forwarded to the Hallam Conservative Association
NQT to the above address hence the delay.

                           Early Day Motions    (EDMs)

Sometimes constituents write to me to request that I support a motion which is due
to be debated by the House of Commons.

After searching for the details of the motion in the House of Commons it is usually
to support an Early Day Motion or as they are known EDMs.

Accordingly, as your letter requests me to sign an EDM ,it may be helpful if I
explain what they are , the reasons for them and also the purpose they serve.

The term EDM is used for a notice of motion given by a member of Parliament for
which no date has been given to debate i t . In the vast majority of cases there is
absolutely no prospect whatsoever of any such motions , e v e r , being debated in
the House of Commons .

Their modern existence is due to members wishing to put on record their opinion
on a subject and then to canvas support for it from fellow members. This can be
done by constituents writing to their own Member of Parliament or by a member
after reading the EDM to sign i t . But I must also explain, that even though 250 Or
300 members may sign an EDM , it will still not be d eb ated .

The motion you request me to support is such a motion and therefore will not be
d e b a te d .

                              EARLY DAY MOTIONS

                                                                   rev ed August 1992




The Public Information Office is very often approached by people who have seen
reports in the press and elsewhere, such as "Mr ... MP has put down a Commons
motion against the closure o f the hospital a t ... ". In almost every case, that means
that the Member has put down an Early Day Motion - an explanation which, when
given, is extremely perplexing to anyone unacquainted with House of Commons jargon.

Early Day Motion is a colloquial term for a notice of motion given by a Member for
which no date has been fixed for debate, and it should be put on record from the outset
that in the vast majority of cases, there is absolutely no prospect of these motions ever
being debated. Their modern existence is due to Members wishing to put on record
their opinion on a subject and canvass support for it from fellow Members. They do
this by inviting, actively or passively, other Members to endorse the proposed motion.
But it must be emphasised that no matter though 250 or 300 Members might do this,
the lack of prospect of the motion being debated remains much the same.


History of the EDM

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, Members had ample opportunity to raise matters
of interest to them in debate, since a large part of the time of the House was available
for their Bills and Motions. Motions were notified to the House in general by a
Member announcing in the Chamber that he proposed to raise such and such a
question, though written notice could also be given. However, in the 1850s and 60s,
at the end of a session, when it was impractical to name actual dates, the practice grew
up of Members giving notice that they intended to raise matters at some future date (eg
Next session, at an early opportunity, etc) rather than on a specific date. Throughout
the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, moreover, the time available
for Private Members’ Bills and Motions became smaller and smaller as Governments
took more and more Commons time.

 By 1865 a separate section, headed Notices o f Motions for which no days have been
fixed, was appearing in the daily Notice Paper regularly throughout the Session. Some
 of the Motions were actually intended for debate, and others were expressions of
 opinion. More than one Member might submit the same Motion in order to
 demonstrate solidarity or the strength of feeling on an issue. By 1921, more than one
 name was commonly seen, but the text of the Motion was not repeated for each name.
It was presumably reckoned that each name was in fact separately submitting the same
Motion, and each name was given a fresh number in the list as if a separate Motion.
By 1928 the majority of such motions were submitted in multiple names, but never
more than six were prefaced to each: the practice had not grown up of attracting tens
or hundreds of signatures. This development took place in the 1930s; by 1943 the
system was in operation much as at present, and the Clerks at the Table were
compiling a listing and index of EDMs in much its present form. From 1944, a
number was allocated to each Motion, to facilitate reference to them. Appendix 1
gives the numbers of EDMs presented in each session since 1939.

In the 1940s, the phrase An Early Day was often appended to each Motion - this
probably being the genesis of the colloquial name still used - meaning the motion was
for debate, theoretically, on some date in the near future. (The phrase has now been
moved to the head of the EDM section of the Notice Paper). It should be noted that
not all EDMs in the 1940s were from backbenchers; some Ministers gave notice of
their intention to bring in Bills thus (the Bill which became the Education Act 1944 was
one of them) and the Chairman of Ways and Means even gave notice of amendments
to be moved to Private Bill Standing Orders in this way.

The 1940s saw developments in the EDM probably because the war footing of the
Commons meant that time for debate of Private Members’ Motions and Bills was not
available. The EDM thus may have gained an impetus as a vehicle for the expression
of views from the lack of alternative - and possibly more effective - means of such
expression. Some motions at this time attracted large numbers of signatures - for
instance, the 279 appended to a 1942-43 Motion on Nazi massacres.

It will be seen that in the 1950s there were approximately 100 EDMs each Session. By
the late 1960s this had risen to about 400 and by the early 1980s to about 700. The
thousand mark was first passed in the long Session of 1983-84; the Session 1985-86
saw 1262 EDMs, a virtual doubling of the numbers usual at the beginning of the
decade. By the end of the decade, 1400 in an average session was the norm.


How EDMs are Tabled and Printed

Members give notice of their motion by handing in its text to the Table Office, which
is part of the Department of the Clerk of the House, with or without a heading or short
title. A Motion might bear only the one name or may be submitted with a hundred or
more. A specially printed form is provided for Members on which to submit their
Motions, but they are not obliged to use it. The forms provide spaces for six main
sponsors and 50 further names; the short title of the Motion and its text; the word that,
with which all motions begin, is also printed.

After the EDM has been checked for conformity with the rules of the House (which
are the same for all Motions whether for a specified day or not) it is printed. The first
printing (and all subsequent printings) appear in the section of the Vote Bundle (see
Factsheet No 26) called Notices o f Questions and Motions - issued normally the
following day. (EDMs are not printed in the Order Paper.) This sets out the Motion
with the names of up to six sponsors selected by the Member in charge prefacing it,
and the other supporters, if any, following it, in the order in which they were
submitted. Each EDM is given a running number and this must be quoted in
juxtaposition with the session (eg EDM No 387, sess 1988-89), if there is any doubt,
since the numbers begin again at 1 each session. The pages of the Notice Paper
concerning EDMs now have a separate sequence of numbers from those connected with
Questions and other notices. The Notice Paper is colloquially known as "the blues".

EDMs may of course be referred to in debate. In particular, they are often mentioned
during Business Questions.

Some typical EDM entries in the Notice Paper are shown in Appendix 3.



Supporting EDMs

The Motion can be signed by additional Members on subsequent days. Commonly,
Members do this by tearing out pages from their copy of the Blues and signing below
the chosen Motion or Motions. The pages are then handed to the Table Office, who
cause the EDM (together with its six sponsors, but not others who have assented
previously) to be reprinted in the next Notice Paper with the new names appended.
Alternatively, Members will often simply give the Table Office the relevant number
and ask for their name to be added. A running total of the number of signatures to
date is also printed.

In an average Session only about six or seven EDMs reach over 200 signatures, but
perhaps 70 or 80 get over 100 signatures. Quite a number will attract only one or a
couple of signatures. Appendix 2 provides a list of EDMs since 1939 which have-
attracted 300 or more signatures.

In 1976, the Services Committee recommended that when EDMs had names added to
them, only the title of the Motion - not its text - and the names of the six sponsors,
should be reprinted; and these details be immediately followed by the added name(s).
This, it was said, would save HMSO £45,000 p.a. in printing costs, and expedite
delivery of the Vote Bundle. The House agreed to this for an experimental period of
a Session on 18 January 1977; the experiment began the next week, but after only eight
weeks the Chairman of the Sub-Committee responsible for the suggestion admitted the
experiment had not been a success. Proposing an amendment would cause the text of
the EDM to be reprinted: on 15 March 1977 a Member (Mr N Winterton) put down
insubstantial amendments to every EDM, thus causing all of the 229 then current to be
reprinted. This action attracted comment in the Chamber the next day, and the
experiment was ended soon afterwards. An EDM about the printing of EDMs itself
attracted 68 signatures.

From 5 April 1989, it was decided to reprint the texts of old (over two weeks since
first put down) motions, when additional names had been subscribed, only on Thursday
of each week. In 1988-89 the estimated cost of printing EDMs was £763,000.
Types of EDM and their purpose

It has sometimes been said that the EDM is the last test of parliamentary opinion,
unalloyed by party discipline, which is left to Members. Certainly, EDMs are of
several distinct groups and of none. Firstly, the opposition may put down an EDM
qua opposition: many appear in the name of the Leader of the Opposition or of
another opposition party to pray against Statutory Instruments. This is how the
Opposition gives public notice that it may seek to secure a debate; and this type of
EDM is to all intents and purposes about the only one ever debated.

Secondly, a group within a party might put down an EDM. This may express a view
deviant to or beyond that of the party concerned, and Motions put down by
Government backbenchers may seek to accelerate or otherwise change Government
action. One of the smaller parties may put down a Motion to publicise its policy on
a subject.

Another type frequently found is the all-party motion, which expresses a view across
party divides, often on social issues; or one which, largely promoted by one party, can
attract signatures from a section of another. All-party motions are on the increase, and
a great deal of work may go into their compilation. In the nature of things it is
generally only all-party motions which can obtain very large numbers of signatures.
A glance at the titles of such motions given in Appendix 2 will give an idea of the
subjects which have regularly commanded very wide support. When looking at an
EDM, scrutiny of the names of the six sponsors will usually provide a clue as to its
type. Certain motions, especially of the all-party category, are suggested to Members
by pressure groups outside the House, and such organisations often go to much trouble
in trying to persuade Members to sign "their" motion.

Some EDMs are completely ephemeral in character - those offering congratulations to
a particular football or cricket club are a case in point (it has been known for two
parties to sign separate but virtually identical EDMs on this sort of thing) and others
relate to local issues - for instance criticising the decision to close a post office or
hospital, or purely personal matters (eg a deportation or similar case).

Members often seek to draw up an EDM if they have been debarred from putting down
Questions on a subject because of the House’s rules.


Duration of EDMs

EDMs remain current for the rest of the Session in which they were put down and
extra names can be added at any time during their currency. For the first two weeks,
motions are reprinted when new names are added; thereafter, they are reprinted only
on Thursdays. Before each parliamentary recess, the Table Office prints a list of
EDMs which records their titles in numerical order, the date of first printing and total
number of signatories to date. This is issued with the Blues. Before April 1989 this
index was published each Saturday.

At the end of the Session all EDMs fall, but can be introduced again in the new
Session. However, they do not carry forward the signatures appended to them in the
previous Session. Some EDMs reappear session after session.
Who may sign EDMs

Any Member may formulate or sign an EDM. There are - as cited above -historical
instances of Ministers having done so, but no recent examples. The Official
Opposition regularly promote them. For instance, as mentioned before, prayers against
Statutory Instruments are put down in this way, and also Motions of Censure - the
Motion eventually approved by the House which led to the fall of the 1974-79 Labour
Government started out as an EDM - see Appendix 3. Similarly, a Motion put down
by one or more of the smaller parties will often be in the names of the party leader and
principal spokesmen. In general, Ministers and Whips do not sign EDMs, and some
Ministers have taken a dim view of their Parliamentary Private Secretaries’ doing so.
Neither the Speaker nor Deputy Speakers will sign such Motions.

Members themselves sometimes cannot remember whether they have signed and may
seek to assent twice or more, though in such cases only the original signature would
be counted in the total.


Amendments

A Member may put down an amendment or amendments to another Member’s EDM,
but he cannot submit an amendment if he or she has signed the Motion (which indicates
his concurrence with the whole of the proposition therein). In order to do this he
would have to withdraw his name from the main Motion.

Some amendments advance a view diametrically opposed to that offered by the main
Motion and may advocate the replacement of the whole text from "that" with an
alternative proposition on the same subject, whilst others may seek additional or
strengthening provisions.

Members sign amendments in the same way as main Motions, and the Notice Paper
counts and records these in exactly the same way. Members can therefore solicit
support for amendments; it is by no means unknown for an amendment to garner more
support than the original Motion.


Withdrawal of EDMs and withdrawal of names

A Member may withdraw an EDM put down in his or her name without reference to
any of those who have signed it. Members may also withdraw their names from
motions or amendments. In either case, the notification of withdrawal is made as a
Memorandum at the end of the EDM section of the Blues; together with any
corrigenda; the motion is then marked * in subsequent listings.


Cumulations of names of those signing EDMs

The Public Information Office is often asked where a complete list of Members who
have signed a particular EDM may be had. Up to the end of the 1987-88 Session such
lists were not published anywhere, and neither was the Public Information Office in a
position to say whether or not a certain Member had signed particular EDMs.
From the 1988-89 Session onwards, POLIS, the Parliamentary On-Line Information
System, has included all the signatories to EDMs. Lists of those who have signed
particular EDMs, or of all the EDMs a certain Member has endorsed, may therefore
be had from the Public Information Office, but a short delay can be involved in the
delivery of a print. The Public Information Office cannot undertake extended or
unreasonably long searching. The list of names should be correct to within 1-2 days
of the enquiry. Similarly, it is possible to isolate the date of the notice paper on which
the signature of a Member was recorded, and the titles of all the EDMs a Member has
signed.

The House of Lords Record Office is the most convenient repository for researches
into old EDMs, since they have both the papers concerned and expertise in their use.
They would also be able to obtain and copy from the cumulations made up by the
House of Commons Library, which were prepared from 1944 to 1989, and hard copy
derived from POLIS thereafter. There is a charge for photocopying.


Number of signatures

The record for most signatures on an EDM is quite an old one: that on service
pensions, put down on 6 February 1964 by Sir Robert Cary, which attracted 482
signatures. A list of all those main motions which have had 300 or more signatures
since 1939-40 is given in Appendix 2. Readers should note there are quite a number
of very popular EDMs which do not appear in this Appendix if they took the form of
a main motion, with 250 signatories and a strengthening or neutral amendment with
100. Similarly, no attempt has been made to add amendment signatures to the figures
given: these are signatures on the main motion only. No account is taken of any
signatures withdrawn.

The Early Day Motion is a much-used device and one which is obviously attractive to
Members. It is certainly a means of making a political point and in some cases of
attracting publicity to a cause, and can be an attempt to prod the Government into
action or to prevent certain developments. But in parliamentary terms, the EDM
virtually never has any direct consequence. It may be taken as a barometer of opinion,
but it is often argued that most EDMs attract a predictable following. Public interest
in them, which is well known to Members, and of which the Public Information Office
has daily ample evidence, perhaps in itself demonstrates their purpose. Even if an
EDM does not attract wide national press coverage it may well receive attention locally
or regionally.
Some thirty years ago, a commentator called EDMs spontaneous unwhipped backbench
manifestoes. EDMs, as this Factsheet has tried to point out, may not be spontaneous,
nor unwhipped, at least in an unofficial sense. Some, as we have seen, are not signed
only by backbenchers, and few are manifestoes. Yet the sense of the quotation does
in many cases still hold true, for they are most certainly an indication of what
Members feel strongly about.



The writer of this Factsheet is very grateful to the Table Office, and in particular to
Mr L L Kaye and Dr C R M Ward, for giving valuable help in the production of these
notes.

          Thank you very much for your letter of 28th June about

           COMPLAINT A G A IN S | "THE COOK REPORT" (CENTRAL TV)

           On behalf of South Yorkshire Police, I wish to make a formal complaint against "The
           Cook Report" (Central TV), in respect of the programme entitled "Kevin’s Mum"
           broadcast on 2 June 1994.

           W e feel that the programme was incorrect in materia! details and, consequently, was
           neither fair nor impartial- The South Yorkshire Police discovered by chance that the
           programme was being made. The West Midlands Police enquiry into the action taken
           at the Hillsborough Disaster was conducted at our request, their investigators acting
           as my agents - hence my interest and concern. When we asked, having discovered
           that work was taking place on the broadcast, for the programme-makers to accept our
           help, the offer was refused. South Yorkshire Police was misrepresented by not being
           allowed to take part.

           There is much evidence in our possession which could1have been included in the
           programme for balance (its consideration might even have prompted a rethink on the
           validity of the project) and which clearly disproves several key claims of the
           programme.

           A summary of our key .points, which should explain our complaint in greater detail, is
           attached.

     W e are very disappointed to have to take the unprecedented step of using this ■formal
     complaints^procedure. W e have resorted to it only af^er
     meetings with representatives of the programme which, in spite of some private
     admissions on their part of weaknesses in the programme, did not result in any public
     apology for, or retractiqn of any aspect of it.

     Ad an active supporter Iof openness and co-operation with the media, 1 have never
     dfsPr d T u r n a K h t to examine and question the, tart>le a«erma,h of « »
     Hillsborough Disaster. Many have done so and we have often co-operated,
     surelv onlv serve the public interest if the report concerned is researched and
     presented fairly, accurately and without bias. Sadly, "The Cook Report" has fallen
     short of that standard on this occasion and, because of the programme s sound track
     record and popularity, we felt it was important to challenge their behaviour and
      judgement.

      W e would welcome the Commission's scrutiny of this matter and
      participate, and for relevant police staff to participate, in any enquiry you might wish
      to conduct.

      If you need to clarify anything at this stage, please contjct, in the first instance, my
      Head of Press and Public Relations, Mrs Giilian R addiff*, on 0742 5231 SO.

              SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE COMPLAINT - THE COOK REPORT"

                                     SUMMARY OF MAIN POINTS



      1       South Yorkshire Police is, unfortunately, inextricably linked with the
              Hillsborough Disaster and any programme criticising the emergency response
              is bound to reflec# on the actions and reputation of the force. Some criticisms
              were specifically aimed at West Midlands Police, who were given an
              opportunity to respond, but the general allegation of a cover-up of the truth
              taints both forces as well as the Coroner's court and other parts of the judicial
              system. At no time was this force offered an input to the programme. The
              force press office telephoned them twice in the week before the broadcast, after
               hearing rumours that researchers had made approaches to some former
               officers involved in the disaster Neither call received the courtesy of a
               response. Two days before the broadcast, after hearing more detail about the
               expected nature of the programme from West Midlands Police, the press office
               tried again and was eventually allowed to speak to researcher David Alford, He
               declined an offer of input to the programme, thereby spoiling its potential
                  balance.

      2           The announcer, speaking in the commercial break before the programme,
                  referred to Roger Cook exposing more "shady characters". Coupled with the
                  Radio Times entry about "The Cook Report" that week, which was in a similar
                  vein this is a rather unfortunate preamble to what should have been an
                  unbiased examination of a terrible tragedy and serves to emphasise the
                  weighting of the programme to our detriment.

       3          The programme clearly set out to "prove1* that Mrs William's son was alive
                  beyond 3 15 pm, a claim made by one former special constable. Debra Martin
                  had given her account of a resuscitation attempt in her original statement, but
                  had changed it later when West Midlands officers explained that her story did
                  not fit in with the available video evidence of her actions in the mortuary at the
                  relevant time. The programme's determination to tell and support only Debra’s
                  original story shows a bias, which permeated the whole programme.
                  Cook made it clear from the beginning of the programme that he had no doubts
                  about the facts as he saw them: 'Tonight, evidence previously disregarded or
                  altered under duress and witnesses previously ignored demonstrate that Kevin
                  and others could still be alive today, " he said.

                   Such opinions reflect, in our view, predetermined attitudes on the part of the
                   programme makers, rather than objective investigation of the range of issues
                   involved.

     4           There are a number of inaccuracies in the programme. Just one example is
                 that emphasis is placed on the timing of alleged events, particularly 3,55 pm,
                 the significant investigative time at which Debra .Martin claims that Kevin
                 Williams stirred apd spoke. Times are used throughout the Report to underpin
                 its claims on 'new evidence' sufficient to re-open inquest proceedings. But, we
                 have a timed vid$o film of the temporary mortuary where Debra was standing
                 by Kevin's body, end, at 3,55 pm there is nothing at all to support her account
                 of what happened. The video reading takes in 'panned’ coverage of the area
                 in which Debra i$ standing between 3.50 pm and 4,10 pm. W e would have
                 been willing to show this to programme researchers had we been asked about
                 it before the broadcast and we are sure this would have created serious doubt
                 about Debra's sttpry.

                 Much was also npade of the evidence of a serving Merseyside Police officer,
                 PC Bruder, who was portrayed as a witness supporting the evidence that Kevin
                 W iliam s was alive beyond 3.15 pm. PC Bruder's evidence does not, in fact,
                 support this view- He tried in vain to resuscitate Kevin Williams, at first
                 believing him to be still alive. Later, however, after medical training, PC Bruder
                 made it clear to investigators that he no longer believed Kevin had been alive
                 and that his small movements were actually just post mortem effects. As with
                 many other aspects of the Report's "evidence", their version does not stand up
                 to scrutiny when $et against other verifiable testimony, whether through expert
                 opinion or fact.

       Police was misrepresented by not being allowed to take part. There is much evidence
       in our possession which oould have been included in the programme for balance - and
       might even have prompted a rethink on the validity of the project - and which clearly
       disproves several key claims of the programme.

       A summary of our key points, which should explain our complaint in greater detail, is
       attached.

       We are very disappointed to have to take the unprecedented step, for South Yorkshire
       Police, of using this forn>al complaints procedure. We have resorted to it only after
       two long and detailed meetings with representatives of the programme which, in spite
       of some private admissions on their part of weaknesses in the programme, did not
       result in any public apology for, or retraction of any aspect! of it.

       As an active supporter of openness and co-operation with] the media, I have never
       disputed journalists' right to examine and question the terrible aftermath of the
       Hillsborough disaster. Many have done so and we have often co-operated. This can
       surely only serve the public interest, however, if the report concerned is researched
       and presented fairly, accurately and without bias. Sadly, "The Cook Report" has fallen
       short of that standard on this occasion and, because of the programme’s sound track
       record and popularity, we felt it was vitally important to challenge their behaviour.

                    SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE COMPLAINT - 'THE COOK REPORT"

                                         SUMMARY OF MAIN POINTS



         1          South Yorkshire Police is, unfortunately, inextricably linked with the
                    Hillsborough disaster and any programme criticising the emergency response
                    is bound to reflect on the actions and reputation of tHie force. Some criticisms
                    were specifically aimed at West Midlands Poliqe, who were given an
                    opportunity to respond, but the general allegation of a cover-up of the truth
                    taints both forces as well as the Coroner's court and other parts of the judicial
                    system. At no time was this force offered an input to the programme. The
                    force press office telephoned them twice in the week before the broadcast, after
                    hearing rumours that researchers had made approaches to some former
                    officers involved in the disaster. Neither call received the courtesy of a
                    response. Two days before the broadcast, after hearing more detail about the
                    expected nature of the programme from West Midlands Police, the press office
                    tried again and was eventually allowed to speak to researcher David Alford. He
                    declined an offer of input to the programme, thereby spoiling its potential
                    balance.

        2           The announcer, speaking in the commercial break before the programme,
                    referred to Roger Cook exposing more "shady characters". Coupled with the
                    Radio Times entry about "The Cook Report" exposing corruption, this is a
                    rather unfortunate preamble to what should have been an unbiased
                    examination of a terrible tragedy and serves to emphasise the weighting of the
                    programme to our detriment.

        3           The programme cplearly set out to "prove" that Mrs William’s son was alive
                    beyond 3.15 pm, a claim made by one former special constable. Debra Martin
                    had given her account of a resuscitation attempt in her original statement, but
                    had changed it later when West Midlands officers explained that her story did
                    not fit in with the available video evidence of her actions in the mortuary at the
                    relevant time. The programme's determination to tell and support only Debra's
                    original story shows a bias, which permeated the whole programme. Roger
                    Cook made it clear from the beginning of the programme that he had no doubts
                    about the facts as he saw them: "Tonight, evidence previously disregarded or
                    altered under duress and witnesses previously ignored demonstrate that Kevin
                    and others could still be alive to d a y ," he said. Such opinion may have been
                    acceptable had it come from one of the aggrieved relatives, but shows a
                    complete mind sat on the part of the production team, which amounted to a
                    prosectfion of the police role rather than an investigation into it.

                  There are a number of inaccuracies in the programme. Just one example is
                  that emphasis is placed on the timing of alleged evehts, particularly 3.55 pm,
                 the time at which Debra Martin claims that Kevin Williams sat up and spoke!
                 At this point, we have a timed video film of the temporary mortuary where
                  Debra was standing by Kevin’s body and there is nothing at all to support her
                 account of what happened. W e would have been willing to show this to
                 programme researchers had we been asked about it before the broadcast and
                 we are sure this w<puld have created serious doubt about Debra's story. Much
                 was also made ofi the evidence of a serving Merseyside Police officer, PC
                 Bruder, who was portrayed as a witness supporting the evidence that Kevin
                 Williams was alive beyond 3.15 pm. PC Bruder's evidence does not, in fact
                 support this view. He tried in vain to resuscitate Kevin Williams, at first
                 believing him to be still alive. Later, however, after medical training, PC Bruder
                 made it clear to investigators that he no longer believed Kevin had been alive
                 and that his small movements were actually just post mortem effects. As with
                 many other aspects of the Report's ’’evidence", their version does not stand up
                 to scrutiny when set against the verifiable evidence.

                 'T H E COOK REPORT*       -     THURSDAY 2 JUNE 1 9 9 4                -    UPDATE



/4 Message      concerning      the    'Cook    Report'        was    circulated            to    the    force    on

   Wednesday 22 June 1994             outlining        action        taken     at       that      time     and    an

   indication      that      further     information          would    be     circulated           as    and   when

   it became available.


   Since the Cook programme was transmitted South Yorkshire Police officers

   have   met    on    two    occasions        with     the    Producers          of    the      'Cook     Report'

   requesting any further,             additional evidence other than that transmitted

   in the programme.           No such evidence has been forthcoming.


   In   the   circumstances,           therefore,       the     South       Yorkshire            Police    are    to
   make   a     formal       complaint     to     the     Independent             Television            Commission

   concerning         inaccuracies,       misrepresentation                 and        unfairness         in     the

   programme      content.       Apart     from       that    the     South       Yorkshire        Police      will
   take no further        action       in this matter other than to await any further

   legal developments that may be raised by others.

         Dear

         Following the screening of the     'Cook Report' on Thursday 2 June 1994,
         research has been carried out at this office to establish whether the
         programme  revealed   any new evidence  from the  events surrounding the
         Hillsborough tragedy.

         Our  in-depth    examination   of   the   programme   contents  established quite
         categorically that there was no new evidence upon which to base any further
         enquiries.     South    Yorkshire    Police    do   not   find  that   surprising.
         Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry was thorough and far reaching, apportioning
         blame and making recommendations.        Lessons were learned.    The inquest into
         the circumstances surrounding the victims of the disaster was painstakingly
         conducted and the South Yorkshire Police co-operated fully with the inquest
         proceedings.    The application     for a     judicial  review into the inquest
         findings,   which    as  you   know   was   refused,   examined  pertinent  issues
         surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.

         In addition, you will be aware that the independent Police Complaints
         Authority supervised the investigation conducted by the West Midlands Police
         and they have indicated their satisfaction with the investigation.

         Our research into the 'Cook Report' disclosed a number of discrepancies
         and I feel that some remarks expressed in the programme were incorrect and
         misleading.

         You may be aware that the South Yorkshire Police on learning that the 'Cook
         Report' was being produced, requested an opportunity to assist or take part.
         That request was refused by the programme makers.

It is felt that had the South Yorkshire Police been involved then a number
of inaccuracies could have been avoided, the effect being to give a more
balanced view and cause less distress to a number of interested parties.
Those parties include bereaved families, people assisting on the day of
the tragedy and, of course, police officers involved, some of whom are still
suffering.

Since the Cook programme was transmitted South Yorkshire Police officers
have met on two occasions with the Producers of the 'Cook Report' requesting
any  further,  additional   evidence  other  than  that transmitted  in the

inaccuracies in the programme.   Apart from that the South Yorkshire Police
will take no further action in this matter other than to await any further
legal developments that may be raised by others.

It is understood that an early day motion was introduced in the House of
Commons on Friday 24 June 1994, and a number of members have signed. There
are calls for a fresh inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster and the early
day motion is one aspect of the campaign to look again into the events on
that fateful day.

This letter is intended to give you a brief insight into why the early day
motion was introduced and I trust you will find it helpful.

the tragedy and, of course, police officers involved, some of whom are still
suffering.

Since the Cook programme was transmitted South Yorkshire Police officers
have met on two occasions with the Producers of the 'Cook Report' requesting
any   further,  additional   evidence  other  than  that transmitted in the
programme.   No such evidence has been forthcoming.

In the circumstances, therefore, the South Yorkshire Police are to make
a formal complaint to the Independent Television Commission concerning
inaccuracies in the programme.   Apart from that the South Yorkshire Police
will take no further action in this matter other than to await any further
legal developments that may be raised by others.

It is understood that an early day motion was introduced in the House of
Commons on Friday 24 June 1994, and a number of members have signed. There
are calls for a fresh inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster and the early
day motion is one aspect of the campaign to look again into the events on
that fateful day.

This letter is intended to give you a brief insight into why the early day
motion was introduced and I trust you will find it helpful.

         Dear

         Following the screening of    the   'Cook Report' on Thursday 2 June 1994,
         research has been carried out at this office to establish whether the
         programme  revealed   any new  evidence  from the  events surrounding  the
         Hillsborough tragedy.

         Our  in-depth    examination  of  the   programme    contents  established  quite
         categorically that there was no new evidence upon which to base any further
         enquiries.     South   Yorkshire   Police    do   not    find  that   surprising.
         Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry was thorough and far reaching, apportioning
         blame and making recommendations.      Lessons were learned.     The inquest into
         the circumstances surrounding the victims of the disaster was painstakingly
         conducted and the South Yorkshire Police co-operated fully with the inquest
         proceedings.    The application   for a     judicial   review into the inquest
         findings,   which   as  you  know   was   refused,    examined  pertinent  issues
         surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.

         In addition, you will be aware that the independent Police Complaints
         Authority supervised the investigation conducted by the West Midlands Police
         and they have indicated their satisfaction with the investigation.

         Our research into the 'Cook            Report' disclosed a number of discrepancies
         and I feel that some remarks           expressed in the programme were incorrect and
         misleading.

         You may be aware that the South Yorkshire Police on learning that the 'Cook
         Report' was being produced, requested an opportunity to assist or take part.
         That request was refused by the programme makers.

     Following      the    Hillsborough    Disaster,   policy   was    formulated          concerning
     supplying statements of police officers and others to interested parties.


     Extracts from the policy files are attached and you will see that basically we
     do not supply unless           the statement maker agrees.       Some officers do,             some
     don *t .


     We have adhered to this policy for the past 4/5 years.

                          the Police Federation is that the Je^ ^ ° " f^ ^ h^ o m rwhom




    such a request.           ,     decision."
    should then make      his/her




          b       Request for Copy Statements of someone other than the maker
                                                                           r<* s'ix
1                 Again with the exception referred to at (a) there can be no objection
                  in law to providing copies as long as there is a written authorisation
                  from the maker of the statement. Where previous requests have been
                  refused the potential criticism referred to at (a) is relevant.

Just a brief note to let you know that l have received your letter of 7 June.

I’m looking into your request for copies of the two officers’ statements, and I’ll write to
you again soon.

                      23 June 1994


                      Dear Chief Constable,
                      Thank you for your letter of 21 June with reference to our
                      programme on Hillsborough. I should make it clear at the outset
                      that this programme was extremely carefully researched and we
                      stand by it. To that extent, we are content to let it speak for
                      itself, but there are a number of inaccuracies in your letter
                      which require correction.

                      David Alford did not accept that there were             'material
                      discrepancies' in the programme, nor that it lacked balance. We
                      dispute both propositions.    Certainly, there were a number of
                      unexplained discrepancies in the various accounts of events at
                      Hillsborough: that was the point of the programme. The families
                      want these discrepancies explained, and you will recall that it
                      was one of those families who brought the story to us.     So far
                      as your reference to 'unrealistic expectations' is concerned, the
                      affected families we have spoken to have been highly supportive
                      of the programme.   We did not suggest that an inquiry would be
                      forthcoming: only that it should be.

                      Debra Martin was not put forward as an expert witness, and it is
                      quite unfair to suggest that she was.    She was simply giving a
                      first-hand account as someone who was there, and we made it clear
                      (twice) that she was a Special Constable.    As Debra Martin was
                      told by the police that she was not even at Hillsborough, the
                      emergence of a restricted video, in which she appears, merely
                      serves to reinforce the points she made in the programme.
                      Debra's account to us is in fact perfectly consistent with your
                      own footage. She insists that Kevin Williams was alive, in the
                      gymnasium, way beyond 3.15, after she had helped to carry him
                      there.

You have stated on two occasions that our programme contained no
new evidence when the reverse is plainly the case. New evidence
included the ambulance, not revealed in the footage shown to the
inquest: confirmation that Kevin Williams may well have been
alive long after the coroner's cut-off point: and the pressure
placed on Debra Martin and PC Bruder to change their statements.
Clearly, one can simply accept, as the police have done, only
those accounts which fit a thesis and dismiss the rest. That is
not our approach.

Finally, I would reiterate that our programme referred to Mr
Duckenfield, and the criticisms made of him by Lord Justice
Taylor, together with the way in which West Midlands Police and
others handled the enquiries into the Hillsborough disaster. It
was not an attack on South Yorkshire Police, and it is a matter
of some regret to us that you have chosen to interpret it in that
way.

Yours sincerely,

 It is felt, had the South Y o r k s h i r e Police been involved, then a

                       'The Cook Report'     - Thursday 2 June 1994




Following the screening of the 'Cook Report' on Thursday 2 June 1994 research has been
carried out at this office to establish whether the programme revealed any new evidence
from the events surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.

Our in-depth examination of the programme contents established quite categorically that
there was no new evidence upon which to base any further enquiries. South Yorkshire
Police do not find that surprising,, in view of the cumulative evidence gathered by Lord
Justice Taylor's inquiry, the inquest and- the W est Midlands enquiry supervised by the
Police Complaints Authority independently lessons were learned . Likewise, the application
for a judicial review into the inquest findings, which as you know was refused* oxamined
pertinent issuot; surrounding the I lillsborough tragedy-.

The South Yorkshire Police, on learning that the 'Cook Report' was being produced,
requested an opportunity to assist or take part.   That request was refused by the
programme makers.

It is felt that,had the South Yorkshire Police been involved,then a number of inaccuracies
could have been avoided, the effect being to give a more balanced view and cause less
distress to a number of interested parties. Those parties include bereaved families, people
assisting on the day of the tragedy and, of course, police officers involved, some of whom
are still suffering.

On 20 June 1994, a representative from the 'Cook Report' met senior officers at Force
Headquarters when a number of discrepancies in the programme were discussed.
Although not accepting fully all the points made by the South Yorkshire Policejthe Producer
did acknowledge certain serious discrepancies within the 'Cook Report', partittilarly with the
timing of events which proved that certain actions alleged by the programme to have taken
place could not possibly have occurred.

The programme makers are now to consider their position and will respond within the
immediate future. You will be informed of further developments.

                    Dear Chief Constable,

                  David Alford did riot accept that there wers 'material
                  discrepancies' in the programme, nor that it lacked balance. We
                  dispute both proposi Lons, certainly, there were a number of
                        ained discr<     ?ies In the various account* of events at
                       trough: that vaa the point of the programme. The families
                       these discrepancies explained, and you will recall that |®
                   ^ one of those families who brought the story to us. So far
                  as your reference to Unrealistic expectations' is concerned* the
                  affected families we ij|ave spoken to have been highly supportive
                  of the programme. We did not suggest that an inauiry would be
                  forthcoming: only tha^: it should be.
                  Debra Martin wa not _ .t forward as an expert witness, and it is
                  <£Uite unfair to sugge: >t that she was, she was simply giving a
                  first-hand account as omeone who was there, and we made it clear
                  (twice) that she was      Special Constable. As Debra Martin was
                  told by the police      at she was not even at Hillsborough., the
                  emergence of a restri pted video, in which she appears, merely
                  serves to reinforce the points she made in the programme„
                  Debra't account to us is in fact perfectly consistent with your
                  own footage. She insjjjsts that Kevin Williams was alive, in the
                  gymnasium, way beyond 3.15, after she had helped to carry him
                  there*

 F o l l o w i n g the scr e e n i n g of the ’Cook Report' on Thursday 2 J u n e
 1994 r e s e a r c h has been carried out at thi s of f i c e to e s t a b l i s h

 The S outh Yor k s h i r e Police, on learning that the ‘Cook Report' was *                                 PA6fc:l/
 being produced, r e q u e s t e d an o p p o r t u n i t y to assist or take part.
 Ihat r e q u e s t was refu s e d by the p r o g r a m m e makers.

 It is felt, had th e South Y o r k s h i r e P o l i c e been involved, then a
 number of inaccuracies could have been avoided, the effect being to
 g i v e a m o r e b a l anced view and c a u s e less distress to a nu m b e r of
 i n t e r e s t e d parties- Those parties i n c l u d e bereaved families, people
 a s s i s t i n g on the day of the tragedy a n d of course, police o f f icers
 involved, s o m e of whom are still suffering.

 On 2 0 J u n e 1994, a r e p resentative f rom the ’Cook report' met senior
 o f f i c e r s at Force Headquarters whe n a number of discre p a n c i e s in
 the p r o g r a m m e were discussed.A1though not accepting fully all the


p o i n t s m a d e by the South Yorkshire Police, the Producer did
a c k n o w l e d g e certain serious d i s c r e p a n c i e s within the 'Cook Report',
p a r t i c u l a r l y with the timing of e v e n t s which proved that certain         *
a c t i o n s a l l e g e d by the programme to have taken p lace could not
p o s s i b l y have occurred.

           ny personal assistant, has told me about your telephone call and your concern about the
‘Cook Report’ broadcast on 2 June.

I quite understand your concern about awakening anxieties which are just beginning to be stilled five
years on from the disaster. This was my response to media enquiries for me to make an official
pronouncement on the fifth anniversary of the tragedy, which I declined to do. I was concerned,
therefore, to see the ‘Cook Report’ - quite unexpectedly - present their programme.

It was all the more distressing to watch the content of the programme and suspect that there was,
indeed, little new material in what they showed, let alone evidence which would afford grounds for re­
opening the investigation. I have asked officers in-force to examine the ‘Cook Report* videotape
virtually frame by frame and there j§ no new material. Had the programme-makers asked us in the first
place, or co-operated when we offer them help having discovered by chance that they were making the
programme, then they might have thought better of broadcasting at all.                              ;;

The programme-makers visited us yesterday and we have sent them away to consider whether or not
they wish to make untransmitted material available to us which might shed new light on the events.
If they do, then of course I am obliged to consider it carefully. My impression is that they will have
broadcast their ‘best’ material and that they will have nothing to offer us, even if they were willing to
do so.

This letter is intended to reassure you that, so far as I can gauge at the moment, there is no obvious
reason to re-open the enquiries and I hope that people like yourself who were put to so much stress
at the time, under appalling circumstances, will be allowed to find your peace. I welcome investigative
journalism but it really does have to be responsible investigation. The ‘Cook Report’ was no such thing.

      Vvte/,
You will remember that I wrote to you on 10 June 1994, inviting you or your representative
to meet with my senior officers to discuss the contents of the 'Cook Reporf screened on
Thursday 2 June 1994. An invitation was also extended to Sir Malcolm Thornton.

David Allford, one of your Assistant Producers, met with members of the South Yorkshire
Police on Monday 20 June 1994, but it was rather disappointing that Sir Malcolm Thornton's
commitments would not allow him to attend. However, a meaningful discussion of the
issues in the 'Cook Report* did take place and although David did not accept all the points
raised by the South Yorkshire Police he did concede that there were a number of material
discrepancies within the programme which failed to give it the necessary balance.

In particular, the performance of Debbie Martin on the programme and the allegations she
made were of interest to David Allford. David was shown video evidence of Debbie in the
gymnasium on the day of the tragedy and he agreed that she was in fact traumatised and
looking like a zombie. (Her words, you will recall from your programme). David was also
shown timed video evidence that Debbie Martin could not by any stretch of the imagination
have carried out the procedures she described in your programme and the allegation that
you make, on three occasions, that Kevin Williams was alive at 3 55pm has been refused
beyond a shadow of doubt                                                             ‘


The 'Cook Reporf also attempted to portray Debbie Martin as an experienced police officer
when in fact she was a special constable of two years standing at the time of the tragedy. *•
As a special constable she was allowed to work a maximum of four hours a week and to
place her in the category of an 'expert witness' was misleading to say the least

                                                        NOTE FOR FILE



 R o g e r Cook s a y s o f e v i d e n c e          p rev io u sly    d isregard ed      or   a ltered    under    duress
 and w i t n e s s e s i g n o r e d .

 We believe that to be an allegation concerning the disregarding of evidence
 refers to the ambulance arriving at 3.37 p.m. and not featured at the
 inquest.   The BBC video was in fact part of the compilation tape shown to
 the inquiry proceedings.

  Police Constable Bruder

  Documentary evidence in the file from Police Constable Bruder shows that
  no pressure, duress or other persuasion was placed upon him - statement
  dated 3 May 1990.                The only information the Cook Report have had regarding

  Great inconsistencies in the account she gave to the Cook Report and the
  facts as we know them.    From the Cook Report itself Police Constable Bruder
  is  timed  giving   resuscitation  to Kevin Williams    at  3.37 p.m.   Police
  Constable Bruder says he continued resuscitation for between 10-15 minutes
  and says it was probably 13 minutes.   That takes the time to about 3.50 p.m.

  Debbie Martin asks us to believe that when Police Constable Bruder and the
  St Johns Ambulance officers gave up on Kevin Williams, whilst on the pitch,
  she, Debbie Martin, carried Kevin Williams       with others into the gymnasium.
  At the door to the gymnasium police officers were directing stretcher bearers
  to different parts of the building and indeed segregating dead bodies from
  live casualties.      Kevin Williams was directed into the area containing dead
  bodies.     She there alleges that she carried out mouth to mouth resuscitation
  on Kevin Williams so successfully that he opened his eyes and uttered the
  word 'mum'.      The Cook Report says this was at 3.55 p.m.      We are asked to
  believe by      Debbie Martin that in the space of, to be generous, less than
  2  minutes,     she carried the body from the pitch, passed the police check
  point, into the gymnasium and revived him.         There is overwhelming medical
  evidence supporting the view that Kevin was dead before he was removed from
  the p e n .

  Video evidence at this office timed at 3.50 p.m. shows Debbie Martin doing
  nothing from at least that time onwards.  She is clearly grossly mistaken,
  so traumatised that she believes her own actions were true or quite simply
  is lying.

  Witnesses Ignored or Not Traced

  The people   referred to are Mr O'Keefe, Mr Hart and                                      Mr Edwards.  All three
  were traced, interviewed and statements obtained.                                          (In total some 13,000
  people were interviewed).

He Died When He Might Have Been Saved

There was no lack of effort to save Kevin Williams on the part of Police
Constable Bruder and the St Johns Ambulance personnel (unknown).       The St
Johns Ambulance personnel advised Police Constable Bruder that Kevin Williams
had 'gone'.   The implication is that after 3.15 p.m. nobody did anything.
In fact some 70 people were treated and survived.

3.28 p.m.         -    Still Alive

The people shown on the video,                         Mr Hart      and Mr O'Keefe, both gave statements
to the police.

Sir Malcolm Thornton MP

Does the Cook Report have any evidence that the truth was surpressed?

What is meant    by   the   statement    from   Malcolm Thornton         that      the    truth   was
surpressed?

Events After 3.15 p.m. - Not Investigated

A full, thorough, painstaking inquiry            from    when    the   victim      left    hom    that
day to the time of the post mortem.

Details are clearly documented and the inquiry most certainly did continue
after 3.15 p.m.    The time of 3.15 p.m. was set by the coroner as to
causation.  i.e. the cause of their death had already taken place.

Malcolm Thornton says officers were leaned on.       This has been                         refuted.
Thornton is merely repeating what he has been told by Mrs Williams.

N.B.  Ambulance service would not allow their personnel to be interviewed
by the West Midlands Police.    It is not unusual for this to happen, they
themselves could have been culpable.       faj *          *" ^   *>»

Don Page

Allegation of surpressing      evidence      from   Cook   refers       to   the    ambulance       on
the BBC video at 3.37 p.m.

That BBC video was shown to the inquiry in the form of a compilation tape.

Don Page says nothing on their statements were ever changed the inference
being that those of Police Constable Bruder and Special Constable Martin
were changed.   They were not.    Further statements were taken to qualify
certain aspects of their original statements and the original statements
were still submitted for information and scrutiny.

Spearitt complaint dealt with separately.

Stringer.




Sheila Coleman

Taylor report provided a full inquiry.          It had no restriction on time.

Mrs Williams says her son died          at   3.55 p.m.     (We   have    conclusive        evidence
that her son died before then).

Dr West says he may not have died if he had been treated earlier enough.
 Shiela Coleman - Statements were not           altered.  New        statements          were   taken
 to qualify the original statements.             The original        statements          were   still
 presented.

 Cook again says that Kevin was alive at 3.55 p.m.

 Debbie Martin alleges      that    West   Midlands    Police   accused     her     of    not   being
 at Hillsborough.

 Statements taken by West Midlands Police from Debbie Martin asks her to
 identify  herself  on   video  which  she  does.    Statement was taken on
 12 July 1989 and she makes reference to video being shown to her by West
 Midlands police officers in which she identifies herself.

 We did not ask her to alter her first                statement.     We    wanted    her    to make
 a new one qualifying certain aspects.

 Mrs Martin

 Mrs Martin   has   no   direct    knowledge   of   the   incident    or    statement       taking.




 Kevin Alive After Taken From Terraces

 Cook says other witnesses claim Kevin was alive after he was taken from
 the terraces. The inference being its the next people to be interviewed.

 Hart says there was no doubt that he was alive. In his original statement
 he says ......'as we lifted him onto the board a policeman came forward
 and pulled the lads jumper up and over his face and I realised then .that
 he was d e a d '......

    Hart - Inconsistencies of evidence and video shows he was already on a board
'£t'though in his statement he states that he was lifted and placed on a board.
    In his original statement he says ..... 'there were so many bodies around
    and I checked some for signs of life but found no n e ' .....

 Cook Report says Bruder     comes across him at 3.35 p.m.

 Mrs Williams Allegation that Bruder Changed a Statement

 Bruder made a second statement qualifying his own original thoughts now
 that he had had the opportunity to have first aid lessons and have a greater
 understanding of people in the throes of death.    He also   saysthat he was
 not placed under duress and no pressure whatsoever applied. This particular
 application was aired following the application for judicial review.
Allegation that the ambulance at 3.37 p.m. was not shown to the inquest.

 That video was shown to the inquest in the form of a compilation tape.

Time of the ambulance confirms that Police Constable Bruder was attempting
to revive a corpse at 3.37 p.m. not that Kevin Williams was alive.

Mr Edwards gave   a statement to the police explaining why he     did   not    stop
in the stadium.   This was an order from his own supervisors.

Mrs Williams asked Bruder would he put     in writing and she said he refused.
He had already put it in writing.

Bruder's statement was summarised to the   inquest proceedings.

When interviewing Dr Popper, Cook says ambulance does not appear          in    the
police video.  It does and it was shown to the inquiry proceedings.

Dr Slater, Pathologist, was asked at the inquest about bodies expelling
air when dead. This was considered a real possibility with Kevin Williams.

Chief Superintendent Mike Foster feels that Cook says this is           the    best
evidence. It is not.  It has already been aired in several venues.

Dr West says people were recoverable after 3.15 p.m.   Agreed.        About 70
people were treated and recovered after that time.   All those       who died,
however, were dead before 3.15 p.m.

Enquiries did continue after 3.15 p.m.   The Lord Justice Taylor inquiry.

Lessons Were Not Learned

The Lord Justice Taylor report contained a great number of recommendations
pointing  out  where    lessons had been learned  and,  of  course,  those
recommendations have been or are being implemented by football grounds
throughout the country.

NOTE FOR FILE - FOR CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT LOWE


THE COOK REPORT - 2 JUNE 1994


   J  the Chief Constable's secretary, rang at about 1.50 pm today (14.6.94)
wanting to speak to you concerning a telephone call she had received from a
Doctor Matthew Bull but as you were out I took the call.

She explained that Doctor Bull, who can be contacted at the Royal Hallamshire
Hospital on Sheffield 766222 extensions 3597 or 3595 or at the Northern General
Hospital on Sheffield 434343 extension 5374, had telephoned, wanting to speak to
the Chief Constable after he had heard the 1 o'clock a news on Radio Hallam
concerning the South Yorkshire Police's response to the 'Cook Report'.

I telephoned Doctor Bull who was concerned, having just returned from holiday
and hearing the 1.00 o'clock news, but had not seen the Cook Report on 2 June
1994.   Doctor Bull said that he had been at Hillsborough on the day of the
disaster and had assisted with casualties and bodies, certifying as dead a large
number* of victims, both inside and outside the gymnasium.       He said he had
assisted on the field in the area of the Kop but couldn't assist further with
the identities of the casualties or bodies.  I spent some time talking to Doctor
Bull, explaining what the programme was about and the South Yorkshire Police
response to it.




PC Greenway has made a check of the Hillsborough records and he confirms Doctor
Bull's movements and actions on the day, certifying as dead in the region of 20
bodies.   There is nothing to indicate a link between Doctor Bull and Kevin
Williams.

I have updated     ‘or the information of the Chief.

Following the screening of the ‘Cook Report' on Thursday 2 June 1994, research has been carried out
at this office to establish whether the programme revealed any new evidence from the events
surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.

Our in-depth examination of the programme contents established quite categorically that there was no
new evidence upon which to base any further enquiries. South Yorkshire Police do not find that
surprising. Lord Justice Taylor’s inquiry was thorough and far reaching, apportioning blame and making
recommendations. Lessons were learned. The inquest into the circumstances surrounding the victims
of the disaster was painstakingly conducted and the South Yorkshire Police co-operated fully with the
inquest proceedings. The application for a judicial review into the inquest findings, which as you know
was refused, examined pertinent issues surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy.

In addition, you will be aware that the independent Police Complaints Authority supervised the
investigation conducted by the West Midlands Police and they have indicated their satisfaction with the
investigation.

Our research into the ‘Cook Report’ disclosed a number of discrepancies and I feel that some remarks
expressed in the programme were incorrect and misleading.

You may be aware that the South Yorkshire Police on learning that the ‘Cook Report’ was being
produced, requested an opportunity to assist or take part. That request was refused by the programme
makers.

It is felt that had the South Yorkshire Police been involved then a number of inaccuracies could have
been avoided, the effect being to give a more balanced view and cause less distress to a number of
interested parties. Those parties include bereaved families, people assisting on the day of the tragedy
and, of course, police officers involved, some of whom are still suffering.

The programme produced no new evidence or facts but my understanding of programme making is that
some footage gathered before the preparation of the programme is not always used in the final
transmission. I have asked the programme makers to make that footage available to me for
examination with a view to shedding any further light on the accuracy of the programme together with
any other material they consider would be helpful.

                                                                                                continued

                    ♦The Cook Report'   -   Thursday 2 June 1994

Following the screening of ‘The O x * Report' on Thursday 2 June 1994# research has
been carried out at this office to establish whether the programme revealed any new
evidence from the events surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy*

inspector Phil Woodward and Police Constable Ken Greenway have produced the attached
report and are to be congratulated on producing thorough research ia such a short
space of tine.

There are a number of discrepancies in the Cook Report#            the   prograane   lacked
objectivity# but isoat important it revealed no new evidence.

The issues referred to in the enclosed report are many and at times conplex.    My
suggestion is that the report is read carefully and than should the reader wish to
have further clarification on any item than perhaps a aeeting can be arranged.  In
particular I find Ken Greenway'• knowledge of the disaster extremely helpful«

Having read the report the question of what to do with the information contained
within it will have to be addressed*    I an of the opinion that there i» sufficient
evidence to contradict the majority of Mr Cook's 'findings' but whether that would
serve any useful purpose is open to debate*    Xn particular it will bfe lllftic&lt to
find a suitable forum for refuting the inaccuracies in the Cook Report.

In the TV programme Mrs Williams, mother of Kevin, says that she is to approach the
Attorney General for a fresh enquiry. Clearly that avenue is open to Mrs Williams
and it will be an option to do nothing until communication ia received from the
Attorney General, if ever.

             ROGER COOK
             You were there on the spot, tell me w h at happened on the day?




             DEBRA MARTIN
             W e had a briefing about ten o'clock down at Hillsborough, and w e were told
             to watch the crowds and just do a normal duty walking round whilst some
             us wouid be actually in             Hillsborough itself      on the ground,           w e'd been
             informed there were large groups of Liverpool players coming who'd been
             drinking heavily and w e ’d got to watch out for any trouble around the area.




             After briefing, w e all w e n t back into the gym and were told to have a drink
             and have some snap,            because w e didn't know when w e ’d be eating next.
             There was a big group of us.             Then w e were given orders, I found that I
             was patrolling the hard shoulder; 1 think it’s a pub called "The W hite House
             Inn" that w e were going towards which was up the hill from where the
             ground is.



             I was patrolling that area and again we were told to w atch out for any
             drunkenness,        look out for ticket-touts as well, because there were going to
             be a lot of those around on the day and if w e did see any ticket-touts w e'd
              got to report it straight to our S .D .O . as w e 'd all got radios.

              I was with a younger special w h o ’d just started duty with us.                           so I was
              going around, keeping an eye               out for any trouble.        There were some you
              could see w ho were obviously drunk, but they seemed okay at the time.
              W e were getting reports through the radio and checked each other out. The
              fans had been to one pub further down, they'd actually drained the barrels,
              and they had to close it down.               It was just a tw o -w a y conversation, just
              checking on each other.




              I was getting a little bit bored.          I got through to our section district officer, a
                                        and said      "look, is there a chance of me being moved
              anywhere else because there's not a lot going off around here?" so he said
              "we'll have a word".                He he had a word with Pete Martin w ho was our
              commandant.           I got a radio call through saying "would you like to bring the
              coaches in". So I said "oh that's great, w hat coaches are you meaning, are
              you meaning the fans?".                He said "no, you can actually bring the players
              through".       I w en t down and        brought the coach through and then                I brought
              the rest of the        fans in as well.     W hat they were trying to do was                separate
              the fans,       the Liverpool and the other fans from each other, because again
              they’d been warned that there could be trouble.




              I was bringing the            the fans in and   we had trouble.          Some tried to get off
              one of the buses,             and   a couple of the lads actually got them and arrested
              them.        Everything was going okay. Kick-off hadn't started, and things were
              quietening down.




              I got called through again and told to start making my w ay in, which is only
              about five minutes from where I was,                 so I could actually go on to the
              ground.

          Suddenly my radio w ent and it said                      there was trouble at one of the
          turnstiles.       I'd never been one to be on the sidelines, I’ve got to be one of
          the lads,        I actually have to join in.             There were some men who were
          absolutely built like gorillas, and they were really causing a lot of hassle and
          they'd       hit a couple of police officers.         There was others who w ere actually
          trying to get over because a lot of the turnstiles had been barricaded up and
          th a t’s when the trouble started.              I w ent up to     this particular turnstile and I
          was helping to drag them aw ay.                 It was    as though everything was in slow
          motion.




          I heard the        clopping of hooves and it was the police, the mounted police.
          Suddenly for no reason, 1 know I moved down further ahead,                                      and one of
          the gates opened up, and I thought w hat's one of the gates opening up for,
          it shouldn't be open.                   Suddenly from literally nowhere there were these
          people,        and it seemed like hundreds and hundreds of people had literally
          come out on the floor and was just running.




          I remember this gate being open,                  and I could actually feel myself being
          dragged through.           Suddenly I felt this hand get hold of the back of my coat.
          This surge was just dragging me in and I remember 1 looked over my
          shoulder into this             mounted officer's eyes.          W e just looked at each other
          and       suddenly      I could see him coming out of his saddle.                      He was actually
          holding on to the pommel, and his horse was being dragged and I thought
          oh no, if I go and he goes that's it w e 'v e had it.                  I looked at him again.                      It
         was obvious he knew that he’d got to let me go otherwise he'd be dragged
          in. I was actually dragged through this gate.




          I remember        going down on my knees and I felt the backs of my legs being
          trapped.       I remember,         I thought to myself "oh my god, I’ve got to get out
         of here, this shouldn't be happening, this should not be happening".                                                 I
         didn’t realise that trouble had already started actually inside the ground.

            There was a man in front of me.                 All I saw was the back o f his head, I
             thought "I'm going to suffocate here, i've got to get out".                                I remember
            trying to climb up this man's back, and then suddenly that was it.                                 It was
             as though somebody had come along and thrown a blanket over me, a black
             one.




             I don't know how long 1 must have been out.                    I remember waking up and
            the gate was closed and there was this little man standing at the front of
            the gate inside.        He was just staring.         1 remember looking up because I was
            actually crouched down.               I was like a child, I'd got my hands over my head.
             I remember looking at him and thinking "w hat am I doing here, h o w ’ve I got
             here".      I remember straightening up.            I was covered ail in dust, and I said
             "what's happened, w h a t’s going off?".              He just looked at me.                  I said "I'm
            talking to you, w hat's going off?'',           and he couldn't talk.                I said "w hy the
             hell did you open the gate?". "I just opened it". I said " you shouldn’t have
            opened the gate”.             He wouldn’t let me out.        So I said "look, I'm a police
            officer, you've got to let me out’’ ...




            There’s w hat they call a spy-mirror in the gate,                        and I actually looked
            through and I s a w this brown object, ... It was the actual horse and rider,
            the man who tried to help me, and he'd actually blocked it with his horse.
            1 said "look, open it.         I had an argument with him and he finally opened it a
            crack, I slipped though.              I remember looking at this horseman and he said
             "are you all right?", and I w e n t "yes, I'm fine".           And the next thing, I think
            he was an inspector,             he came racing up to me he said "w hat the”                            you
            know,        he swore.        He said "the radios have gone mad,                           is your radio
            working?", and I said             "I think it is".     All you could hear was this mass
            crackling, it was just static and you could hear sirens going off.




             I finally managed to get into the ground, and there was just mass panic.                                     I
            came down one of the slopes and there were another mass of people, and
            there w ere       police officers,        and   I just wondered                 to m yself "w h a t's
             happened?".

              It was just like a nightmare,           there were people screaming,                    fans going
              demented,           they were fighting everywhere,    and all the time i was running
              forward onto the pitch. Then I saw the bill-boards w ith the actual fans, and
              I thought       this can’t be real,     it just can't be real.             And I heard people
              screaming "they're dying, th ey’ re dying, for God's sake help, you’ve got to
              help”.       And as I ran through onto the pitch there w ere tw o blokes who
              came down. They actually tore the bill-boards off, the ones surrounding the
              pitch.       These tw o blokes came up to me and said "can you help my
              friend?",      and there was blood everywhere.             The next thing there was
              another officer w ho came to me and he said "come on, w e 're taking him
              into the gym".




              It was a hot day, I'm in full uniform, but I'm ice cold, and they kept taking
              these bodies in and               they were dying,   you could              actually see them
              suffocating.          If they couldn't get them on billboards, they were carrying
              them in their arms, and most of them had got no idea that they should have
              laid them on their side in the recovery position.                 You could actually see
              them laid on their backs vomiting.           As fast as you were trying to go up to
              somebody there was somebody else there, you just could not do anything.
              I was like a programmed robot, I just knew I'd got to do w h at I was doing,
              and suddenly this billboard came.




              I remember looking down and I thought oh my God it's a little boy.                         I knew
              there were families w ho used to take the children, and many a time I’d
              turned round and said they shouldn't take children to football matches, it's
              too dangerous..          If anything did happen it's the children w ho always get
              hurt.



              I remember looking down at a dark eyed boy.             I thought he must have been
              about eleven or tw elve, because, well he was small to my point of v ie w and
              w h at stood out on him was the fact that he'd got a necklace with a little
              horn on it.         He was laid there and   this police officer looked at me and he
              w en t "oh he's had it".

          These boys were screaming "you’ve got to help him, you've got to help
           him", and I said "I'm trying to do the best ! can".                       I bent down          and I felt
          for a pulse, I could hardly feel anything in his wrist at all, so I felt at his
          throat.         I applied a bit more pressure, and I actually got a little flutter.                        He
          was still pale, but you could see a slight greyness coming into him and he'd
          got vomit round his mouth.




          W e managed to get him into a recovery position.                           This other          policeman
          turned round and said, "come on w e ’ ll take him into the gym".                                I had the
          bottom end, he took the head end of the bill board and w e ran.




          W e w ent into the gym and there was just                   bodies laid all around and I think
          there was a doctor there.                   By then th e y ’d started cordoning the dead ones
          off to the live ones.                     I'd already started mouth to mouth on the actual
          pitch.         I started mouth to mouth again.             As I say i continued CPR on this
          little boy, I had no idea w h a t his name was and he actually got a little bit of
          colour.          And       I don't know w h a t it was, I just looked at him and                 I picked
          him up.           I actually cradled him,         and I thought "you are not going to die,
          you cannot die".




          I remember holding him and I thought "no he's only a baby, it can't be
          happening".               So 1 held him, and he actually opened his eyes.                     It w asn't a
          definite stare at me, his eyes just fluttered and he looked and he made a
          noise,         and I thought "I've got him, I've actually got him alive".                       As I say,
          he made a noise and                 I looked again and I bent my head down to him, and
          his eyes opened and he looked straight ahead and he w e n t "mum",                                       and
          then his eyes fluttered again, and he just seemed to slump back in my arms
          again.          And I just, I looked at him and I thought                 "no, there's something
          wrong here".

          I laid him flat again and gave him heart massage.                             This police officer came
          up to me and w h at I didn't know was there was a doctor there and he
          must have made a sign to him.                             I remember someone patting me on                     my
          back, and he said "leave it love, he's dead".                       I w ent "no he c an't be", and I
          know I continued with CPR.                         I was    really going at him, giving him mouth
          and a heart massage again,                          and    then 1 was pulled back and told "he’s
          dead".         Then I heard somebody’s voice saying "all the police officers with
          bodies, you've got to stay in the gym".




          I remember looking at this other police officer who'd been with me for a fair
          bit and he said "will you be all right?", and I just shook my head.                                    I felt as
          though I was in a goldfish bowl, I was there but I w a s n ’t.                               So they moved
          this little boy onto the dead side and I stayed with him and they said to us
          to take a detailed description                      i.e. clothing, hair and everything.               If they'd
          got any belongings you'd got to take them out and got to bag them up.




          Somebody else came up to me and he said "do you know w h at to do?". I
          looked at him and I w ent                       "no, not really".   So he said "well I'll tell you
         w h at to do, you've got to                      make a detailed description in your pocket book,
         you've got to do that",                     so I said "I know that".        He said "make a detailed
         description of any valuables that he's got on him".                            I found        a railway pass,
         a ticket and I think there was                       some odd change.           He was also wearing a
         necklace with a horn on it.                            And they asked            also to make a clear
         description if there were any                        bruises, i.e. facial bruises or chest bruises;
         because th a t’s when I found out later on that there'd been quite a fe w
         bodies that had been crushed.




         All I found on Kevin was a little scratch, just on his chest, just about here,
         that was the only mark that that little boy had got on him.                                        I remember
         standing up and 1 thought                        "I’ve got to get out of here, I really have",                and
         then the other half of me was saying "be sensible you’ve got to stay with
         your body".             That's w hat w e were told, you've got to stay w ith the bodies
         all the time.

              So w e stayed with the bodies, and by this time it was about ten to four
              when         I'd been told he was dead,        and then a doctor came round                     who had
              to certify      proper death, and that was after four o ’clock.                     I remember it was
              after four o'clock because I looked down at my w atch,                               because again it
              was a note that I'd got to make in my pocket book.                        And this doctor came
              around I think he was an Indian doctor.




              As I say he certified that he'd died after four o'clock and then 1 was told I’d
              got to stay.          It seemed about a half an hour or so                there were a camera
              crew and I was sure it was a fire brigade because 1 remember this bloke all
              being in a fire brigade outfit and he’d got a                yellow hat on w ith a video
              camera on his shoulder,               and he came right up to to me I felt like turning
              round and saying "go a w ay you bastard it's scavaging, you can’t do this
              they're dead. You've got to give them some respect".




              All around me I could hear all this screaming going off and then it finally
             started calming down.              They said that w e had to number the bodies and
             w h at they said was that they were                 going to have               to     section the gym.
             W hat they were going to do, was the far                  end of the            gym, was goingto be
              made into a viewing area because they said that the families were going to
             have to come from Liverpool.




             The centre was reserved for all police officers,              and the far side, which was
             my side was going to be reserved for all the dead bodies.                              By then th ey’d
             got the injured out.            They got us chairs and the         time kept ticking on.                 By
             then, the bodies were in the bags and they were all lined up.                                W e'd had to
             help put the bodies in the bags,               and as I say w e'd numbered them.                         I'd
             cleaned his face up because it was a                bit   dirty and        brushed his hairback.
             Then they moved the bodies, as I say over to this side of the gym and we
             were stuck in the centre. The hours seemed to go on for ever and I thought
             "I’ve got to do something, I've got to do something” .

          fe w other officers from Woodseats.                I remember, I think it was one of the
          sergeants who I knew as I walked out I just stopped.                      I didn't know w h at I
          was doing and there was police officers over here and then there was my
          lot from Woodseats,            and I could feel my face crumpling, and that was the
          first time I started to cry and everyone converged on me outside.




         i remember my sergeant turned round and said to                            because he's a born
         again Christian,         "go up to h e r        ,    A nyw ay he took me into one the
         offices and he w as trying to explain to me w h at had happened and                               that it
         was for the best, they’d gone up there to a much better world, they were
         just trying to calm me down in general.




         I finally w ent back into the gym and w e got sat down.                        The other officers
         were around me, they were great, they really looked after me.                              And then
         w e were warned that they were bringing the relatives in, which must have
         been between           eight and nine.     And w e sat there, I heard voices at the far
         end of the gym where the viewing was,                    because by then they'd taken
         photos and they were saying to the relatives "if you can see anyone who
         belongs to you let us know, because those bodies can be moved".




         You could hear these people coming in, and then the wailing started and it
         was such a horrible wail.              You couldn’t believe it         it didn’t sound like a
         human being really.             It just pierced you right to your heart,                    and you
         couldn’t do anything about it.           And the screaming started,              and all I wanted
        to do was try and block my ears off, but 1 just couldn’t do it.                             And then
        the smell started, even though they were in body-bags, there was a smell.
        They started bringing these big drums of chicken in and I just couldn't face
        it, I just couldn't touch it. I just drank cups of soup.

           I remember going through to the loos, I had to walk through this section
           where the        relatives w ere.         1 had some abuse,       and then I remember going
           to the ladies and I bumped into tw o ladies w ho'd come to v ie w somebody,
           and they actually turned round and said                "poor thing, she’s gone through it
           today, just look at her face". I remember coming back,                            and I stayed in the
           centre,      and this screaming just continued and continued, it just w e n t on
           and on and on and then it started going quieter.                         And then some of the
           officers w h o 'd been with the bodies and the ones that had been viewed and
           been identified by relatives, actually went with the bodies.




           A nyw ay it got to about               half past twelve.    I didn't know that              all the lines
           down to Hillsborough had been re-directed.                    I know incoming phone calls
           had been sent over to Snig Hill.               I didn't know that my parents didn't know
           where I w as.          They couldn't find me at first and then they got word that I
           was actually with a body.                M y parents rang Woodseats up, but Woodseats
           couldn't get through            to Hillsborough.      A nyw ay something happened                      then
          this phone call came through and this gentleman; I always remember a small
           grey haired chap in a suit, and he came and he w ent "is there a P.C. Martin
          around here?"




          I remember one of these police officers standing there and he said "i'm P.C.
          Martin",       he said ”is your collar number tw o tw o one?" so he said "no, he
          said y o u ’ve got the wrong one".               By then I was just in shirt sleeves ...and
          he's going round            and I was oblivious.            Suddenly        one of these officers
          turned round and he said "what's your name love?" so I                                 said "it's Debra
          Martin".       He said "w hat's your collar number?".                 I said "I'm S.P.C. 2 2 1 " ,
          and this voice w e n t "I w ant P.C. Martin"                and I stood up, and f remember
          walking towards him and w e n t "I'm Special Constable 2 2 1 , Debra Martin".
          And I remember he got this look of amazement on his face and he said
          "you're Police Constable Martin”, I said "yes" he said "but I've been looking
          for man".        I said "no, I'm certainly a woman",              I remember that.               He says
          "your station's been trying to get in touch with you".

          I tried to ring Woodseats back, I couldn’t get through. I waited my turn and
          I remember there was a priest there,                     the next thing i knew 1 was grabbed
          by the chest.                  He grabbed my shirt and he said "you murderer.                        Do you
          know how many people you've killed", and I looked at him, and I couldn't
          say anything.                 I just could not believe it was a man of the church, and he
          said ’’you're a murderer! you're a murderer!”.                      I remember tw o men pulling
          him off me,                  and I made my w ay to a telephone and I got through to Snig
          Hill and I told them who I was, and I was put through to Woodseats, and
          then they relayed a message back to my parents that I was ative, because
          as far as mum and dad were concerned they thought I was dead or
          something serious had happened to me.                      By then they had been contacted
          by the Specials, they had rung round all the families letting them know
          where w e were and w hat they thought was going off but I couldn’t get
          through to my parents.




          I w en t back to the gym.                    By then the gym    had been sealed off just for
          relatives because there were still some who were viewing,                                      and      1 just
          remember walking in and there was the smell.                     By then, some o f the bodies
          had been identified by their relatives.




          Later on, the ambulances came and took the identified bodies over to the
          M edical Legal C en tre.                     Th ere w as m yself,     an o th er colleag ue from
          Woodseats w ho was in the C .I.D . and the other officer was                                             You
          see, the practise that I used to w ork at, when I first started dental nursing,
                     had been a patient.                   and his wife were police officers and                     he
          always used to say to me "you'd make a smashing copper Deb".                                     I used to
          say to him             "yes, I think I’m going to go for it".        I sat the exam and I never
          got through it because it’s tough getting into the South Yorkshire Police.

          W e w ere the only three remaining ones with bodies that had not been
          identified, and that must have been about four or five o'clock in the morning
          and in the end an ambulance came and they took the bodies,                                 and w e
          actually had to climb in the back of the ambulance.                     Well I’d never seen a
          dead person before and I didn't know w hat a dead person did.




          As ! say there was this horrific smell even though they were in these bags.
         And when they were dead everything comes away from them and all the
          gases in the body start deteriorating, breaking everything down and I didn't
          know that a body could actually move.




         1 remember sitting down, I was                seated at the back where the ambulance
         driver was and                   and my colleague from Woodseats, I can’t remember his
         name,          were both stood up and there was one body on one couch and
         another body on the floor,                and then 1 forgot where the other body was.
         They were having to stand over them, they were having to stand over them
         and suddenly one of the body bags started moving.




         I remember looking down, it was really weird.              It was just like a zombie film,
         I expected the zombie to unzip the bag and come out of it, and I remember
         one of them saying to me "it's all right, it’s the gases in the body that are
         breaking everything down, it's expressing it all”.               I had an idea o f w h at he
         meant.          W e got to the Medical Legal Centre and that's when                    they started
         taking the bodies out and I had to sign my body in and put down the time
         that w e'd arrived and that was about six o'clockish,                      I'm not too certain
         with the times.             But, as I say I'd never seen    anything like it before, and
         what really got to me, it’s one thing that I didn’t put down in my pocket
         book was the w a y they handled the bodies;                  they just picked them up,
         looked at them and removed the clothing.

          There was a pile of clothes to one side and bodies were being moved so
          they could take them in and                       I was just looking all the time and thinking,
          "this is a nightmare, it really is".                     I then walked in, I w ent through one of
          the doors.           I'd actually been to Medical Legal Centre before and I ’d only
          ever seen a normal dead body.                      When they'd taken them out o f the freezer,
          I always remember being told it’s like touching cold pork and I just couldn't
          do it.




         When you go into Medical Legal Centre it’s a long long corridor that goes on
         and on.          It seems to go on for ever, and it's ice cold.                     There was shrouded
         bodies, line after line after line. W e made our w ay up to the reception area
         at Medical Legal Centre.                      I think there was tw o motorway policemen.                      They
         asked if w e ’d got a lift.                   M y colleague turned round and said "no”.                       They
         asked us where w e were going ”oh we'll drop you off at Woodseats".




         W e got to Woodseats and the morning staff were on duty.                                     I remember my
         colleague w en t upstairs and I w ent into the ladies.                           I came out and stood
         opposite to the office doors.                    I always remember a face peering through and
         saying "w hat are you doing here, don't you think y o u ’ve put enough hours
         in already, you should have been home a long time ago?”, and I just looked
         at him.         And the next thing this voice said "leave her alone, she's been at
         Hillsborough".            And a bit more was said because                 my colleague was just as
         upset as me and w e managed to get a lift with the station driver,




         He was also a special constable.                      He brought me home and dropped me off
         first.       M y colleague turned round and he asked if I'd be all right and he said
        to me "get into the shower straight away,                            just get in and stand in the
        shower for as long as you can, because that smell will not go aw ay, it's
         going to stay with you for a while".                        I remember saying "yes" to him, and
         he said "now do you w ant me to take you in", and I said "no, w e 'v e got
        dogs".          He said "right then".              He said he was going to go home.                     He said
         he'd got a bottle of whisky, he was going to down that.

          I remember seeing the car going off and just standing there.                  I could hear
          the birds singing, and I thought to myself this is another day.                 1 couldn’t
          believe it.     I remember coming in and my parents hadn't been in bed very
          long and all I remember was this horrible smell about me, and I thought I've
          got to get clean... and the stupid thing about it,         I dunked my head under
          the cold w ater tap.         I got the nearest thing at hand which was washing up
          liquid and tried to wash the smell out of my hair. I just stood there dripping
         for about half an hour or so, and then my dad came down, and he said
         "you're home",           I said "I know", and after that I don't remember much at
         all.




         DEBRA M ARTIN
         Well,      when w e w ere actually at Hillsborough,          all officers dealing at
         Hillsborough were all told not to put it down in proper statement form.
         W e'd got to put it down as the actual event had happened, because they'd
         said they'd much prefer that because everything would be included.                     W e'd
         got to remember everything,            so the statements were done more or less
         there and then, but not in statement form. At the time I only knew Kevin as
         a number.       M y statement was written as the disaster had happened and not
         in true statement form.

          He said "mum", he did. I brought him round, i was so pleased with myself
          because I'd seen so many around me that had died, but there was definitely
          a pulse there, I'm not making it up.            As I say if you can’t find a proper pulse
          in the wrist,           the best place to go for is to feel at the throat, there is pulse
          there.         I did feel just a tiny pulse,    and as I say his colour was going, he
          was beginning to turn a bit grey, but when I got him going a little bit of
          pinkness did come back into him, but he was alive in my arms when I was
          bringing him round.




         ROGER COOK
         Did he just move, was he breathing?




         DEBRA MARTIN
         There was just a slight rise and fall,           but I’d actually got him, I actually had
         him alive and             he did open his eyes and he did say "mum", I would never
         lie. All the time I've been in the force I’ve never been one to lie, everything
         that I've seen and done and heard has gone straight down in my pocket
         book.




         ROGER COOK
         So that statem ent was one hundred percent the truth?

          DEBRA MARTIN
          I had to lie.




          ROGER COOK
          Tell me about it.



         DEBRA MARTIN
         A fter the tragedy had happened,                the Hillsborough families had to come
         down for an enquiry, which again I was never a part of.                        It's    as though I'd
         been there, but been forgotten, probably because I was a Special Constable,
         because there's a lot of police officers who think that w e're just "hobby
         bobbies" as they call us and w e just like to take their overtime. I'd just been
         completely forgotten.              It was a while later, i'm not quite sure to be honest,
         that i was notified that W est Midlands had been brought into it, because
         they were doing the enquiry.




         I had some CID gentleman come down to interview me, at home because
         they said it was best for me, with them being strangers. The first time I had
         tw o police officers and they were ever so nice.                      They asked me some
         questions and             there was no asking of changing of statements or anything
         like that, they just wanted to know exactly w h at happened.




        So, I told them exactly w hat had happened,               more or less word for word, as
        I had done in my statement and explained to them again that w e 'd been told
        to write it out, as it happened and not in statement form, and they were
        great and they went.

          Then there was another tw o CID officers who came.                         I remember they
         stayed at the M oat House Hotel on Chesterfield Road South and one of
         them liked collecting cap-badges.            He said to me at the end o f it all            "right
         then, we'll not bother you any more", so I w ent "oh is that it then?",                           he
         said "yes, but you can do me one favour, I like collecting cap badges, if you
         can get any, give me a call".            He gave me his number.             He said "and you
         can send them through the post".               I remember him as I say because he
         collected these cap-badges,            and that was, as far as I was concerned over
         and done with.




         Then,       another officer got in contact with me, I didn’t know her name.                           I
         found out afterwards that her name was "Appleton".                          She was a small
         blonde haired wom en,           she seemed nice at the time.           She said that they'd
         found some further information out which they needed to check out so she
         asked if they could come down to my home and I said "yes, if it's going to
         help I’ ll do it".




        The first time she came she was nice and said that she may have to call
         back again, but it might not be necessary.            Then      the phone calls started.
        She knew w hat I'd been through but she wouldn't let go.




        A t first she started ringing my home demanding for my w ork number and
        my mum said "I'm sorry I can't give you her work number.                       It's a new job
        and they don't like people c o ntacting".          Then I was at w ork one day, and
        we had a phone call.                   our receptionist came into surgery and told me
        who it was and I w ent out and spoke to Appleton.                I said "but yo u ’ve seen
        me twice already", he said "I've got to see you again”.




        Signed                                                                               17

             This particular time she came, and to be honest I ca n 't remember if she
             came by herself, I think she came by herself. She sat where I'm sitting now
             and she'd got a briefcase to one side of her.                 She brought out all these
             papers,     she asked me questions again.           She asked "and how are you
          feeling?",       i said "well to be honest I'm not feeling very well".                      So she said,
             "well,    w h at's the matter with you then?".              I said "I've been through
          Hillsborough and I'm having a fe w problems".




        _____________________________________________________________ So she started
         chattering on, and she looked at me and smiled, and she said "oh there is
         something".             As I say it's not word for word but I remember,                      I remember
         things like this ... and I always remember her looking at me and smiling, she
         said "oh there is one message I've got to give you",                            and I said "what's
         that?".        So she said        "we don't believe you".     So I said "I'm sorry you've
         lost m e” .          She said "we don't believe you".          She said "we think you've
         made it all u p '.           I said "made all what up?", so she said,                         "your first
         statement.         As a matter of fact we don't think you were at Hillsborough".                              I
         said 'but I was at Hillsborough".             So she said "well, the message from my
         boss is,        he doesn't believe a word you've said, he thinks you made it all
         up.      He seems to think, and I seem to think that               you're just doing this so
         that you can get a bit of attention".




         f just broke down, I just couldn't believe it.              She said "we don’t w ant to
        take your first           statement into consideration, we w ant you to make a new
        one” .        I looked at her and I said "I'm sorry i've got to go out".                         I was in
        tears.        I walked into the kitchen, and my mum and dad said to me                           "what's
        the matter?",            so I told them.   My dad got up and he said "right, I’m kicking
        her out".

               By then I'd just had enough.              I felt as though I were going over the edge,
               because it w asn’t me. It felt like a stranger in another person's body. ! said
               "no dad".          "I've had enough” dad said ..." I’ m going to th ro w her out,
               they're not going to change your statement".                   I looked and I said "no, it
               doesn't matter".           I remember walking in and she'd got the papers out.                  She
               said "right then, w e ’ll get started".




               She started doing a n ew statem ent and I thought that I'd have to write it
               down, but she got the statem ent papers on her knee and she started it.
               Then suddenly she said "no, I w ant a better word", and she w ent into her
               briefcase and she pulled a dictionary out, and she started thumbing through
               this dictionary.           She then said "yes, that sounds like a good word'', as
               though I were a complete idiot,                as though I'd got no brain whatsoever for
               myself.      And she started writing and these words were beinp thrown at me
               ...by then I was in cloud nine, cuckoo-land.              She finished the statement and
              she said to me, "right then. I’ll read it through to you".




               She started reading out and again as I say 1 was just oblivious to the fact.
              She said "right, I w ant your signature!".                 I looked at her and I thought,
               "I've got to do it, if this is one w a y of getting rid of her, and trying to forget
              Hillsborough I’ll sign it", and I signed it,              and she just smiled at me again
              and she said "yes, w e 'v e got it now, all nicely tied up", and that was it, she
              upped and left.




              After that I didn't hear anything more from them.
              _______________________________                 Then as 1 say it was just over and done
              with,      I'd been       to see     videos,    because they wanted to know where I’d
              pin-pointed       the little boy's body,          again as I say I only knew            him as a
              number. Then w e had to go down to Snig Hill, in full uniform, into one of
              the theatres and the then Chief Constable was there and he said "all those
              that had been there had done an excellent job".                 He also said "if there w?
              anything anyone wanted to ask, he would deem it his right to try and

          I always remember standing up and saying to him,                         "well, I was there sir,
          all I know is this little boy is a number, could you find out his name for
          me?".          He asked w h at I'd done,        and I said "I thought I'd saved his life but
          he died on me", and as far as I was concerned, my first statem ent stood.




          I d completely forgotten about the second one and 1 w a s n 't to know that
          they d used my second statement.                  Some time later I found out that it was
          Kevin. Then in 1 9 9 0 , I tried to go on duty and I just couldn't, I was forcing

          faith,       and to me she'd made me feel like a murderer, as though                        I was a

           ROGER COOK
          W hy do you think that they wanted your statement changed?



          DEBRA MARTIN
          Well to be honest,                 with "Appleton";                   because that's all I can call that
          woman, "Appleton", the w a y she talked to me,                                    she made me feel it was
          because I was a "Special" I was nothing.



          ROGER COOK
          But w h y would they w ant the truth changed, that's w h at I'm asking you?



          DEBRA MARTIN
          That's w hat I couldn't understand,                             I just couldn't understand w hy they
          couldn't accept my first statem ent,                         and apparently because it didn't weigh
          up it didn’t come into the puzzle.                        All the other bodies were just right,                   and
          unfortunately Kevin's w asn 't, because I'd actually done mouth and mouth
          and then got a slight pulse.                      I'd brought him back                and he'd actually said
           mum , that's the reason w h y she wouldn't                                   accept my first statement
          because it w ouldn’t tie in with the rest of the other deaths.




         ROGER COOK
         And the consistency in the other deaths meant that you have this cut-off
         point at three fifteen, ...




         DEBRA MARTIN
         Exactly.

            ROGER COOK
            ...and everything else after it couid be swept under the carpet.



           DEBRA MARTIN
           Exactly.




           DEBRA MARTIN
           Fair enough there was some bodies,                   as far as I knew.         I just did not know
           w h at was happening because I was ferrying                 bodies in, being dead or alive,
           so time was irrelevant to me.             But how they can actually say that ail those
           people died at that cut-off time                I just don’t believe it, because there were
           people after that.            I mean even Kevin, that was about ten to four,                between
           quarter to and ten to four I'd say, th at’s when I'd got him, and then                               he
           died.        So how they can say that he died the same time as all the rest,
           they’re just lying.           As I say, it's just one big cover-up and it's something
           th a t’s got to be brought out into the open for people to realise, that they
           can't get aw ay with this sort of thing.




           ROGER COOK
           And w h a t are they covering up thought, is it incompetent policing,                              is it
           ill-considered arrangements for a tragedy?




           DEBRA MARTIN
           I think it's that, being honest.           I don't really know how they work,                there's
           somebody out there who has got a sick mind.                   If they could have just used
           my first statem ent, and agreed on w hat had happened                          then I would have
           been happy.




           ROGER COOK
           But it would have made their job tougher.

            DEBRA MARTIN
            Exactly, so they had to cut me out and make me look like fool and liar.



            ROGER COOK
           But now you know that at least tw o prominent forensic scientists support
           you.



            DEBRA MARTIN
           Wei!,      to be honest,              after five years and this happening,               I cried about
           Hillsborough for the first time in five years.                I actually cried.              I cried for
           about an hour, I've never cried like that before, never. Knowing that there's
           people who are believing me, that's it, I can't thank them enough for this.




           ROGER COOK
           And,        if people had taken more notice of w h at was happening at the time,
           as those forensic scientists say, there are some people probably including
           Kevin, who might be alive today.




           DEBRA MARTIN
           Yes.      1 would say that, but how they can turn round and say that all those
           people died exactly at the same time, it's like asking someone to drop a
           bomb on a load of people, fair enough th ey’d die at the same time. But you
           can't expect all those people to die at the same time, no w ay,                               no w ay,
           unless someone, as I say was lying, and it's just been one cover-up. If they
           could only have been truthful at the beginning, and agreed on w hat had
           happened,             and taken my statement as being truthful, as it w as, then none
           of this would be happening today, five years later.

          ROGER COOK

          Try and explain to me in your own words, instead of listening to me, w h a t it
          is you think th e y ’re covering up?



          DEBRA MARTIN
         From my own point-of-view, they come across all these deaths and they've
         found one little boy. W hether or not they hold it against me being a special
         constable and not for being a proper police officer,              i'm not sure, but in my
         own mind I think that's w h at they hold against me, the fact of being, not a
         responsible police officer who's had tw o years training,                         to become an
         officer, but a special police constable.



         ROGER COOK
         But I mean             you're also supported by another serving police office w ho,
         obviously isn't being allowed to speak to us at the moment.



         DEBRA MARTIN
         Exactly.




         ROGER COOK
        But leaving aside the fact that you’re not given full credit for being a police *
        officer, or be it a "Special”, w hat is the system trying to cover up; and here
        I'm referring you back to, you know, the fact that if they can have a cut-off
        point at three fifteen, that's it, everything fits beautifully?



        DEBRA MARTIN
        Yes.

              Right, now tel! me               if that's w hat you think try and reflect it in your own

             DEBRA MARTIN
             I don't know. They're trying to cover up their ow n incompetence, w hy they
             should try to cover it up I've no idea.              W h at they've done should not have
             happened and it shouldn't have happened at all, they just should have been

             have.

              It would have shown that there was other people being injured or dead,
              were actually dying after that time.



           ROGER COOK
           And could have been saved?

          They could have been saved.                       But       I only knew w h at was going off when I
          was in the gym you see.                       I don't know w hat was going o ff outside because
          once w e d been told to stay where w e were, that was it i was totally cut

           There was a lot of things going off; you could see that some police officers
           were in shock.         There were some who were just stood around, there were
          others w ho were trying to help.          But I couldn’t really say exactly w h at was
          going off, because again I was taking people into the gym,                      so I was more
          or less oblivious to w h at was going on all around me, all I was bothered
          about was taking the bodies in, off the pitch.



          ROGER COOK

          Put in another w ay,          are there valuable lessons that could have been learnt
          if they have considered the period after three fifteen?

              KENNETH DANIEL WILLIAMS                                            04,03.93




              Further to the recent correspondence, I draw your attention to page 5 of the
              transcript of proceedings of the inquest on the k May 1990, paragraph *A’.
              It is clear that inspector SAWYERS was directed to see PC BRUDER as a
              result of an enquiry from the Coroner* I also draw your attention to the
              other transcript in respect    proceedings on the 2 May 1990 at page 8,
              paragraph ‘E*. Dr SLATER,        ^called» makes it clear that the concept
              that the evidence of 'opening yes and speaking1 is not really conceivable.

              It is evident from all these circumstances that the distressed condition of
              the Woman Special Constable was sufficient to produce an inaccurate account
              of the facts as they were not possible in view of the medical opinion and
              clearly conflict with the evidence by PC BRUDER.

              At 11.45 am today I had a telephone conversation with Derek William
              BRUDER, Police Constable 7808 of the Merseyside Police, who confirms that
              his second statement {unpaginated - but taken on the 3 May 1990 by
              Inspectors SAWYERS) was made entirely voluntarily and without any
              pressure, duress or other persuasion by Inspector SAWYERS.

              It was interesting during the conversation with PC BRUDER that he also
                                                                     ,
              indicated that a solicitor, on behalf of the relatives had interviewed him
              and suggested the possibility that his second statement could have been
              furnished as a result of cajolery or other improper action by the West
              Midlands Police. Additionally, PC BRUDER was challenged by the solicitor
              as to whether his contact with the Coroner was construed by him as undue
              pressure, PC BRUDER maintains that he has made it clear to the solicitor
              that this was NOT the case.

               In all the circumstances it would      clear that the conflict in the
               evidence was factual on the account* given by the various witnesses, namely
               PC BRUDER and woman special Constable MARTIN, but all of the evidence
               supports the account given by PC BRUDER.

               CONCLUSION t
               There was no improper conduct by Inspector SAWYERS In re-taking the
               statement from Police Constable BRUDERj he was merely clarifying a request
                               hspu-^i the transcript at page 5 of the A May 1992.

      TO:                 ______

      DATE:               3.6.94



      I led an enquiry which I believe to have beer, very thorough into the
      H-^lsborough Disaster, interviewing almost 13,000 people during the
      course of the investigation. All the material was made availaole to the
      then Lord Justice Taylor, the Coroner and the Director o. Public
      Prosecutions.
      Watching the Cook Report yesterday evening, I was not convinced that any
      new evidence was presented which would hove changed the outcome of Lord
      justice Taylor's inquiry or the Coroner s inquest.

       However clearly the issues raised are of importance to some people but
       it is tor then to pursue these through the appropriate legal cnannels
       I do rot trirk a half hour television programme can properly examine the
       issues raised and co:r.e «, conclusions objectively. - there ore intend
       to say nothing further on this natter and to await any legal
       developments which may arise.

Re:    The Cook Report - ITV - 8.30 p.m. - 9.00 p.m. - Thursday 2 June 1994

The Coroner, Chris Dorries, rang to    speak to Chief Superintendent Lowe or
his deputy on Thursday 2 June 1994.     I rang the Coroner who directed our
attention to the judgement of the judicial review held in November 1993
which may answer questions which may be raised by the programme.     He has
advised Gillian Radcliffe to this effect also.

The programme   appears to surround    the circumstances of the death of
Kevin Williams and the statements of Debby Martins who was a special
constable on Saturday 15 April 1989 and who had dealings with Kevin.

I have arranged for AVA to record the programme and supply us with the video
recording for our files.

Roger Cook says of evidence previously disregarded or altered under duress
and witnesses ignored.

The allegation concerning the disregarding of evidence refers          to the
ambulance arriving at 3.37 p.m. and not featured at the inquest.       The BBC
video was in fact part of the compilation tape shown to the            inquiry
proceedings.

Pressure on Witnesses by Colleaqes to Alter Statements

Completely unfounded.

Police Constable Bruder

Documentary evidence in the file from Police Constable Bruder shows that
no pressure, duress or other persuasion was placed upon him - statement
dated 3 May 1990.   The only information the Cook Report have had regarding
this allegation is from Mrs Williams.

Debbie Martin

Pressure was allegedly placed by two West Midlands Police officers to change
her statement.

Debbie Martin waited 4/5 years to make allegation.

Great inconsistencies in the account she gave to the Cook Report and the
facts as we know them.   From the Cook Report itself Police Constable Bruder
is  timed   giving resuscitation   to Kevin Williams   at 3.37 p.m.    Police
Constable Bruder shows he continued resuscitation for between 10-15 minutes
and says it was probably 13 minutes.  That takes the time to about 3.50 p.m.

Debbie Martin asks us to believe that when Police Constable Bruder and the
St Johns Ambulance officers gave up on Kevin Williams, whilst on the pitch,
she, Debbie Martin, carried Kevin Williams with others into the gymnasium.
At the door to the gymnasium police officers were directing stretcher bearers
to different parts of the building and indeed segregating dead bodies from
live casualties.   Kevin Williams was directed into the area containing dead
bodies.   She there alleges that she carried out mouth to mouth resuscitation
on Kevin Williams so successfully that he opened his eyes and uttered the
word 'mum'.    The Cook Report says this was at 3.^5 p.m.    We are asked to
believe by Debbie Martin that in the space of, to be generous, less than
2  minutes, she carried the body from the pitch, passed the police check
point, into the gymnasium and revived him.                                    v

Video  evidence   found  at   this office  and  timed   at   3.50 p.m.  shows
Debbie Martin doing nothing from at least that time onwards.   She is clearly
grossly mistaken, so traumatised that she believes her own actions were
true or quite simply is lying.

Witnesses Ignored or Not Traced

The people referred to are Mr O'Keefe, Mr Hart and Mr Edwards.      All   three
were traced and interviewed and statements obtained.
Their evidence was of a general nature and when requests were made to make
that evidence more specific, in the case of Mr Hart, he refused. Mr Edwards
and Mr O'Keefe could add nothing of significant value.

The Cook Report says that Kevin Williams was alive at 3.55 p.m.

We have video evidence that this is untrue.

Did not want     a different version from Debbie Martin we wanted the truth
and to refute    that we have a vast array of medical people to say it was
impossible for    him to be alive at that stage. Some say he would have been
dead before he   was taken from the pen.

Police Constable Bruder and Special Constable     Martin were before asked       to
qualify certain aspects of their statements and   not alter it in any way.

He Died When He Might Have Been Saved

There was no lack of effort to save Kevin Williams on the part of Police
Constable Bruder and the St Johns Ambulance personnel (unknown).       The St
Johns Ambulance personnel advised Police Constable Bruder that Kevin Williams
had 'g on e'.

3.28 p.m.   -   Still Alive

The people shown on the video,   Mr Hart and Mr O'Keefe, both gave statements
to the police.

In the case of Mr O'Keefe, ......'there were       so many bodies around   and    I
checked some for signs of life but found no n e' .....

In the case of Mr Hart, ......'as we lifted him onto the board a policeman
came forward and pulled the lads jumper up and over his face and I realised
then that he was d e a d '......

On 28 October 1989 Mr Hart was requested to assist for visual evidence            to
be shown for identification and continuity. He declined to assist.

Bruder - The Kiss of Life

Evidence from the Pathologist statement states that bodies which are brain
stem dead continue to twitch for sometime after the brain stem has died.
In the words of one Consultant Neurologist, ..... 'they can twitch and very
unnerving it is too'.....

The Neurologist, Mr Gumpert, was called to the mini inquiry on Kevin Williams
and gave evidence to the coroner to this effect.  From the evidence available
Police Constable Bruder was attempting to resuscitate a body that was brain
stem dead but still twitching.
Sir Malcolm Thornton MP

Does the Cook Report have any evidence that the truth was surpressed?

What is meant    by   the   statement    from Malcolm Thornton      that       the    truth   was
surpressed?

Events After 3.15 p.m. - Not Investigated

A full, thorough,     painstaking inquiry from       when   the   victim       left    hom that
day to the time of    the post mortem.

Details are clearly documented and the inquiry most certainly did continue
after 3.15 p.m.     The time of 3.15 p.m. was set    by the coroner as to
causation.

Malcolm Thornton says officers were leaned on.       This has been                     refuted.
Thornton is merely repeating what he has been told by Mrs Williams.

N.B.  Ambulance    service would not allow their personnel to be interviewed
by the West Midlands Police.  It is not unusual for this to happen.

Don Page

Allegation of surpressing     evidence     from   Cook   refers     to   the    ambulance     on
the BBC video at 3.37 p.m.

That BBC video was shown to the inquiry in the form of a compilation tape.

Don Page says nothing on their statements were ever changed the inference
being that those of Police Constable Bruder and Special Constable Martin
were changed.   They were not.    Further statements were taken to qualify
certain aspects    of their original statements and the original statements
were still submitted for information and scrutiny.

Spearitt complaint dealt with separately.




Sheila Coleman

Taylor report provided a full inquiry.       It had no restriction on time.

Mrs Williams says her son died      at   3.55 p.m.       (We have    conclusive        evidence
that her son died before then).

Dr West says he may not have died if he had been treated earlier enough.
Shiela Coleman - Statements were not            altered.  New        statements          were    taken
to qualify the original statements.              The original        statements          were    still
presented.

Cook again says that Kevin was alive at 3.^5 p.m.

Debbie Martin alleges      that    West    Midlands    Police   accused     her     of    not    being
at Hillsborough.

Statements taken by West Midlands Police from Debbie Martin asks her to
identify  herself  on   video  which  she  does.    Statement was taken on
12 July 1989 and she makes reference to video being shown to her by West
Midlands police officers in which she identifies herself.

We did not   ask   her   to alter    her    first     statement.     We    wanted    her    to   make
a new one.

Mrs Martin   has   no   direct    knowledge    of   the   incident    or    statement       taking.




Cook says other witnesses claim Kevin was alive after he was taken from
the terraces. The inference being its the next people to be interviewed.

Hart says there was no doubt that he was alive. In his original statement
he says ..... 'as we lifted him onto the board a policeman came forward
and pulled the lads jumper up and over his face and I realised then that
he was d e a d '.....

Hart - Inconsistencies of evidence and video shows he was already on a board
though in his statement he states that he was lifted and placed on a board.
In his original statement he says ......'there were so many bodies around
and I checked some for signs of life but found no n e ' .....

Cook Report says Bruder      comes across him at 3.35 p.m.

Mrs Williams Allegation      that Bruder Changed a Statement

Bruder made a second statement         qualifying his own thoughts originally now
that he had had the opportunity        to have first aid lessons and have a greater
understanding of people in the        throes of death.   He also saysthat    he was
not placed under duress and no        pressure whatsoever applied.  This particular
application was aired following       the application for judicial review.
Allegation that the ambulance at 3.37 p.m. was not shown to the inquest.

That video was shown to the inquest in the form of a compilation tape.

Time of the ambulance confirms that Police Constable Bruder was              attempting
to revive a corpse at 3.37 p.m. not when Kevin Williams was alive.

Mr Edwards gave   a statement   to   the police   explaining      why he   did          not stop
in the stadium.

Mrs Williams asked Bruder what he had put in writing and she said he refused.
He had already put it in writing.

Bruder's statement was summarised to the inquest proceedings.

When interviewing Dr Popper,    Cook    says   ambulance   does   not   appear     in    the
police video.  It does.

Dr Slater, Pathologist, was asked at the inquest about bodies expelling
air when dead. This was considered a real possibility with Kevin Williams.

Chief Superintendent Mike Foster feels that Cook says this is                    the    best
evidence. It is not.  It has already been aired in several venues.

Dr West says people were recoverable after 3.15 p.m.    Agreed.   About 70
people were treated and recovered after that time.      All those who did,
however, were dead before 3.15 p.m. or the cause of their death had taken
place.

Enquiries did continue after 3.15 p.m.     The Lord Justice Taylor inquiry.

a watch on the lists, assessing the witnesses as to whether
or not you should be present. He will do whatever we can
by supplying the same Information as we have supplied up to
now to you or to your Instructing solicitors. I hope that
helps.
      MISS SINCLAIR: Sir, I am very grateful and      I would
say again that It Is not In the least our wish to delay the
Court by an adjournment and we are planning various means
of keeping an eye on what Is going on. Thank you.
      THE CORONER: Is there anything you want to say In
the absence of the jury so that you don't have to wait until
we have finished with the video. If there were I would send
them out and deal with It now?
     MR. MANNING:   Witnesses for Monday, sir?
      MR. JONES: It Is intended P.C. Grunhlll; Sergeant Smith?
subject to his fitness to return to duty Inspector Hand-Davls;
Sergeant Thomas and Police Constable Wilson Is also warned
as well sir.
      THE CORONER: These are all, I think, mounted Officers
of one sort or another.
                      (Short adjournment)

      THE CORONER: Right, we are going to watch the
compilation tape, as it is known. You will remember it
Is split in two. We will watch to the end of the first
section.

      TBS CORONER:   Can you just pause there for a Minute?
The Jury have asked whether a particular gate is opened.
They, have given ae a little drawing. In fact it is the gap
in a wall within the concourse area, it is not in this
picture. That was not actually a gate. There was a gate
there but it was a gap in the wall so you could get
through.

     Is there anything that you want to say to me
without the Jury being present, because we could do
this now to save you time?
     MR. PAYNE: I do not mind if the Jury are here. I
would like to just mention the question of exhibits.
You did say earlier that the deadline for the
introduction of further photographs or exhibits would
be at the adjournment of the Court next Wednesday.
      THE CORONER: I think you misunderstood me, Mr.
Payne. What I meant was the deadline - and even then
I put a caveat in - was for nominations for further
witnesses whom you wished me to consider, not
exhibits, because exhibits we might well want to
introduce as we go along. So there is no deadline on
that because we do not know what we might need. What
I was trying to do was get you to compile, if you have
any additional names, those names so that I can
consider them. I think I did say - I intended to aay
- that even if we have past the deadline, if something
crops up and there is a witness who is considered by
any of you as really vital, then I will look at that,
but I do not want to get dozens of them In January
time.
    MR. PAYNE:   Thank you very much.
     THE CORONER: We will go and have coffee then and
we will be back in quarter-of-an-hour. I think that
seems to be quite a good time. I do not think we can
do it in much less time really.

Further to the recent correspondence, I draw your attention to page 5 of the
transcript of proceedings of the inquest on the 4 Hay 1990, paragraph 'A*.
It Is clear that Inspector SAWYERS was directed to see PC BRUDER as a
result of an enquiry from the Coroner. I also draw your attention to the
other transcript In respect of proceedings on the 2 May 1990 at page 8 ,
paragraph *E*. Dr SLATER, when recalled, Bakes it clear that the concept
that the evidence of 'opening eyes and speaking* Is not really conceivable.
It is evident froa all these circumstances that the distressed condition of
the Woman Special Constable was sufficient to produce an inaccurate account
of the facts as they were not possible In view of the nedtcal opinion and
clearly conflict with the evidence by PC BRUDSR.
At 11.45 an today I had a telephone conversation with Derek Hllllaa
BRUDER, Police Constable 7808 of the Merseyside Police, who confirms that
his second stateaent (unpaginated - but taken on the 3 Hay 1990 by
Inspectors SAWYERS) was made entirely voluntarily and without any
pressure, duress or other persuasion by Inspector SAWYERS.
It was Interesting during the conversation with PC BRUDfcR that he also
indicated that a solicitor, on behalf of the relatives, had interviewed hla
and suggested the possibility that his second statement could have been
furnished as a result of cajolery or other improper action by the Vest
Midlands Police. Additionally, PC BRUDER was challenged by the aollcltor
as to whether his contact with the Coroner was construed by hia as undue
pressure. PC BRUDER maintains that he has aade it clear to the solicitor
that this was 90t the case.
In all the circuostances it would seem clear that the conflict In the
evidence was factual on the accounts given by the various witnesses, naaely
PC BRUDER and Wooan Special Constable MARTIN, but all of the evidence
supports the account given by PC BRUDER.
CONCLUSION i
There was no inproper conduct by Inspector SAWYERS in ro-taking the
statement froa Police Constable BRUDER| he was merely clarifying a request
of. the coroner, hence the transcript at page 5 of the 4 May 1992,

halfway line. I'm not sure if this was after the first or second nan.
People in the Leppings Lane end then ripped down advertising hoardings
and began to carry people on than up tcwards the comer famed by the
SpiDn Kop and the North Stand. I could see that sane of then were
presumed dead as they had coats over their faces and one nan In
particular had a juqper pulled back to oover his face. These people
were then rolled onto the pitch and the carriers went back for note
people or bodies.
The police then formed a further cordon in front of the North stand.
Around the sane time a nurriber of people wearing tracksuit trousers and
sweatshirts came frcra the direction of the players tunnel and went to
the Spion Kop end. They then pulled down more hoardings here and went
to help carry more people     14?   frcm Leppings Lane.
A number of people were also carried up to the comer in front of me
bodily. There were a large number of people in this comer either
laid out behind the police on the pitch or sitting with their heads in
their hands.
I did not see   any   of the Police in the cordon in front of the North
Stand break ranks to assist these people.
I saw one person on the pitch about a quarter of the pitch length away
fro.Ti the Spion Kop about twenty feet from the hoardings in front of
the North stand. I distinctly remember this because later on as I
will describe an ambulance drove directly past us and a St John's
Ambulance man   who   was with me tried to flag it down but it carried on.
I an not sure if this man had been carried on a hoarding or by his
friand who was with him. I saw this man lying on the floor having
convulsions.
The Police cordon in front of the North Stand appeared unconcerned and
'smaxny', this agitated the supporters in the stand who ware shouting
BRUOER                DEREX WIUJAM


for them to go and help the people on the pitch. None of the Police
officers left the cordon.
I was very close to the pitch so I vent down the aisle, over a snail
fiva foot wall with hoardings on, I walked through the cordon without
being challenged at all and then went to the nan having convulsions.
Alirost immediately I was joined by a St John's Aribulanoe nan. I
identified myself to the St Johns nan as an off duty Police Officer.
He then said to me " You do mouth to mouth and I'll do heart nassage".
I then took his pulse in his neck.   I could feel a slight pulse. I
then ccmnenced uouth to mouth resuscitation and the St John's nan
started heart nassage. I undid two buttons on the top of the man's
shirt. If I remember rightly the bottom of the shirt appeared
ripped.
We continued to work on the man but after about five minutes he went
grey and his face was withdrawn. As I had approached the nan his head
had moved as if he was being sick. When I got to him I cleared his
mouth and the back of his throat of vomit before ccmnencing mouth to
mouth resuscitation. There was no blood in the vomit. After dbout
five minutes when the man went grey, a very distinctive smell
fron his mouth. I can still remember it now but could not Ascribe
it.
After about seven minutes I swapped places with the St John's
Ambulance man and he commenced mouth to mouth and I heart nassage. As
                      /
I did heart massage his ribs were unnaturally prominent in the whole
of his rib cage even though he was only thinly built. His stomach
was depressed and abnormally lower than his ribcage.
After a short time I undid the button on his trousers and ripped open
the zip. I then continued heart massage.
Shortly afterwards an arribulance entered the ground. It appeared to be
BRUDER                  DEREK WILLIAM                                         2


years. On 15 April 1989 (150489) I had received no further Instruction
or refresher training in basic first aid. However, as a direct result
of the situation I found myself in on the day of the disaster I
personally felt inadequately equipped in either theory or
practise of first aid. I am absolutely satisfied that the first aid
I rendered in terras of mouth to mouth resuscitation and heart Massage
were correct and that I could have done no more, but nevertheless, I
felt I didn't know enough and regretted not having taken that aspect
of initial training seriously enough.
For these reasons, I applied on uy own iniative for further first aid
training in the form of a one week full time course leading to
qualification as a first aid public order trained officer. I undertook
the course in June last year, which means I now have a special role
within public order deployments to treat casualties either of members
of the public or police officers as injuries occur.
As a result of that course, I feel confident and nuch better equipped
to deal with injured people whether those injuries be minor or life
threatening.     It also confirms that in fact, my actions were right on
the day and my attempts at resuscitation, although unsuccessful were
properly administered.
I w ill new deed with a number of specific points frcm my original
statement (27.4.89) (270489), using the page n u tte r s of that statement.
I understand that the nutters I will use in brackets are those of the
file of statements contained in respect of Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS,
prepared by West Midlands Police under the deceased reference number
51.
On page   6   (File page 41) I first refer to the youth I now know to be
Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS lying a 1/4 length of the pitch from the Spicn
Kop. I refer to him been "on the floor", meaning the pitch surface.
BRUDER                  CERBC WILLIAM                                     3


and "having convulsions".    I have thought about this carefully today
and with the added benefit of ray training I can say that this was not a
process that lasted for any time.    It certainly wasn't anything similar
to an epileptic fit, for example.    It was an impression that I had
which I originally associated with the lad vanitting. I will say that
I did not see the casualty vcmit nor did I see any sick on the body or
grassed area around him.    I will correct further references to vomit as
they occur in my original statement.
On page 7 (42) 1 describe approaching the body. He was not convulsing
as I did so (line 5).
I refer to feeling for a carotid pulse in the neck and said originally
that I thought I could detect a slight pulse however I now feel that I
ant able to correct this.   I felt for the pulse with ray first two
fingers of my left hand, I believe, to the carotid artery I cannot say
absolutely that I felt for the pulse before I started mouth to mouth or
after, noar indeed whether I did both simultaneously. Whilst I would
new have much more skill, on the day I cannot say with absolute
certainty that I went, accurately, straight to the carotid artery.
For all these reasons, I can say that I felt for a pulse in the region
of the carotid artery, but I may have also touched the area of the
"Adams Apple* or felt something in the neck region which I originally
thought was a pulse but may have been mistaken.
I refer to the face going "grey" and his "face was withdrawn.” I
cannot say specifically that this was a change frcm normal paller to
grey, or what I row know to be cynoeis or blueness. I mentioned it in
the sequence of when I became aware of it.
I refer to approaching the lad and having the impression that his head
moved and associating this with his being sick. I am now absolutely
satisfied that he was not sick, or certainly I did not see vendtting or
BRUDER                  CEREK WILLIAM                                    4

varit. The movement of the head, if that* what it was, I would say its
best described as a 'twitch'.
I refer to clearing his mouth before resuscitation, by that I mean to
say I checked that his airway was clear before expressing air into his
mouth. There was a fluid of seme description but I accept readily that
this could have been spittle or phlegn.
I refer to the man going grey after about 5 minutes and a very
distinctive smell caning from his mouth. This was again not vomit but
its true to say I can still remember it now as it caused me to heave
and feel side myself.
I refer to performing mouth to mouth whilst the St John ambulanceman
did heart compression for about 7 minutes. Whilst this is purely
recollection I believe it to reasonably accurate.
Having changed places with the St Johns Arcbulance man I refer to
feeling what I thought was an unusual rib cage and abdomen.   A
photograph I have been shewn at poet mortem appears to suggest this.
I refer to unzipping the lads trousers at this point and in ay second
statement recollect the striped boxer shorts which I have seen in
photographs (Ref Ho TT1/31 and TT1/32).
I have been shewn docunents which purport to give timings of the
arrival on the pitch of the 1st ambulance (St Johns Ambulance) and the
2nd ambulance (being the 1st SYMftS ambulance). I have considered this
information (referred to as MAP 1 15.15-33 and RJH2 15.17-08) in
comparison with the photographs PR5/A/32 and PR5/A/33 which purport to
show the casualty being carried on a stretcher at 15.32 (1532) and
which I understand would be before I saw and assisted to resuscitate
him at the Spion Kop end of the ground. I cannot reconcile the time
sequences and I am still sure that I did see an ambulance, distinguish
in ay own mind that it was not of St Johns but Health Authority and
                                                                       STKTION

        Further to my previous statements I would like to add the following,
        On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I worked in the capacity of
        Special Constable at the F.A. Semi-Final football natch between
        Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C. which was being played at
        the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield.
        My recollection of the events of that day are vague and confused.
        As a result of the disaster I was prescribed medication by ly Doctor




                                                                   I felt like
        a 'Zombie.'
        As a result of this I feel that my memory, ay recollection of that day
        is possibly inaccurate. I am unsure of what tine I arrived at the
        Leppings Lane entrance to the ground or even how I came to be on the
        pitch but I did.
        By time I got onto the pitch it seemed to be mass confusion, these
        wers police officers and supporters all over the place. I could see
        people who appeared to be injured and possibly dead, lying on ths

                                                               «
 >WnN                   DEBRA JMC                                            .


 pitrh. I was in a state of stock.     I didn't t a w what to db but my
 natural instinct was to help these people in the best way that I could.
 I can't describe to you in any detail my exact ffioveraanta over the next
 half an hour or so. I knew that I approached several people lying on
 the pitch and assisted if possible. I did not give any of these
 people mouth-to-mouth or heart wassage.
 I dacided that there were enough people dealing with the situation
 at the leppings Lane end of the ground and made ay way to the Spion
 Kop end of the ground.
 I could see that bodies were being carried from the Leppings Lane end
 to the Spion Kop end of the ground and then being placed cn the pitch.
 I assisted to carry a nuifcer of dead and injured people fran the Spion
Kop end of the pitch, into the gymnasium where a tenporary aortuary
had been set up. I was talking to seme of these people, comforting
then and trying to reassure them. I am unable to describe any of
these people in the detail.
By this time I really was in a state of shock, I couldn't believe what
I was seeing. I seared to be on automatic pilot, My memories are
very confused and distorted.
I can recall carrying a youth who I new know to be, Kevin
WILLIAMS   fran the pitch to the gymnasium. He was the last person that
I assisted in carrying. I first saw Kevin W I U J M 6 lying on the pitch
near to the goal area at the Spion Kop end of the ground. At that
stage he wasn't on a hoarding or a stretcher.
I ramenter that there were several people around where he was lying.
I can't recall anyone giving him mouth to mouth. With the help of
other people, who I can't recall, Kevin WILLIAMS was placed onto a
hoarding and carried into the gymnasium. Someone instructed aa to
MAPHN                 DEBRA JANE


I didn't know what to do.   I didn't want to believe the boy was dead.
I didn't know if he was dead or not but I decided that I had got to
attempt to revive him.   I started to give him nwuth-to-cciuth but
scraone, I don't know who, touched me on the shoulder and told me he
was dead. Gy this time my head had gone, I wasn't aware of what I was
doing or what was really happening.
At 16.06 hours (1606) Doctor CURPEN examined Kevin WILLIAMS and
certified him dead.
I ramanber a detective officer, DC Paul M3KFRHDI helping me to
carplete the GEM 18 form (sudden death form).
I stayed with the body until the early hours of Sunday 16th April
(160489) when I escorted Kevin WILLIAMS, who at this stage had not
been identified, to the Medico Legal Centre.
I identified the body by the number allocated, which in the case was
Nurber 51. I had no further dealings with Kevin WILLIAMS.
This statement is made to the best of my recollection and I believe it
to be the truth. However, under the circumstances I cannot be
positive that the details are accurate.




I have mairked on a plan of the pitch (Reference D.J.M.1) the
approximaite location where I first cane into contact vith the
deceased, Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS.

Kevin Williams was alive

       at 3.55pm
South Yorkshire Police


 Overwhelming medical
evidence indicates Kevin
Williams was brain stem
 dead before extraction
      from the pen.

(Dr. Gumpert/ Dr. Slater)
  kept alive by artificial means and some of you may
  remember the case in America w h i c h was kept alive for
. thirteen and a half years.
 Some of us were concerned that the guidelines that were
 drawn up were not strict enough a nd that there was no
 call for them to be repeated a f t e r a passage of tine.
 Perhaps unwisely we said this and this resulted In a
 BBC "Panorama" programme one n ig ht at ten o'clock whan
 the medical profession for o nc a actually debated it,
 eight of us.    As a result of that debate tha
 regulations were hardened.    T h e y had to ba carried out
 by senior people who were used to doing it and they had
 to be repeated*    A satisfactory outcoae from ay
 personal point of view, although I don't know whether
 the anguish was worth it really*
 As a consequence of that I suppose in the next three
 years I had to go through this rather unpleasant
 procedure many times.   It was part of my professional
 duty but still to this day X c a n n o t certify someone
 dead without being disturbed b y it still.
 From this I suppose I have g ained a great deal of
 experience of brain death and b r a i n damage* It seems
 clear to me, sir, in this case that poor Kevin was
 probably dead before he was got out of the area in
 which he was standing.   I w ould agree with Dr* Slater.
 I would think consciousness was lost probably within
 ten seconds.   I would say loss of pain would be almost
 instantaneous - not quite, but almost.
 I cannot explain the Liverpool Police Constable's term
 "convulsion because to me a convulsion is a major
 epileptic attack and he has q uite clearly said he does
 not mean that, so I don't know w ha t he does mean.  I
 think it would be wrong for me to try and guess what he
 means.   I think we could accept that he does not mean
 any significant movement.
 Unfortunately, after people are brain stem dead, they
 can twitch and very unnerving it is too.   This is
 really due to a spinal reflex. What we think happens
 in anoxia - lack of oxygen - is that the brain stem
 dies first.   Tne cortex, that is the thinking part of
 the brain, your walnut, probably goes on quite a bit
 longer and the-peripheral nervous system probably quite
 a bit long still and I think that is the explanation of
 what has been described by the Liverpool officer.
. 1 know the Liverpool officer in his supplemental
  statement when he was discussing the question of a
  pulse says he may have been mistaken, but let us
  hypothesise that in fact he wasn't and he had felt a

     Kevin Daniel Uilliamj who was Also identified as No. 51,         is
     th4t right? - A. That i3 correct, sir.

Q.   Identification was done by Inspector Timms so far as you are
     concerned? - A. That was the initial identification.
                                                            «•*
Q. But there is no doubt   in your mind ,about the identity? -
A. Ho.

Q. There were various marks on the body itself to identify it?
A. Sir, Kevin was clearly labelled both by number and by name.

Q. Or- Slater, would you be kin<j enough then co take me through
  •the post mortem? - A. My examination of Kevin showed that
   the main finding was that o f asphyxia.        This opinion was
   formed through the extensive blueness on the face and upper
   part of the chest.   In addition there were small
   haemorrhages in both the face a n d internal organs including
   the brain, heart and lungs.      T h i s asphyxia had clearly
   resulted from compression o f the neck and chest and this
   opinion was supported by the presence of three small
   scratches over the left side of the neck and also over the
   front of the voice box.   T h i s h a d also resulted in four
   fractures to the small bones in the actual voice box.         In
   addition there was evidence of bruising to the lungs, again
   supporting compression of th e chest.

           Hy autopsy showed that Kevin was a normally developed,
     fit, healthy, young male wit h no evidence of any natural
     disease which could have contributed towards death and it
     was my opinion that Kevin had a normal life expectancy.   In
     terms of the mode of death the compression of the neck or
     chest has occurred here and unconsciousness occurs very
     rapidly, certainly within a few seconds, and there is one
     reported case of it occurring apparently instantaneously.
     Following unconsciousness then there is no discomfort and no
     pain.   Death then occurs after approximately three to five
     minutes, sir.

0. So because when we say asphyxia people think .of agony for
   ages and ages.  What you are saying is that the         person          j
   himself would very rapidly not know anything at all about
   what was happening? - A. I should say the word "asphyxia" is
   unfortunate in that sci ent if ical ly it partly includes simply        j
   that there is not enough oxygen in the blood.       It doesn't          j
   imply actual suffocation and prolonged death.

Q. Did you say there were four fractures to the voice box? -
A. Yes, there are two bones in the voice box, as you know, sir,
   and both these showed two fractures each*

Q. Now the reason why I asked you w a s this, and I want to put
   this to you because I would like to get your view on it, one
   Officer will be dealing with the value of this evidence in a

                              3



                                                              1011
 where unconsciousness can be instantaneous.     That is
 the rapid loss of consciousness.
As soon as that person becomes unconscious I have saieT
several times that pain modalities, discomfort, aeain
disappear very, veey quickly, perhaps within « second
or five seconds.                                 •«>»
 ■

In very general terms, certainly myself - and I h a v e
       t 0 keep it general - I then said that death * and
I have used the word very broadly, as you will*'
appreciate in my previous evidence - that deatH occurs
five, ten perhaps fifteen minutes, after.    I purposely
kept that very open because human beings are very '
variable.     You cannot say that somebody is going to
die in fifteen minutes, and not in fifteen r-inutes.
I am trying to put the concept that although I have
talked about averages, very occasionally you are toine
to have additional extremes.   I think Kevin was one of
these extremes that did not fall into this five, ten or
fifteen minute sequence of somatic death, whole body
death, but in fact this was extended.
Having said that, Kevin had extremely severe asphyxia.
I have no doubt in my own mind th a t he had* suffered
irrecoverable brain damage and d e a t h within the three
to six minutes that I said.   Therefore, I am quite
confident at that time that Kevin was dead and there is
nothing that anybody on this earth could have done for
him after that time, including PC Bruder and any
ambulance people who arrived.
Again, you will appreciate from what I have said to you
that although Kevin was brain dead I have not said that
other tissues in the body may not have been living -
the heart, muscles, nerves.    In fact I know Dr.
Gumpert will explain in a minute that in fact there are
mechanisms whereby when somebody is brain dead in fact
the muscles in the body can twitch.    This will come as
a surprise, and I apologise if it is emotive, this can
even happen to somebody who hasn't got a head.     That
person is clearly dead, they haven't got a head, but
those persons can actually have twitches in their
muscles.   This is what happened to Kevin.    lie died
early - brain death - but unfortunately in this
particular instance we are talking about an extreme
case where perhaps the heart beating went on for a bit
longer and we noticed these twitches, at least PC.
Bruder noticed these twitches in the body.
I feel this is what happened In the case of Kevin.

 . From the description - in fact it is only fair to say
   you also had a word with PC Bruder because you were
   concerned, you wanted to be quite sure that you
   understood his evidence personally, so to speak? - A#-
   Yes, sir.
 . In the light of w ha t you heard ami what we have heard
   now, d a you feel that this lad died, if you like, in
   the,totality sense, I don't meant that his skin w a # w 5
   dead, -Cut- in lay terms at the p oi nt in tine when Mr,:*
   Bruder was:with him? - A. Yes, sir, :I a* q ui te ^%:S>,y
   confident of that.     When one V p e a k s to lay people^who
   have experienced people dying, a word which i
   recurrent in these descriptions of death is t h V way^'.
   that individuals turn grey.     In fact I was very 7
   impressed by the content in *PC Bruder*s statement of '
   the word "grey", recurring several tines.          To me as k
   doctor that implied that that was the point of whole
   body death.     In fact I feel that it was probably
   around that time that Kevin's w ho le body died.        His
   brain had died twenty/twenty five minutes before that
   at the time of the crushing, but his whole body died at
   the time PC Bruder was with him.
Q. Ue have mentioned these twitches and I think sometimes
   they are referred to as spinal reflexes? - A. that is
   correct, sir.
       THE COROWER:       Now, Mr. Fraser, is that reasonably
  clear?
       MR. FRASER:   Even to me, sir, thank you. and I am
  sure it will be clear to the family.
           THE CORONER:   Any questions?
                  Cross-Examined by HR. LIMB:
 . Doctor, it is an emotive       subject. I remember.in your
   evidence about K evin you described death in terms of a
   process rather than as a moment? - A. Yes.
. I would like to ask you a few questions about the
  process following unconsciousness.   As I understand
  it, in the cases of these victims, unconsciousness has
  come ten to twenty seconds after compression of the
  chest? - A. Yes#--.
. That is as a result of oxygen to blood mix leading to
  unconsciousness? - A. Yes.       T here are various...  ffe
  are now not talking about the actual cause of death,
  but mechanisms.      One very profound view that has been
  put forward of c r u s h asphyxia, traumatic asphyxia, it
  is not simply only the reduction of oxygen going to the

The photographs of Xevls Williams appear to show the correct body* They
do not indicate the classic signs of traumatic asphyxia. There is no
swelling of the face although there is some cyanosis. The most prominent
findings that can be seen on the photographs are the injuries over the
undersurface of the chin and left jawline just belov the prominence of
the larynx (Adas's apple). The photographs indicate o ne long abrasion
under the right side of the chin and an abrasion under the left jawline
and two abrasions over the region of the larynx. An additional abrasion
is visible just outside the left eye. There also appears to be deformity
of t he neck in the region of the larynx.
In m y opinion there has been substantial damage to the front of Kr.
Williams neck as the result of compression of the neck possibly caused
by h is neck being crushed under the feet of individuals in the crovd or
caused by his neck being crushed against some rigid object*           The
deformity seen in the photographs and the fractures, found b y Dr* Slater
during his post mortem examination, strongly suggest that damage to the
upper airway was an important contributory factor in the death of Kevin
Williams. Damage to the airway at this level nay lead to obstruction and
swelling of the lining of the larynx which reduces the amount of air that
can reach the deceased's lungs. As I have stated in ay previous report
1 do not believe that this type of injury would lead to unconsciousness
w ithin a few seconds. Whilst death may occur rapdily following such
laryngeal injuries this is not inevitably the case and death may be
delayed for a considerable period. This type of injury is amenable to
treatment in the form of an emergency tracheostomy or a crico­
thyroid© tony. Whilst an emergency tracheostomy is a relatively major
procedure, crico-thyroidotomy is a simpler procedure which involves the
pas sa ge of a tube through the membrane between the thyroid and cricoid
cartilages.    It is possible that if one of these procedures had been
carried out at the scene then he would not have suffered from the fatal
asphyxia which led to his death.
Both cricothyroidotoroy and emergency tracheotomy can be performed in the
field although, in the latter instance, with difficulties owing to an
increased likelihood of haemorrahge at the operation site.
I could find nothing, from the post mortem report or from the
photographs, to refute the realistic possibility that this young man was
still alive after 3.15 pm on the day.   I do accept, hovever, that he is
unlikely to have spoken the word "Mum* if he had already suffered
convulsions due to lack of oxygen, in my opinion, the primary cause of
death in this instance is deunage to his neck which would not have been
inevitably rapidly fatal.

  At 3.28pm according to

  Mr O'Keefe and Mr Hart,

Kevin Williams was still alive.

the medical profession for o nc a actually debated i t f
eight of us.      As a result of that debate the
regulations were hardened.      T h e y had to be carried out
by senior people who were used to doing it and they had
to be repeated.      A satisfactory outcoae froa ay
personal point of view, although I don't know whether
the anguish was worth it really.
As a consequence of that I suppose in the next three
years I had to go through this rather unpleasant
procedure many times.   It was part of ay professional
duty but still to this day I c a n n o t certify soneone
dead without being disturbed by it still.
From this I suppose I have gained a great deal of
experience of brain death and b ra in damage. It seeas
clear to me, sir, in this case that poor Kevin was
probably dead before he was got out of the area in
which he was standing.   I would agree with Dr. Slater.
I would think consciousness was lost probably within
ten seconds.   I would say loss of pain would be almost
instantaneous - not quite, but almost.
I cannot explain the Liverpool P olice Constable's tera
"convulsion becausc to me a convulsion is a major
epileptic attack and he has q uite clearly said he does
not mean that, so I don't know what he does mean.    I
think it would be wrong for me to try and guess vhat he
means.   I think we could accept that he does not mean
any significant movement.
Unfortunately, after people are b rain stea dead, they
can twitch and very unnerving it is too.     This is
really due to a spinal reflex, W h a t we think happens
in anoxia - lack of oxygen - is that the brain stea
dies first.   The cortex, that is the thinking part of
the brain, your walnut, probably goes on quite a bit
longer and the-peripheral nervous system probably quite
a bit long still and I think that is the explanation of
what has been described by the Liverpool officer.
I know the Liverpool officer in h is supplemental
statement when he was discussing the question of a
pulse says he may have been mistaken, but let us
hypothesise that in fact he wasn't and he had felt a

In a sense that is the risk you are taking but Z have no
objection at all to you consulting with ay Officers, keeping
a.watch on the lists, assessing the witnesses as to whether
or not you should be present. We will do whatever we can
by supplying the same information as we have supplied up to
now to you or to your instructing solicitors. X hope that
helps.
      MISS SINCLAIR} Sir, X an very grateful and X would
say again that it is not in the least our wish to delay the
Court by an adjournment and we are planning various Beane
of keeping an eye on what is going on. Thank you.
      THE CORONER; Is there anything you want to say in
the absence of the jury so that you d o n ’t have to wait until
we have finished with the video. If there were I would send
them out and deal with it now?
      MR. MANNINGS   Witnesses for Monday, sir?
      MR. JONES: It is intended P.C. Grunhillf Sergeant Smith?
subject to his fitness to return to duty Inspector Hand-Davis;
Sergeant Thomas and Police Constable Wilson is also warned
as well sir.
      THE CORONERS These are all, I think, mounted Officers
of one sort or another.

      THE CORONERs Right, we are going to watch the

is split in two. We will watch to the end of the first

      TBS CORONER:   Can you just pause there for * ainute?
The Jury have asked whether a particular gate is opened.
They, have given ae a little drawing. In fact it is the gap
in a wall within the concourse area. It is not in this
picture. That was not actually a gate. There was a gate
there but it was a gap in the wall so you could get
through.

     Is there anything that you want to say to me
without the Jury being present, because we could do
this now to save you time?
     MR. PAYNE: I do not mind if the Jury are here. I
would like to just mention the question of exhibits.
You did say earlier that the deadline for the
introduction of further photographs or exhibits vould
be at the adjournment of the Court next Wednesday.
      THE CORONER: I think you misunderstood me, Mr.
Payne. What I meant was the deadline - and even then
I put a caveat in - was for nominations for further
witnesses whom you wished me to consider, not
exhibits, because exhibits we might well want to
introduce as we go along. So there is no deadline on
that because we do not know what we might need. What
I was trying to do was get you to compile, if you have
any additional names, those names so that I can
consider them. I think I did say - I Intended to say
- that even if we have past the deadline, if something
crops up and there is a witness who is considered by
any of you as really vital, then I will look at that,
but I do not want to get dozens of them in January
time.
     MR. PAYNE:   Thank you very much.
     THE CORONER: We will go and have coffee then and
we will be back in quarter-of-an-hour. I think that
seems to be quite a good time. I do not think ve can
do it in much less time really.

 courses in first aid and

 Kevin William's medical
        condition.

vorit. The movement of the head, if thats what it wos, I would say its
best described as a 'twitch'.
I refer to clearing his mouth before resuscitation/ by that I mean to
say I checked that his airway was clear before expressing air into his
mouth. There was a fluid of seme description but I aooept readily that
this could have been spittle or phlegn.
I refer to the man going grey after about 5 minutes and a vary
distinctive smell caning fran his mouth. This was again not vomit but
its true to Bay I can still remember it now as it caused ms to heave
and feel sick myself.
I refer to performing mouth to mouth whilst the St John anfculanceman
did heart compression for about 7 minutes. Whilst this is purely
recollection I believe it to reasonably accurate.
Having changed places with the St Johns Ambulance nan I refer to
feeling what I thought was an unusual rib cage and abdeman.    A
photograph I have been shown at post mortem appears to suggest this.
I refer to unzipping the lads trousers at this point and in my second
statement recollect the striped boxer shorts which I have seen in
photographs (Ref No TT1/31 and TTl/32).
I have been shewn documents which purport to give timings of the
arrival on the pitch of the 1st ambulance (St Johns Asbulance) and the
2nd ambulance (being the 1st SYMAS antoulance). I have considered this
information (referred to as MAP 1 15.15-33 and RJH2 15.17-08) in
comparison with the photographs PR5/A/32 and PR5/A/33 which purport to
show the casualty being carried on a stretcher at 15.32 (1532) and
which I understand would be before I saw and assisted to resuscitate
hiir at the Spion Kop end of the ground. I cannot reconcile the time
sequences and I am still sure that I did see an ambulance, distinguish
in my cwn mind that it was not of St Johns but Health Authority and
  kept alive by artificial means and some of you may
  remember the case in America w h i c h was kept alive for
  thirteen and a half years.
  Some of us were concerned that the guidelines that were
  drawn up were not strict enough a n d that thera was no
  call for them to be repeated a f t e r a passage of tiae.
  Perhaps unwisely we said this and this resulted in a
  BBC "Panorama" programme one night at ten o'elock when
  the medical profession for once actually debated it,
  eight of us.    As a result of that debate the
  regulations were hardened.    They had to be carried out
  by senior people who were used to doing it and they had
  to be repeated.    A satisfactory outcoae froa ay
  personal point of view, although I don't know whether
  the anguish was worth it really.
 As a consequence of that I suppose in the next three
 years 1 had to go through this r ather unpleasant
 procedure many times.   It was part of ay professional
 duty but still to this day I c an no t certify someone
 dead without being disturbed by it still.
 From this I suppose I have gained a great deal of
 experience of brain death and brain damage*   It seeas
 clear to me, sir, in this case that poor Kevin was
 probably dead before he was got out of the area in
 which he was standing.   I would agree with Dr. Slater.
 I would think consciousness was lost probably within
 ten seconds.   I would say loss of pain would be almost
 instantaneous - not quite, but almost.
 I cannot explain the Liverpool Police Constable's term
 "convulsion because to me a convulsion is a major
 epileptic attack and he has quite clearly said he does
 not mean that, so I don't know what he does mean.   I
 think it would be wrong for me to try and guess what he
 means.   I think we could accept that he does not mean
 any significant movement.
 Unfortunately, after people are brain stem dead, they
 can twitch and very unnerving it is too.    This is
 really due to a spinal reflex. What we think happens
 in anoxia - lack of oxygen - is that the brain stem
 dies first.   Tne cortex, that is the thinking part of
 the brain, your walnut, probably goes on quite a bit
 longer and the -peripheral nervous system probably quite
 a bit long still and I think that is the explanation of
 what has been described by the Liverpool officer.
. I know the Liverpool officer in his supplemental
  statement when he was discussing the question of a
  pulse says he may have been mistaken, but let us
  hypothesise that in fact he wasn't and he had felt a

From the description - in fact it is only fair to say
you also had a word with PC Bruder because you were
concerned, you wanted to be quite sure that you
understood his evidence personally, so to speak? - A r
Yes, sir.
In the light of what you heard and what we have heard
now, do, you feel that this lad died, if you like, in.1*'.
the _to£ality sense, I don't meant that his skin was'r," ^
dead,'*Cut-in lay terms at the point in time when Mr* ■* *'
Bruder was with him? - A. Yes, sir,’ I' aa quitei^^'.^X^ '.''
confident of that.    When one'speaks to lay people ;w K o .7^
have experienced people dying, a word which                    '
recurrent in these descriptions o f death is the:WyV'^’; ‘
that individuals turn grey.    In fact I was very
impressed by the content in *PC Bruder's statement of '
the word "grey” , recurring several tines*    To me as a
doctor that implied that that was the point of whole
body death.    In fact I feel that it was probably
around that time that Kevin's w ho le body died*   His
brain had died twenty/twenty five minutes before that
at the tine of the crushing, but his whole body died at
the time PC Bruder was with him.                       *     '

Ue have mentioned these twitches and I think sometimes
they are referred to as spinal reflexes? - A. that is
correct, sir.
     THE CORONER:     Now, Mr. Fraser, is that reasonably
clear?
     MR. FRASER:   Even to me, sir, thank you, and I am
sure it will be clear to the family.
     THE CORONER:     Any questions?
             Cross-Examined by MR. LIMB:
Doctor, it is an emotive subject.   I remember* in your
evidence about Kevin you described death in terms of a
process rather than as a moment? - A. Yes.
I would like to ask you a few questions about the
process following unconsciousness.   As I understand
it, in the cases of these victims, unconsciousness has
come ten to twenty seconds after compression of the
chest? - A. Yes*-. .
                                             *

That is as a result of oxygen to blood six leading to
unconsciousness? - A. Yes.   There are various.•*    We
are now not talking about the actual cause of death,
but mechanisms.   One very profound view that has been
put forward of crush asphyxia, traumatie asphyxia, it
is not sinply only the reduction of oxygen going to the

       standing outside the first entrance end pointing for us

to go into it.        The police officer shouted to us that if we

went to the second entrance then we would be able to get out

via the first entrance.                   paid no and that he wanted us

to go into the first entrance.              We did so.    We were set by

Mr.Hopkins      the     Assistant         Chief   Aabulanc*      Officer.

Mr.Higgins was also there.            Higgins told us to drive up

behind an ambulance which was already parked and alaost at

the same time Hopkins told us to go on to the field.                     At

this   stage    there     were     rows    of   police   with    vans   and
stretchers coning out of the entrance on to the pitch.                   It
was clear that there were dead bodies on at least two of the

stretchers.     Z would say the time was about 1535 hours.



We were stopped by a police officer at the entrance to the

corridor to the pitch.           The officer at the front of the

ambulance said that we could not get through.                   Spectators
were shouting at us about a body on a stretcher.                We stopped

and Hopkins came up to the ambulance and opened the door.                I

said that the police officer said that we could not go

through and he        replied that he wanted us on              the pitch

immediately.        He said that there were casualties at the far

       Police Joint Executive Committee and                           6 November 1989
       Branch Board
 D e a r Member,
        The fourth Executive Committee meeting of the Joint Branch Board
w a s held on Thursday, 26 October 1989, at the "Pickwick" Restaurant,
H i g h Green, Sheffield, commencing at 10.0 a.m.
      The minutes of that meeting are set out hereunder for your
 information and retention.

 1.       ATTEND A N C E
          P. Middup                                               R. Lax
                                                                  M. Young*


          * Denotes non-attendance.

          The S e c r e t a r y informed members that |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ |had been invited
          to attend this m e e ting to talk about uniforms and w o u l d be
          joining us later.                       was suggesting that we look at the
          p o s s i b i l i t y of coming to an agreement where we do not adhere to
          the usual issue but instead to have the issue as and when
          n e c e ssary and for this recommendatio n to be put to the Joint
          Branch Board.

 2.       M I NUTES OF THE LAST MEETING

                    proposed and                 seconded that the minutes
          of the Tast meeting were a true record. This was agreed by the
          members

 3. (A) T R E A S U R E R ' S REPORT

          The T r e a s u r e r reported he had circulated the statement of
          accounts to the members at this meeting for their information.
          He added we were in a favourable position with the bulk of the
          mo n e y on special deposit and only keeping a ยฃ500 float in the
          current account.
          The T r e a s u r e r said he was now going to transfer the Building and
          Equipment fund m o n e y into a special account and he was deciding
                   said that the Regional view was that people were
  w a n t i n g the best - it was not a cost cutting exercise.

  We had a three year uniform contract and we went to Y o r k shire
  Purchasing Organisation where we would go out to tender. A
  m ember of the Police A u t h o r i t y was taken along and they would
  go for the cheap one so try and cut the member out.
  A c c e pting tenders of quite substantial sums.
             said no matter what replacement system we had that
  danger wouId always be there.
  The Chairman said he did not see a ny fight f r o m A.C.P.O. or
  the Superintendents' Association.           ^ r e p l i e d they
  relied on the Federation to do this.
  The Chairman said we were always on the receiving end, the
  powers that be never say, "We won't, so what are you going
  to do about it?"
             said he could not see it going R e g i o n a l l y before
  three or four years because there would be d i f f erent ideas on
  specifications.
  Mr. Middup said the basic idea was good that u n iform be
  issued when genuinely needed, in order to obtain good quality
  garments.
  Mr. Middup stated the J.B.B. may wantj          ~|to attend
  one of Joint Branch Board meetings, so they could hear for
  themselves what he had to say.
                enquired are we looking at o b t aining better
  e q u i pment for the same amount of money.                [replied
  that was b a s i cally it, it was not a cost cutting exercise.

j) H i llsborough Disaster. The Secretary said there were one or
   two things to report on. He added it was down to the immense
   success of the seminar there had been many spin offs. There
   had been in depth discussions with Mr. John Webber and Mr.
   Dick Coyles, Vice Chairman of the J.C.C.
   Mr. Webber had written to Lord Justice Taylor saying that
   evidence did not come out in his Report and that we were not
   able to put our views forward and asked to do this. That
   letter had been sent and we were now awaiting the outcome.

   Mr. Middup said, hopefully, the debate will come up in time
   for the special meeting on the 13 November. At the moment
   the guests who attended the seminar will be a t t e nding as
   planned.
   We are aware of what our lawyers have done where West
   M i d lands are concerned. We had written confirmation that
   when anyone is to be seen by West Midlands they will contact
                                                                  9.

  our solicitor, Mr. Nick Holroyd. If of a criminal nature, a
  solicitor would be present, if a discipline matter a "friend'
  can be present. However, if an officer is served a
  Regulation 7 N o t ice, it must f i r st be checked with the
  Welfare Officer, |                      to see if the officer has
  been c ounselled and is in a reasonable state of mind to
  receive this Notice. If it is felt he may be able to accept
  it m e n t a l l y but may be upset if a complete stranger gave the
  Notice then one of our own officers would be briefed and give
  it to the officer instead.
   The S e c r etary said the achievement was colossal with the
   involvement with the lawyers and the Police Federation
   nationally.
  Mr. M iddup read the letter he had written to the Chief
  Constable, which he had been requested to do by the members.
  This letter was giving our views on the Hillsborough tragedy
  about our recomendation s that the football authorities not be
  asked to pay for the policing also for us to present Lord
  Justice Taylor with the evidence which was o riginally omitted
  in o f f i c e r s 1 statements. A reply was awaited to this letter
  from the Chief Constable.
   Mr.Mi d d u p said he had also received a letter from our
   solicitors Russell Jones and Walker asking to be
   independently represented at the Inquest and attached to this
   was a copy of a letter from the Coroner, which said the
   Coroner would like to defer confirmation of this matter.

   Mr. M iddup reported we were now starting to receive the
   completed Civil Claim forms from the officers involved at
   Hillsborough, who were wanting to sue the Health and Safety
   Executive and/or the football club. He added that 200 forms
   went out to the officers who were counselled, together with
   a letter from him through the Welfare Office, in order to
   retain confidentiality. The letter asked the recipient to
   contact other officers involved who were not counselled, as
   these members were obviously unknown to us and we were
   receiving quite a number of these as well.
   Mr. M i ddup said that both Discipline and Civil Claims were
   going direct t o l             I, through the I n s p e c t o r s 1
   Central Committee, who is sending them to each separate
   Central Committee and then onto the solicitors.

L) Sheffield Marathon. The Secretary reported he was asked to
   get the date re-arranged for this event as it always fell on
   the same o f f i c e r s 1 weekends off. He said this had been done
   and the marathon would be held on the 1 July, which would be
   two weeks later than normal.

M) Fixed Furniture in Interview Rooms. |          (asked for this
   subject to be removed as a separate item on the agenda in
   future but for it to be discussed at J.N.C.C. Therefore,

number,      doing a very brisk              search which hardly bore any                     relevance as

they were         not thoro u g h at all.             It was all        pointless anyway            because

an y alcohol        on the    coach had been hidden                   prior    to them getting            on,

everyone        knew the     procedure,        and had taken steps accordingly.

bite     to eat.       I saw numerous          people      carrying                r packs    of alcohol

but the queues were             just about          non-existent.             I saw only a handful                  of

indicating         passage    to the stands.             I went        there       last year an y w a y so

knew where         to go.     I had no trouble             passij             mg    the    tunnel    and       can

only     recall Police        being        present     near    to              nneJKat       the    other       end,

I went     straight       to my viewing            point with                  the same       place as          I

s tood    last year       just about,         and the      pen must       have only been about

twenty     five     percent     full.        Nothing     in particular              happe n e d until          about

             At about         half    past two          (1430 hrs)       and onwards              I had noticed a man,

             a bout 30 years           of age who was standing about a yard or so                                    in front         of

             me and slightly to my                  left.        On his shoulyders^was sat a young                            lad,

             age d about        ten to f o u r t e e n years,            w e a p r n o ^ i Liverpool        scarf an d hat

             and    I think he had a L i v erpool                     shir/C   y /K .     I saw his     face and he was

             beaming,         I think he had b l o ndish hair.



             I recall         at about       ten to three             (1450 hrs)          it got     really     crushed as            I

             think more and more                  people       came    in from the           rear.     There were             people

             shouting         that they needed more                   room because           people were        coming         into

             the    pen from the            rear,       and    I knew then that              it was getting           serious

             because        I c o u l d n ’t move my body or arms anywhere,                           all    I could move was

             my h e a d .



                  never     saw the young           lad that          I had seen earilier              go down but             the

             next      thing    t    tje c a m e aware        of was looking to my left and there on the
eji                                                                        f
             floor      was    the same          lad,    lying    on his back p r y y t d e with his head to one

fe'fi-C.tD   side.        He must      have      been dead at that               stp.jg'e             oas m o t i o n l e s s a nd I

ffG   S a    w ou ld    have a ss u m e d have           been t r a mpled on.               The    next thing        I was aware

             of was       being      pushed forw a r d again,              once more          in the     crush of the

             crowd,       towards      the front.              All aro u n d me          people were shouting                 and

             s c reaming       obv i o u s l y    in panic and hysteria.                     It was    pa n d e m o n i u m    in

             there.



             At    the front         I could see          people on the fence and trying                        to    climb the

             fence.        There were Pol i c e               on the fence,             on the other        side and          I recall

             them shouting            for    people       to get       back,     either       off the fence           or away

             from the fence.                By this       stage                had d i s a p p e a r e d from my        left and I

             didn't       see him again            until       after    the match.

              I remember at one stage                ending     up about 3 or 4 yards away                     from the

              fence at the front,                but the    crowd m oved back again and                   I ended up

              going wit h them.            After a bout       ten minutes             the   crowd kind of filtered

              backwards and back thro u g h the tunnel                         and    I was able to t u r n round f o r

              the first          time and walk       properly.         People were           lying down        in the

              tunnel      but were alive,           and as     I exited f r ojrj/^the t u n n e l ^            the other

              hour and a half            later Mark        turned up.           At about a quarter              past   six

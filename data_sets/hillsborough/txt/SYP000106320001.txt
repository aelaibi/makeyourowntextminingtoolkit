I am a Detective Constable in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed
at Main Street Police Office, Rotherham.




At 8.30 am on Saturday 15th April 19^9, I commenced duty at Main Street Police
Office, At this time I war. in Full Police uniform and was subsequently transported
to the H i1 1 sborough football ground by coach arriving there approximately
9   .1 5 am that date* I there stayed for the pre match briefing and left the ground
about 10.55am. Being a member of seriel ^fO under the immediate supervision of
Srrfc Cloke and the overall supervision of Detective Inspector MEEK, I. had duties
parking and supervising the unloading of Liverpool supporters coaches on
Halifax Road/Penistone Road North,




On leaving the ground, I walked with Detective Constable DAVIS and other officers
of seriel ^-0 to the top of Halifax Road where, on our arrival at approximately
11.15am, I saw that one coach was already parked at the end of the dual
carriageway. From then on, throughout the morning, coaches arrived in ones and two
They were each parked immediately behind the precedin                  coach and this way we
worked our way back down Halifax Road towards Hillsborough. As loaded coaches arri'
one of our seriel would board the coach, advise the fans as to the ban on large
banners and the talcing of alcohol into the ground and also to which gate they
should enter the ground. It soon became apparent that a large number                   01    coacues

arriving on Halifax Road to park. A number of coaches also arrived bearing
stickers on the windscreen showing that they had been searched                  prior to entering
City limits.




At approximately 3.00pin that date we were instructed by Detective Inspector MEEK
to make our way to Claywheels lane fora meal. We were by this time,                   011   Penistone R<
outside the GATE INN, and the crowds had gone. For about one half hour prior
to this , large crowds had been malting their way towards the ground. Most had
been in good spirits and obvmously in anticipation of having a good time,
although quite a number were carrying cans of beer and larger and had to be remindc
of the ban on alcohol inside the ground.

On entering Claywheels Lane we v/ere joined by other seriels who were also
making their way for a meal. At this time A message was received by
Detective Inspector CHARLES to the effect that all unemployed officers were to
make their way to the Leppings Lane Gate# This we did and on arriving at the
junction of Vere Road and Leppings Lane we were lined up in seriels. At this tiir
I saw that Sgt Cloke was not present, neither was BoI. Meek, but it was stated
that D.I.Meek had gone on ahead to see what the trouble v/as. We were then
sent to the Leppings Lane gate where we v/ere again lined up in serials* A ferw
moments later, we were ordered into the ground, thinking that some sort of crowo
trouble v/as taking place. On entering the ground I saw a crowd of fans 'milling'
about round the entrance to the tunnel leading to the playing area. On entering
crov/d I saw two bodies lying on the ground. They were obviously dead. We formed
a ring and dispursed the crowd from around the bodies and at this time, a
Police Constable emerged from the tunnel and shouted for assistance. I went up
the tunnel   aware that other officers were following me* There were quite a numl
of people in the tunnel, shouting abuse and in an agres-ive demeanour. On
leaving the tunnel I could not see any sign of crowd disturbance but was
directed by 'Fans' tov/ards the front of the crov/d* I forced my v/ay through,
passing a number of people v/ho v/ere obviously distresed, and saw a number of
injured people. I v/as at this time still looking for fighting and crowd
trouble* On nearing the front of the crov/i' I saw what couldonly be described as
a heap of bodies piled up, against the front fence* Some of the people v/ere stil
moving but the majority were obviously dead*    I otart&d to dis entangle the bodi
and as I managed to get one free, I passed it over to other officers and
members of the public to transport towards the rear. All this time I was aware
of the hostility of the fans in the upper tier® Because of the slow progress
of getting the bodies away, I assisted two other officers in ripping away the
perimeter fence. Once this v/as done, v/e were able to convey the dead and injured
onto the jjlaying area. I am not aware how many dead and injured I moved, but
I recall a young man and at least two female victims. I staj^-d there until the
last 'body' v/as moved and then stayed in the compound. At this time, still
fearing that the 'Fans' in the upper tier would overspill into the compound
that I v/as in, I v/as ordered by someone, to form a line#    face t ] & crowd*
This I did. When someone ordered us to link arms and face the crov/d, I had
had enough* I turned my back to the crov/d and leaned on a barrier* We were
later told to filter back onto the playing area, which I did, By this time
the crov/d in the upper tier war. dispursing. I went onto the playing area
and attempted to give assistence where I could. Once the ground v/as emptied
I        alone back tov/ards Oiaywheula Jano.
From entering the ground at approximately 3«05 pm until leaving at about
5.30 pm. I was not aware of the identities of the officers I v/as working with.
I had no radio contact and did not see a supervisory officer until I went
onto the playing area where I saw D.S. TISSINGTON. I wan also aware of D.C. COO
and D.C. DAY.

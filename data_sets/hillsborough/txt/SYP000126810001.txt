TICKET HOLDER,LIVERPOOL FC. I WAS WITH MY IS YR OLD SON SITTING IN THE FRONT
ROW OF THE STAND OVERLOOKING THE DISASTER, LEVEL WITH THE 18 YARD LINE. AT
1420 HRS I HEARD AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE LOUDSPEAKER ASKING LIVERPOOL
SUPPORTERS TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE LEPPINGS LN STAND.
THEY REPEATED THAT REQUEST AT 1430 HRS. AT 1445 HRS I COULD SEE THERE WAS
S O U T H I N G WRONG & I COULD SEE PEOPLE BEING CRUSHED TOGETHER. I LOOKED FOR A
S T ™ A R D BUT THERE WASN'T ONE NEAR TO ME IN ORDER TO DRAW ATTENTION TO WHAT
WAS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

STATEMENT


My name is                                                    Liverpool

I have witnessed accounts in the media both on television and in newspapers

concerning the Hillsborough Disaster and I am disturbed at the inaccuracy

of many of these accounts and descriptions of what has happened#     I there­

fore wish to make the following statement;

I attended the Semi-Filial Match on the day in question and went through the

turnstile at the Leppings Lane end to enter that part of the standing

ground enclosure*   I approached the Hillsborough Stadium at 2.45 p.m. I had

a ticket with me and I was assured of entry to the ground but the street

and immediate areas around the turnstile was absolutely crowded.     I looked

at the crowd and did not want to have to push my way through them#


A policeman on horseback was shouting to the crowd that he was trying to

obtain a delayed start to the Match#   This was at about 2.50 p.m.    He was

trying to calm the supporters down#    He was pleading with them to take their

time#   In my view there was a lack of communication between what this

policeman was trying to achieve and the persons having actual control of the

game situation itself#   If he could have assured the fans that the kick-off

time had been altered this would surely have relieved the tension and anxiety

of the Liverpool Supporters as kick-off time approached#     There was in my

view ample time to get this message relayed provided that the policeman had

a means of communicating his concern to those responsible#     To my knowledget

in the past this has been a regular occurrence if the police deemed a

later start was necessary in the interest of crowd safety#



Due to the fact that two to three thousand people were still outside the

ground and in view of the message this policeman was trying to relay,I could

see no possibility of obtaining entrance to the ground myself without
pushing or shoving my way in*         I walked away from the Stadium for

approximately       50   yards to obtain use of a telephone to make a personal

call home.        After that call I walked back to the Stadium and the

congestion had all disappeared#         I casually showed my ticket to a

policeman who directed me to a turnstile which was appropriate to

my ticket#        It was now approximately 3*03   P«m .   I went through this

turnstile and handed my ticket in and walked over a concrete forecourt

to gain access to the terracing through the tunnel access in the centre

of the terracing#          The media reported that there were several people

injured and even fatal injuries occurred in this particular tunnel#

In my view there were no injuries or fatalities in that centre tunnel

area at all at that time 3*0^ P»m#          It was completely clear#      Immediately

as I viewed the football pitch inside the Stadium the referee stopped play

and suspended the game#


Within a short period I returned back down the centre tunnel to visit

the toilets which were located out on the forecourt itself#              I saw people

being dragged from the terracing along the centre tunnel and being laid

out on the forecourt area adjacent to the tunnel#            This lasted a few

minutes#     Police, St. John's Ambulance personnel and fans were attending

to people who were in need of medical care and attention#              These facts

are contrary to what I have read or seen in the           reports   from the media which

suggest that fatalities or injuries were caused by the rush to and through

the tunnel#        Because people were carried out back through the tunnel the

impression was probably given that this was the area were the injuries were

sustained, i.e. in the forecourt and the tunnel#            The entrance to the tunnel

was pinpointed as one of the principle areas were people were actually

crushed#     This is clearly incorrect*       Nobody in the tunnel itself#when I

entered at    3   *0 ^ p.m.twas injured or appeared in distress in this location#
I stayed around the forecourt and by the time I left at approximately 3*30 p.m.

there were at least 20 people being attended to in the forecourt area*   Many

appeared to be dead*

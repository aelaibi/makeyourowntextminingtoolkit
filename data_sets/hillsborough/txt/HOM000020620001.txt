HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


You may be receiving requests from parties to litigation to have
sight of the scale drawings you prepared at the request of the
Health and Safety Executive for Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.

I thought I should let you know that, after discussion with Dr
Nicholson at HSE, Lord Justice Taylor is content for parties to
the litigation to have sight of these drawings. This facility is
made available on the basis that copyright and ownership of the
drawings is retained by the Inquiry, and any costs are met by the
party seeking copies of the drawings.

I attach a copy of a letter of 18 September from Hammond Suddards
to the Treasury Solicitor which sets out the details of the five
parties to the litigation.

So far as the Inquiry is concerned, I am content for you to let
these parties have copies of the drawings you prepared for Lord
Justice Taylor, subject to your own negotiations over the
conditions. Perhaps you would be kind enough to let me and Dr
Nicholson at the HSE know if any requests are made.

Dear Sirs

HILLSBOROUGH : ADLINGTON V DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for providing us with copies of letters of 27 July and 4 August to Mr Keva
Coombes. Whilst in some respect we can see the point raised to which the letter is
an answer in many other respects that is much more difficult. Would you be good
enough to provide us with a copy of the letter of 31 July from Keva Coombes to
which yours of 4 August is a reply.

With regard to your own letter of 27 July, we doubt very much whether we have any
material that is not already in your possession. This firm of course represented Mr
Murray at the inquest and that hearing provided some documentation that had been
before the Taylor enquiry but by no means all of it. We were not involved in the
Judicial Review hearing nor in the scrutiny save to be on notice that Mr Murray might
have required representation by us in that regard which in fact did not materialise.

Yours faithfully




R B Manning

           PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL
           Dear Mr Sharp
           RE : COMPLAINTS AGAINST MR PETER WRIGHT, CHIEF CONSTABLE OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE
                BY MR TREVOR HICKS, MR PHILIP HAMMOND AND MR D W DEVONSIDE
           Enclosed are letters from Mr Trevor Hicks, Mr Philip Hammond and Mr D W
           Devonside dated 7 and 8 February and 3 March respectively in which they complain
           about the conduct of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Mr Peter Wright
           arising out of newspaper articles based upon interviews given by the Chief
           Constable.
           Originally the Police Authority appointed the Chief Constable of West Midlands
           to carry out an investigation but as Mr Hadfield, the successor to Mr Dear, is
           inappropriate to continue with the investigation, the Police Authority at a
           meeting today, appointed you as investigating officer. The investigation is to
           be supervised by the Police Complaints Authority and Captain Noel Taylor has
           confirmed the approval of your appointment.
           Will you please confirm that you will accept the appointment.
           Yogys sincerely

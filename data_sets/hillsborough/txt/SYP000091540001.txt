               I a t te n d e d the FA Cup M atch between N o t t i n g h a m Forest FC and Liverpool

              FC at H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium,          as a spectator,         wjjAh my two sons.              We were

               sitting    on the front          row of the block             reserved for N o t t i n g h a m

               supporters,       at    pitch    level,        some 30 metres         ( a p p r o x i m a t e l y ) from the

               corner flag w hich was a dj acent                 to the terracing where                 the tragedies

               s u bs e q u e n t l y occurred.

               I noted     people     spilling       onto      the   pitch behind the goal,                 several

               m inutes after         the start of the game.                 After    the game was           stopped and

               P ol ic e were    posi ti oned      in front of the terracing,                     it was     not a pp arent

               to me that       s pe ct ators had been crushed.         It was possibly ten to

               f if te en m inutes      later that a child was carried onfto the pitch, approx

               10 metres       in front     of me,       by a first aider wh^> S u b s e q u e n t l y a t t e m p t e d

               cardiac and m o u t h - t o - m o u t h    resuscitation.             I promptly         left my seat and
                                                                                                                         P AG E         2

             v gave a ss is t an ce       to the       child    (? 12-13 years       old)    on the      pitch.           I felt

              that he was             clin ic al ly dead,       but    I continued for some time               ? 15

              minutes.          As     far as       I recall,    the    child was    then taken off            by

              stret c h e r .

              I tempor ar il y          returned to my seat,             as   I did not     realise      the extent            of

              other     fatalities.                It soon became obvious          that other      bodies were             being

              brought       onto the          pitch,    and    I returned to the        Bitch,     where       I

              personally a t t e m p e d            to resuscitate       several    cjisualties,        possibly          10-12

              in a l l .      I m o ve d on to a different               body w h/n a first aider              s atisfied

              me that he/she was                   performing    resuscit4j/ion a d e q u a t e l y     on the body            I

              had just        left.

              Gradually         the bodies were           taken off       by stretcher,        some     in ambulances.

              Some were         being given oxygen from cylinders.                      I came across at                 least

              two other doctors who were also a s s i st in g                      in the same way as myself.

              Unfortunately             I believe       that all       of the bodies      that    I attempted             to

              resus ci tate were              dead,    beyond    resuscitation.         I felt      it a pp r o p r i a t e        to

              attempt       resus ci ta ti on on every            casualty who m e r it ed        it.     Nevertheless,

              I recall        that      one man,       urged myself and srther attendants,                    to    continue

                    a ttempt     to     resuscitate       his two d augl/ers who            both a p p e a r e d     to be


              dead‘
              I continued to give a s si st an ce                  in this way until         it a p p e a r e d     to me
    A
         A    that all        of the      casualties          had been st re tc he re d away,

              I returned to my sons,                   in the seated area,          and stayed until               the

              a n n o u n ce m en t    that    the game had been abandoned.

              I imagine that             the       reason for the a pp arent        lack of success            in

              promoting         spontaneous           cardiac a ct i v i t y or respiration,            was    due to too

              1 engthy a delay between                  cessation of these          vital    body functions and

              the    commencement             of    resuscitation.        In some    cases     vomit was e xpressed

              from the m outh of the                  casualties.        I did not diagnose           other        injuries.

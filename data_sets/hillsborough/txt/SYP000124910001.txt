 THE LACK OF ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE GROt^D LED TO THE TROUBLE INSIDE.                          I

 THINK   IT WAS RIGHT TO OPEN THE GATES TO R E L^&V E/1"H E CRUSH OUTS IE BUT AFTER

LINE WAS PUT ACROSS THE CENTRE LINE OF THE PITCH.      THEY MUST HAVE BEEN FIRST

AID TRAINED SO THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELPING.      I DON'T BLAME THE INDIVIDUAL,

 ITC5 THE COMMAND I BLAME.

THERE WAS A LACK OF    INFORMATION PUT OVER AND A LACK OF COMMUNICATION ALL

THROUGH.

054

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THAT THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OTHER r

LARGER END AND ALSO SHOULD HAVE HAD A LARGER ALLOCATION OF TICKETS.            I D O N 'T

 THINK IT REALLY HOLDS WATER ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL FOR THE FANS

BECAUSE MOST OF THE FANS FROM THE NORTH TRAVEL DOWN THE M62 AND Ml WHICH PUT

 DO YOU HAVE ANY COMME        i ON THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THE TWO OCCASIONS

 HAVING ARRIVED AT ABOUT SAME TIME.          I CANNOT SAY IF THAT POLICE PRESENCE W

 I^ E V I D E N C E THIS YEAR THOUGH.

 THE OBSERVATION THAT BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH OUTSIDE,        THE MATCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 MUCH EARLIER TO FACILITATE EVERYONES ENTRY. THE FAILURE TO ORGANISE PROPER

 QUEUES WAS A FACTOR WHICH REQUIRED THE OPENING OF THESE GATES TO EASE THE

 CAUSED IT? (BRIEFLY)

 NO - I JUST SAW THE TREMENDOUS CRUSH, AND I WAS SHOCKED THAT THE FRONT GATE

 ONTO THE PITCH HAD NOT BEEN OPENED AND PEOPLE FILTERED THROUGH TO THE LESS

 F^lL PARTS.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VEIWS OF OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,         AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WERE NO LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCMENT INFORMING SUPPORTERS OF THE SITUATION OR

 DIRECTING THEIR MOVEMENTS.                       O C T                           C O M l ^ (

 POLICE OFFICERS WERE TRYING J      PGT'T
                                        H R OW   FANS BACK     INTO THE PENS FROM THE PITCH;

 AND PUSHING THEM OFF            FENCE

 IT APPEARED THAT -THE POLICE WERE DEALING WITH THE SITUATION AS A PUBLIC ORDER

 MATTER . THEY W E R E T l N E D 4 DEEP ACROSS THE HALF-WAY LINE AND COULD HAVE BEEN

 BETTER UTILISED HELPING THE CRUSHED PEOPLE.             IF A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT HAD

 BEEN MADE TELLING SUPPORTERS OF THE CRUSH THEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO NEED

 FOR THE POLICE TO DIVIDE END.

 VERY FEW POLICE WERE USED CARRYING STRETCHERS.                IT WAS MAINLY THE SUPPORTERS.

 I SAW A FEW OFFICERS AND FANS CARRY THE INJURED THE LENGTH OF THE PITCH

 THROUGH THE CORDON (POLICE). THEY HAD TO FIGHT THROUGH THE LINE?                THE OTHER

 ONCERS     JUST STOOO T H E R E .

 A LINE OF OFFICERS MARCHED OUT ONTO THE PITCH TO SORT OUT THE SUPPOSED PUBLIC

 ORDER SITUATION.     THEY D I D N ’T RETREAT UNTIL THEY WERE BOO'D BY THE NORTH STAND

 SUPPORTERS.                                  O r r                          O D H f - f

 THERE WERE A FEW EXCEPTIONS,         SOME OFFICERS TRIED SO HARD TO HELP THE

 SUPPORTERS,    BUT UNFORTUNATELY,       THEY WERE GREATLY OUTNUMBERED BY THE ONES DOING

 NOTHING. SO MUCH MORE COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO HELP                IF THE SUPERVISION OF THE

 POLICE HAD BEEN BETTER AND THEY HAD BEEN UTILISED IN A LIFE-SAVING SITUATION

 INSTEAD OF THINKING IT WAS A NORMAL HOOLIGAN PITCH INVASION.


Q-

 054

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO           ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE POLICE WAS THAT THEY ANTICIPATED AGGRESSION,                THEREFORE

 THEY APPEARED TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND SULLEN IN THEIR ATTITUDE.                THERE APPEARED TO

 BE NO ONE IN CONTROL,       BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE INCIDENT.          FOR EXAMPLE, FANS

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE CENTRE PENS TO OUTSIDE PENS PRIOR TO THE

 START OF THE MATCH. ALSO AFTER THE           INCIDENT AMBULANCES HAD TO DRIVE      OVER

 HOARDINGS.    A SENIOR OFFICER SHOULD        HAVE GIVEN THE ORDER TO REMOVE THE
                                                                           QSi_3Q8
        *


 HOARDINGS SO THAT THE AMBULANCE COULD HAVE REACHED THE INJURED SOONER.

 NO ONE SEEMED TO BE IN CONTROL AT ALL.   IT WAS CHAOS. NO ONE KNEW WHAT THEY

 WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING, AND THEREFORE STANDING AROUND DOING NOTHING.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D „

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE MOST BIZARRE INCIDENT AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED WAS THE FORMING OF TWO

 POLICE CORDONS ON THE PITCH,     ONE ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE UNFENCED

 NORTH STAND., THE OTHER ACROSS THE PITCH IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE TWO CORDONS

 FORMED A *T * SHAPE,   THE PEOPLE IN THE NORTH STAND WERE INCENSED BY THIS,

 I MYSELF WAS EXTREMELY ANNOYED AS THE ACTION IMPLIED THAT WE WERE ABOUT TO

 S^RT   A RIOT.   FEELINGS WERE RUNNING VERY HIGH IN THE NORTH STAND,



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE TRAGEDY WAS CAUSED BY PEOPLE ANlN&OT THE POLICE,         WITH FIFTEEN MINUTES

 KICK-OFF PEOPLE WERE DESPERATE TO GET IN\['0 THE_ GROUND.         THIS WAS WHAT
                                                                                COM
 CAUSED THE PROBLEM.    H O W E V E R , THERE WAS A LACK OF \POLICE CROWD CONTROL

 OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND ALTHOUGH THIS CONTROL IS\OFjT'EN RESENTED BY FANS,

 IT GOES TO SHOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN IF POLICE DO NOT CONTROL A CROWD.            I WAS

 S ^ P R I S E D AT THE APPARENT LACK OF STEWARDS IN THE GROUND.

 NO.

 <353

 DO YOU HAVE ANY ViEWs OR OBSERVAi IONS ON THE. WAY 1 HE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCK.WAS STOPPED?

 I THINK THAT THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TOS. OUTLYING POLICE & THE GROUND POLICE

 ^^|U I LA iE ARRIVALS MUST HAVE BEEN POOR.

 THE POLICE INSIDE THE GROUND WERE TOO SLOW IN R ^ C T I N G TO THE PROBLEM AND

 L A S 1NG 11 BY OPEN ING   !Ht h ENCE GA fE S . i ALSO SAW   i^AJ_>^JHtN THE I" i.R S i f"A N S C A M t

 OVER THE FENCE       IHtY WERE BEING THROWN BACK    IN THROUGH      iHt GASES.

 I THINK ALSO THAT THERE WAS A SLOWNESS IN CONTACTING THE AMBULANCE SERVICE AND

 GE i1 iNG   iHEM   i0 THE GROUND,   AND THERE SEEMED   f0 BE A LACK OF        IS 1 AID

 FACILITIES AT THE GROUND.

 THERE FAR TOO MANY POLICEMEN AROUND THE COACHES AND ONLY A HANDFUL AT THE

 TURNSTILES TO MARSHAL THE CROWDS.

 Q 34

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT               YOU WISH TOADD WHICH      YOU   FEEL. IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I C A N ’T UNDERSTAND WHY THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS W E R E N ’T ALLOCATED MORE TICKE

 AND GIVEN THE LARGER END OF THE STADIUM.                  L I V E R P O O L *S AVERAGE GATES ARE

 PROBABLY TWICE AS MANY AS MOST OTHER CLUBS,                   INCLUDING NOTTINGHAM FOREST.

 THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF POLICE CONTROt AT THE LEPPINGS LAME ENTRANCE

 BETWEEN THE PERIMETER GATES AND THE TURNSTILES.       LAST YEAR AT THE SAME GAME

 THERE WERE FAR MORE POLICE EVIDENT AT THIS POINT.       I THINK THAT THE TICKET

 ALLOCATION WAS A MAJOR FACTOR     IN THE DISASTER, TOO MANY FANS NOT ENOUGH

 fjj^CES FOR THEM.     I THINK ALL SEATING GROUNDS WOULD DEFINITELY AVOID CROWD

 CRUSH AND THE FORMING OF GANGS/HOOLIGANISM.

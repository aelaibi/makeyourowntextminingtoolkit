            At 7.45 am on Saturday the 15th April                1989 (15Q489)     I reported for

             duty at Attercliffe Police Station, Sheffield.                  At 8.00 am that day I

            comenced duty and after fajcj.ef instructions I
                                       CdjL
            attended at the Po l i c e Training Schcj, Brightside Lane Sheffield,                        for

            a pre match briefing,

             I was    i nformed at   the   briefing   thaj    rriv^uties for the day^would

             consist    of traffic    duties at G o w j         r e e V Junction wijfefi Carlisle

            Street,     Sheffield.    /At ,9.30       that day I commencsra my duty until 2.40

             pm when I was~pTcked up and conveyed to the Driving school,                       Brightside

            Lane arriving at at about 3.00 pm.

            Before     commencing my meal      the Superintendent        in charge instructed all

             operation support officers were to assemble                in the front of the

            building with our respective vehicles.                 We were then escorted down to
                                                                                   PAGE        2

         Hillsborough football ground arriving at 3.20 pjjyf

         All the officers in my serial        left the varj/fmt as I left the vehicle          I

         was asked by the driver of our v e h i c l ^ t o assist him in reversing his

         vehicle out of the ground and into Penistone Road. Wh^jvT^had done

         this I made my way into the ground and on to tjyy'pitch.           I saw what     I

         thought was an invasion of the pitch at tj>e Lep ing s Lane e n d .        I made

         my way up to the perimeter fencing wfc/re I
                             G>- J C
         assisted other officers to c-i          .njured persons from the ground out

         to the gymnasium.

         It was obvious that we we/e not going to be able to reach the gym due

         to the confusion.     So / e   ended up placing the dead and injured on the

         floor under the Noe/th S t a n d .   After a short w h i 1e I was instructed to

         leave the bodies and return back to the West Stand and assist with

         crowd control whiHh I did u n t i 1 4^%0 pm.

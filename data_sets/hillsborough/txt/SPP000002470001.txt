Dear Chris,

Thank you for your letter 14ft April 1997.

I would prefer if you replied to Mr. Hammond.

As I do not have the transcripts or exhibit list I cannot say whether the list set out in
Mr. Hammond’s letter is complete but I am inclined to think that there are some gaps.
Obviously, to be sure one would have to check through the exhibits and transcripts
but I notice for example that on page 82 of the transcript for 19lh November 1990
( which I do happen to have) I refer to my intention to show three videos on the 20
November. I would expect that they all had an exhibit number. I do not have the
transcript for 20th November so cannot say at this point what was actually shown. The
point is not strictly relevant to Mr. Hammond’s enquiry but I wished to draw it to your
attention in case you felt that it might become an issue at some time. No doubt you
can have a quick look at the transcript if you think it necessary.

With regard to the specific question I would not wish to speak from memory as to
what the Jury took with them into the jury room but from page 52 o f the transcript of
on 26th March (which again I happen to have) I say “Now the nest thing we need to
do is to give you the exhibits. These are the complete set of the exhibits— ” I go
on to say “The other thing we need to do is to show you how to use the video
equipment ” Page 53 contains a note to the effect that the jury were shown how to
operate the video.

I hope the above will help you to answer Mr. Hammond’s question.



Yours sincerely,



S. L. Popper.

Dear Stefan
Hillsborough Inquest
I am enclosing a copy of a letter received from Philip Hammond, father of one of the
deceased and also Secretary of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.
I have spoken to Mr Hammond on a few occasions. He has been trying to work out
whether the jury had sight of some particular video footage. Apparently you had originally
said that they would not have this in the jury room with them but later indicated a change
of heart. However, he is not clear whether the jury actually had the item. Plainly I could
not answer this and I said that if he wrote to me I would pass the letter on to you.
I wonder if I could trouble you to either let me have your comments or reply direct to Mr
Hammond (letting me have a copy for the file).
Best Wishes




C P Dorries

               Dear Dr Popper,

                             X am trying to ascertain the precise extent of the
               video footage shown to the jury, after reading all he transcripts
               the dates I find are as follows,

               Ref C278                                        - shown to the jury on 20th November 1990.

               Ref C539                                        - shown to the jury on 15th March 1991.

               Ref C334                                       & SGBl - shown to the jury on 19th December 1990.

               Ref C411                                       & Mapl - Shown to the jury on 30th January 1991..

              Finally on the 31st December 1991, Day 42 page 109 (F) you stated
              that you was changing your mind on a previous ruling and you
              would probably let the jury take the video/exhibits into their
              room when they came to their deliberation. Did the jury in fact
              take any video footage in with them. If so, please could you let
              me have the information of what video,s they took.


              Your sincerely

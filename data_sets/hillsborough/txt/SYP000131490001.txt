             FOREWORD



This report is submitted in the normal and accepted

complaint format.     However, some explanation is

required to assist the reader in identifying where to

find certain statements and documents.



In the margin of the report it will be seen that

Document numbers, Statement pages, Appendices and on

occasions Lord Justice Taylor’s interim and final

report are referred to as well as to extracts from the

transcripts of his Public Inquiry.



Where a document number or statement is prefixed with a

part number this can be found within the seven volumes

(parts) of evidence submitted to the Director of Public

Prosecutions.



eg:     PART IV            or          PART IV

        Document No 6                  Statement

        Pages 44-52                    Pages 2331-2356



If a document number or statement is not prefixed with

a part number that particular item can be found within

this file.



Where reference is made to a video then each VHS tape

has been given a separate, Part III, document number.

Not only that but within the same Part III is a written

description/schedule of what the video contains.     For

example;
                   Part III (Documents)

                   Document No 115

                   (Video)

                   Pages 757



identifies the VHS tape number as 115 and the schedule

page in the documents where the description can be

found.



A similar system is used to identify photographs which

also feature in Part III.    For example;



                   Part III (Documents)

                   Document No 150

                   Photo No 14



This easily identifies that this photograph can be

found in the Album marked Document Number 150 and

within each album the photographs are numbered

consecutively.



A reference to one of Lord Justice Taylor’s reports

will be shown as follows;

                   Page

                   Paragraph
A reference to a transcript from the Public Inquiry

will be shown as follows;

CHIEF CONSTABLE

CUMBRIA CONSTABULARY
SHARP6 MURRAY     CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING COMPLAINTS



                  R1    On 15 April 1989 a Football Association Cup Semi

                  Final match was played between Liverpool and Nottingham

                  Forest Football Clubs at the neutral Sheffield

                  Wednesday ground at Hillsborough.   It is well

                  documented that shortly after ’kick-off’ the match was

                  abandoned due to crushing in pens 3 and 4 of the

                  Leppings Lane/West Stand terraces, which resulted in

                  the death of 95 Liverpool Supporters and injuries to

                  many others.



                  R2    As a result of the tragedy Mr G J DEAR, QPM,

                  Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police was

                  appointed to investigate the disaster and to collate

                  evidence for H M Coroner and for a Judicial Inquiry

                  which was carried out by Lord Justice TAYLOR.     On 27

                  September 1989 following submission of the TAYLOR

                  Interim Report into the disaster to the Director of

                  Public Prosecutions Mr DEAR agreed to accept additional

                  responsibility for the criminal and disciplinary

                  aspects of the investigation.   On 1 April 1990, with

                  the retirement of Mr DEAR, these responsibilities were

                  transferred to Mr L SHARP, QPM, Chief Constable of

                  Cumbria.



Part IV           R3    Trevor HICKS was the father of Sara Louise HICKS

Statement Pages   (19 years - deceased) and Victoria Jane HICKS (15 years

2331-2356         - deceased) and attended the match with his wife

                  Jennifer HICKS and the two daughters.   Whilst he went
             and stood on the West Terraces forming pens 1 and 2 and

             his wife went to a seat in the North Stand, both girls

             went into pen 3.     Mr HICKS makes a number of

             complaints which relate to the lack of planning,

             control and management of Liverpool supporters both

             prior to and during the match as well as the police

             response to the tragedy.    These complaints are against

             Superintendent Bernard MURRAY and other officers.



             DETAILS OF COMPLAINTS



             R4    Dealing with the complaints by Mr HICKS involving

             Superintendent MURRAY, on 7 June 1989 Mr HICKS sent a

Document 1   letter to the Home Secretary Douglas HURD complaining

Pages 1-2    about another senior officer in the South Yorkshire

             Police.     The complaint was initially allocated to Mr

             Kenneth Philip Douglas COOPER, Assistant Chief

             Constable Northamptonshire Constabulary for

Document 2   investigation by letter dated 25 July 1989, with the

Page 3       Police Complaints Authority being formally requested to

Document 3   supervise the investigation in a further letter the

Page 4       same day.



Document 4   R5   In a letter dated 4 August 1989 Mr SKITT, Deputy

Page 5       Chief Constable, Northamptonshire Constabulary agreed

             to the appointment of Mr COOPER as the Senior

             Investigating Officer on behalf of his Chief

             Constable.     This appointment was ratified in a further
Document 5   letter dated 4 August from Captain TAYLOR of the Police

Page 6       Complaints Authority in which he confirms his

             supervision on behalf of the Authority to Mr HICKS.



             R6    Following his appointment, Mr COOPER saw Mr HICKS

             on 24 August 1989 and he made a formal statement of

             complaint outlining a series of complaints against a

             number of other officers including Superintendent

             MURRAY.



             R7    Subsequent to this interview Mr COOPER received a

Document 6   letter dated 5 September 1989 from Captain TAYLOR

Page 7       informing him that, the enquiry would be dealt with by

             another force.   On 27 September following protracted

             negotiations, responsibility for all criminal and

             disciplinary aspects of the investigation into the

             Hillsborough disaster, were passed to Mr DEAR for

             enquiries by West Midlands Police.



             R8    These complaints raise allegations of both

             criminal and disciplinary offences.   The file on the

             criminal aspect of the investigation is already with

             the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Police

             Complaints authority.   This report deals solely with

             the disciplinary aspects.
DETAILS OF THE INVESTIGATION



R9     The complaints against Superintendent HURRAY

are made solely by Mr HICKS who levels the same

complaints against Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD,

Superintendent MARSHALL and Superintendent

GREENWOOD.    They are:-




1.     NEGLECT OF DUTY



        Failed to prevent a dangerous build up of

        supporters outside of the gates.



        Without good and sufficient cause he

        neglected or omitted to attend to or carry

        out with due promptitude and diligence

        anything which it was his duty as a member of

        a police force to attend to or carry out,

        viz, he failed to control the build up of

        supporters outside Leppings Lane gates on 15

        April 1989.



        Contrary to Police (Discipline) Regulations

        1985 Schedule 1. Regulation 4 (i). Paragraph

        4a.
                  RIO     Mr HICKS can have no personal eyewitness

                  knowledge of what occurred outside Leppings Lane

                  turnstiles other than at about 2 pm when he entered

                  the ground and the scene was calm.    Thus the evidence

                  to consider centres on many of the statements from

                  supporters who actually found themselves in the build

                  up and eventually the crush outside the turnstiles.



                  Rll     Also of particular relevance here is the

                  position of Superintendent MURRAY in the command

                  structure at Hillsborough on the day.     Effectively he

Part VII          was in command of the   Police Control room within the

Appendix C        Hillsborough Stadium.    In interview he explains his

Pages 965-970     understanding of this   role.



Part V            R12     Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD the match

Statement Pages   day Commander elected to police the event from the

2457-2469         same Control Room in the ground but according to Mr

Statement Pages   MURRAY there was no confusion in roles.    However, the

2470-2488         adoption of this style of command must, to an extent,

                  reduce the overall responsibility held by Mr MURRAY

                  because decisions are always likely to be made with

                  the consent of the present Chief Superintendent.

                  That consent may be verbal by direct or by tacit

                  agreement if he makes no comment to a decision made

                  by Mr MURRAY or any other control room officer.
R13    Although by the very nature of his rank

Superintendent MURRAY would accept the responsibility

upon him, the very presence of Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD in the control room must, to an extent,

diminish any responsibility for the events that took

place on 15 April 1989.    Having said that there is a

duty on every police officer to act promptly if the

situation requires it and the presence of a more

senior officer should not hinder or excuse that

requirement.



R14    In consideration of this complaint    some

account will be taken therefore of the role played by

Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and the file in

respect of that officer should be considered

alongside this one.



R15    By 1400 hours it was evident to

Superintendent MURRAY and Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD that far fewer Liverpool supporters had

entered the stadium than Nottingham Forest

supporters.    The Kop and South Stand were filling up

steadily but the North Stand and the West Terraces in

particular were relatively empty.
                         R16       On those West Terraces where Liverpool

                         supporters were gathering in pens 3 and 4, the

                         central pens were filling up but the outer pens were

                         quite empty by comparison.



                         R17       After 1400 hours the build up of Liverpool

                         supporters in Leppings Lane increased to the extent

Part V                   that’at about 1417 hours Superintendent MARSHALL

Statement Paees          radioed the police control inside the ground for the

2527-2547                motorised traffic to be stopped.    The request was

                         granted, although not actually implemented, until

Part V                   about 1430 hours.    The time 1417 is identified from

Document 207             a written log kept by Superintendent MURRAY but the

Pages 1445-1447          time has, in fairness, been questioned by

                         Superintendent MARSHALL.



Part III                 R18       By 1430 hours the video of the turnstiles

Document No 109          area shows how heavily congested the place had

Schedule Pages 740-741   become.    This is in contrast to the same view when

Part III                 the video for 1988 is viewed.

Document 146

Schedule Pages 809-812

                         R19       In 1988 there had been three special trains

                         from Liverpool to Sheffield and the passengers on

                         those trains had been met by police and either bused

                         to the stadium or escorted in crocodile fashion along

                         Leppings Lane to the turnstiles.
                  R20     In 1989 there was only one special train from

                  Liverpool, it arrived by 1400 hours and the 350 or so

Part V            Liverpool supporters who had travelled on it were met

Statement Pages   by police, escorted in crocodile fashion down

2633-2647         Leppings Lane and gained access to the ground easily

2648-2654         and safely by 1420 hours.     The escorting officers

                  were then deployed on other duties in accordance with

                  the Operation Order.     The increasing crowd which

                  followed them came along Leppings Lane unescorted and

                  although police officers mounted and on foot were

                  deployed to keep them on the pavements, the numbers

                  were such that the crowd overspilled onto the roadway

                  hence Superintendent MARSHALL’S request to close the

                  road to traffic.



                  R21    There is an argument which runs to the effect

                  that' traffic flow is one way of keeping crowds

                  confined to a pavement or similar controllable safe

                  space, but in the circumstances prevailing at the

                  time I have no doubt that the request and the

                  decision were correct.



                  R22    But in 1989 the iron perimeter gates outside

                  the Leppings Lane turnstiles were not closed early as

                  they had been in 1988.     Consequently, the previous

                  year’s filtering effect of those gates was not
                     possible in 1989 and the crowd became swiftly a

                     single seething mass of people filling the whole area

                     between the iron perimeter gates and the turnstiles

                     including the area of the South Road near to the

                     outside of Gate C.   This effect can be seen clearly

Part III             from a comparison of the relevant 1988 and 1989 CCTV

Document 143A        videos from camera 1.    This may go some way to

Schedule Page 803a   explain the various arguments which emerged during

                     the Lord Justice Taylor Inquiry, about filtering the

                     crowd in Leppings Lane with barriers or otherwise.

                     The fact is that when the iron gates were eventually

                     closed just before the opening of Gate C at 1452

Part IV              hours, they were broken open by the Liverpool

Statement Pages      supporters in Leppings Lane but it must be remembered

1678-1679            that the forcing of the iron perimeter gates did not

1680-1686            occur until Gate C was opened.   The fans still in

1687-1697            Leppings Lane saw the gate open and made a "bee-line"

Part V               for it knowing that the kick off was imminent and

Document 190         there had been no indication that the start of the

Pages 987-990        game would be delayed.



                     R23     It may be pertinent that for Sheffield

                     Wednesday Football Club league matches, which of

                     course occur almost fortnightly throughout the

                     football season, spectators with tickets for the West

                     Stand, the West Terraces and the South Stand, all use
                  the Leppings Lane entrance.   Those for the South

                  Stand enter the ground through turnstiles 19-22 and

                  23-28 and reach them along the private road at the

                  rear of the South Stand (called South Road).   To

                  achieve this, the iron perimeter gates outside and

                  across the mouth of the Leppings Lane turnstiles, are

                  kept open.   No such considerations are necessary for

                  a FA Cup semi-final.



                  R24 '   Up to the time that Leppings Lane was closed

                  to traffic, although there was a large mass of people

                  outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles, and there were

                  large numbers of Liverpool fans still approaching the

                  turnstiles along Leppings Lane, there was nothing

                  either inside or outside of the ground which was

                  recognised by the Police Control Box staff as a cause

                  for alarm.   It was about this time that

Part V            Superintendent MURRAY advised Chief Superintendent

Statement Pages   DUCKENFIELD that everyone would get into the stadium

2470-2488         by kick-off time, and he rehearsed his policy for

2457-2469         delaying the kick-off.   This specific aspect is

                  considered elsewhere in this report.



                  R25     Between 1430 hours and 1444 hours the crowd

                  in pens 3 and 4 continued to increase to the
                  detriment of pens 1 and 2; and 6 and 7.     The crowd

Part IV           outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles continued to
Statement Pages
1731-1741         grow and spread both along Leppings Lane and over the
1742-1750
1751-1757         River Don bridge faster than the trickle of fans
1758-1763
1805-1808         coming through the turnstiles could disperse it.        The
1809-1816
1817-1820         police officers deployed on foot and on horses were

                  no longer able to carry out their appointed duties
Part V
Statement Pages   because of the crush of the crowd.   The foot officers
2821-2829
2890-2895         at ohe stage were forced to retreat through the
2912-2916
                  turnstiles and then emerge again through Gate C.




                  R26       The mood of the crowd rapidly changed and

                  any attempt to control them was resented.    Officers

                  and horses were attacked and there is some evidence

                  that a significant proportion of the crowd, mostly

Part V            young men, who had been drinking, tried to push their

Statement Pages   wav forward through the crowd.   There were some signs

2843-2848         of panic, mainly at the turnstiles themselves, as

2849-2857         people were pressed against the turnstile walls.        In

                  the crowd young people and women were fainting and

Part V            some fans climbed over the turnstile building and the
Statement Pages
2527-2547         dividing fence.   Only some of this could be seen on
2947-2955
2964-2970         the CCTV monitor in the Police Control Box, but
3043-3048
3184-3190         Superintendent MARSHALL on the spot had gained a
3368-3371
Part II           vantage point on the parapet of the River Don
Statement Pages
1123-1128         bridge.   He radioed to the Police Control Box at 1444

                  hours for reinforcements, for a Tannoy message to be

                  broadcast to urge the crowd to stop pushing, and for
                  this to be reinforced by a police vehicle equipped

                  with a public address system.     Because of police

                  radio failure at about that time only the requests

Part V            for the tannoy and the reinforcements were received

Statement Pages   and acceded to, but Police Constable BUXTON in a

2830-2835         police landrover equipped with a public address

                  system, arrived at the scene by 1446 hours and

                  started to broadcast to the crowd to stop pushing

                  forward towards the turnstiles.     By this time the

                  crowd outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles had grown

                  to some 5,000 strong.     Police Constable

Part V            BUXTON radioed from his police vehicle requesting

Statement Pages   that the kick-off be delayed.     From the Police

3368-3371         Control Box the request was refused.



Part V            R27        The mounted police officers, now reinforced,

Statement Pages   formed a cordon across the mouth of the Leppings Lane

2836-2842         turnstile area, and the iron perimeter gates were

2843-2848         shut.   This reduced the pressure within the iron

2849-2857         perimeter gates which gave a few minutes respite

2858-2863         during which the area outside the turnstiles could be

2864-2867         cleared.    However, times was of the essence and

2868-2873         clearly because of non-ticket holders; tickets with

2874-2878         confusing directions printed thereon; supporters

                  getting stuck in the turnstiles; the turnstiles were

                  not functioning quickly enough to achieve this, so at
Part V            1447 hours Superintendent MARSHALL asked the Police

Statement Pages   Control Box for permission to open the exit gates, an

2527-2547         extraordinary action but one well justified given the

                  circumstances prevailing at that time.



Part V            R28     At 1448 hours while Chief Superintendent

Statement Pages   DUCKENFIELD was considering the request, Gate C was

2457-2469         opened so that police could eject a youth who had

                  climbed into the ground without a ticket.     As the

                  gate' opened some of the fans outside took advantage

                  and about 150 of them forced their way through it

                  into the ground.   The gate was quickly closed with

                  the assistance of a mounted officer who blocked off

Part III          the entrance.   This ’illegal* entry was seen on the

Document 110      CCTV monitors in the Police Control Box where

Schedule Pages    Superintendent MURRAY was in position.

742-747           Superintendent MARSHALL made a second and then a

                  third request for the gates to be opened.     At this

                  point Superintendent MURRAY addressed Chief

                  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, saying words to the

                  effect, "Are we going to open those gates".



                  R29     This perhaps is a good example of

                  Superintendent MURRAY, although the junior officer,

                  making his mark in a situation and a time he felt it

                  necessary.
                  R30       There is little doubt the Police Control Box

                  inside the ground became extremely busy, a fact shown

                  in the abandoning of the written log by

                  Superintendent MURRAY at about 1421 hours.



                  R31       Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD’s approval

                  was for the "gates" to be opened so he was surprised

Part V            very shortly afterwards when Police Sergeant HIGGINS

Statement Pages   radioed for Gate A to be opened.   Approval was given

3043-3048         and Gate A was opened despite protests from the

                  stewards employed at that location.    Gate B was also

                  opened for a short while.



                  R32       Gate C was opened for about five minutes and

                  during that time about 2,000 fans passed through it

                  at no more than a fast walk but the sight of this

                  gateway to the match was too much for the Liverpool

Part IV           fans outside the iron perimeter gates.    They pushed

Statement Pages   towards Gate C . broke through the iron perimeter

1821-1831         gates and joined onto the rear of the fans going

1832-1841         Gate C.     From the video pictures available from

1842-1847         the CCTV camera 1, there was a third group of

Part III          fans who went through Gate C on that occasion - these

Document 110      fans who had been standing about for a considerable

Schedule Pages    time without attempting to enter the ground through

742-747           the turnstiles.
Part V            R33        Of those who entered through Gate C, either

Statement Pages   at 1448 hours, or at 1452 hours, there can be little

3006-3012         doubt that some had tickets for the North and West

3013-3019         Stands, some had tickets for the West Terrace, some

                  had no tickets at all.



                  R34        Some made their way to the wing pens 1 and 2,

Part III          some went through the opening in the dividing wall

Document 110      making their way to the West Stand or to the pens

Schedule Pages    6 and 7.     But from the CCTV pictures from camera 1.

742-747           that the majority of them went straight and unchecked

                  to the tunnel leading to pens 3 and 4.



                  R35        It must be remembered that the Police Control

                  Box had limited views of the Leppings Lane problem.

                  Superintendent MURRAY was reliant to some extent on

                  Superintendent MARSHALL, the man on the ground, to

                  give precise updates.     The CCTV is simply an aide

                  that cannot give the full picture.



                  R36        Further the fact is there are three other

                  sides to the stadium being policed and even if a

                  problem is building up at one end the normal policing

                  problems at the other ends have still to be dealt

                  with and those responsibilities rested to a great
Part VII          extent on the shoulder of Superintendent MURRAY. In

Appendix C        interview this area is explored and he gives

Pages 1014-1017   explanation and reasons for his actions.



                  R37     This particular allegation made by Mr HICKS

                  forms part of the evidence submitted to the Director

                  of Public Prosecutions who is considering criminal

                  offences against Superintendent MURRAY of

                  Manslaughter and Culpable Malfeasance.



                  R38    The evidence required to consider

                  Manslaughter requires a high degree of gross

                  negligence or recklessness and there is no comparable

                  discipline offence to consider.



                  R39    However, the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

                  is an alternative offence to Manslaughter, and

                  although it is based upon the same evidence, it

                  requires a lesser degree of negligence or

                  recklessness and embraces neglect of a duty.



                  R40    Should the Director of Public Prosecutions

                  decide there is insufficient evidence to prove

                  offences of Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance, no

                  further action can be taken in respect of this

                  disciplinary offence of Neglect of Duty.
                  R41     The next complaint made by Mr HICKS is as

                  follows:-



                  2.     NEGLECT OF DUTY



                          Failed to control the movement of supporters

                          subsequent to the opening of Gate C.



                          Without good and sufficient cause he

                          neglected or omitted to attend to or carry

                          out with due promptitude and diligence

                          anything which it was his duty as a member of

                          a police force to attend to or carry out,

                          viz, he failed to control the movement of

                          supporters subsequent to the opening of Gate

                          C at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.



                          Contrary to Police (Discipline) Regulations

                          1985 Schedule 1. Regulation 4 (i). Paragraph

                          4 a.



Part IV           R42    Mr HICKS explains that although he was not a

Statement Pages   witness to the influx of supporters into the stadium,

2331-2356         once Gate C had been opened and once through the

                  turnstiles the only sign visible was above the tunnel

                  which led to pens 3 and 4.   The natural inclination
                  of the crowd would be to make for the tunnel and

                  should have been controlled.



Part V            R43        The decision to open Gate C was made by

Statement Pages   Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and passed to

2457-2469         Superintendent MARSHALL by Superintendent MURRAY

2527-2547         over the police personal radio which was on

2470-2488         "talk-through".     That means all officers in

                  possession of a personal radio, on duty at

                  Hillsborough that day should have heard the message.

                  Of course, the din within the stadium, preoccupation

                  with other matters, and fallibility of personal

                  radios, would all create difficulties in this

                  respect.



                  R44        However, the decision to open the gates was

                  not followed by any direct or indirect orders to deal

                  with the 2,000 or so fans who, for a period of five

Part IV           minutes, entered the ground in this way.     On

Statement Pages   entering the ground there were no stewards or police

1863-1869         officers checking or directing them so the ma iority

1870-1878         of them made for the tunnel leading to pens 3 and 4.

1879-1883         either following those in front, or making for the

1884-1889         only sign clearly visible to them, above the tunnel.

1890-1897         Once inside the ill-fated pens the crowd pressure was

Part II           such that lateral movement through the gates in the

Statement Pages   radial fences into other less crowded pens was not

941-949           possible.
Part VII          R45       In interview Superintendent MURRAY said that

Appendix C        even the earlier opening of Gate C when several

Page 1030-1035    hundred supporters got in did not alert him to

                  consider how to cope with a deliberate opening of the

                  gate'.



                  R46      Additionally nothing that was happening made

                  him consider providing more police officers or

                  stewards to receive the supporters albeit the time

Part VII          span may not have made this a feasible option in any

Appendix C        event. Superintendent MURRAY savs that there was

Pages 1030-1035   nothing that was said to him or gave an indication to

                  him to direct the supporters in one direction.     Not

                  only that but in terms of a reception to meet the

                  influx of supporters which has just been referred, to

                  the confusion of the situation is evident more so

Part VII          when it is seen that the action to open the gates

Appendix C        was directed not to specific police officers but in

Pages 1043 1044   general.



                  R47      This was a life and death situation in the

Part VII          mind of Superintendent MURRAY and according to his

Appendix C        explanation he thought they would be absorbed into

Page 1049         the "concourse" area, "the stands” and all over the

                  place".
                         R48     Superintendent MURRAY did not give thought

Part III                 to the capacity on the terraces except confirming

Document 128             that there was space and that space is evident in

Schedule Pages 774-775   the video available, as well as on some

Document 162             photographs.

Photo 28-29

                         R49    Although he has not answered questions to

                         this investigation, Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                         told the Public Inquiry that he did not give

                         consideration to blocking the tunnel to pens 3 and 4.



                         R50    Superintendent MURRAY has said he had no

                         knowledge that this action was taken in 1988.

Part II                  Although some supporters have said this happened

Statement Pages          arid one retired police officer confirms it. the

1128 - A-B               issue is in doubt and in any event was not featured

                         at any de-briefings after the 1988 match.



                         R51    It should also be remembered that the policy

                         of South Yorkshire Police was that crowd monitoring

                         and packing were the responsibility of Sheffield

                         Wednesday Football Club and it seems that may be one

                         reason why Superintendent MURRAY did not consider the

                         possibility of overcrowding or crowd distribution at

                         the crucial time.   Another was the South Yorkshire

                         Police general view that the crowd could be left to

                         "find its own level".
•
                 R52       The crux of this complaint is the failure to

                 control the movement of supporters who came through

                 Gate C.    That control should also include the

                 thoughts of the senior officers in the control room

                 as to when to close that gate, and the others for

                 that matter.



                 R53 ■     The question is whether on releasing the

                 crush of people outside the turnstiles thought should

                 have been given to closing the gates earlier than

                 they were closed.    This is even more important when

                 considering the incident of the iron perimeter gate

                 nearest the River Don bursting open.    The fact is

                 that more supporters actually went in through Gate C

                 than perhaps was intended by Chief Superintendent

    Part VII     DUCKENFIELD.    Because he has not answered questions

    Appendix C   we do not know his view.    However, Superintendent

    Page 1059    HURRAY did say that he did not at the time realise

                 the iron perimeter gates were closed and could not

                 recall discussing it.



                 R54       In any event Superintendent MURRAY gave no

                 thought to closing Gate C and presumably neither did

                 Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD so the result was

                 that the flow of supporters through that gate lasted

                 several minutes.
R55      There could be criticism of this failure but

that would have to have gone hand in hand with

recognition of the overcrowding that later happened.

The fact was Superintendent MURRAY and Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD dealt with a situation,

saved life, and no doubt felt relief that they had

succeeded.   Hindsight dictates the thought that they

could have regained control, closed the gates, formed

queues, used the turnstiles again and resorted to

normal entry, but at the time they saw no

reason to do that at such a very late stage with

kick-off approaching.



R56      Clearly the opening of Gate C, and other

gates, was the right decision given the circumstances

prevailing at the time.   It was intended to relieve

the crowd pressure outside the Leppings Lane

turnstiles so as to prevent injury or even death

there.   The opening of Gate C achieved that.



R57      Clearly, no orders or directions were given

for police, or stewards, to control the influx of

supporters through Gate C, and to that extent Mr

HICK’s complaint is correct.
                  R58     It is evident, therefore, that Superintendent

                  MURRAY did fail to control the movement of supporters

                  once Gate C had been opened but the direct

                  responsibility for this action rested with Chief

                  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and within his file this

                  issue is further considered.



Part VII

Appendix C        R59     The interview with Superintendent MURRAY

Pages 1028-1045   explores further his view on this complaint.



                  R60    The evidence required to consider

                  Manslaughter requires a high degree of gross

                  negligence or recklessness and there is no comparable

                  discipline offence to consider.



                  R61    However, the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

                  is an alternative offence to Manslaughter, and

                  although it is based upon the same evidence, it

                  requires a lesser degree of negligence or

                  recklessness and embraces neglect of a duty.



                  R62    Should the Director of Public Prosecutions

                  decide there is insufficient evidence to prove

                  offences of Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance, no

                  further action can be taken in respect of this

                  disciplinary offence of Neglect of Duty.
R63    The final complaint by Mr HICKS against

Superintendent MURRAY iss-



3.     NEGLECT OF DUTY



        He failed to respond to the developing

        tragedy and was slow to effect a rescue

        operation.



       Without good and sufficient cause he

       neglected or omitted to attend to or carry

        out with due promptitude and diligence

        anything which it was his duty as a member of

        a police force to attend to or carry out,

       viz, he failed to respond to the crushing by

        overcrowding of spectators in the pens 3 and

        4 of the Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April

        1989 and was slow to effect a rescue

        operation.



        Contrary to Police (Discipline) Regulations

        1985 Schedule 1. Regulation 4 (i). Paragraph

        4 a.



R64     In this instance Mr HICKS was an eye-witness

but there are a number of discrepancies in his
                  statements.   However, he is also Chairman of the

                  Hillsborough Family Support Group so his complaint

                  goes wider than his own personal experience.



                  R65     The first difficulty with his personal

                  recollection is one of timing.   On the day of the

                  disaster when he was under extreme emotional shock,

Part IV           he saw nothing untoward until the game had been in

Statement Pages   progress for four or five minutes.   At that time he

2331-2333         saw people pushing and shoving in pens 3 and 4, and

                  people being pushed up against the perimeter and

                  radial fences.   One of these people was an old man in

                  a grey suit, and his tongue protruded from his

                  mouth.Mr HICKS shouted to a senior police officer

                  who ran onto the pitch and stopped the game.     There

                  is no criticism of any police officer in that

                  recollection statement.



                  R66      In a detailed prepared statement which was

                  sent to police on or about 18 May 1989 he describes a

Part IV           similar series of incidents but says they occurred "a

Statement Pages   little before kick off (approximately 1450 pm)."

2336-2348         This change of timing is important because it

                  suggests Mr HICKS was witnessing crushing in pens 3

                  and 4 as early as 1450 hours.    Still before kick-off

                  he describes people being hoisted out of pens 3 and 4
                         into the West Stand, and an increasing number of fans

                         climbing over the perimeter and radial fences of pens

                         3 and 4.



                         R67        Having noted that the teams then kicked off

                         he describes a police cordon two to three officers

                         deep placed in an arc around pens 3 and 4 "and it was

                         obvious that their purpose was to prevent anybody

                         climbing over the barrier".



                         R68 ’      While the game was still in progress he

                         believes that several fans were trying to climb the

                         perimeter fence and were pushed back into the pens by

                         police officers.     The officers in the arc, or cordon,

                         were standing watching with their arms folded.



                         R69        This continued for some five to ten minutes

                         and during that period the game was stopped.     He

                         believes incorrectly that the game was stopped at

                         1500 hours.

Part III

Document 128             R70 •      From a study of the photographic and other

Schedule Page 774        evidence it is clear that his estimated timings for

Video Ref 15.05.33       the incidents he recounts are incorrect.

Part III                 Consequently because timing is a crucial factor in

Document 162             this particular complaint, and incorrect timings can

Schedule Pages 841 842   only mislead, it is to the complaints made by Mr

Photo 1.18.28.29
                  HICKS as Chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support

                  Group, that this report will be directed.



                  R71     In the Police Control Box no-one recognised

                  the overcrowding or anything amiss in pens 3 and 4

                  until the first fans spilt out onto the perimeter

Part VII          track just before kick-off.   Superintendent MURRAY in

Appendix C        interview was clear that although he felt the

Pages 1066-1070   monitoring of fans was a joint police and stewards

                  responsibility he did not specifically view that to

                  include overcrowding.   He had no experience of such

                  happening and referred to monitoring really in

                  relation to problems of disorder, supporters fainting

                  and the like.



                  R72     From the Police Control Box the reserve

                  serials on standby in the gymnasium were directed to

                  go to the pitch and a request was made to Police

                  Headquarters for more dog-handlers, again indicative

                  that it was a disorder situation which was perceived.

                  Although Superintendent MURRAY was aware of a problem

                  on tjie track at Leppings Lane it is evident he did

                  not recognise what the problem was.



Part V            R73     Police Constable ILLINGWORTH on the track

Statement Pages   serial at pen 4, prior to the kick-off, had

3324-3328
                           recognised crowd discomfort, had opened the perimeter

                           gate to allow some of the crowd onto the perimeter

                           track and tried to relocate those released into pen

Part III                   5.    That action is visible on a video recording and

Document 109               if it was observed by the Control Box staff, although

Schedule Pages 740-741     it would have alerted them to the fact that something

                           was amiss it would have seemed that it was being

                           dealt with by the officer on the spot.



                           R74      According to Superintendent MURRAY   efforts

                           were made to contact Police Constables SMITH and

                           ILLINGWORTH on the radio but without success.

                           However, Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD sent Chief

                           Inspector McROBBIE from the Police Control Box onto

                           the track to facilitate the relocation of fans from

                           the central to the wing pens.



Part V                     R75      By 1504 hours police officers were hauling
Statement Pages
3383-3386                  fans out of the pens over the perimeter fence and
3387-3391
3392-3400                  this must have been seen by the staff in the Police
3401-3410
3411-3418                  Control Box.



Part III                   R76      By this time an increasing number of police
Document   155
Schedule   Pages 827-828   officers and others were congregating on the pitch
Document   128
Schedule   Page 774        side of the perimeter fence of pens 3 and 4 making it
Document   136
Schedule   Page 791        increasingly difficult for a clear view from the

                           Police Control Box.
Part V            R77    Superintendent GREENWOOD was at the players

Statement Pages   tunnel as the teams kicked off.   Shortly afterwards

22515-2526        he noticed the fans on the track and went to the West

                  Terraces end of the ground to investigate.    It was

                  not until he was close to pens 3 and 4 that he

                  recognised the overcrowding problem.    He climbed on

                  the wall below the perimeter fence and signalled with

                  his hands for the crowd to move back.    This action

                  was seen in the Control Box, but in the absence of

                  information over the personal radio, again the matter

                  was seen as being dealt with by the senior officer on

                  the ground.



Part VII          R78    Superintendent MURRAY saw Superintendent

Appendix C        GREENWOOD signalling and says he recognised that Mr

Page 1088         GREENWOOD was signalling to stop the match.



Part V            R79    At this point Chief Superintendent

Statement Pages   DUCKENFIELD sent Superintendent MURRAY from the

2457-2469         Control Box to stop the match via the linesman in

Part V            accordance with the agreed procedure, but before he

Statement Pages   could do this Superintendent GREENWOOD had run onto

2515-2526         the pitch to the referee and stopped the game.
Part VII           R80      On this brief visit to the pitch it is

Appendix C         evident Superintendent MURRAY did not recognise    what

Pages 1088 •1090   was happening on the terraces.    He quickly returned

                   to the Control Box.



                   R81      Almost at once Chief Superintendent

                   DUCKENFIELD asked him to return to the pitch to clear

                   the supporters from the goal area.    On the pitch

                   Superintendent MURRAY recognised the problem and saw

                   supporters jammed against the perimeter fencing.     He

                   at once found a police officer with a radio, spoke to

                   Sergeant GODDARD and requested a fleet of ambulances,

                   for tannoy messages to tell people to move back and

                   he believes at some stage he asked for bolt croppers.



                   R82      Superintendent MURRAY saw that Superintendent

                   GREENWOOD was on the scene and that other police

                   officers were in abundance at the perimeter gates.

                   He made the decision therefore to go to the back of

                   the tunnel leading to the rear of the central pens 3

                   and 4.    He saw number of police officers in

Part VII           the pens and eventually went back to the pitch

Appendix C         area.    At this time Superintendent MURRAY

Pages 1098- 1105   states how he went around the stadium identifying

                   senior officers to act as contact points for Chief

                   Superintendent DUCKENFIELD
                  R83     Shortly after this he went back to the

                  control box arriving at about 1535 hours at which

                  time Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and Mr JACKSON

                  went to the board room.



                  R84     With regard to this complaint it is clear

                  that Superintendent MURRAY made every effort to deal

                  with the situation at the first recognition by him of

                  its seriousness.



Part V            R85     The awful truth of the dying, dead and

Statement Pages   injured was recognised at various times by individual

3315-3323         officers in different locations.     Even those police

3324-3328         police officers closest to the front of pens 3 and 4

3329-3336         of the Western Terraces did not immediately recognise

3337-3340         the problem.   Even when they did recognise a problem,

                  they thought it could be resolved by a relocation of

                  fans from one pen to another.

Part IV

Statement Pages   R86     The lack of instructions as to overcrowding

1916-1923         and a formidable deterrent to opening perimeter gates

1924-1929         inevitably led to slow recognition by police of

2145-2147         crushing in the pens.     Certainly there can be no

2148-2151         doubt that the seriousness of the overcrowding in

2311-2313         pens 3 and 4 between 1450 hours and 1459 hours was

2314-2316         not recognised and therefore was not effectively

2320-2322         remedied.
                  R87     It should not be too surprising therefore,

                  that the staff in the Police Control Box were the

                  last to know.



                  R88    However, the delay in police recognition of

                  the problem was not as great as some witnesses

Part V             believe.   Although the immediate assumption in the
Statement Pages
2566-2577         Police Control Box was that a pitch invasion was
2578-2588
2589-2596         starting, and that assumption persisted until the

Statement Pages   request for ambulances was received at about 1507,
2554-2565
3315-3323         action was being taken at pens 3 and 4.    Before 1500
3324-3328
3329-3336         hours fans were being relocated from pens 3 and 4.
3337-3340
                  From 1500 hours gates 3 and 4 were open and remained

                  so.



Part IV
Statement Pages   R89    At some point the barrier in pen 3 broke and
1965-1971
1972-1975         then many supporters became trapped and crushed in
1976-1981
1982-1984         the well of the terrace towards the right corner near
1985-1992
1993-2000         to the radial fence dividing pens 2 and 3.
2001-2003


                  R90     Police officers, supporters and others tried

                  frantically to remove the dead and injured through

                  the small perimeter gates which became blocked by the

                  mass of bodies.    In the confines of the disaster site

                  it is not surprising that there were many officers,

                  willing and able, who could do nothing other than

                  stand and watch.   That at least some of these
                  officers were effectively directed is clear.      It is

                  also not surprising that hostility and aggression

                  mounted in some of the fans to such an extent that

                  positive action had to be taken by police officers.



Part V            R91      The morbid press photographers had to be

Statement Pages   Police Constable SMITH radioed from the pitch to the

3315-3323         Police Control Box for bolt croppers to cut the

Part V            perimeter fence.   Although he did not know it,

Statement Pages   Police Sergeant GODDARD had received his request and

2566-2577         tried to locate the necessary equipment at a nearby

                  police garage without success.   It was not until

Part V            1513 hours that Police Constable BICHARD, in the

Statement Pages   Control Box, requested Police Headquarters Control

2578-2588         Room to call the Fire Brigade to bring hydraulic

                  cutting equipment to the Leppings Lane entrance.
                      R93     Fire appliances with the necessary equipment

Part VI               arrived at the stadium at 1522 hours.   Station

Statement Pages       Officer FLETCHER rushed the equipment to the front

3664-3670             of the West Terraces but by then the last of the dead

                      and injured were being removed from pens 3 and 4.



Lord Justice Taylor   R94    Clearly the Fire Brigade could have been

Interim Report        called earlier but it is extremely doubtful that

Paragraph 301         would have saved more lives.



Part VI               R95     On the day two South Yorkshire Metropolitan

Statement Pages       Ambulance Service Officers were on the ground with

3529-3540             one ambulance, and another ambulance on standby.

3541-3551             As soon as the ambulance officers noticed the fans

3552-3559             on the track, and while the game was still in

                      progress, they went to them and began to render

                      assistance to the injured.



Part V                R96    Chief Inspector EDMUNDSON in Police

Statement Pages       Headquarters Control Room, had been monitoring the

2600-2605             police radio traffic at Hillsborough and both he

Statement Pages       and Police Constable WAUGH heard sufficient for

2608-2610             them to make enquiry of the Police Control Box at

                      1459 hours as to whether ambulances were required.

                      The response at that time was in the negative but

                      "standby".   It was not until 1507 hours that the
Ground Control notified the Headquarters Control Room

that injuries were possible, and the call went to

SYMAS that ambulances might be required.     This was

confirmed into a positive request during the same

telephone conversation.    The first ambulance arrived

at the stadium at 1513 hours and in all, 42

ambulances arrived.



R97     It is correct to say that the distress of

those in the front of pens 3 and 4 was recognised by

those officers closest to them at about 1500 hours.

It is also correct that the Major Incident Plan was

not implemented until 1507 hours when the ambulance

service was called.    It is also correct that for

various reasons no cutting gear was located until the

request was made to the fire brigade at 1513 hours.

But there is no evidence to show that if these

shortcomings had not occurred then lives would have

been saved.    Given the poor radio   transmissions and

reception and the chaos of the moment from the

vantage point of the Control Box it is difficult to

see how these complaints can be substantiated.       Once

the real problem was identified in the Control Box

the Major Incident Plan was implemented effectively

and swiftly.    The fact that the injured were safely

cleared by 1545 hours, the dead were being dealt with
in the gymnasium under the supervision of HM Coroner

by 1615 hours, and that all dead had been identified

by 0430 hours on 16 April 1989 is some evidence to

support that view.   That it could have been done

better and perhaps quicker is not the real, issue

that it was done to the best of the officer’s ability

given the information available and the circumstances

prevailing at the time, is.



R98     This particular allegation made by Mr HICKS

forms part of the evidence submitted to the Director

of Public Prosecutions who is considering criminal

offences against Superintendent MURRAY of

Manslaughter and Culpable Malfeasance.



R99     The evidence required to consider

Manslaughter requires a high degree of gross

negligence or recklessness and there is no comparable

discipline offence to consider.



R100    However, the offence of Culpable Malfeasance

is an alternative offence to Manslaughter, and

although it is based upon the same evidence, it

requires a lesser degree of negligence or

recklessness and embraces neglect of a duty.
                 R101    Should the Director of Public Prosecutions

                 decide there is insufficient evidence to prove

                 offences of Manslaughter or Culpable Malfeasance, no

                 further action can be taken in respect of this

                 disciplinary offence of Neglect of Duty.



Part VII         R102    Superintendent MURRAY was interviewed

Appendix C       at Furnival House, Sheffield on 25 June 1990.     He

Pages 916-1128   agreed that the question and answers given for the

                 criminal investigation, be used for the discipline

                 inquiry.

M J Foster

Detective Chief Superintendent
CONCLUSION



R108    Superintendent MURRAY is the Sub-Divisional

Commander of the FI Sub-Division which includes

within its boundary, Hillsborough Stadium.   At the

time of the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989 he

had held that post for just over one year.   During

that time he has regularly performed duty there in

the Police Control Box, including the occasion of the

1988' FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool FC and

Nottingham Forest FC.   He has considerable experience

of policing football matches elsewhere during his 24

years police service.   He was involved in the police

planning for the 1989 event and was party to the

decision to base it on the successful previous year’s

semi-final.   Because of his experience in 1988 he

believed there were a number of areas where police

arrangements could be improved, including a reduction

in manpower overall with reinforcements deployed in

areas where problems were likely to arise.   There was

to be no reduction in the manpower to be deployed at

the Leppings Lane turnstiles, additional manpower at

Leppings Lane where it joined Penistone Road, and by

extra resources on the perimeter track at the end of

the game to prevent a repetition of the pitch

invasion experienced in 1988.   There were a number
of other changes made with the agreement of

Superintendent MURRAY but the only one which requires

ta be mentioned here is the provision for mobile

serials of officers to locate supporters without

tickets and remove them to Hillsborough Park

(Nottingham Forest supporters) and Cole Road

(Liverpool supporters).   From his involvement at the

planning meetings he was aware that Liverpool

supporters were dissatisfied with the allocation of

tickets between the two competing clubs, and with

their allocation to the Leppings Lane terraces and

stand, and the North Stand.   He considered these

points at an early stage with Chief Superintendent

MOLE, who prepared the initial draft Operation Order,

and for good reasons agreed that the arrangements

should not be changed in this respect.



R109    He attended various other planning meetings,

including visits to Hillsborough Stadium, at one of

which he discussed the arrangements with the

Sheffield Wednesday Club Secretary, Mr Graham

MACKRELL, and made a full inspection of the ground.



R110    On the day and before, he was personally

involved in the briefings and there is evidence which

suggests that because of his eye for detail he took
action to deal with matters which had the potential

for later problems, for example, distributing check

lists and the removal of rubble.    He took up his

position in the Police Control Box at about 1030

hours.



Rill     At this point it is pertinent to recall that

the operational commander in previous years had been

Chief Superintendent MOLE, a man with a style of

management and leadership which was different from

Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.    Chief

Superintendent MOLE adopted a roving style of

command, frequently on the ground moving about from

place to place, relying on his personal radio for

contact with the Control Box.   Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD was much more like a Captain on the

bridge of his ship, who remained in the Control Box

throughout relying upon the visual and audio aids for

information and control.   Both styles are quite

acceptable and both have their disadvantages and

advantages, but the effect on Superintendent MURRAY’S

role would be quite significant.    To have the "boss"

at his shoulder would likely lead to much more

referral of matters up to him for decision or

confirmation than where the fallibility of police

personal radios to a certain extent makes that more
difficult if the "boss" is absent.   Additionally, the

"boss" on the spot can only see what you can see,

either by direct line of sight or by CCTV, whereas

the absent "boss" has his own personal viewpoint but

cannot see the CCTV pictures.



R112     At Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD’s

suggestion, Superintendent MURRAY started to keep a

manual log of events to aid any debrief after the

event.



R113     Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD joined him

in the Police Control Box at about 1350 hours and

apart from a period 5 or 10 minutes after the game

had been stopped, when he went to the Boardroom,

Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD remained in the

Police Control Box until some time around 1700 hours.



R114     By 1415 hours Superintendent MURRAY

recognised that the Liverpool fans were not coming

into the stadium as fast as the Nottingham Forest

supporters



R115     At 1417 hours he received the request from

Superintendent MARSHALL for Leppings Lane to be

closed to traffic.   He looked at the CCTV pictures
and although he claims that he did not then identify

any particular problem in Leppings Lane, he made

arrangements for the road to be closed.       When this

had not been achieved by about 1422 hours he made

alternative arrangements and the road was closed,

probably at about 1430 hours.



R116       It is interesting to note that although

Superintendent MURRAY claims that he did not perceive

any particular problem in Leppings Lane at that time,

his manual log terminated at 1421 hours.



R117       At 1430 hours, although he could see the West

Stand and pens 3 and 4 filling, he noticed that there

were "large clear sections" in pens 1 and 2, and 6

and 7.     He saw that there was a "large crowd" outside

the Leppings Lane turnstiles, and he remarked to

Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD that although "there

was a good crowd outside there was still half an hour

to kick-off and we would get them in by three o ’clock

(1500)."     It was at that time that Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD rehearsed with him the

previously agreed policing for delaying the

kick-off.     It does seem that there was at least some

concern in the minds of Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD and Superintendent MURRAY at that time.
R118       By 1435 hours the Control Room was busy and

Superintendent MURRAY was engaged with radio reports

of incidents of disorder, arrests, ejections from the

ground and an elusive ticket tout who had to be

located.     He was also trying to make arrangements for

the accommodation of some Liverpool supporters who

had tickets for the Spion Kop, the Nottingham Forest

end of the ground, and for a breath test to be given

to a driver who was alleged to be drunk.



R119       At about 1440 hours, although he claims that

the "crowd around the turnstiles in Leppings Lane

appeared to be the same as five minutes earlier" it

was about that time that a request was received from

that location for reinforcements to be sent there.

All available mounted officers were deployed on

instructions from the Police Control Box in addition

to one serial of reserve foot officers from the

ground gymnasium.



R120       Again, at about that time, requests were

being received in the Control Box, from police

officers at the Leppings Lane turnstiles for tannoy

messages to be broadcast asking "people outside the

turnstiles to stop pushing forward as people were

going to be injured".     On Superintendent MURRAY’S
instructions these broadcasts were made from the

Police Control Box.



R121       At about 1442 hours the police radio was

becoming unintelligible and Superintendent MURRAY

took positive steps to restore radio communication

suggesting that "at least give us talk-through and we

will use a personal radio."     This was done and

although radio communication was restored, it meant

that the Police Control Box could not override other

transmissions.     There does not appear to have been

any alternative.    Although messages were being heard,

often only partially, in the Control Box,

Superintendent MURRAY found it very difficult to

acknowledge messages, or to send directions.



R122       By 1445 hours he could see on the CCTV

monitor that the crowd outside the Leppings Lane

turnstiles was compacting and "there appeared to be a

crush".    He estimated the crowd to be between 2,000

and 2,500 strong as he heard Superintendent

MARSHALL’S first request for the exit gates to be

opened.     There is no question that Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD was not aware of this

request.    Mr MARSHALL was told to standby.   Inspector
Part V            John Joseph BENNETT radioed for assistance at

Statement Pages   Leppings Lane turnstiles so Superintendent MURRAY

2947-2955         despatched 5 sergeants and 50 constables from the

                  club gymnasium,    A similar request was radioed

Part V            by Inspector Steven Robert SEWELL but the

Statement Pages   message was not acknowledged.    A second request

2502-2514         for assistance was radioed by Inspector BENNETT but

                  the message was not acknowledged.    He did not know

                  that officers had been sent from the gymnasium in

                  answer to his first request.    At about the same time

                  a second request was heard from Superintendent

                  MARSHALL for the exit gates to be opened, more urgent

                  this time.    While Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                  was still considering the matter Superintendent

                  MURRAY tried to contact Mr Douglas John LOCK, the

                  Club Security Officer, using the stewards’ radio

                  system, but without success.



                  R123    At about 1447 hours, as Superintendent

                  MARSHALL was making his third radioed request for the

                  exit gates to be opened, Superintendent MURRAY’S

                  attention was drawn to the CCTV monitor for camera 1,

Part V            by Police Constable Trevor BICHARD, who shouted out

Statement Pages   that a gate had been forced.    Superintendent MURRAY

2578-2588         could see Gate C open and fans flowing through it

                  into the stadium from outside the Leppings Lane

                  turnstiles.    He saw a mounted officer block off the
                  gateway with his horse and Gate C closed again.

                  Almost immediately Superintendent MARSHALL was heard

                  again on the radio asking for the exit gates to be

                  opened because of injuries and possible fatalities in

                  the crush outside of the turnstiles.   Superintendent

                  MURRAY pressed Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD for a

                  decision which he then made and Gate C was opened.

                  Superintendent MURRAY took no action to receive the

                  influx of people through Gate C, and gave no advice

                  in that respect.   He explains that he thought the

                  crowd would be absorbed inside the stadium.



Part V            R124    After Gate C had been opened and just before

Statement Pages   kick-off time (1500 hours) Superintendent MURRAY

2470-2488         noticed that Police Constable Peter Edward SMITH or

3315-3323         Police Constable David Alfred ILLINGWORTH had opened

3324-3328         the perimeter gate to pens 3 or 4 and a "handful" of

Part V            fans had come through the gate onto the track.      Chief

Statement Pages   Inspector Robert Ian McROBBIE left the Control Box

2554-2565         and went down onto the track to assist the relocation

                  of these fans into other pens.   Again, some time

                  around kick-off time, Superintendent MURRAY saw

                  supporters climbing over the perimeter fence onto the

                  perimeter track from pens 3 and 4, and others coming

                  through the open perimeter gates.   No radio traffic

                  was being received in the Control Box although
Part V            Police Constables SMITH. ILLINGWORTH and HELLIWELL.

Statement Pages   all recount messages being radioed from the track to

3315-3323         the effect that crushing was occurring in pens 3 and

3324-3328         4.   These messages were not acknowledged.    Although

3329-3336         Superintendent MURRAY was unable to see what the

                  problem was he thought that there may have been "some

                  pushing and crushing" at the front of the pens and

                  that people were being relocated by the officers on

                  the track.     Superintendent MURRAY heard Chief

                  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD direct Superintendent

                  Roger GREENWOOD to the Leppings Lane end of the

                  ground to investigate.    He heard the radio messages

                  being received in the Control Box but shortly

                  afterwards he saw Superintendent GREENWOOD standing

                  head and shoulders above the crowd waving his arms to

                  signal that the game should be stopped.     With Chief

                  Superintendent DUCKENFIELD’s approval he left the

                  Control Box and approached the linesman in order to

                  stop the match, the agreed procedure.     The linesman

                  ignored him.    Having seen Superintendent GREENWOOD

                  run onto the pitch and stopping the game,

                  Superintendent MURRAY returned to the Control Box.

                  He could see increasing numbers of people coming onto

Part V            the playing area and could hear Police Constable

Statement Pages   Michael Vincent RYAN using the tannoy in an attempt

2589-2596         to clear the pitch.
                          He could see that some of the fans were injured.

                          Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD directed

                          Superintendent MURRAY back to the pitch to try to

                          clear it and as he left the Control Box he heard

                          Police Constable RYAN asking for the ambulance

                          service to standby.



                          R125     On reaching the playing area Superintendent

                          MURRAY learned of the full nature of the disaster.

                          He had no radio with him so he took one from a

                          sergeant and radioed the Control Box for a "fleet of

                          ambulances".   That message was acknowledged and acted

                          upon.   He then assisted with the rescue activities

                          and radioed for tannoy messages to be broadcast to

                          try to get the people on the Leppings Lane terraces

                          to move back and ease the pressure at the front of

                          the pens. He then went to the rear of pens 3 and      4

                          through the central tunnel andfound police officers

                          there moving people out of the pens.



                          R126     He returned to the pitch andapart from

                          assisting with the rescue activities, he used police

                          officers to clear a gangway in the South Stand to aid

Part V                    the removal of casualties, gave direction to

Statement Pages 2488A-H   Superintendent David Christopher CHAPMAN and

                2677A-H   Inspector Brian Thomas WALLACE.   By 1530 hours he was
back in the Police Control Box briefing Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, just before he left to go

to the Boardroom.   Superintendent MURRAY remained in

the Police Control Box playing a full part in the

Major Incident Plan as it unfolded until about 2100

hours when he went to the temporary mortuary in the

gymnasium counselling police officers and liaising

with welfare and clerical workers.   At about 2240

hours he continued his counselling duties at the

Police Niagra Sports Club, eventually reaching

Hammerton Road Police Station at 2330 hours where he

stayed until about 0100 hours, checking arrangements

for VIP visits and other duties.



R127    Given that Superintendent MURRAY was not in

overall command of operations that day and that the

Police Commander was at his side almost throughout,

it is difficult to find evidence which is sufficient

to prove Neglect of Duty.   The poor police radio

performance on the day and the undoubted chaos of the

moment from Superintendent MURRAY’S vantage point in

the Police Control Box are both factors which made

difficult the recognition of the real nature of the

disaster as it unfolded in its early stages.     The

evidence shows that with the information available to

Superintendent MURRAY from police radio, CCTV and

his own eyesight, he acted to the best of his ability
before, during and after the moment of disaster.

That his general philosophy of policing football

matches with its emphasis on segregation, pitch

invasions and crowd disorder, played some part in his

actions on the day, is quite likely, but once he

recognised the real problem he did all that was asked

and expected of him.    The evidence in respect of all

three complaints is currently being considered by the

Director of Public Prosecutions to decide on

Superintendent MURRAY’S culpability for Manslaughter

or Culpable Malfeasance.    Should the Director decide

that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute

those offences then the same must be said for the

disciplinary offence of Neglect of Duty.    In which

case the complaints are unsubstantiated.



R128      In consultation with Mr WELLS. Chief

Constable, South Yorkshire Police, agreement has been

reached to forward all files direct to the Director

of Public Prosecutions and to the Police Complaints

Authority.   Once a final decision is

made by the Director the full main file and the

separate discipline files will be forwarded to South

Yorkshire Police following the certificate of

satisfaction from the Police Complaints Authority.

 I refer to today's telephone conversation regarding the Hillsbrough enquiry. As discussed
   require Assistant Chief Constable Cooper, as the current Investigating Officer, to
 serve Regulation 7 notices on the officers named by Mr Hicks in his statem ent of 2^
 August 1989. It is important th at the notices are served without delay*

 I confirm that Mr Cooper is only required to serve the notices and the enquiry will then
 be dealt with by another force. As soon as the situation regarding the appointment of
 the new Investigating Officer is resolved, I will inform both yourself and Mr Cooper in
 order that arrangements can be made for the transfer of documents etc.

 Again thank you for your assistance in this m atter.

Following our telephone conversation of recent date I write to you with a
proposition in connection with the routeing of the papers arising from the
crime investigation into the Hillsborough disaster.

You will know that my investigation into the criminal and disciplinary aspects
is being supervised by the Police Complaints Authority. At the end of my
investigation, which is not far off, the PCA must make a statement that it is
satisfied with the conduct of the investigation. That statement will be sent
to you, the complainants and to the officers whose conduct has been called into
question. The only exception to that will be the PCA statement in respect of
your Assistant Chief Constable Mr Walter JACKSON. In his case the PCA
statement will go to your Police Authority.

In strict accord with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the way for
this to be achieved is for me to submit my original report to the PCA, and at
the same time send a copy to you (or your Police Authority). Once the PCA is
satisfied with my investigation it sends the forementioned statement to that
effect, to you (or to your Police Authority).

You (or your Police Authority) are then required first to consider matters
related to any criminal offences revealed in the report and refer them to the
Director of Public Prosecutions. Thereafter you are required to submit a
report to the PCA setting out your opinions as to the merits of the complaints
against police officers; any disciplinary charges preferred or proposed; the
merits or otherwise of convening a disciplinary tribunal; and any reasons for
not preferring disciplinary charges.

My proposition is that for various reasons; including the referral of the
matter by Peter Wright to the DPP in the first place; the complex circumstances
of the investigation; the bulk of the documentary and other evidence; and the


                                                      Continued...




                                                                                  9
                                                                  DOCUMENT N o .      8

need for expediency; you allow me to deal direct with the DPP in so far as the
crime aspects are concerned. Of course, you will receive the PCA statement at
the appropriate time and you will receive all of the evidence and reports in
time for your consideration of the disciplinary aspects with the PCA. The
matters relating to your Assistant Chief Constable would not be affected.

I hope that this letter is comprehensible and that you will agree to my
proposal, in which case a short letter of reply would be appreciated.

Many thanks for your letter of   17 July 1990 which concerns the routeing
of your report to the DPP.

I quite understand that there are exceptional circumstances which surround
your investigation and that the bulk of the material which accompanies
your report isconsiderable.    It is also relevant    that the matter was
referred to the DPP by Peter Wright in the first instance, and the need
for expediency should require no argument.

Of course, I am directly concerned only with the matters which involve
officers of and below the rank of Chief Superintendent, so I cannot speak
for my Police Authority which is concerned with officers of ACPO rank.

I have no objection to your submitting    your   report   to    the    DPP   through
the PCA without sending a copy to me.

I understand that in due course I shall receive a statement from the
PCA in respect of your conduct of the investigation and that I shall
receive all the reports and supporting evidence in good time for me to
consider any disciplinary aspects of the case.

I trust that this letter is sufficient for your purposes              and    that   it
will help to bring the matter to a swift conclusion.

                          feature later on when I talk to

                          you. You would not have been

                          present during the 1981 (000081)
                          semi-final when there was some

                          problem with crushing at lappings

                          which I think was Coventry against

                          particularly shall we say to do
                          with Hillsborough and as you've

                          said on a few occasions, the

                          policing of football matches.
11.04                     There is an F Division Policy File

                          on football, would you have had

                          access to that file?
11.13    BDM               I could have had access to the file

                           I don't recall seeing the file,
                          the, when I joined the Division,
                          the football matches were commanded
                          by the Divisional Carrmander or

                          his Deputy.   It wasn't the role

                          of the Sub-Divisional Superintendent

                          to command football matches.
         DCS6930          Not to command them, would you have
                          had a role in them though?
         BDM              I was told the, the Superintendent
                          frcm the Sub-Division traditionally

                          worked in the Control Room

                          environment and that was where I
                          would work.
         DCS6930          That's where you would work.    That

                          Policy File, F Division Policy

                          File, did you, did you think at any
                          time at the start when you first

                          went there, with the view that you
                          may be doing football matches, did
                          you think it important to read

                          years ago and we're talking of

                          an incident nine years previous.
         DCS6930          Sometime.    I mean were you aware

                          for example, and I think you've

                          actually answered this by saying

                          you weren't, but were you aware
                          that those changes really resulted

                          from the problems of 1981 (000081)?
         BDM              Not...
         DCS6930          Was it that apparent at the time?
         BDM              Not entirely no.
16.06    DCS6930          Okay, thank you. We, you mention
                          that you weren't actually there in
                          1987   (000087 ),   there has been a

                          suggestion and it is only a, it's

                          not, it's not well documented, but

                          there is a suggestion that there

                          was a problem at the semi-final in
                          1987   (000087)   whereby there was the

                          suggestion of overcrowding.      Did
                          you have any knowledge of that?
         BDM              No.
         DCS6930          Going on to 1988 (000088) when you

16.40                     Rocm situation with Mr MOLE, again
                          there is some evidence that people

                          were injured on those terraces in

                          an overcrowding situation. Was that

         BDM              Not that I know of, the different
                          serials do may well comment on it

                          on their debriefing sheets.

         DCS6930          Yes.    If, is there any instruction

                           for them for any injuries to

                          actually inform the Police.     Is
                          there anything that you know of

                           if if there was serious injuries
                           I would think they would get in

         DCS6930          And I think from what you've said
                           it's evident that nothing actually

                           came up to suggest that there was

           BDM              Yes.
           DCS6930          And you went to that meeting with
                            one of the Inspectors I think?
           BDM              Yes I did.
           DCS6930          Can you briefly tell me what that

                            meeting was for?
3 7 .4 0   BDM              Well the meeting was just to, just
                            to to sort of exchange information

                            and to find out several matters
                            that I wanted to bring to the

                            attention of the Club and probably

                            seme matters that they wanted to
                            bring to my attention.           I was

                            concerned about the, the gantry

                            that the television cameras were
                            being mounted on over the West
                            Stand, and whether it was safe.

                            I was concerned about where
                            exactly Mr CLOUGH was going to

                            sit because I think he'd been
                            banned from the touch line and

                            there was several matters that

                             I wanted to discuss with the
                            Club where they were going
                            to site betting booths, what

                            vulnerable property they had, who

                            the referee was and and matters
                            in general.
           DCS6930          It's a sort of final mop up, make
                            sure everything's right before
                            the day?
           BDM              Yes.
           DCS6930          And the Club man from your, your
                            point of view.
           BDM              Yes, yes that's the way I look
                            at it.
3 8 .4 7   DCS6930          Did the, did you actually have

                            anything to do with the, the

                            tickets that were produced or

                            printed for the game?
           BDM              No, no I didn't I know that
                            Chief Superintendent MOLE had

                            asked them to be slightly bolder
                            colour than they were the year

                            before, but that, I had no

                            involvement with the tickets.
           DCS6930          Do you know why Mr MDLE asked that?
3 9 .1 2   BDM              I think they were sort of pastel
                            shades which it was difficult to

                            decide which was brown, which was

                            red and he asked them to be a




                                                                       954
MURRAY              BERNARD D


                           darker shade, and I think they
                           were made a darker shade for the
                           89 (000089)   final.
39 .2 8   DCS6930          Is that because there was a problem

                           with 88 (000088) in terms of

                           people knowing where they've been
                           going?
          BDM              I think it was generally a problem

                           that it wasn't clear from the

                           tickets yeah, which was the brown

                           queue, which was the burgandy queue,

                           which was the red queue, whatever
                           the colours were.
          DCS6930          Do you know where that related to

                           was it, was it in general throughout

                           the ground or specifically Leppings
                           Lane?
          BDM              I don't know whether it was anywhere
                           specific, my impression was that it
                           was generally throughout the ground
                           that the colours were similar.
          DCS6930          But you had no cause yourself to

                           take any part in the, the colouring

                           of those tickets or the...
          BDM              No.
40.06     DCS6930          Or the, what about the inspection
                           of them, to see that you were

                           happy with them that they in

                           fact accorded with the turnstile
MURRAY             BERNARD D


                          numbers or lettering?
         BDM               I think, I think we received

                          copies of the tickets.   I I don't

                          I didn't inspect them personally.
40.24    DCS6930          It, I mean it has been suggested

                          that the tickets either by colour
                          or lettering caused confusion in

                          the 1988 (000088) 1989 (000089) semi­
                          final. Would you agree with that?
         BDM              I would agree with having read and

                          heard what I've heard since the
                          event.
         DCS6930          Mm.
         BDM              At the time I didn't know.
40.47    DCS6930          You didn't know.   I mean would

                          you give any opinion on whether

                          you think it was a considerable
                          factor or a factor of any kind
                          in the problems that occurred

                          outside the turnstiles in 89
                          (000089)?

         BDM              I don't know the extent of it
                          but I I I feel sure it must have

                          been a factor, if someone turned
                          up at a wrong turnstile and was
                          turned away, then obviously

                          it's impairing the efficiency
                          of the turnstiles and it was very

                          inportant that those turnstiles

 41.20     DCS6930           So what you're actually saying

                            really is it would appear at

                             88 (000088)          there was a, seme
                            sort of problem because Mr MDLE
                            acted on it and asked them to

                            to use bolder colours?
          BDM               Yes.

          BDM               Yes.
          DCS6930           And that the Police actually did
                            something about it and tried to

                            rectify that problem?
          BDM               Yes, yes.
41.41     DCS6930           But to your knowledge there was

                            nothing wrong with the or nothing
                            suggested that there was anything

                            wrong with the the printing or the

                            numbers to cause confusion other
                           than the colouring?

           BDM              Yes.
           DCS6930          Your briefing that we were just

                            talking about in the previous part

                            of the interview.   You actually
                             said that you discussed with Mr

                             to the Inspectors, I had to cut it
                             down for the following day, it was

                             taking too long. The, the officers
                             just would not give their attention

0 7 .4 3   DCS6930          Thank you.   Can we move on now to

                            your actual role on the day. You

                            actually I think say that you had
                            responsibility and overall command
                            of the Control Room?
           BDM              Yes.
0 8 .0 3   DCS6930          Can you actually explain that in
                            relation to the role of Mr

                            DUCKENFIELD in the Control Room?
           bdm              Well Mr DUCKENFIELD was in overall
08.17                       command of the event. My job,

                            as I saw it was in the Control
                            Room, overseeing the event, making
                            arrangements for reception of all

                            communications and acting on the

                            information received.   Mr

                            DUCKENFIELD had informed me

                            before the event that he would
                            be taking up his position as
MURRAY               BERNARD D                                    51


                            Corrmander in the Control Room and

                            where as Mr MOLE, the previous
                            year had not.
0 9 .0 0   DCS6930          Yes, you, I think you actually
                            said to the Public Inquiry that

                            Mr DUCKENFIELD if you want to

                            look at it it's on Page 68 of the

                            transcript and I'll read it out to

                            you, I'm reading page 68 of the,
                            of your transcript.

                            You were asked the question, say
                            you were with Mr DUCKENFIELD or

                            intending to be with Mr DUCKENFIELD

                            for the match itself, and you

                            actually say, Well Mr DUCKENFIELD
                            took up the role which I expected
                            to take up...
           BDM              Which I expected him to take up,
                            that should be.
           DCS6930          What Mr DUCKENFIELD...
           bdm              Which I expected him to take.
           DCS6930          So it's while Mr DUCKENFIELD took
                            up the role which I expected him
                            to take up, which was in the
                            Control Room.
           BDM              That's right.
           DCS6930          Because that makes a completely,
                            that makes a very significant
                            difference to the interpretation




                                                                       966
MURRAY             BERNARD D


                          of of that.
09.44    BDM              No, Mr DUCKENFIELD didn't take my

                           role he took the role I expected
                           him to take, because he had already

                           told me that he would be spending

                          most of the time in the Control

                          Room.     He saw the Match Commanders,
                           that being the Match Commanders

                          position.

         DCS6930           I mean the the question that would

                          ccme from anybody reading that
                          would be that you you appeared not

                           to be sure of your role because

                           he was actually taking on your
                           role but that's not right?
         BDM               That's not right.

         DCS6930           No.     I mean, had you seen that

                           before in your transcript and

                           realised?
         bdm               I I feel so I think that's, that's
                           why I was so quick to recognise

                           to explain.

10.29    DCS6930           Okay.    So, the year before then,

                           Mr MOLE really had taken a

                           different method?
         BDM               Yeah, their leadership styles
                           were very different.    Mr MOLE

                           did the whole of the briefing

                           himself.    He operated mainly on
MURRAY             BERNARD D


                          the ground and moved around alot,

                          came to the Control Room, visited,
                          was in radio contact all the time
                          but didn't spend the whole of
                          the event in the Control Roc*n.
                          I think Mr DUCKENFIELD saw his

                          position as supervising the

                          event from the Control Roan
                          environment.
11.08    DCS6930          Right, now in terms of the

                          control that you have exercise
                          within the Control Room. You are

                          obviously in control of the
                          the officers within that room?
         BDM              Yes.
         DCS6930          Radio carmuncations, decisions

                          being made at that stage caning
11.28                     in requests being made.   Do

                          you put yourself even with
                          Mr DUCKENFIELD in position as
                          the person who responds or makes

                          the decision to agree to, for

                          example a request for the Landrover

                          that that went with the tannoy?
         BDM              If the request is to do with
                          movement of manpower, vehicles
                          and specific request then yes,

                          that's (town to me.

19.18    DCS6930          Does that information get fed back

         BDM              If it, if it's of interest to us
                          yes.
         DCS6930          Well non ticket holders...
         BDM              Absolutely.
         DCS6930          would be of interest.
         BDM              Well what, what they were trying to
                          do well if it was a bus, if it was

                          a coach load of non ticket holders,

                          the instructions were to turn them
                          round and escort them back up the

                          motorway.   Obviously if it's half
19.46                     and half there is a problem, but

                          we didn't get any information on

                          the day that people were travelling
                          without tickets.
19.52    DCS6930          So you would have expected officers
                          one to have done that because

                          that's part of the briefing and
                          the plan is to actually stop

                            supporters in.     I don't know whether

                             it was concern but I was, I was

                            hoping that they were going to

                            be here very quickly and in fact
                            it was very shortly after that

                            that they did start to, to arrive
                            in larger numbers.
2 4 .2 2   DCS6930          As you say, perhaps not concern

                            but, you, you were certainly

                            alive to the difference?
           BDM              Absolutely.     Yes.
           DCS6930          So it perhaps wouldn't have been
                            an unusual thing for Mr JACKSON

                            to have said?
           BDM              It wouldn't have been, because if
                            it was, it was apparent at that
                            stage that there were far more

                            Nottingham supporters than
                            Liverpool.
           DCS6930          Was Mr JACKSON there for the 1988

                            (000088)   game? To your knowledge?
           BDM              I don't know.
2 4 .4 7   DCS6930          You don't know.    The, the next

           BDM              I think that time, whether it's
                           on the actual monitor, I don't
                           know, it may well be on the

                           recording, I wouldn't look at the

                           at the monitor that was actually
                           recording at the time, I would
                           look at the five fixed TV monitors.
          DCS6930          Mm.
          BDM              And which would in front and near

                           to my left but not the recording

                           machine which is to my right.
          DCS6930          If we just, can you just put that

                           on play and if you want to stop
30.21                      it at all, I, I mean the crowd

                           is, is fairly considerable there,
                           at that stage, and going back

                           up towards Leppings Lane, again
                           for the benefit of the audio, we're
30.32                      looking at Document 109 timed at

                           1416 (1416)   and I think it flits
                           about now.    Can can you say now

                          whether that was the sort of view
                           and crowd that you would have seen
                          at that time?
          BDM              I can't, I can't recall but I I

                          can recall sort of about 2 .1 5 (1415)

                          about that time, thinking well,
30.56                     good there's plenty of people

           DCS6930         Right. Mr DUCKENFIELD is with you,

                           you can switch that off now, we're

                            just switching off that particular
                           video.           Mr DUCKENFIELD is with
                           you at this time?
           BDM             Yes.
           DCS6930         And and on that request from
 MURRAY             BERNARD D


                           Mr MARSHALL, the, did you and

                           Mr DUCKENFIELD discuss that request?
           BDM              I I can't, I can't honestly recall

                           it.    I can't I can't recall whether
                           we discussed it or not. We may have,
32.14                      I may have said to him, we're

                           going to have to close Leppings

                           Lane, it doesn't look too bad but

                           we're going to have to close it,
                           if Mr MARSHALL wants it closing,

                           that sort of conversation may have
                           taken place but I can't, I can't

                           recall turning round to him and

                           saying, such, Do you want me to
                           close it.
32.32     DCS6930          No.    So you, who actually, did
                           you actually say okay close it

                           and gave the instruction?
          BDM              Yes.
          DCS6930          I know there was again a bit of a
                           delay in it actually happening.
          BDM              I I think so, I think so, but

                           I can't be one hundred pier cent
                           sure, but I do recall looking at the
                           video and thinking, well fair
32.55                      enough, I don't think it's too
                          bad in Leppings Lane but if Mr
                          MARSHALL wants it closed then he's
                          the man on the ground he can have
 MURRAY              BERNARD D


                             it closed.
 33.05     DCS6930          Would either, would Sergeant GODDARD

                            or one of the other officers, would
                            they have done that without your
                            authority?
           BDM              Em.
           DCS6930          I mean could it have happened

                            without, without you actually
                            agreeing it?
           BDM              It could, what I, what I would do

                            is I I I'd put a great deal of of

                            faith in the in the Control Room

                            staff, Sergeant GODDARD has got a

                            tremendous local knowledge which
                            I haven't of the area and if a

                            unit is requested at a particular
                            area, he knows exactly where it

                            is and he knows a unit on stand,
3 3 .4 0                    that is near.   If Sergeant GODDARD

                            gets an instruction from outside
                            or a request from outside and he
                            automatically sends someone,
                           despatches someone, I I will stand

                           by that unless I agree otherwise.
                           And if he did something that I

                           disagreed with I would tell him
                           and say no or we'll do something
                           else, but I would be, as far as

3 5 .2 2   DCS6930          Okay.   Did you ask at any time

                             following that request for any
                            of the officers shall we say

                            outlying areas whether the crowd
                            was a problem, whether there was

           BDM              No I I don't think I asked.
           DCS6930          Any reports coming in that you
                            could recall that, from people

                            saying, I've still got people in
                            coaches or I've still got, you

                            know, they're aren't as many

                            coaches here as they should be,
                            anything else to warn you that
                            you know well I'm going to get
                            additional crowds coming over
                            the next thing than perhaps I
                            would expect?

           BDM              The only, the only information

                            were urinators outside, as far

          BDM              That's correct, yes.
          DCS6930          And again, I think emphasising

                           the public inquiry side, that you

                           you couldn't recall actually
                           using that facility or, or
                           checking it. But in fact I

                           think you were told, and I think

                           it's right to say that somebody
                           in the Control Room, in your

                           Control Room, was actually on

                           three or four occasions monitoring
                           that situation.   Is that correct?
                           What I've just said there?
38.46    BDM               So far as I'm concerned, I never

                           made contact with the Club's Control

                           Roan to find out numbers inside the
                           ground and I cannot recall

                           at all anybody giving me any

                           information that there were x

                           number of people inside the ground
                           and I do know that the Club

                          Control Room have said that they
                          were given that information to
                          someone in the Control Room.

                          If that is correct fair enough,

                          but that information never, was
                          never given to me.
         DCS6930          Is it something in the experience
                          that you've had in there, is it
 MURRAY              BERNARD D


                             something that's done automatically?
                             In other words does, on a fairly

                            regular basis, does the Ground

                            Control ring through or radio
                            through and say, It's now so and
                            so, it's now so and so. Perhaps

                            not because there's a need or a

                            an urgency or anything else just
                            in general practice?
           BDM              No it it's a nice little facility,
                            because we we find out at the
                            end of the day just how many

                            visiting supporters we've had.
           DCS6930          Mm.
           BDM              And what the crowd is and generally

                            the, the, that's the only time we
                            use the facility to find out the
                            total number of visitors for our
                            records.
3 9 .5 8   DCS6930          So you have never had to use that

                            facility in terms of an operational

                            have seen in fact huge numbers of

                            people, accomodated in the five
                            or six minutes before a kick

4 1 .4 3   DCS6930          Who who actually gave you that
                            sort of information. Was it
                            the Club?
           BDM              I can't remember whether it was,

                            whether it was the Club, Mr MOLE

                            or one of the Liaison Officers,

                            it was just given as, as sort of
                            rough figures to to work on.
           DCS6930          General information?
           BIE              Yeah.
           DCS6930          Not again am I right in saying,

                            it's not because you had experienced
                            any concern or problem, it was
                            really just general information on
                            that?
           BDM              It was more of on one occasion

                            standing looking around and

                            someone saying to me, either from
                            the Club or the Police side, I

                            can't recall which.    Don't worry/
                           we can, we can get a thousand a

42.26     DCS6930           I mean would you have known to
                           the extent that they can actually
                            identify and again I think this

                           came up at the public inquiry,
                           specifically the group of

                           turnstiles and the count

                           differences for those turnstiles?
         BDM               I...
         DCS6930           Was that within your knowledge?
         BDM               I know that they can give the

                           information on every specific
                           turnstile, I don't know how

                           difficult it is to, to group

                           turnstiles, turnstiles together
                           and whether it is more difficult
                           than we are using recognised

                           turnstiles for one part of the

                           ground to the other.    But I
                           know   that they can give you

                           that information, I don't
                           know   whether it would be, whether
                          they'd be able to give it at

                          the drop of a hat or whether it

                          would be a lengthy process.
         DCS6930          I know that the tape is going
                          to finish in the next two

                          minutes, I think it's perhaps
                          best if we finish this one

                           gymnasium again to Leppings

                          Lane. Was that your decision
                          to do that?
30.03    BDM              It was my decision, it was

                          a request from an Inspector

                          for assistance and Inspector

                          BENNETT I think who was

                          actually standing on the
                          turnstiles, said we require
                          some more assistance at

                          Leppings Lane.    I think this

                          was after the first request

                          had been received for the gates

                          to be opened.     With it the
                          radio being on talk through,
                          Inspector SEWELL who was the

                          Liaison Officer and at the

                          gymnasium heard the request

                          got on the phone to the Control

                          Reran and said, we have, I have
                          eight or ten serials, I can't
                          remember.   I straight away

                          said send five and fifty.     Hold
                          on to the rest but send five

                          and fifty down to Leppings Lane.
30.52    DCS6930          So, so you were responding again
                          to a deteriorated situation
                          given to you.    Somebody was saying

                         that we've still got a problem...

                              were available.   Now I know

                              again at some stage there prior
                              to us caning round to the the

                              people in, it did open for a

                              short time as a result I think
                             of somebody actually being
                             ejected and a number of of

                             supporters went in.

            BDM              No.   I can't I can't recall

                             exactly what I was doing but
                             it might have been, I might

                             have been sort of organising

                            did from time to time if he

                            wanted me to see anything.      The

                            request had already been made
                            for the gates to be opened.

                            any possibility that you are
                            confused into what he's talking

                           gate and people ccming into the
                           ground,   it was a perimeter
                           gate...

                             to the fact that if you did let

                             people in you could have a problem
                             when they came in?
            BDM              It didn't, it didn't alert me to

                             that, it, I I was despatching

                             officers to the scene, I was

                             trying to watch the situation, I
                             was getting messages over the
                             radio that, that, to open the

                             gates that people were going to

                             be crushed.   It didn't, it didn't

                             alert, trigger any other thought
                             pattern in my mind.
3 4.32      DCS6930          I mean did yourself and Mr

                             DUCKENFIELD or did you, did you

                             discuss or consider that as they
                            were coming in there was no

                             ticket collection there could

                            have been non ticket holders,
34.45                       and that people, I mean I think

                            we know there was about five
                            hundred came in, I think you

                            estimated it at less at the time

                            or but was there anything there
                            that made you discuss what to




                                                                        1032

                           do if you actually responded to
                           the request that was coming
                           to open the gates?
          BDM              No, I think, I think that I would
                           only be thinking that Mr
                           DUCKENFIELD may have made a

                           ccnment that, why are they

                           still asking for the gates to be

                           opened if they've burst, or words
                           to that effect.
          DCS6930          But, but nothing on a, shall
                           we say on an operational basis

                           that made you think that if we

                           do anything else we should put

                           some more resources or get more

                           stewards to to receive the influx
                           that that would come?
          BDM             No, I I was just hoping that

                          that would relieve the the obvious
                          problem outside which was

                          becoming apparent and the fact

                          that we'd got manpower either

                            several things happening and Mr

                            I was hoping that the situation
                            might have been retrievable, I
                           was looking at the, at the video
                            and I I was seeing whether there

                           was a possibility that we could

                            get away without opening the gates
                           but eventually it got to a stage
                           where because of the, the urgency
                           in Mr MARSHALL'S voice I was
40.43                      satisfied that the gates had to

                           be opened, that the situation

                           wasn't recoverable and that we

                            we going to open the gates and he
                            thought about it for a few

                            seconds and said yes.

                            being opened and Gate B was

                            opened perhaps for a short time.

                            means the gates to the Leppings
                            Lane enclosure and not the gates

                           the decision to open those gates.
                          Was there anything on those

                           terraces that gave you cause for

                           the closing of all those iron

                quite serious because again the

                 Sergeant said if you don't open

                 it people are going to be killed

                 and Mr DUCKENFIELD immediately

                 saying open it and I think
                 asking for the remaining serials

                 from the gymnasium to be

                 despatched to receive them on
                 the North Stand concourse.

19.56            I I had a real fear with that

                 gate that people were going to
                 come spilling through the,
                 the the exits and entrances on

                 the North Stand onto the pitch

                 into the seats which were all

                 ticket and there was going to be
                 chaos and I was watching the
                 North Stand and I was watching
                 the West Stand and I was watching

                 the terraces and I I didn't, I
                 don't think I gave a conscious

                 thought to saying right enough
                 was enough, we've eased the pressure
                 let's shut the gate and for a

                 control over people going through

                 but eventually he withdrew or

                            was pushed aside and and I didn't

                            give a conscious thought to

                             saying stop it there.
21.00      DCS6930          The there was some discussion

           BDM              Yes.

           DCS6930           In in Leppings Lane.    Those iron

                             perimeter gates, that that feature

                             outside, they, there are I think

                             six pairs that open out.    Is that
                             right?

           BDM               I think so, yes.

           DCS6930           If we talk about the ones that

                             that give access to turnstiles

2 1 .3 0                     A to G.    Is there any policy on
                             prior to the match and the build
                             up of the crowd on which of those
                             gates are open, be it 1, 2 or?
           BDM               I think there there may have been

                             the perimeter gates for the

                             Sheffield Wednesday it's the

                             edge of their property and and
                             they delegate the the end of

                             Sheffield Wednesday's property.

                             I've never known them be, be
                             closed.    I've, as far as I can

                             recall and I stand corrected
                             they're always sort of opened




                                                                         1061

                            and left in the open position.
           DCS6930           Is that all of them?
2 2 .0 7   BEM              All of them.   I've never, apart

                             from the ones that lead down,
                             actually down to the road at
                             the South Stand and then

                             again, I can't remember

                            whether they closed or not,

                             but I've I've never noticed

                             the gates have never featured
                             in any plans or strategy, they're
                             just there, they just happen to

                            be perimeter gates.

           DCS6930          Are they manned by Police

                             Officers?
           BDM               No.
2 2 .3 3   DCS6930           The the reason I bring it up

                             is because in eighty, people

                             have said that in 1988 (000088)
                             the the queuing was better.
           BDM               Yeah.
           DCS6930           Now what I'd like you to do is
                             just have a look at a piece of

                             video from 1988 (000088) that
2 2 .5 4                     shows those those gates, because

                             it does seem evident and it's

                             not very clear but if we, it's

                             about 2 .4 5 (1445) and in fact
                             if you'd accept that it, it's

                             these seem to be.

                           actually talking about monitoring

                           it for, for packing purposes, or

                           for overcrowding or, what has

                          been your view of, of why you

                          would monitor those pens?

         BDM               I'm not, no I wasn't talking
                           about packing or overcrowding, I

                          was talking about a a serious
                           situation which comes, comes

                           to the attention of anyone and

                           I I can only, there's no
                           specific, we never gave any
                           specific instructions for anyone

                           to monitor pens, but if there

                           was a serious problem I would

                           just expect to be notified of it

                           by anyone.
         DCS6930           So what you're actually saying
                           to me is that, that shall we

                           say that questioning around

                           the public inquiry on that

                           point. What you're really saying

                           is when you talk about monitoring

                           the pens is you're looking at than
                           for any sorts of incident, be it

                           for, for a hooligan a drunk,

                           anything at all, people being

                          know whether I would be looking

                           for anything particular.              I recall

                           I've seen it years ago where

                           children always used to go to the
                           front and sometimes they they
                          were in distress and the policeman

                          would lift them out and relocate

                           them somewhere else.           Ill

                           certainly don't think I would

                          be standing there looking to see
                           how how dense the crowd was if if
                           I could, if I could sort of
                           figure it out.        I would just be,
                           I would be looking at the people,

                           looking at the crowd and looking

30.21    DCS6930           So there would, from what you're

                           for individual perimeter track

                              completely different now.

             BDM              Absolutely.

             DCS6930           Yes.   But nothing had happened

                               difficult to say to a Police

                               Officer, well look at the crowd
                               and if you see anybody who's

                               sort of obviously suffering

                               severely, do something about it

                               it's part of his his job, his
                               duties, he's highly trained.

                          that in fact I think the

                          reason I've pursued that is
33.58                     that certainly PC ILLINGWORTH

                          didn't seem to be aware of

                           a responsibility on him to

                          man any particular gates and

                           I think from what you've said
                           is that would be right.      That
                           he wouldn't...

         BDM              Yes.
         DCS6930          perhaps be given a set
                           responsibility.       The only

                           further point I I'd put to
                           you on that is, it was
                           suggested by that officer that

                           indeed that he had suggested

                           seme four or five weeks before

                           to a senior officer that more

                           track officers ought to be
                           employed with the big game
                           coming up. Was that ever

                           considered or was there any

                           knowledge of that within your

                          by by 1503 (1503) you've seen a
                           a number of people spilling onto the

         BDM               Yes.

                           you that after the event my
                           perception was that the match had
                           been played perhaps for about two

                           minutes, when I was informed that

                           it had been going on for six

                           minutes I found it difficult to

           BDM              No, no it was merely a perception
                             that there must have been some

                            people in some discomfort at the

                             front and the officers were trying

                             to relocate them.    It was also my

                             perception that other people were
                             taking advantage of the situation

                             as I would expect and were getting

                             out onto the track for a, for a

                             better view of events.

           DCS6930           You say that because, has that
                             happened before?
           BDM               It's nothing, it's not that I've

                             known at Hillsborough but I I do

                             know that when I've been to

                             Football matches, both as a Police

                             Officer and as as a spectator
                             that people do take advantage
                             of any situation to gain themselves

                             a better position to, if they feel

                             sometimes they're helped onto the

                             heard I think Sergeant GODDARD

                             saying, stop the game, stop the
                             game which is on the bottom of your

                             page 13 of your statement, you

                             actually grabbed your hat and

                             Mr DUCKENFIELD said, yes stop the
                             game.   You grabbed your hat and

                             and went down from the Control

                             ever discuss or consider going
                             down any earlier to see what the

                             problem was with people coming
                             out or did you feel you knew what

                             the problem was?

                             but I I think Mr DUCKENFIELD and

08.42                        happening no.       There was no way

                             I could recognise it was a

                             serious problem.        Obviously now

                             if I'd gone further and gone up

                             for myself that it was a serious

                             problem but at that time I had

                             no idea, still thought that we'd

                             got, what we'd got were, were people

                             who'd come onto the track, taking
                             advantage of a, of a situation.

           DCS6930           So nothing, you saw nothing,
                             nothing was said to you that in

                             any way would have alerted you
                             to to what we know unfolded later?

                             you say in your statement, and
                             Mr DUCKENFIELD then again asked

                             you to go back down onto the field
                             and try and clear people from the

                             goal area?

           BDM               That's right.

                           the first occasion.

         BDM              It was the first occasion.

         DCS6930          Are you quite sure about that?

         BDM              I'm almost sure because there
                           were more people on the pitch

                           when I went down the second
                           occasion, they they were spilling

                           out towards the penalty areas.

         DCS6930           It's only just to, I didn't want
                           you to to feel that, that was
                           definitely right.             There is the

                           option that it, it could have

                           been the later one.

         BDM               I can't remember being there

                           that, I'm I'm satisfied that
                           was the first occasion.

10.39    DCS6930          Okay. When you went back down

                          you, you saw a lot of people as
                          you say in your statement that

                          were shocked and dazed lying on
                           the ground and then you saw
                          people apparently janxned hard

                           against the fence?

         BDM               That's right.

         DCS6930          And actually graphically describe

                           the fact that they were starting
                           to discolour?
         BDM               Yes.
11.02    DCS6930           Can you tell me what you actually

                           did at that particular point?

         BDM               Yes, went for a radio.   I needed

                           a radio, when I left the Control
                           Room on the second occasion nobody
                           in there gave me any hint that
                           they knew that people were

                           seriously injured.   In fact as I

                           left I recall PC BICHARD who had
                           the job of also conmunicating with

                           force ops room asking for an

                           ambulance to be made ready for

11.39                      standby.   When I saw those people

                           hard against the fence, and at

                           the same time someone lying on
                           the track being sick, vomiting
                           discoloured, I realised then we

                          and I was acknowledged by Sergeant

12.56                     GODDARD.    I asked for, for a

                           fleet of ambulances.   I asked for
                          tannoy messages to tell people to

                           get back because it was my

                          perception then that it was the

                           force of the crowd at the back that

                          was injuring these people at the
                           front.    I think I asked for, for
                           bolt croppers I can't remember

                           if I, if I asked for them, if I

                           didn't ask for them, it was
                           purely and simply because the guy

                           next to me said I've already asked
                           for them, but that was, that was
                           what I wanted.    I I wanted mainly

                           I wanted to make sure that we'd

                           got ambulances on route and that

                           we we did what we could to get

                           people to move back.

                         being taken out.   I I then saw

                            could be of assistance.

3 8 .0 0   DCS6930           So how would you effectively find
                             that the Major Incident Plan had

                             actually been carrmenced?

           BDM               I I think I picked, I don't know,

                             I don't know how I picked it up
                             but I picked it up that we were

                             on a Major Incident situation.

38.19                        Bearing in mind that when I returned

                             to the Control Room I still didn't

                             know the extent of what we were

                             dealing with.   I was able to tell
                             Mr DUCKENFIELD that I I felt we

                             we'd got alot of injuries and

                             possibly some fatalities but I

                             was certainly not thinking that we

                             had the type of incident that we

                             had.

           DCS6930           What's going on is being
                             monitored in the Force Control

                             Roam. Would that be right?

           BDM               At that, at that stage once I

                             think, once Operation Support had

                             been, had been called then the
                             Force Ops started to monitor I

                             think.

 39.00     DCS6930           Now then in terms of Command of

                             the Incident that's taking place.

                             As far as you were concerned
                                                                               INJ

                                                                                    1121

                           I was satisfied that Mr JACKSON

                          was the officer who was going to

                           give that particular instruction

                           anyway. As to who was, who was

                           in charge of and at what particular
                           stage I don't know. Certainly the
                           event was Mr DUCKENFIELD's and there

                          must have been a stage when Mr

                           JACKSON took over.

40.53    DCS6930          Who for example can you recall

                           said we want the temporary mortuary
                           set up, we want the Incident Room

                           Box, the Major Incident Plan, the

                           Emergency Box. Who made those

                           decisions?
         BDM               Well I wouldn't be in the Control

                           Roan I don't think when those
                           decision were made?

         DCS6930           Okay that's fine. Can I move

                           perhaps finally onto the specific
                           allegations and I've covered most

                           of them but it's an opportunity

                           for you, through what we've
                           been through and what we've said

41.26                      Mr HICKS has made specific

                           allegations against you and the

                           first one is that you failed

                           to prevent a dangerous build up of
                           supporters outside the gates.     Is




                                                                        1 122
MURRAY         BERNARD D                                       208


                      there anything you wish to add

                      to that allegation as a result of

                      what we've said today?
         BDM           I don't think so.   I I think you've
                       gone through it and I think that
                       on the circumstances that prevailed

                       that the time limits that was

41.58                  available that that we did everything

                       that we we thought was possible to

                       prevent that build up, bearing in
                       mind that there were all sorts of
                       other factors, the the weather which,

                       was unusual at the time, the the

                       familiarity of the fans with that

                       particular area having come the

                       year before and obviously arriving
                       later, the layout of the ground
                       which which doesn't become apparent
                       until after something like this

                       has happened, the number of

                       turnstiles, the ticket coding,
                       the signing actually inside and
                       outside the ground, the fact that
                       a barrier collapsed, the attitude
                       of some of the people that were

                       there, the fact that many had
                       drunk alcohol, the fact that our
                       cammnications went down.      I

                       think there were so many factors




                                                                     1 1 23
MURRAY             BERNARD D                                      209


                          that that helped to to create this.

42.56    DCS6930          He makes two other allegations

                           that you failed to control the
                          movement of supporters subsequent

                           to the opening of Gate C and that

                           you failed to respond to the

                           developing tragedy and was

                           slow to effect a rescue operation.

                           Is there anything that you wish
                           to add to those other two specific

                           allegations?

         BDM               No except, all all I would say that

43.13                      my aim and and as far as I was

                           concerned was to remove the danger
                           that existed outside the ground and

                           to relieve the pressure and the,
                           and the, the obvious hazard to those

                           people who again reports of were

                           being crushed outside the ground

                           and the opening of the gates
                           obviously relieved that but
                           caused secondary problems that
                           that I didn't foresee at the time.

         DCS6930           And is there anything else of any

                           other nature that you wish to bring

                           up with me at this point?

         BDM               No I don't think so I would say

                           that pure and simply I I'm a Police

                           Officer I do the job as best I can




                                                                        1 124

                           I ' m n o t a Superm an, I'm n o t a ,

44.01                      I thought I I could handle anything

                           and everything and as a result of
                           these, I now know I can't.              I lean

                           on my experience and my experience

                           has never brought me up against

                           anything like this before.              I've

                           always tried to my job properly
                           and I continue to do so.

44.20    DCS6930           Thank you.       The final thing that

                           I need to say to you is that
                           the the facts will be reported

                           to the Director of Public

                           Prosecutions and it will be a
                           matter for him to decide whether

                           any criminal offences have been

                           ccntmitted.       Do you understand?

         BDM               Yes.

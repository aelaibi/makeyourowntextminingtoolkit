At         approximately                        1 45 2       hours           I saw              the          exit              gates         open.           They       remained

           section           of     the    crowd            had          b e e n m a d e to c a u s e       chaos         at the       turnstiles

           so    that        persons           could        gain         entry without                  tickets.           A    large m a j o r i t y

           of    tne       crowd      that          I encountered                 after        1 4 30      hours       had been drinking                    to

           various           degrees.

           At    1505        hours        on    the       instruction               of    ground           c on t r o l    I attended           on    the

           playing           area     at       the       rear       of     the    Leppings              L a ne    goal.

           On m y      arrival            at    the       fenced           area     behind          the      goals        1 could        see    that        a

           l ar g e    number         of       persons          at       the     front        of    the c r o w d w e r e          injured          and

           that       a number            of    these          seemed          to be d ead.

           For      approximately                   40 m i n u t e s         1 assisted with                     tne m o v e m e n t     of    dead       and

           injured           persons           from       this       area        onto     the       playing          area.         I assisted

          with        tne     removal           of       a number           of    obviously dead                    persons        to    tne

          makeshift               mortuary           at     the      Hillsborough                  gymnasium.

          At     approximately                  1 60 0     hours           1 was     directed              back      to    the     turnstile          area

          at     the       r e ar    of    the W e s t          Stand where              I was           again       engaged          in a s s i s t i n g

          with        injured         and d ea d          persons.

          At     1730        hours        I attended                a de-briefing                  in    the N o r t h         Stand     a n d was

          eventually                returned           to W o o d s e a t s        Police          Station where                 I terminated

          duty        at     1900     ho u r s .

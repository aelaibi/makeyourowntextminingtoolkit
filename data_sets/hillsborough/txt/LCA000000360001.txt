 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
 regional u n i t .
  (DSS7323^89) .


                       Report of the Director of Social Services.

  introduction.

  Following the disaster in Sheffield on 15th April, 1989, various
  actions have been taken by the City Council to ensure that the
  Liverpool victims have been provided for and a separate report dealing
  specifically with Liverpool's response is under consideration. The
 .Social Services Department has continued to co-ordinate the main aspects
  of the response to the disaster in total and we have worked with the
  four other Merseyside Authorities; Lancashire, Cheshire, Nottinghamshire
  and Sheffield to achieve this co-ordination.

' PURPOSE OF THE REPORT.

.On 29th April 1989, the Leadership of these seven Councils met to
 consider the question of the continuing need for a co-ordinated response
 in the longer term and the establishment of an appropriately staffed
 unit in order to achieve this aim. The proposal for a Regional Unit
 was agreed in principle and officers were requested to prepare a more
 detailed scheme and to examine possible sources of finance for such a
 unit. On 6th September, 1989 at a further meeting of the Leadership
 of the Councils involved it was agreed that the unit be created and run
 until March 1991 at least and that the costs be underwritten by the local
 authorities involved.

'.RECOMMENDATION,

  that (a)           the City Council underwrite its proportion of the cost of the
                     Regional Unit up to a maximum of £12,500 in 1989/90 and
                     £25,000 in 1990/91;

            fb)       the Director of Social Services continue to seek funding for
                      some or all of the above resources and report on the outcome
                      in due course.

..■■b a c k g r o u n d .

  On Sunday, 16th April, officers of the Social Services Departments met
  and agreed a concerted approach to Hillsborough. Members have seen a
  resume of the action taken already. It was recognised that direct
  services to survivors and families would be provided within each Authority,
  but that certain core services could best be provided across all
  Authorities from one Unit and an outline structure was devised for the
  establishment of such a Unit.

  The Helpline has continued to provide a 24 hours/day service since
  midday on 16th and some 3,000 people have used this service from all
  over the country. With effect from 3rd October, the staffing of Helpline
  has been taken over by a voluntary organisation based at Walton Hospital.
  A Database (computerised) has been established to ensure that people are
  not either missed from service or experience intrusive visiting. This
  database will also be expanded to keep track of people involved in
  Hillghnmnnh who may be identified from other indirect sources enabling
                        —   2-


the service to take on a pro-active mode of operation. Many people
involved live outside the seven Authorities involved and co-ordination
of both information and outreach work across the country is necessary
following the experience of previous disasters.

There is a continuing need for training and staff development to tackle
this sensitive and often intensive work which exists across all of the
Authorities and has been recognised by N.W.A.S.S.A. The interest of the
media has predictably diminished following the first week and it is
necessary to engage in substantial and positive publicity. This latter
activity will be assisted by the production of a Newsletter for people
who are experiencing problems following Hillsborough. There are obviously
major administrative requirements to support the Unit and Liverpool's
other service response.                                                .

Approval has already been given to the establishment of a Counselling
Service additional to the mainstream social work provision. Plans are
finalised for the building of a permanent outreach centre near Anfield ;
to be run with maximum user involvement.

Tne services currently provided will be exceedingly difficult to maintain':;
unless some regional structure is devised which can ensure continuation •
of service provision. Staff have been diverted from their substantive
responsibilities and have carried considerably increased workloads. This>
demonstrates a high level of personal commitment, but leaves this service,:
which is crucial to the services to families and survivors, in a marginal
position. An initial appraisal of the service carried out recently shows;-'
that the uncertainty and lack of substantial co-ordination is leading to/.-v
problems and risk of breakdown.

The Leader of the Council acting in accordance with the decisions of
Council on 19th April has authorised the commitment of expenditure to
underwrite these services. The discussions and pursuit of finance will
continue and the problem has been shared and acknowledged by the other .
Local Authorities involved. To date there has      not been a positive
response from either the E.E.C. or Government.     The Government have   /•
Indicated that they are prepared to accept an application for assistance ■■
in line with the Bellwin Rules. These rules cover emergency services and
their associated costs, but the usual threshold for Government assistance
 is expenditure by a Local Authority in excess of the exclusive product   .
of a penny rate - £630,000. However there are a number of other sources
of finance which are being investigated and the Director will report on
these in due course.

The details of staffing and expenses for the establishment of a Regional
Unit are attached to the report at Appendix'a'. The question of which
Authority should undertake managerial responsibility for the Unit and
the locality in which the Unit would be established are still to be
decided.

 •PSFiFFlNG OF HILLSBOROUGH CENTRE.




                                 Report of the Director of Social Serviceg.

f''lNTO(®UCTION.

  -tnce the Disaster on 15th April, 1989, the Department has established
                in reject of Liverpool based victims in refurbished
"'Scom^ation at No.l. Anfield Road - now known as the Hillsborough Centre.
         premises accommodate the tea® of 14 Social Workers who were recruited
:: specifically to deal with victims and is also used as a Dro p - m Centre.

   wihpose o f t h e r e p o r t      .

-'.fftis report addresses the need to create substantive support staffing to
; service the Centre and ensure that administrative, reception and typ g
   services are provided to enable the Centre to operate effectively.

f,■■■r e c o m m e n d a t i o n .

X That following consultation with the Director of Personnel and Management
  Servi«s, the following posts be created at the Hillsborough Centre:-

;l (a)        Senior Assistant (Administration), Scale 5, £10,290- £11,301

v :{b)        Clerical Officer, Scale 2, £7,578 to £8,007

    (c)       Clerk/Typist, Scale 1,           £4,308 to £7,134

    (d)       Receptionist (Part-time - 20 hours per week - 2posts) Scale 2,
*:!' '        £7,578 to £8,007.

    BACKGROUND.

   •Immediately after the Disaster the City Councxl authorised the
    of Social Work staff to work with the victims of Hillsborough. A bui                g
    at No.l. Anfield Road was identified as suitable for a work base and a
   •Drop-in Centre, This building was refurbished and is now operating an
    providing a very effective centre of operations.

   -There was, of course, a need to provide support staff to undertake
   ' administrative, reception and typing duties and because of the urgency to
   ■■■open the Centre an Administrative Officer was seconded from Headquarters^
   ■."'to manage the facility. Authority was also obtained at th<5 ti.e to recru
     temporary reception and typing staff whilst a proper evaluation of the
    •Staffing required was undertaken.

     Ho» that the Centre has been in operation for some time it is clear
     the staffing needs must be formally recognised.    e   ml
     absence fro. Headquarters is causing severe                              h
     allowed to resume his normal duties. The „ork pattern at the Hillsborough
     Centre is organised on similar lines to a District Social Services Office,
     albeit the scale of operations is smaller.

      The basic requirements are:-

      Ci)           An Administrative Officer to be responsible for the day-to day
          operation of the clerical/typing/reception services at the
          Centre, This involves the creation, implementation and
          monitoring of all systems and procedures; staff management and
          development; ensuring the maintenance and security of the
          building; ordering of supplies and services and general
          responsibilities for all aspects of the administration of the
          Centre. The Director would recommend that a post of Senior
          Assistant (Admin.) Scale 5, £10,290 - £11,301, be created to under-
          take these responsibilities.

fix)      A Clerical Officer, Scale 2, £7,578 to £8,007, who would support
          the Senior Assistant (Admin.) in all aspects of his/her duties but
          in particular will ensure referrals are processed, and statistics
          of referrals and case loads are maintained and monitored.

(ill)     Two Receptionist/Telephonists (part-time, 20 hours per week)
          Scale 2, £7,578 to £8,007, who will ensure all visitors/enquiries
          to the Centre are properly and sympathetically dealt with.

(iv)      One Clerk/Typist, Scale 1, £4,308 to £7,134, who in addition to
          undertaking typing duties for the Social Work Teams will carry
          out routine clerical duti es.

(v)       In accordance with the provisions relating to the creation of the
          Social Work support team it is proposed that the above-mentioned
          posts be temporary for fixed term contracts of two years and the
          position reviewed towards the end of the two year period.

FINANCE

The cost of these proposals, including employers national insurance and
superannuation contributions, is estimated to be £11,800 in the year
1989/90 and £36,000 in 1990/91. There is no provision in the Department's
budget for these proposals and the City Council is asked to consider
giving consideration to special provision being made in a similar manner
to the arrangements made for the creation of the Social Work support team.

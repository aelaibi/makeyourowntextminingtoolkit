                 .on the yTnner         track and other              people    climbing        over the fence.

             h ine rri/j o r i ty of the              people       seemed    to me     to be watching            the     football

                 As    I got    to the L a n e         end of the          pitch ■■■■■ I saw and heard a lot of

                 supporters          shouting at            the Police       to open the        gates as         they were

                 getting       squas h e d      and that          there was too many           people     in there.

                 A small       gate was         open at       this time,       this to the            right     hand side of

                 the    goal as you            look at       it     People were        going    through this a n d               onto

                 t h e p it ch area.

                 A senior       officer at            this    time    ran onto        the    pitch and        i nf a r m e d / t h e

                 1 a s s i s t e d (/ther       officers to get            these    people     t h r o u g h JtThe gate?           but

                 as    it was       iu ite    small,        difficulty was          experienced.^/injured                  people

                 then gained access                to the         pitch area.,       Fans were         coming      from the            back
     c
U                of the      (Jrowd and walking               over    the    tops     of the    people        in front of them,

                 P o 1ice/Officers and                supporters       then began to shake               the     fencing        from

                 beh in d    t h e g o a 1 a r e a a n d I d i d also,             t h i s wa s t o e na b 1 e t h e c r o w d o f

                 fairs/to get         onto      the    pitch area the          fencing        gave way and           people were

                 the/i climbing            through.          Numerous       people     o b v iously dead were also

                 parsed through and                laid on the         pitch.         I a s s isted     in passing           the

                 fodies through              the   fenced area,
             /
       y O       Supporters          and      police    officers       had torn down the               boardings         from

                 around      the     pitch and         carrying       bodies       to the gym area.              I then started

                 to do this as there were                     too many officers              around     the goal         area.          I

                 assisted       in carrying about                  seven    people     to the gym.            Some     time      later

                 after      this when all             the    dead had gone          from the         pitch area        1 rejoined

                 my unit,       as    I had become            split    up from them.            I then went            to the

         outside   of L e p pings Lane   end. and   as Iw a l k e d   past   near   to   Che river         I

         saw about   10   dead bodies    covered up -      shortly after w a r d s       I went    back

         with my unit     to the   transit    van and went      on mobile      patrol.

         At 8 . 3 0 pm 1 went   off   duty.

Dear Lord Justice Stuart - Smith,


Thank you for your letter of 12 December 1997.

We regret any inconvenience that the late delivery of the Further Submission has caused
you. The reason for their late delivery was that they were an attempt by the Group to
develop and explain some of the specific points about the video evidence which were
raised in the private meetings in Liverpool (for example, the meeting with Mr and Mrs
Robinson, at pp4 - 5). The points were not developed in the principal submissions
because at that time we were focussing on the evidence of the subordinate officers, who
gave specific evidence about the state of the cameras. Ms Adlington and counsel were
aware that you were continuing to conduct interviews with witnesses until last week, and
we therefore considered that brief further submissions might assist with your continuing
deliberations.

The Submissions were signed by junior counsel alone simply because leading counsel was
working abroad,


Yours sincerely,




Alun Jones OC                       Julian Knowles

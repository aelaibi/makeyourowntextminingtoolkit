         R v DUCKENFIELD

         Thank you very m uch for your letter of 25 July to the Attorney General,
         which he has seen.

         The Attorney has asked me to thank you very much for your courtesy in
         keeping him informed of the position. He has seen now that a further
         prosecution will not in fact take place and there is, of course, no need for
         you to notify him formally of that fact.

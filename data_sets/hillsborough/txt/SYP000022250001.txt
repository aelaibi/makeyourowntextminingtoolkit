Dear Lord Mayor,
Civic Reception 10th May 1989
Thank you for your letter notifying me of the postponement of the
Civic Reception for those connected with the World Student Games.

I fully understand and appreciate the City of Sheffield's gesture
in making their facilities available to the inquiry into the
disaster at Hillsborough.
Being a life-long Liverpool FC supporter I was actually at the
match in seats acquired for me by friends in Sheffield,
fortunately out of harm's way.
With strong ties in both Cities I have felt the tragedy deeply and
would ask you to accept on behalf of myself and my company a
cheque towards the Hillsborough Disaster Fund.

Yours sincerely,




                                                        r



                                                        L

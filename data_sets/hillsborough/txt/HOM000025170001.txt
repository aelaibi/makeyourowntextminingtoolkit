Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

I enclose herewith the recommendations to .the Inquiry on behalf of
Sheffield City Council.                                                                                              RwvsJ

    These recommendations and suggestions have been drawn together from

    representatives with various interests within Sheffield City Council.


    They are submitted having taken time to assess the effect of the

    Hillsborough Disaster, the Inquiry and the Interim Recommendations of Lord

    Justice Taylor which are being implemented in Sheffield.
Clarification and Codification of Legislation

If the Inquiry is minded to recommend amendments of or additions to the
existing legislation then the opportunity could be taken to codify and
clarify the legislation.

The provisions, which are currently contained in the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975, the Fire Safety and Safety at Places of Sports Act 1987,
various Regulations and statutory guidance could be remodelled to create one
Act and Regulations (with functional statements) requiring certain standards
to be achieved.

Improvement/Prohibition Notices

The 1975 legislation (as amended) makes provision for the issue of a
Prohibition Notice to the holder of a certificate.  It is suggested that
consideration should be given to including an intermediate course of action.
The Health and Safety at Work, Etc. Act 1974 makes provision of the issue of
Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices. An Improvement Notice requires
the employer to carry out certain works within a given time.  If the
employer fails to comply with the Notice, they are guilty of an offence.

The power to issue Improvement Notices would be a useful intermediate step
where a Prohibition Notice is not appropriate, but where some formal Notice
is required.

Periodic Certificates and Inspections

The Popplewell Report recommended (at paragraph 3.68) that there should be
(i) annual renewal of safety certificates issued under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975; (ii) a duty on the local authority annually to inspect the
premises prior to re-issuing the certificate; and (iii) power for the local
authority to revoke the certificate.

The interim recommendations compliment the first proposal; the second
recommendation was implemented in statutory guidance after the Popplewell
Report; the third recommendation has not been acted upon.

With regard to the fiifst recommendation, annual certificates focus the
parties' minds on the whole situation and not on a particular application or
inspection.  It tends to promote an overall review of the circumstances
surrounding the re-issue of a certificate.

With regard to the second recommendation, it is suggested that prior to
re-issuing the certificate there should be an inspection, but that there
should also be inspections on a half-yearly or quarterly basis with guidance
given as to timing, e.g., prior to renewal, end of season, start of season,
during season (obviously this is less relevant to multi-use stadia where
"seasons" are not as clear cut.)

Visits to the ground should be carried out whilst it is empty and during use
but the limitations on "during use" inspections by their very nature must be
recognised.

Model Safety Certificate Conditions

The Popplewell report (paragraph 3.81) suggested that model safety
certificate conditions should be drawn up. A standardised form of
conditions could form the nucleus of all certificates.   Additional
conditions could be added to cover local conditions.   This would enable some
                                       Page 3


     degree of national uniformity of application of conditions.  It would seem
     appropriate, that the Home Office draw up the standard conditions as it has
     done in respect of byelaws for example.

5.   Resource Implications - Fees

     At present it is suggested in Circular No. 72/1987 that the statutory
     inspection should not result in significant resource implications but that
     in general inspections are not expected to take more than about two man days
     per ground.  This point is made in the context of emphasising the scope of
     inspections, together with associated report work and are not intended to be
     as detailed or extensive as that often required by the holder of the
     certificate.

     Clearly, more time is spent on safety of sports grounds than the Home Office
     anticipates.  The resource implications involved for local authorities and
     their advisers from other services to implement the existing provisions and
     the new recommendations must be recognised.

     Although the certificating authority is allowed to charge fees for dealing
     with applications for the issue or amendment of a certificate (by virtue of
     the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976) there is no express provision
     for fees for the ongoing work of enforcing the provisions of the Act and
     dealing with inspections that have to be carried out at least once a year.
     The Inquiry may wish to consider whether express provisions should be made
     to allow a certificating authority to make some reasonable charge.  There
     are many examples of legislation where local authorities are empowered to
     charge a reasonable fee to cover the cost of administering and enforcing a
     particular licensing function.

6.   Definition of Roles

     The Popplewell Report recommended that there should be urgent consultation
     between the Health and Safety Executive and the Fire Authorities and Local
     Authorities as how best to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and
     reports (paragraph 3.95).

     It has again become clear during the Inquiry that a lack of clarity in the
     definition of roles, as well as a lack of communication, can cause problems.
     This is particularly relevant in relation to the Police who are involved in
     the safety.of sports grounds in a number of roles, e.g. a member of the
     Advisory Group, upholders of law and order and their role inside and outside
     the Ground.  It is also relevant to consider if and at what point in an
     emergency the role of the safety officer is subsumed by the emergency
     services.

     Clarification, following consultation, is needed of the different roles
     Authorities are required to fulfil and the means of communication between
     them.

7.   The Advisory Group                  â€”

     The Police and the Building Authority and, for metropolitan districts
     subsequent to local government reorganisation, the Police and the Fire
     Authority, have to be consulted by the certificating authority by virtue of
     the legislation.  Sheffield City Council have included officers from the
     Building Authority and Health and Consumer Services in their Advisory Group
     prior to this Inquiry.
                                           Page 4


         The legislation therefore, provides the basis of expert opinion on which the
         Local Authority makes decisions.

         The decision making process can take a number of forms, but perhaps the two
         extremes are:-

         (a) where all the experts are in agreement that decision is delegated to an
         officer of the Council, where one or more experts differ - that decision is
         delegated to an appropriate committee of the Council;

         (b) the appropriate committee considers all matters relating to works
         carried out at the sports ground.

         Further guidance could be given over and above that contained in the interim
         recommendations as to the preferred course of action.

          In addition to the statutory consultees, together with those recommended in
^        the Interim Report, i.e.,   the Ambulance Service, the Club and the recognised
P        Supporters' Club, consideration should be given as to whether any other
         bodies should be involved in the wider Advisory Group, e.g., Health and
         Safety Executive.

         It may also be necessary to have a consultation group consisting of Police,
         Fire, Building Authority, Environmental Health, Ambulance Service in
         addition to the wider Advisory Group.

         Members should be able to have professional advice from officers.

8.       Pooling of Information

         Some consideration should be given to pooling information   on a national
         basis to improve the flow of that information.               .

         Information should be available to all certificating Authorities and their
         statutory consultees.  This would assist to achieve a degree of uniformity
         throughout the country and enable all Authorities to learn from each others
         experiences.

         This is particularly relevant to regional level where the emergency services
         will cover a number of District Authorities.

    9.   Safety Management and Safety Planning

         Sports ground management and promoters must accept safety as essential
         aspects of their business and not an adjunct to it. It is essential for
         safety responsibilities to be clearly identified and for systems of
         accountability to be included. Any regulations or the "Green Guide" could
         usefully develop this theme. The term safety planning is preferable to that
         of emergency planning in that it makes clear to everyone that the process of
         safety planning is exactly that and an appropriate safety plan should
         promote better safety standards. All relevant agencies should be included
         in the planning process.  Safety planning is aimed to prevent disasters as
         well as providing contingency plans to ensure emergencies and disasters can
         be coped with.

10.      Status and Content of the "Green Guide"

         A comprehensive review of the status and content of the Green Guide is
         required.  The present guide to safety of sports grounds is predominantly
         written for football single use stadia. Multi use stadia are becoming more
                                  Page 5


popular and it is suggested that the guide be expanded to cover spectator
safety requirements pertaining to a wider variety of sports, e.g., speedway,
stock car racing, hockey, archery, shooting, etc. and other potentially
dangerous activities.

In addition, either by expansion of the guide or by the creation of a
similar document, requirements for spectator safety of fully enclosed stadia
should be created.

"Flexibility"

The 1986 edition of the Green Guide, paragraph 6, states as follows:-

"Deviations from individual guidelines are possible without necessarily
detracting from the overall safety of the ground.  The variety of type,
function and layout of sports grounds means that a flexible approach should
be maintained to take account of the particular circumstances at individual
grounds".

And paragraph 8 states:-

"It should be borne in mind when using the guide to assess whether existing
circumstances provide adequately for the safety of spectators the criteria
to be aimed for is that of a reasonable degree of safety.  It would be
unreasonable, even if it were practical, to seek the absolute safety of
everyone attending a ground".

And, again in paragraph 11:-

"The principles referred to in paragraphs 4-10 above should be kept in mind
by both ground management and, where applicable, by the local authority when
applying the guide to an individual ground. The guide is an aid to, not a
substitute for, professional judgment and common sense".

There is a problem in affording the Green Guide this kind of status. What
is "flexibility" to one mind may be slap-dash permissiveness to another.
Clearly, emphasis on flexibility was and is well intentioned, but the effect
is to produce a code that is not applied tightly and where non-compliance
can be justified as falling within the scope of some flexible discretion
allowed to the relevant authority.

For the future perhaps the Inquiry would wish to consider recommending that
the approach of the Green Guide should move away from that of "flexibility"
to, for example, an approach of the following kind:-

"That the certificating authority, and where appropriate the club itself,
should always seek to establish whether there is some reasonable cause why a
relevant guideline is not complied with, and that in the absence of some
such reasonable cause emerging then compliance with the guideline should be
achieved or insisted upon".  A recommendation not to comply with a relevant
guideline should be in writing and approved by the certificating authority.
If such a decision is considered by the relevant committee of the Council
then the public will have access to that information.

Parts of the existing guide could become regulatory and other parts
re-issued (in a revised form) as a guide c f . the majority of the Approved
Documents to the Building Regulations or an "Approved Code of Practice" cf.
status of an approved code of practice under the Health and Safety at Work,
Etc., Act 1974.  In the case of documents similar to the Building
Regulations compliance would therefore not be necessary, yet failure to
                                        Page 6


      comply with the Guide could be taken as being evidence tending to show that
      the requirements had not been met, unless it could be demonstrated by the
      party concerned, using other means, that the requirements of the legislation
      had been satisfied.

11.   Specific Recommendations in relation to the Structure and Design
      Requirements for a Sports Ground

      General Fabric

      It is recommended that the headroom for tunnels be increased from 2.4 metres
      to at least 3 metres to facilitate overhead viewing of any crushing or other
      problems occuring along its length.

      Due to the possible risk of explosion, it is suggested that gas
      installations should not be permitted in any building in the stadia used for
      spectator accommodation,  cf. tower blocks.

^     To cater for different speeds of travel through tunnels or restricted
      passageways longer than, say, 5 metres, a minimum of 4 units of exit width
      should be provided.

      Ingress

      Segregation of entrances for supporters of opposing teams is recommended as
      a permanent design criteria.

      Permanent unobstructed access to the pitch area for emergency vehicles to be
      provided in at least two positions, and these being at opposite ends of the
      ground (whenever possible).

      The "guide" states a maximum notional rate of 750 persons per turnstile per
      hour, however it does not state the design time, i.e., the time within which
      all spectators are capable of being admitted.  It is suggested that a
      revised code should state a maximum ingress design time of say, 45 minutes.
      For multi use stadia, in particular, investigation of the flow rate should
      be carried out as rates may differ, e.g., for families with young children.

      Terraces

      Where terraces are to be sub-divided so as to avoid major migration and
      sideways surge, each section should be formed by inserting radial barriers.
      Radial fences should be avoided.

      It is considered that spectator accommodation should not be lower than the
      pitch level or pitch perimeter path level (whichever is the higher), so that
      spectators do not have to step up from the spectator accommodation.
      In the present "guide", it states "gradients steeper than 1:2 (26Â°, 34')
      could be dangerous" (paragraph 94).  In Table 1 barrier requirements are
      specified for terrace gradients of up to 30Â° or 1:1.7, therefore
      contradicting the previous statement. From a graphical interpolation and
      extrapolation of all the relevant data the maximum gradient should be 31Â°,
      30'.  This equates to approximately 1:1.63.

      Crush Barriers - Design

      To avoid rusting in unseen and non-maintainable places, overclipped barrier
      rail supports should no longer be acceptable. All parts of barriers should
      be capable of direct inspection and maintenance.
                                        Page 9


      when people are very tightly packed, their ability to flow through exits is
      dramatically reduced. Until the outcome of further research is known, it is
      suggested that flow rates are reduced to the following:-

      (a)   "Peak viewing area" of terraces - 30 persons per minute per unit of
            exit width.

      (b)   All other areas - 40 persons per minute per unit of exit width.

      It is considered that the emergency evacuation time should remain at 2i
      minutes.

12.   Stewards

      Training of Stewards should be carried out by people who have experience in
      training and safety.  Training should be regular to remind existing Stewards
      of procedures and ensure that new Stewards receive appropriate training.

^     The acceptable age range for Stewards should be specified as being between
W     eighteen and sixty five years, in addition to the current requirements
       relating to fitness etc.

      A Steward (or a police officer) carrying out isolated tasks, e.g. external
      gate duty, should be provided with an efficient means of communication with
      the Safety Officer.

13.   National First Aid Guidelines

      There is the need for national first aid guidelines which are drawn up with
      particular reference to occasions when large numbers of people are likely to
      be present, e.g.  football matches, pop concerts etc.

      It is also important for the individuals expected to provide first aid to
      receive appropriate training.

14.   Counselling and Support for Victims

      Substantial knowledge and experience now exists about the services the
      public and those directly affected by a disaster need afterwards.    These
      responses are informed by an understanding of the potentially long-term
      needs of victims.  Initiatives must be taken immediately after the disaster
      without waiting for requests for help and be available for a period of at
      least two years. Their establishment and co-ordination with the voluntary
      sector and between statutory organisations needs to be undertaken on the
      basis of an agreed general plan.  The services have to be carefully
      provided, managed and last appropriate lengths of time, if the bereaved,
      survivors and rescue staff are not to suffer lasting damage.   These
      co-ordinated services are expensive to provide and outside of the normal
      provision made by local authorities.  Therefore their establishment and
      continuance is dependent on new and additional resources being made
      available.  Such separate funding needs to be made available.

15.   Public Appeals

      The legal issues surrounding public appeals are complicated, e.g. charitable
      status, tax etc. Guidelines are required on the establishment,
      administration and termination of disaster appeals to ensure that funds are
      distributed as fairly, quickly and effectively as possible.
If pitch perimeter fences are to remain, it is suggested that at least 50%
of its linear length is openable and such openings are evenly spaced so as
to provide maximum benefit for spectators' safety.

Where pitch side police or stewards require access into the spectator area
through relatively small doors or gates, these may be provided as additional
openings or as wicket gates in the large opening panels.

So as to avoid sudden forward movement, all such gates should be vertically
multi-hinged and open towards the pitch.  Collapsible panels should not be
acceptable.  It is a further pre-requisite that the release mechanism should
b e :-

a) capable of being operational remotely in tandem with others;

b) capable of independent opening whilst under crowd pressure, by the
   operation of a quick release, manually operated catch;

c) all opening devices must be capable of   use under crowd loading
   conditions.

In order to simplify any new designs of catch for pitch perimeter gates and
bearing in mind the fact that there should be no spectators on the pitch
side of the opening sections of the perimeter fencing, test loading on
perimeter fences could be reduced to, say 3 KN/m.

Estimation of Space Capacity - Terraces

Under the present "guide", terraces in good condition can be calculated as
capable of holding a maximum of 54 persons per 10 m ^ , throughout the
available terraced area.  It is, however, accepted that some parts of that
area are "peak viewing areas" and as such will achieve in practice agreater
population density due to their popularity.  The figure of 54/10 m^ is
therefore an average, without the peak viewing parts being given a maximum
packing density.

It is considered that the 54/10 m^ should be treated as being the maximum
and therefore only be applied to the areas of peak viewing.  Other areas of
the terrace should be*calculated as having a lower packing density, say
40/10 m2.

In order to practically achieve the consideration set out in the above
paragraph, it would be necessary to:-

(a)   Define the size and position of "peak viewing areas".

(b)   Surround the areas of "peak viewing" using radial barriers as opposed
      to radial fences.

(c)   Determine by effective stewarding or policing that the crowd density
      of each "peak viewing area" is at a satisfactory, safe and comfortable
      level.

Flow Rates

Throughout the Inquiry, the flow rate of 40 and 60 persons per minute per
unit of exit width have been heavily criticised as being based on
inconclusive research.. A practical lesson that has been learned is that
                                   Page 7


Welding of all joints would achieve the aims set out in the above paragraph
and will create a structural continuity where the failure of an individual
element would minimise the risk of collapse.

Consideration should be given to the application of horizontal, (in addition
to lateral) forces.  This could be taken as 5% of the horizontal force thus
resisting torsional and secondary effects.

The recommended heights of the barrier rails should be re-assessed.
Clarification is also required (preferably by sketch) to show where this
measurement should be taken from. The present "guide" appears to make an
assumption that the barrier rail is in the same vertical plane as the
terrace riser. When these vertical planes differ, the method of height
measurement may also differ.  The acid test being at what level a normal
person would stand who was comfortable, immediately behind the barrier.

The opportunity should be taken to re-appraise the required test and design
loads. An increase would achieve a greater resistance to collapse but may
increase the risk of injury due to resisting greater crowd pressures. A
decrease, however, may result in earlier collapse, yet may prevent fatal
injury.

Crush Barriers - Testing

It is suggested that each barrier span should be tested separately (for rail
strength) and then adjacent spans be tested together to determine rail and
support strength.

The specification of the test should be modified to clearly state how
recovery deflection is to be calculated.  Such a modification should be in
accordance with the testing procedures in BS 5950 and other similar British
Standard documents.

To avoid any further doubt, a standardised test specification and procedure
is now required. This should include a specification of a standardised
testing rig and a standardised test result sheet.

Stands with seated accommodation

Although steeper gradients can create better forward viewing for the
spectators, very steep gradients will have the effect of creating equally
steep radial gangways and may create a domino effect during an evacuation
where all persons may be stood - instead of being seated.  No maximum
gradient is directly stated in the present guide for seated areas; the only
tenuous reference being to the maximum calculated gradient for stairways in
paragraph 73 as being 34Â°,9'.  It is considered that seated accommodation
greater than 30Â° should have intermediate crush barriers at approximately 5
metre centres.

Pitch Perimeter Fences

The Popplewell Report (paragraph 4.136 to 4.138 and also Appendix 'E ',
paragraph E29) recommended that consideration should be given to the design
of a standard efficient perimeter fence, with proper exits.

As a direct result of the Hillsborough disaster it has been suggested that
spectators may feel reassured by the possibility of forward escape onto the
pitch from all sides of the ground.

16.    Pre-Match Entertainment

       Further to recommendation 25 in the Interim Report, consideration should be
       given as to whether pre-match entertainment and associated activities can
       influence the type of crowd attending football matches (in particular) and
       for example can therefore be used to encourage family attendance.  Such
       entertainment may also result in staggered entry times.

17 .   Day and Time

       Consideration should also be given to what effect changing the day and/or
       time of kick off of football matches, in particular, may have on crowd
       behaviour and therefore crowd safety.

18.    Football Membership Schemes - I.D. Cards

       The Popplewell Report recommends (at paragraph 4.128) that consideration
^      should be given to some form of membership scheme for football league clubs
W      in England and Wales.

       However, in view of the experiences at Hillsborough, careful consideration
       needs to be given to any national football membership scheme.  It would
       clearly be undesirable if any such scheme resulted in significant delays at
       turnstiles.

       There are other practical considerations which must be taken into account,
       e.g., patterns of attendance, different method of entry, space required for
       a complex admission system, i.e., two turnstile systems, number of
       turnstiles required, additional policing/stewarding required to control the
       crowd and eject individuals, where to eject individuals from and how and
       reducing further the ground capacity.

19.    All Ticket Entry

       In order to increase the speed of ingress of spectators, consideration could
       be given to requiring all ticket entry for events where greater than, say,
       70% of the total available capacity could be expected.

CROWD CONTROL AND MEMBERSHIP AT FOOTBALL:

A SURVEY OF POLICE OFFICERS WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR

POLICING FOOTBALL MATCHES IN ENGLAND AND WALES



1.     Introduction



1.1      This    short       paper      provides            an     analysis         of     a    survey      of

senior     police      officers with responsibility                        for     policing         Football

League grounds.          The      survey       was conducted in 1988.                    In all, replies

were received from             officers        at     90     out of the 92          possible grounds.

Most replies came from officers in charge                            of     crowd        control      at the

clubs concerned, though a number                      were        returned       by Football Liaison

and other officers (see Tables 2 and 3).                             Some        forces,       of    course,

have     responsibility           for     policing          more     than one ground.                In these

cases, a return was made for each                          ground,        taking into account the

particular policing problems                   that they face.              This excellent level of

return     is due, in no small measure, to the co-operation                                    the     Centre

received from         ACPO       in compiling and distributing the questionnaire.

We are grateful for              their        support,       particularly for the assistance

given     to    us    by     David       Phillips,          the      then-Secretary            of the ACPO

sub-committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events.



1.2      The     survey      covers       a     wide        range         of      issues         concerning

contemporary          policing       methods         at     football.            However,        there is a

particular        focus      -    and     we        shall     concentrate          on     this       in    this

preliminary document - on the issue of club membership.                                        The question

of     membership is, of course,                 prominent           in    present        debates         about

football        and    its       future       (May     1989)       following        the        Government's

introduction of            the    Football Spectators Bill and the Taylor Inquiry
                                                                                                                  2




into the causes of the Hillsborough disaster.



1.3    The     data            provided        here         deal      with      police        views        on   the

usefulness and                 effectiveness              of partial membership schemes and also

look forward to                what     they regard          as    the    potential benefits                    and

drawbacks          of     a     comprehensive              national       membership          scheme and the

possibility of an away fans 'ban'. Ideally,                                    this    information should

be    considered               alongside the responses from fans and                          clubs        on   the

membership issue.                The Centre           has     already          produced       reports on the

views of club officials on the partial v                                 national membership debate,

and has also conducted surveys of football fans for                                       their       views      on

membership.               (A     full list of Centre publications is included at the

back of this document.)



2.    The Survey Findings



2.1      There           follow         some         summary         statements          on      the        survey

findings,          and some comments from police officers on specific aspects

of the        membership              and     crowd       control issues covered by the survey.

When     asked           about        the     general       effects        of         partial     schemes         on

hooliganism and crowd behaviour at their                                 particular           clubs, 23% (21)

of our respondents felt these effects had been                                    positive        compared to

only     7%        (6)     who        argued        that the local scheme had                  produced         only

negative           outcomes.            The        bulk     of our       respondents,          however,         felt

partial        membership              had produced neither                a    positive        nor    negative

impact        on     these issues.                 Perhaps such observations are unsurprising

given the short                 length        of     time most schemes have been in operation

and    the requirement of locating partial                                membership          initiatives         as

part of        a     longer           term     package        of     measures         designed        to    reduce

hooliganism.
                                                                                                            3




2.2    On      the    question           of      the     siting         of         membership        areas,

exactly one-third of our respondents                          thought        the     local    scheme was

located       in     the best possible place, but 10 (11%)                           respondents         felt

membership areas in               the     grounds       for     which they had responsibility

were not well sited (see Table 4).                           Generally        speaking,          the latter

respondents          were    of     the        view    that     their own club had introduced

membership areas with no real intention of using them constructively.

As one reply from the Second Division put it:



       I believe this one, like the majority of clubs, has complied
       with a scheme to cause as little inconvenience as possible
       and so as not to reduce income from placing restrictions on
       paying customers.   The area chosen,    apart from seating
       accommodation, was the least popular area of enclosure. The
       club is quite willing to suspend the membership scheme when
       there is an attractive fixture if its retention would harm
       the gate.


2.3      On    the      issue      of     changes        in    policing        arrangements           inside

the    ground following the introduction                        of    membership,            around        45%

(41)     of     our     replies indicated that members                       areas        required       fewer

police        officers.      11 (12%) required very few, or                         no,     officers       and

supervisory duties              were      taken        up,    in     some     cases,        by club-hired

security        staff       (see    Table 5).           However, almost half of                  those     who

replied reported that, at                     least     at    this      early stage of membership

arrangements, the introduction of members areas had had little effect

on policing practice.



 2.4   Almost         30%    (26)        of    those replying reported                 that      membership

 had, in their view, improved the                       situation with respect to combating

 hooliganism          inside       the        ground    (see Table 6).               In    the     words    of

 an officer at a First Division club from London:
                                                                                                    4




       Because of major rebuilding work and space being more
       limited than in 1987/88, the club has found a     'healthy
       membership' can solve many interim problems of segregation
       and policing, particularly on high profile games.


From    the     Third     Division,        one   respondent reported that he had 'no

doubt that the scheme has made a positive contribution to our efforts

to combat hooliganism'.



Only one      reply indicated that membership had made hooliganism inside

the ground more of a problem, though                     6     out    of        10    of     our replies

suggested        that      partial       schemes        were     largely             irrelevant to the

direct     issue    of     reducing        hooliganism.              (This is an issue we also

raise in our report on Membership                  at        Professional            Football Clubs).

A number of comments on this score raise the                          problem           of    the   local

determination       of such schemes.             From the police at a Midlands' First

Division club, for example, came the view that:



       Whilst even individual clubs are allowed to determine the
       scheme we will get diluted and ineffective schemes which in
       no way address the issues.    The 50% rule has not been
       seriously addressed by the club because        no sanctions
       have been forthcoming.    Legislation is necessary if the
       Government wish to take on the football authority and impose
       a common unanimous standard on membership schemes.


In similar vein, the officer in charge of                        crowd          control       at a small

Fourth     Division        club     felt    that     his local club had done little to

encourage       fans      to    become     members       and         that        there       was    little

external        pressure to make the club               introduce           a    scheme       which     did

much     more      than        fulfill     the   formal        requirements             of    Government

directives.        According to this officer:



        At present, members are offered no incentives to join the
        scheme and the club have taken a less than positive approach
        to the concept.   The scheme requires more impetus by the
        club, with    tangible   benefits   to create the correct
        atmosphere for persons to join.   The existing scheme simply
        does enough to satisfy the Football League, without any real
        intention to improve it further.


Other      officers,       who    were        similarly       concerned        by   the    lack      of

effectiveness         of     schemes,           argued        that      clubs       were     lax     in

distinguishing        between      members           and non-members and that,              in     some

cases, membership areas were                  not     even insulated from the activities

of hooligans.       In relation          to     this        last point, over 9 out of 10 of

our     respondents        favoured      a     photograph          on   membership        cards (see

Table     12).    The reason for this, according to                      one    respondent         with

First Division responsibilities, is that:



        The main problem with the membership scheme presently is the
        lack of  identification of the person in possession of the
        card when he arrives at the ground - we consider a
        photograph essential and some type of embargo of the member
        if he becomes involved in hooliganism etc.



At a     Second    Division        club not noted for its hooligan problems, the

officer in charge of crowd control was clearly disappointed that:



        At present, membership cards can be purchased on the day of
        a   match   which,  potentially,  allows hooligan visiting
        supporters the opportunity to infiltrate members areas.   No
        checks are carried out on an applicant.  Therefore, although
        there has been no evidence of this to date, there is nothing
        which deters individuals from making multiple applications.


Problems of       enforcing        and       monitoring        membership seem to have been

even more difficult at one Fourth Division                           club.      Here, a number of

 loopholes on membership - undoubtedly also                          common     elsewhere        - were

 pointed to by the officer in charge in order to show the obstacles to

 producing any membership             plan          which    can     be regarded as absolutely

 watertight.      We are unsure how widespread the                      practices         referred to

 below might be or what the evidence is to                          support such claims.            This

 particular       officer        commented that the membership scheme was a 'good
                                                                                                   6




idea1 but that it had,



           been allowed to be watered down by all and sundry.    Too
       many fiddles are involved     in flouting the scheme both by
       players giving free tickets to their criminal friends who
       then pass them on to other villains and        so on and, I
       believe, club directors passing on tickets.   This means that
       nobody has any control over the distribution of a large
       number    of    tickets.    This  immediately    flouts   the
       membership scheme.    There is no doubt in my mind that
       players are knowingly passing on tickets to groups of
       troublemakers well knowing their pedigree.


2.5     Only   1    in    10 of the officers who                were       surveyed      felt   that

the introduction         of    partial       membership         schemes had had a positive

effect on hooliganism outside the ground                       (see    Table       7).     A senior

officer in charge of the affairs of a club in                          a    small northern town

admitted in this connection that, as far as 'his' club was concerned,



       Membership take-up has not met expectations and we have
       probably 500-1,000    troublemakers penned in, with 5,000
       problem free non-members.     We have to address ourselves to
       outside violence.    Because   we   police the grounds very
       well, the venue for violence is now elsewhere,    but usually
       the nearby town centre.      It is important that football is
       not blamed for that.   It is now appearing in rugby as well.


The officers in charge of two smaller clubs in smaller northern towns

also    spoke of the          difficulties         of    coping       with    problems       outside

the ground     and       of    the    lack    of        any noticeable positive effect of

partial    membership          on    restricting          or    controlling        the activities

especially         of     away       fans     outside          grounds.       In      both      these

accounts, too, the perceived role of alcohol loomed large.


        The main problems are with away supporters who arrive early,
        cause trouble in the city,      often under the influence of
        drink and then require policing at the ground and escorting
        away at the conclusion of the event.   If their ability were
        restricted to gain entry because they needed to be members
        and powers of arrest were available these problems would be
        minimised.  If this becomes a national system, removal of
        membership cards would replace Exclusion Orders,   a system
        which is proving difficult to enforce/administer.
                                                                                                                 7




      The policing commitment to football matches is greater
      before and after the match than it is during a match, and
      hooliganism   within the stadium has been substantially
      eliminated.   The cause for greatest concern is supporters
      travelling to and from matches and    in particular in the
      immediate vicinity of the ground.       Alcohol, in spite of
      recent legislation, is still of major concern and adversely
      affects behaviour.



2.6      On      the          issue        of       trends           in     levels           of       hooliganism

inside and outside grounds, it                         was       interesting           to     note      that          our

sample of largely senior officers with experience of crowd control at

football        felt     that,        on        balance,         hooliganism           inside         grounds was

decreasing        -     one     respondent             pointed         to      a 48%        fall      in    arrests

inside     the        ground at his club since                      membership            was      introduced           -

but it was much more divided on trends outside                                        (see Table 15).                1 in

5     respondents             thought            hooliganism                outside          was      increasing,

though     the        same     proportion              argued       that       the        trend     was      in       the

opposite         direction.                Such         replies           indicate,          of     course,           how

important        local trends and the patterns of performance of particular

clubs (relegation,              promotion              etc)      are      in        determining        the           local

experience        of     hooligan           activities.                Around         1 in 10 of our sample

replied that hooliganism is not, and                                never       has       been,       a problem at

their particular club.                     This        is     the      kind of statistic which might

provoke       either         celebration           or       depression              within      the        ranks        of

the     game,          depending           upon the         'public         temperature' regarding the

hooliganism issue, i.e. optimism because there are clubs which appear

to have little or no hooliganism, or pessimism because such clubs are

 so few in number.             Finally, 1 in                 5   respondents              were of the opinion

 that     the         introduction              of partial          schemes         had     provided         a       very

 important              and      positive contribution                         to      effective           policing

 inside       grounds.          Only        1     in    20       respondents           felt        the same could

 be said with respect to the situation outside (see Table 14).
                                                                                                       8




2.7      Question       8     of    the   questionnaire          invited       our         sample     to

comment on the effects of membership on                     a    range of issues connected

with     the     policing      and management of football crowds.                     On     none     of

these issues did a simple                 majority    of police officers feel that the

introduction             of partial       schemes     had       improved      their        situation,

though     it     is perhaps especially encouraging that around 4 out of 10

officers felt that            membership       had     improved       police       relations with

orderly        fans,    and    almost       half     the sample felt          membership           areas

allowed the concentration of police resources on 'trouble spots'                                    (see

Table 8).        In addition to this,              3 out of 10 were of the opinion that

the introduction of membership had had a                        generally      positive        effect

on     reducing levels         of         hooliganism.           A    good    example        of these

positive        effects       comes   from     the     Fourth        Division.        One     of     our

respondents from this division reported that,



       Here we have a free membership scheme allowing members-only
       access to certain areas of the ground.  The scheme has had a
       marked effect on weeding out potential hooligans who were
       beginning to establish themselves amongst young supporters.


Another        set       ofpositive         comments        came      from    an     officer        with

responsibilities              for     a     Second     Division        club    where        in-ground

arrangements           - for the police at least - had obviously improved as a

result of the introduction of a membership scheme.



        Two complete sides of the ground are open only to members.
        The result is that the majority of hooligans, who are
        non-members, now have to stand on the Kop at the opposite
        side of the ground to visiting supporters. General effects
        are positive.


On a     rather        more    negative      note,     especially given present debates

about the possible effects a national membership scheme might have on

entry     into       grounds,       especially in the light             of    the     Hillsborough
disaster, 11% of our           sample      were      of    the view that partial schemes

worsened     the     situation regarding the entry of supporters                       into    the

ground.     In general        terms,       partial        schemes were seen as having the

least     positive     effects        in    relation        to   control     and     segregation

outside     the     ground,     reducing          police     costs     and       dealing      with

visiting     fans.      We were faced, however, with examples where partial

schemes      were      held      to        have      increased        the        potential     for

hooliganism even inside           grounds.          At one Fourth Division ground, for

example,



        The club has decided that access to three-quarters of the
        ground is limited to members.    Non-members must utilise a
        caged area (for away fans) or be accommodated   in a stand
        adjacent to it. The general effect has been to force some
        of our 'undesirables'  into the stand adjacent to away fans.
        This also means that they can mingle with away fans in the
        stand.  This creates a problem where none existed.     There
        have been no beneficial effects evident so far.


Elsewhere in Division Four, another respondent complained that,



        The membership area contains a substantial number of young
        children who are largely unsupervised.    Since there is no
        perimeter fencing to this area, pitch invasions often occur.


Such     schemes     also     seemed       largely        ineffective       in    keeping     known

hooligans     from     matches,        prompting           an    officer in charge of crowd

control at a First Division London club to comment that,



        Membership schemes will only work      if   there is 100%
        membership, as the troublemakers will not otherwise join,
        and will   still be able to enter the ground.   The present
        membership scheme contains only persons      who cause no
        problems anyway, and having designated membership areas on
        the terracing could cause a 'lock-out' situation at busy
        games which are not 'ALL TICKET'.


An officer in charge of crowd control                      at    a   Second Division club in

the     Midlands     felt     that     the introduction of a scheme had increased
                                                                                  10




his problems of segregation.      He commented:



        The general effects are that a third group of spectators to
        segregate has been created and (there are) some expressions
        of discontent from fans against the scheme,    because they
        cannot use the parts of the ground that they wish to.



Other respondents, this time with         Third     Division     responsibilities,

found     the   purported   anti-hooligan      element    of    the   50%    approach

difficult to reconcile with their           own     experiences.      Were    partial

schemes     about   hooliganism   at    all?      Here are the views of three of

them,



        The membership scheme at present is nonsensical.       It is
        approximately 50% of the total crowd allowed into the
        ground,  and   approximately    50% of the space for the
        spectators.  Consequently,   if a person has his membership
        taken away, he walks round the corner and enters in a
        non-membership area.   The only    'threat' is that he cannot
        stand with his mates.


        The scheme has had a very limited effect and excluded
        troublesome supporters from vulnerable areas.     However, it
        is limited and open to abuse.    It has not achieved the
        exclusion of the hooligan element.   Essentially a number of
        respectable supporters now have membership cards.


        The membership scheme here  is restricted              to families and
        known supporters.    We do not have 100%               membership and
        hooliganism has never been a problem with              this class of
        supporter.




On   the issue of using      membership     schemes      to    cope   with   visiting

fans -     even when matches are all-ticket - one officer in charge of a

Second Division Midlands       club    was very sceptical following a recent

visit from Leeds United fans.          He told us,


        To enforce membership schemes for visiting supporters is
        very difficult.  For example, when this club played Leeds
        Utd in 1987 the strategy was not to allow visitors into the
        ground without a ticket and a club membership card.    Less
                                                                                                      11




       than 10% of the 3,000 Leeds supporters were 'card carriers'.
       To have denied access to the remainder would have presented
       potentially more problems in terms of public disorder.


We suspect there would be                   some     degree       of      support from many of our

respondents, at least in broad terms, for the sentiments expressed by

an officer in charge of crowds at a Second Division club in the south

of    England.        He    commented           in    the       following way about membership

arrangements in his locale:



       The scheme as it is at this club is felt to have had no
       effect.   The major impact on crowd behaviour has been firm
       policing, right from the beginning of their first season in
       Division 2.  I cannot see much improvement in the future,
       except through an education process coupled with the clubs
       carrying out improvements to their grounds and providing
       more entertainment value.


        Membership schemes  in isolation do not hold the complete
        answer - witness the behaviour of Luton supporters away from
        home.


2.8       Despite          the       rather     discouraging            news           from a    number     of

areas     on    the    effects            of    partial         schemes,           8    out of    10 of    our

respondents       professed               themselves       to     be    in     favour       of membership

arrangements,         though          a     small number of those were                    not    in   favour

of such arrangements                 at     their    own        clubs I      (See Table 11.)          Again,

this     sort    of finding is not necessarily                         contradictory,            given     the

ground layout and            location           of    clubs       and        the       kind of scheme      now

in operation at many.                 On this last point, we invited our respondents

to comment on a range of membership options.                                 Around one-third of the

replies         favoured         a    partial        scheme,       though          not    necessarily        on

the lines of the ones currently in use.                            More significantly, perhaps,

almost     one     half      of our respondents opted for a 100% scheme with 16

 (18%) officers favouring a Luton-style 'home only' arrangement.                                           Only

7 (8%) respondents opposed                     schemes      of     any kind at their club.                   In

 some cases, this opposition was clearly tied                                 to       the status and size
                                                                                                  12




of    the     club    and also brought forth a relatively                   common        complaint

about the present schemes:              the        case   of     the   congested non-members

area,       while space remains in members sections.                    Thus, one respondent

in charge       of    policing     at     a    Fourth      Division club was at pains to

remind us that,



        The average home gate for this club for the 1987/88 season
        would be around the 2,500 mark.  The ground capacity at the
        present time is 6,800.    Whilst I appreciate that there may
        be some benefit in the introduction of such schemes for the
        First and Second Division clubs who regularly enjoy good
        gates,  the benefit to a Fourth Division club which has
        always struggled to attract fans is somewhat diluted.     If
        specific areas are segregated for use by members only, this
        can lead to other areas of the ground becoming congested
        when, at the same time,  the membership area may be quite
        empty.  This could cause undue frustration to football fans.


In    the     same    way,    another         contributor        with Fourth Division crowd

control to contend with commented simply that,



        It is a small club with commensurate ideas.   Any additional
        work on membership schemes etc stretches staff. The ground
        imposes the best control; away standing fans well segregated
        inside.


2.9      Looking       more     closely       at    the   pro-100%      lobby       who    are    not

opposed       to     visiting     fans, it is clear             from   some     responses        that

controlling          visiting     supporters more              adequately     was    one    of    the

key areas of          interest.     A good example is provided by the officer in

 charge of policing at a northern Third Division club who felt that,



        If a 100% scheme were to be introduced with                                 the added
        security measures of photographs and electronic                             turnstiles
        it would do much to control the unruly away                                 supporters
        possibly more than home support.      The great                              deterrent
        against football hooiganism should rest with the                            courts and
        not simply the football clubs.
                                                                                            13




More forceful     ideas     on   the     general        context     in which the game is

played and on the responsibility of clubs for                     paying for the control

of crowds came from a senior officer with responsibility                        at   a First

Division club in London.         In his view,



     Football   is  a business. The      hypocrisy of jingoistic
     overtones and the small      town pride area fiction.  The
     playing of professional football is not the exercise of
     a democratic right but theexploitation of      a commercial
     opportunity.   Until   football    bears the full economic
     cost of its policing it will continue to invest in reserve
     team strikers before considering its duty to the wider
     society and its immediate neighbours.


        (Any)   meaningful   scheme   must   be                    national,         with
        photographs and inbuilt card security.


Finally on      this   issue,     a     number        of respondents clearly felt that

there was no simple and effective half-way                    house   for the police, at

least as far membership          was     concerned.        For police officers in this

camp,     the   only      form   of membership          which     offered any    positive

assistance from a         policing point         of    view was a scheme which had as a

basic     criterion that every fan         must be        a   registered    member.         Two

examples of this approach,             both drawn       from the Third      Division, must

suffice for purposes of illustration here:



         I believe membership schemes should either be compulsory or
         discontinued because in their present form they are little
         use to police.  In fact, with a capacity crowd or a crowd
         with a large away     support the membership scheme would
         hinder police in segregating fans.



         I feel that if a membership scheme is to be effective it
         should be 100% - all persons to carry card with photograph.
         All parts of the ground would then be open to all members
         and prevent overcrowding in non-member areas.

2.10   As    we     have      already       pointed      out,     16     of   our    respondents

favoured a 100% membership scheme which excluded                         visiting         fans,       an

option currently favoured by the Police Federation. These preferences

were expressed by officers                who had responsibility for policing clubs

right across the divisions, so it                  is    difficult        to argue for a 'big

club'/'small        club' split on this question, at least as                       far     as     the

police are        concerned.        It was interesting, however, that a number of

police officers          in     favour     of    this    option        had responsibility for

policing     clubs located in coastal resorts. Again, two                           examples       are

provided below.            The first, short testimony comes from the police at

Torquay United, which is one of only two clubs in the Football League

to have a 'home only' policy (the other being Luton Town, of course).

The second, longer statement reflects                    police experience at a coastal

club   in    the     Third         Division, and it illustrates the rather unusual

problems     sometimes          faced     by    the police in locations of this kind.

Perhaps     it     also       illustrates       the      selective       applicability           of    a

Luton-style approach.



       There is no doubt that the 100% membership scheme, plus the
       ban on away supporters has been a major factor in the
       satisfactory state of affairs at the present time. The 100%
       membership card  scheme with a ban on away supporters has
       virtually eliminated hooliganism and public order problems
       both inside and outside the ground.


       Because the football club is situated in a seaside resort
       with many entertainment attractions, it is not uncommon to
       find away supporters arriving in the town on Friday evening
       and staying through Saturday evening, therefore circulating
       in the town, with the      potential for clashes with local
       people.  It is for this   reason that it is felt that 100 %
       membership schemes with a ban on visiting supporters are the
       only effective way to deal with this problem.


One    final       point      in     relation to the idea          of     a   ban     on    visiting

supporters:        one    officer with          responsibility         for    policing a          small

Third Division           club      made    it    clear    that his ideal would be a more
                                                                                                           15




flexible        system         which          would,             perhaps,      allow            selective

bans    for    fans     from clubs who had previously caused disorder in the

town and at the         ground.         It     is    clear        from    his comments that the

police at this club, whilst by no means complacent about the hooligan

problem,      were     apprehensive          only        about     the visits of a relatively

small    number of clubs.         A selective              ban     operating        on     a       seasonal

basis, with a lifting of restrictions over time, may well have served

this club's         requirements more effectively than a blanket restriction

like the one practised at Luton Town and Torquay United.



        I, personally, would  like to see the exclusion of all away
        supporters visiting this football club, as has been the case
        with the Luton Town experiment.   I would perhaps amend that
        slightly to allow visiting supporters to attend from those
        areas who, in the past, have caused absolutely no problems
        in the ground.   There are certainly a small number of clubs
        in the Third Division,    for the forthcoming season, who I
        would personally like to see barred        completely   from
        attending fixtures in this town.


2.11          In addition to      these questions                 which    were      more          directly

aimed         at assessing        the impact              of     membership          on        hooliganism and

crowd     control, the         Centre        was     also      concerned       to    generate             some

information         from     football-duty               police     officers        regarding         their

assessments of         a    range of anti-hooliganism initiatives promoted and

used by clubs in           conjunction         with local and national government and

the police.          (The full list of             options can be seen in question 12 on

the     questionnaire        at the end of this                report.)        Of     those         options

offered       for    comment      there            was      least        enthusiasm        for       police

'undercover' operations, almost                     certainly        because        such       strategies

have       been used only            in relation to a very small                     number of clubswit

especially          entrenched    and        substantial hooligan problems.                        They have

very little relevance, for               example,           to the problem of crowd control

at most clubs in the lower               divisions.            Our respondents seemed almost

as     unenthusiastic        about      staging matches on Sundays                    as       a    way     of
                                                                                                 16




limiting hooliganism though the                 practice      is common, for example, in

countries         like the Netherlands.         All-ticket matches,              early   morning

kick-offs, exclusion            orders    and     membership           schemes also split our

sample in terms of the importance                  they    attached to these strategies

for      limiting hooliganism.            One     reason    why        exclusion      orders,    in

particular, might not have a massive appeal to                          the   police     in    this

respect      may be the difficulties involved in having magistrates grant

such orders.          A respondent with duties at a Third Division club told

us that,



       Since the Exclusion Orders legislation came into force the
       magistrates have refused a number of police applications for
       Exclusion Orders to be made against persons convicted of
       offences which    come   within the criteria.    To   ensure
       consistency, consideration should be given to making such
       Orders mandatory on conviction.


By    way    of     contrast,        segregation, CCTV,        police         intelligence      and

alcohol controls were all rated very highly as anti-hooligan measures

by our sample.         So, too, interestingly in the light of recent events,

was     perimeter fencing (see Table 12).                  There        was   also     widespread

support for         having     visiting     fans     travel       on     'official'      football

transport, an idea which, as is shown by the very small proportion of

Liverpool fans who travelled from that city to Hillsborough                              for    the

FA     Cup   semi-final        on     special     trains    laid on for the event, runs

counter to what is currently the dominant trend.



2.12         On      the      more      general      questions           about       hooliganism,

its     causes      and strategies for control, some                   police    officers       were

concerned for         clubs to become more active in a preventative sense.                        It

was     suggested by         a number of officers that clubs could be stimulated

into action by         penalties        which could        really have a damaging effect

on their activities. For example, the officer in charge at a Midlands
                                                                                          17




Second Division club was concerned that,



      Inside the ground,    regular appeals   should be made to
      supporters by way of programme items, leaflets, notices
      around the ground, drawing attention to ground regulations
      and encouraging better behaviour and reduction in drinking,
      and also to indicate that CCTV is in use. Very often these
      notices become neglected and the message lost because they
      are not quickly replaced.  To ensure that clubs are doing
      everything they can to create a good spectator environment,
      they may become licensed in a similar manner to public
      houses.  As a penalty, if they cannot control the situation,
      the grounds should be closed - either entirely,  or at least
      to spectators.


One     suspects    that    had    this        officer      had      his   recommendations

accepted and then suffered the             sort of experience reported by one of

our     respondents    who services a Fourth              Division     club,    the   club's

licence might already           have    been     revoked     or    refused.     Here again,

enthusiasm on the part of the club for                   membership was slight and its

operation sloppy.          But, there were also other problems.



        (The)  introduction of a limited membership scheme meets
        Government/FA needs whilst serving as an additional (though
        minimal)  source of revenue.   The club is not interested,
        basically, in who becomes members.


        The club has shown a reluctance to include a photograph
        because of cost.    Closed circuit television is eagerly
        awaited as a major deterrent and identification system.
        Club very slow to arrange.




Other     respondents       were      perhaps a little more 'realistic' about the

nature of     the     problems        sometimes     faced     by   clubs      and their real

capacity     to     exercise effective control.              One such commentator began

by admitting that          at   his     Third     Division     club    from     the south of

England,



        The present scheme is little more than a social club. This
        club provides few problems     for police at    this time.
                                                                                      18




       However, promotion in the League could generate                a different
       situation in the future.


He continued,


       In a more general view,     young males will behave in a
       hooliganistic manner some of the time.     If we physically
       stop them doing it at football grounds then they will find
       some other outlet.


2.13     We    will      end     this   preliminary    account     of     replies          from

police forces on membership, crowd control and hooliganism by quoting

two    more   general responses on the hooliganism issue and the role of

clubs in combatting the problem.            In the first, the officer concerned

considers     the     potential value of membership against the restricting

backcloth of the facilities available at many League grounds.                          In the

second, our respondent           provides   observations on the complexities of

the hooligan problem and the            difficulties    football        and     the police

will    necessarily have in devising any scheme which, on                     match     days,

will deflect        some young men from these sorts of activities.                    We have

some    sympathy      with     the   sentiments   expressed      in     each     of     these

accounts,     both,     incidentally,       provided     by   London-based             police

officers.



       If a membership scheme is to succeed it must be worth
       joining.   There must be a tangible cost (in cash terms) and
       benefits   to match.    There must be    some vetting,   and
       attempts to run it along club lines of any other social
       club.  Facilities at most League clubs are little improved
       over the last 50 years - most grounds are little more than
       corrugated asbestos    sheds and slums, open to the elements
       and lacking even fourth rate amenities.       Most clubs are
       poorly run as businesses, as distinct from ego trips for the
       directors.



       The problem of violence by organised gangs  is one way a
       small, otherwise powerless, group create their own society
       values and self esteem - they have nothing else to fight
       for,  and are seeking 'dragons of their own' to slay.  They
       are largely impervious     to   outside influence   because
       everything they value or cherish (even if it is violent and
                                                                                                           19




       unlawful) is to be found within and not outside their group.
       Whilst we deal    frequently   with the symptoms of this
       phenomenon, we are ill equipped to deal with its cause.


3.    Concluding Comments



3.1      Perhaps what          is     most        striking        about        the       results      of        this

survey     is    the wide range of experiences and                             opinions           relating        to

membership       and its        effects           that     were     described              and      expressed.

This relates in part, of course, to the range of schemes in operation

at League       grounds and also to the varying levels of commitment shown

by clubs to        the       partial        membership           policy.            On     balance,        police

officers        seemed       pleased with the effects of membership.                                That is to

say, there were          more        positive            than     negative           coments       on schemes.

However,         many        oficers             could      identify               few     positive               or

negative          effects on hooliganism as a result of the introduction of

a membership        scheme at their club.                       Again, in at least some of these

cases, negative or even neutral perceptions on the part of the police

are clearly linked to a lack of energy and commitment to such schemes

on the part        of        clubs.        They also reflect the need to avoid viewing

partial        schemes in isolation from a                       range        of     other        anti-hooligan

initiatives now in force.



3.2      The      examples           and          comments         we         provide        in     this     short

document         also         show         the      relevance            of        local     conditions          and

circumstances           to     any        changes envisaged inside grounds.                          The forced

implementation of the 50%                    provision,           for     example,           seems     to       have

provoked         additional               problems         for     some        police        forces        though,

admittedly,        only        at     a     relatively           small        number of grounds.                This

suggests        that     any        nationally-imposed              initiative on membership, or

crowd management and control at                          football        in        general,        will have to

take     account        of local factors which might make their implementation
difficult, or even           disadvantageous, to the club, local police and/or

football fans.



3.3       On      the     contentious           issue         of        a         national     membership

scheme,        again     our respondents were again                      split.        Just    over    half

did favour a           national       scheme,        though        in       the     light of Government

determination to legislate on this issue, it is perhaps more relevant

to report that around             4     in     10     of     our        respondents did not favour

a     national     scheme     which          would     require              all      fans      to     become

members, and that 7 (8%) respondents                         were        opposed       to     any   form of

membership at their           particular             club.         This suggests that extensive

on-ground         discussions           at      the        local         level,        involving        club

officials,        police,     supporter             representatives                 and local residents

will be needed to produce the arrangements with respect to membership

that are most satisfactory for the various parties concerned.

Mr. C. F. Bone,
The Hillsborough Scrutiny,
Room 1106,
50, Queen Anne’s Gate,
London, SW1H9AT

Dear Mr. Bone,



Thank you for your letter of 8th December.

Dealing with your second paragraph first.

I think you will find that the letter of Mr. Hicks is in feet complete but has been split
as enclosure 7 and 8 of the letter from the Hillsborough Steering committee dated 16th
November 1990. (Section 6 enclosure 5) with my letter of 3rd December 1997.

By chance I happen to have extracted what I thought were some duplicate letters from
the file in Sheffield. Among these there is an annotated version of these two pages and
you will see that the date 13.11.90 has been added to the page signed by Tracey
Robinson and the name of Trevor Hicks been added to the letter dated 13th November
 1990 addressed to Mr. Fraser. I cannot remember precisely where on the file these
letters were situated so cannot say that they were attached to the letter of 3rd January
 1991 but in view of the summary of the contents contained in the letter of 3rd January
 1991 and the added name and added date I suspect that this is the letter referred to by
Miss Kennah. I enclose a copy of these annotated two pages and I hope this resolves
the question. Incidentally I did call a Mr. P.J. Taylor on day 32 witness 116 but
without checking I cannot say whether this is the witness Mr. Hicks is referring to.

Turning not to your first paragraph 1 have revised the enclosure for Section 4 and
have inserted the page numbers of the individual inquests against the named deceased.
I have highlighted the page numbers so that it is easier to see and I hope that this will
assist you.

 Whilst doing this I am sorry to say I found a number of errors on this enclosure. The
main ones being that for some reason I misnamed two of the cases namely
James R Hennesey should read James P Delaney and the other one being Brian C
Murray which should read Brian C M atthew s.

Whilst on corrections on page 16 of my letter of 3rd December the date of the file
note referred to in paragraph 4 of Section 8 (page 16) should be 12th April 1990 and
not 4th April 1990. I have also noticed that I have misspelled Miss Steel’s name on
occasions. I am sorry about these mistakes and hope that there are not too many
more. If you see something which is not clear please let me know so that I can see if I
have made an error.

There are numerous references to sequential numbered pages of the interim inquests in
my letter of 3rd December. I have skimmed the letter and set out below the alternative
page numbers for those locations which I found. If I have missed any please let me
know.

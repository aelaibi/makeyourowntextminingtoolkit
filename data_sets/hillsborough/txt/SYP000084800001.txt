On my arrival             at    the t^frnsti les that I went in there were n cy

problems.              There wafs a queue           of about       10 people      in front        of me.         1 had

no    problem finding my entry                     point     to the ground,            I did not have any

I did    not see any one                climbing        over   the walls      to get      in and         I did    not

see any gates             open apart         from the turnstiles.                Inside     the    gro und       I saw

back and about              level      wit h the       IS yard area at the S pi on Kop end of the

I looked          towards       the L ep p i n gs L^rfe end of the            ground and the              part

behind the goal                looked vary / u l l         and the o ut sides          looked quite         empty.

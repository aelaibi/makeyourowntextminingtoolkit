   also     many        officers             milling                around            in      a       complete          state             of    shock        and

   bewilderment,               particularly                         some            younger            officers             that          I saw.           Many

   fans     were        running             around           in       a    near           state            of    hysteria.                 Some       of     them

   wre    screaming            out          that          the       Police            ewre            at    fault       or          that       we    were     not

   doing      enough          or       just          generally              wanting                   to    "have       a       go"       at    us    for

   whatever         reason.                 I myself                found            the      whole             scene       difficult                to    take        in

   quickly         and    for          several             moments                  took      time          to    take          it       all    in.

   The     crowd        itself          seemed             angry.                   The     Liverpool                 supporters                in    the     North

   Stand      in    particular                   were        jeering                 at     the        police,          especially                   those

   officers         who       were          facing           towards                 them         from          the    perimeter                track.            In

   turn,      the       Nottingham                   supporters                 were          jeering             at    the          Liverpool             crowd,

   obviously            unaware             of       what       had        happened                   and,       perhaps,                blaming

   Liverpool            supporters                   tor     stopping                 the         game.           I found                the    atmosphere

   frightening            and          suspected                a     serious               pitch           invasion                at    any       moment.            If

   this     happened           I saw             no       way       to     stop           it,         and       very    little             we       could     do       t o -J

   prevent         it    as    it       was          my    opinion                  the     Liverpool                 fans          were       not’ happy

my    area        there       were      some             public          houses          operi.             The       pubs     were      quickly

filling           up    with        supporters.                   One    of    these             pubs,          The    Royal       on

Penistone              Road     quickly            filled          up    inside          and          supporters             started          to

gather        on       the    footpath             outside          to       consume             ineir          drinks.

Initially              this     presented               no    problem          and       the          supporters             predominantly

from     Nottingham,                 were      goad          natured,          I saw             no    real       reason          at    this       t:me

At    tms         time       Peni stone            Roau       was       very       busy          with       fans.         I noted         some

Around        "I4GG h r s           1 heard         PS       Thompson          on       my       ratio,          calling          for

Supporters          only.            The       premises              were       cleared             of     all       customers,                 and          the

landlord       strongly              advised              to       close       for        the    afternoon.                    This        he    did

and    no    complaints              arose          from           this    incident              to       my    knowledge.

By    this    time        Penistone             Road           was      crowded            with       supporters                    and,    generally

speaking,          most     were          in    good           humour          and        well      behaved.                There          were          a

few    Liverpool           supporters                 still             approaching                 the    ground              with    the

Forest       fans     but       I    saw       no     trouble             as     a result             of       this.            It    is    true             to

say    many        fans    had       been           drinking,              but,       apart          from          the     Royal       incident,                   I

saw    nothing        further             that        was          solely        drink          related.

Sometime           prior       to    1500           hrs    at       a    guess        I    would          say        ten       to    three

(1450),        I heard          some        conversation                    on       my    radio          when           officers          were

requesting           the       start           of    the       match        to       be    delayed.                  It    seemed          this

request        was       made       as     there          was       a    large        build          up       of     fans       at    Leppings

Lane,        many    of    whom           would       not          get     into        the       ground             in    time       for     the

match        start.        I heard              concern             expressed              over          this,           and    some       mention

of     'pushing          and    shoving'.                  Just           before          1500        hrs       I    heard          excited

voices        of    police          officers              on       my     radio       requesting                    g a t e s to      be     opened

at     the    Leppings          Lane           end.            I    heard        one       voice          say       w o r d s to      the        effect

if     the    gates       were       not        opened,             the     police             would           lose       it    and    a     serious

incident           was    probable.                  The       radio           was     distorted,                   with       transmissions

drowned        by    background                 noises             and     screams,              but      I     did       hear       a request

for     all    officers,              including                    those       going        for       meal,          to    get       into        the

ground        as    quickly           as       possible.                  Although              radio          reception             was     poor,            it

was     quite       apparent              to    me        from       the       tone       of     voices             that       could        be       heard

 that       something          serious              was        happening.                  With       some          of    my serials,                I

 cannot       remember          who        or       how        many,       I     quickly            made        my       w a y to      the       ground,

 arriving          about       1510        hours.

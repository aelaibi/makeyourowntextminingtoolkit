                                                             REPORT NUMBER R291

I caimenced duty at 9.45 a.m. and was allocated duties on the perimeter track.

After meal I took up a position on the "Kop" end in front of number one gate

(10.45 a.m.).    The gate at the junction of the "Kop" and the South Stand.   At

this   time   the serial Sergeant was Police Sergeant Chapman and     Inspector

Darling had overall control of the ground contingent.   The briefing before the

game was carried out by Chief Superintendent Duekenfield and in the company he

stated that "there vould be no provision for the kick off to be delayed".

During the build    up to   the game the Notts Forest fans at the "Kop end"

appeared very well behaved and appeared to be inside the ground much earlier

than the Liverpool Supporters.

During the build up to the game several Liverpool supporters on the "kop" came

to the front of the fencing and asked to be taken to the Leppings Lane end,

provisions had been made to acccmodate the Liverpool contingent on the raised

area of the kop adjacent to the North Stand.    We were told that provision had

been made to accanodate up to 1,000 Liverpool fans in this area and I was

approached by up to 100 such fans who were directed accordingly.

During the build    up to   the game I saw Chief Inspector Beal on numerous

occasions he came   and spoke to officers on duty around the track, I only saw

Inspector Darling   twice.I did not see Chief Superintendent Duckenfield at

all after the briefing.

I feel that 4 hours before the game 20 officers on perimeter track duty was

excessive, I feel that officers could have been better employed on a mobile

patrol duty checking pubs etc in the local area.   At 2.30 p.m. the Kop end was

almost full, I noticed that the Leppings Lane end was empty in comparison.

At about 2.45 p.m. eight Liverpool supporters came to the front of the Kop and

asked to be transferred.    The Kop end was all but full and it was obvious to

     the Nottingham supporters that the fans were fran Liverpool.

     The fans came to number 2 gate policed by Police Constable 446 Grocme.                    At

     this time Inspector Darling was walking past and Police Constable Groane asked

     what he was to do with than.          Police Constable Groane had opened the gate and

     was going to escort them on the track to the raised section on the Kop.

     Inspector Darling instructed Police Constable Groane to move the eight fans

     through the Nottingham fans to the raised area.           This incident taking the fans

     across      the Nottingham fans       just   about the   full   length of   the   Kop.     I

     appreciated the danger of one Police Constable doing this and I followed

     Police Constable     Grocme into the crowd. However when we reached the rear of

     the terracing by     the turnstiles, I was requested by a turnstile operator to

     assist him, he was having trouble with Liverpool fans trying to climb over the

     turnstile and threatening violence.

     When I had dealt with this I made my way back to the track, and at this time I

     heard numerous messages over the radio as follows: "OPEN THE GATES" repeated

     on numerous occasions and then "THE WALLS GOING, OPEN THE GATES QUICK", and I

     also heard on the radio "DELAY THE KICK OFF, EOT IT BACK TO 3.15."

     There was a pause and a reply came overthe radio "THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS                 TO

     DELAY THE KICK OFF."

     I could see that the centre pen of the Leppings Lane end was full but the

     cuter wing sections were empty by comparison.

     The players came onto the field and the game kicked off.

     After a few minutes play Liverpool almost scored at the Kop end, and from my

     position on the track it appeared that chaos had broken out at the Leppings

     Lane end.      Supporters were spilling on to the pitch and I saw Superintendent

     Greenwood run towards the referee and the game was stopped.

     We   were    instructed   at   that   time   to remain    in situ   facing towards       the

     Nottingham fans.

     At this time it was chaos on the radio with much of the conversation being

     shouted and it appeared that no one realised what was happening.
I still thought it was a pitch invasion and when a Nottingham supporter jumped

onto the pitch he was escorted fran the ground.    I saw numerous Liverpool fans

on the pitch taunting the Nottingham fans, also unaware how serious the

incident was were shouting and taunting the Liverpool fans.

Because of the supporters on the pitch someone, I don't know who, decided that

officers form a line across the pitch along the halfway line to keep the

supporters apart.    At this time I was still not aware of the severity of the

incident.    I thought a fence had collapsed with a resulting pitch invasion and

was still expecting the game to continue.    It wasn't until the Ambulance came

onto the pitch and the supporters started tearing up advertising hoardings to

use as stretches that I realised that persons were injured.

Chief Inspector Beal then instructed several officers, including myself to go

to the rear of Leppings Lane end to assist with crowd control and Ambulance

reception.   When I arrived I saw numerous Liverpool supporters milling around

in Leppings Lane.    The area smelled like a brewery numerous supporters were

obviously the worse for drink, seme of them were very drunk and could hardly

stand.   With other officers I assisted in clearing the terraces and then after

the match I returned to the North Stand for the de-briefing.     I finished duty

at 6 p.m.

I have worked numerous big games at Hillsborough and have policed Liverpool

supporters several times including one previous occasion this year.

The vast majority are decent and well behaved but as on previous occasions

there is an idiot minority that drink heavily and cause problems.        On the

previous occasion Liverpool attended in January I arrested a very drunken

supporter who had found his was into the Sheffield end.

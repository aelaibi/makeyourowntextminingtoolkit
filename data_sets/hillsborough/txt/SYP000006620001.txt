Dear Sir


1.1k* a n y b o d y else, I was appalled by the football triy&edy
lust Saturday.       I have sine* been equally appalled by the
that both spectators ftfid media seek to put the blame for it
on..either the Police, or the Gricmd author it lee, or the
Football Association or all three.


Nobody, especially the politicians* seems to believe that th*
main cause was the behaviour of the 1fans * themselves.
To my mind, every Liverpool supporter who gained access to the
ground without holding a ticket authorising him to do so was
to blame for the catastrophe.         It can be no coincidence that
it was Liverpool supporters who caused the calamity in Belgium.g
It is rough justice that this time they caused casualties to
their own ki n d .


When I used to attehd football matches in my youth, a cloSed
gate meant no admission and the message was respected. A couple
of bobbies could easily have controlled a crowti of the same size*
the modera attitude of 'I want therefore I will have* wifi!
alt 'the indiscipline thus engendered is the cause of such inevitable
consequences.    My sympathy goes not only to the casualties and
their families who were Innocent victims but also to the PolAce
with whom normally I have no particular affifaity.


I have sent a copy of this letter also to the Chief Constables
of Liverpool and Nottingham Constabularies, and you may use it
in any way you think fit.

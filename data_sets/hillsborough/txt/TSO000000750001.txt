PART I   INTRODUCTION AND AIMS OF THE SCHEME


1o   Introduction

     This short paper is drawn from a report (1) on the effects on
audience response and crowd behaviour of the introduction by Coventry
City in 1981 of England's first all-seater football stadium. The main
body of the paper presents the results of a social survey of 2801 Coventry
City supporters and 201 visiting Luton Town fans, which was conducted at
the match between the two clubs played at Highfield Road oh 20 November 1982
1.e. some 15 months after the introduction of seats and of Coventry City's
new and unique differential and flexible pricing policy. The rest of the
paper is devoted to observations on the all-seater in action during the
1982/83 League season and to interviews with club supporters, club officials
and local police officers on the desirability and effectiveness of the
all-seater scheme. The paper ends with some comments on the latest develop­
ments at Highfield Road.


2.   Aims of the All-Seater/Flexible Pricing Policy Scheme

     The central aim of the Coventry City scheme was to reduce and eventually
to eliminate hooliganism in and around Highfield Road. It was anticipated
that, by doing so, Coventry City might regain lost support and succeed in
attracting new spectators to the club's home games. In this connection,
special emphasis was placed by Coventry officials on the importance of
appealing to a "family audience".

     The cost of replacing terraces with rows of plastic "bucket" seats and
of the other ground modifications involved in the conversion was in the
region of £350,000. In introducing seats, the ground capacity of the High­
field Road stadium was reduced from 35*000 to 20,500 (Coventry City's average
League attendance in the last season before the introduction of seats was
just under 17,000). One of the major advances brought by the new scheme was
that the club felt able to take down the metal fences which had been erected
in the mid-1970's to prevent pitch invasions and missile throwing from the
terraces. The club also aimed to dispense with "formal" means of segregation
(eg. penning) between opposing spectators following the conversion to seats.

     The all-seater/flexible pricing policy initiative was designed to
reduce hooliganism in four main ways:

           (i) by replacing terraces with seats
          (ii) by appealing to a "better class" of spectator, thus
               pricing out hooligan fans
         (iii) by making all home games, in effect, "all-ticket" matches.
          (iv) by pricing out most away supporters, and especially those
               who favoured the cheaper, standing terraces.

Let us look, briefly, at each of these facets of the Coventry scheme.

           (i) Replacing terraces with seats.

Although recent evidence on football disorders suggests that crowd disturb­
ances inside grounds are moving increasingly into the seated areas, most
official reports on hooliganism, and many of the game's most influential
spokesmen, recommend seating as an important means of reducing hooliganism.
More specifically, it is generally suggested that seating: (a) reduces
                                                                7.

the scale of hooligan incidents; is (b) less attractive to hooligan fans;
(c) makes hooligan incidents, when they do occur, easier to contain; (d)
allows easy identification of offenders and, (e) makes football crowds
easier to police.

         (ii) Appealing to a "better class11 of spectator.

The introduction of seats brought considerable price rises in some previously
terraced sections of Highfield Road. Prices in the covered sections of the
popular West "Terrace", for example, rose from £1.50 to £3.00. By increasing
prices and attempting to move "up market" in its audience appeal, Coventry
City hoped to exclude hooligan offenders from Highfield Road, while at the
same time increasing revenue from smaller crowds. In fact, although some
seat prices in exposed areas of the ground were no higher than most of
their terrace equivalents elsewhere, in the first season of the all-seater
(1981/82) the Coventry City club were able to report that a fall in home
attendances of 22% was accompanied by a rise in gate receipts of some 1Jfo,
This was one of the reasons why Coventry City's break-even attendance figure
in 1982 was considerably lower than that of most First Division and many
Second Division clubs. (See Table 1).

        (iii) Making home games, in effect, "all ticket".

Police and football clubs frequently co-operate in making potentially
troublesome matches all-ticket affairs. In a broadly similar fashion, the
Coventry City flexible pricing scheme encouraged home and away fans to
purchase match tickets prior to the day of the game. Clubs visiting
Coventry City, for example, were instructed that no tickets would be available
to away supporters on match days. Home supporters who were not season ticket
holders could buy match tickets on weekdays either from the club offices
or from one of the approximately 50 club agencies which were dotted around
the city and around the counties of Warwickshire and Leicestershire.
(Typically, match tickets could be bought, for example, from local travel
agents.) On weekdays, match tickets for exposed (i.e. uncovered) parts
of the Highfield Road ground could be bought by home fans for as little as
£2. On match days, however, tickets were offered to home fans at a minimum
charge of £5. This specific aspect of the Coventry scheme was designed to
reduce the number of "casual", local hooligans attending home matches i.e.
it was presumed that most hooligan fans favoured "paying at the gate" and
that hooligans would be less willing to buy match tickets in advance or
to pay a minimum match-day charge of £5 per ticket. Finally, this aspect
of the overall scheme was also designed to help with informal modes of
segregation inside the ground.

           (iv) Pricing out away supporters.

Coventry City officials identified the cheaper standing terraces as those
areas of the ground which were typically favoured by visiting hooligan fans.
Accordingly, Coventry City's flexible pricing policy required, initially at
least, that visiting supporters should pay a minimum charge, in advance, of
£5 or £6 per match ticket, this price being dependent upon the "reputation"
of visiting fan groups. On the basis of price increases of this sort and
on the basis of restrictions on the purchase of tickets on match days, it
was estimated that the size of visiting contingents at Highfield Road would
be considerably reduced. This, in turn, it was argued by Coventry officials,
would reduce the potential for conflict between opposing fan groups. This
would be especially the case, of course, to the extent that the Coventry
"all-ticket" arrangements served to exclude home and away hooligan fans.
Some measure of the effect of the Coventry scheme on the numbers of home
                                                                   8.

and away fans visiting Highfield Road during the early period of its
operation can be gained from Tables 2 and 3* In the first season of the
all-seater, total attendances at Coventry City home matches fell by 25$
compared to a fall of 12.5$ in the previous season. At the same time,
however, visiting contingents to Highfield Road decreased in size by
roughly 50$. However, because of the large increase in prices aimed
specifically at away supporters, receipts from visiting fans actually
increased by almost 25$.


3.   Local Reactions to the Introduction of the All-Seater Scheme.

     Football supporters, of course, often develop deep and long standing
ties with the local club. They perceive themselves to be involved in a
"special" relationship with the club. After all, in the eyes of most
supporters, football clubs owe their very existence to continued local
support from the terraces and the stands. Radical changes in club policies,
especially when they are introduced without "consultation" with local fans,
are liable therefore to be treated in some quarters with suspicion and even
hostility. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Coventry City's determination to convert
to seats in order to attract what club chairman, Jimmy Hill, publicly des­
cribed as a "better class" of supporter to Highfield Road, produced some
outspoken criticism from long-standing home fans. Protest banners began
to appear at Coventry City home games towards the end of the 1980/81 League
season. The local newspaper, the Coventry Evening Telegraph, carried many
letters from terrace fans claiming that the club in their actions had tarred
all standing supporters with the same hooligan brush. Supporters also
complained about the increased costs of attending matches at Highfield Road,
particularly in the light of the economic recession which had helped to
increase unemployment in the West Midlands region at a faster rate than in
any other area of the U.K. Finally, supporters complained about the match-
day ticket restrictions, claiming that their introduction deterred a large
number of well-behaved "casual" supporters from attending Coventry City home
games.

     Supporters' objections to the new arrangements were heightened during
the first season of the all-seater when serious crowd disorders occurred at
two matches at Highfield Road: more particularly, at the matches against
Leeds United in September, 1981, and against Oxford United in the F.A. Cup
in January, 1982. Seats were used in hand-to-hand fighting and as missiles
during scenes which some Coventry City supporters told us were among the
worst they had ever witnessed at the ground. Complaints were especially
loud from patrons of the Sky Blue Stand, many of whom were season ticket
holders, and who now shared their vantage point with the main body of
visiting supporters. Before the- introduction of seats, the majority of
visiting fans were housed in a penned terraced section of the exposed East
End of the ground.(See Figure 1). Following the introduction of the all-
seater,   however, away supporters were usually accommodated in sections E
and F of the Sky Blue Stand, and, occasionally, on the East End sectionsof
the Sky Blue Enclosure. (See Figure 2). Police officers, rather than
fences,   were now used to keep rival fans apart in these sections of the
ground,   although before matches and at half-time, opposing fans frequently
mixed in gangways and in the Sky Blue Bar, which is sited under the Sky
Blue Stand. On most match days, the central section 'D' in the Sky Blue
Stand was closed to supporters,, in order to aid with segregation in that
part of the ground.

     It can be seen from what we have already said, that the Coventry City
initiative was no simple matter of substituting seats for terraces. The
club's proposals and aims were complex and their various components were
                                                                  10.

often interrelated. As a result, the effects of the scheme are not easy
to trace directly to any one of the large number of variables involved
in it. For example, it is no simple task to measure the effects on attend­
ances and hooliganism at Highfield Road of, say, the increase in admission
charges, as opposed to the effects on these issues of the introduction of
seats, or of the "£5 on the day*' restrictions. Our crowd survey at Coventry
City and our interviews and observations at Highfield Road during the 1982/
83 League season do provide some clues, however, in this respect. By the
time of our crowd survey (November 1982), Coventry City's home attendances
had fallen to 9 ,500, some way below the club's new, modest "break even"
attendance figure. Admission prices for away supporters had been reduced
to    and to £5 for clubs with the larger, more troublesome, followings.
The "£5 on the day" element of the City scheme was still in operation at this
time and it was still drawing heavy criticism from local fans, despite the
club's attempts to sell blocks of cheap tickets on match days to home fans.


PART II   THE COVENTRY CITY SURVEY


1.   Introduction

     All fans at the match between Coventry City and Luton Town on 20
November, 1982, were supplied with a questionnaire which they were requested
to complete and return by post. The questionnaire for home fans differed
slightly from that aimed at away supporters (see Appendix 1). In all, over
3000 fans returned completed questionnaires, including 201 Luton Town
supporters. This means that 31% of those provided with questionnaires
completed and returned them. Although we will make some references in the
section which follows to the observations made by Luton Town supporters, we
shall concentrate largely in what follows on the replies from Coventry City
fans. Let us begin with some background data on our Coventry City
respondents.


2.   Age and Sex

     Table k divides the Coventry City respondents by age and Table 5 divides
them by sex. Unsurprisingly, the old and the very young are underrepresented
when compared with the age profile of the city of Coventry as a whole. The
most heavily overrepresented category is that for spectators between the age
of 21 and 30 years. However, our Coventry City data do not seem to support
the conclusions of a recent and influential survey conducted for the
Nottingham Evening Post (2) which suggested that watching football was
"strongly age-related" with "under 35's attending in significantly greater
proportions than do the over-35's". A recent survey at Tottenham Hotspur (3 )
suggested that approximately 12% of Spurs' fans were over k3 years of age.
The comparative figure from the Coventry survey is something close to 25%.
The attendance at Coventry City of a larger proportion of older fans might be
one important by-product of the introduction of the all-seater scheme.

     Of course, without the benefit of comparable survey data on Coventry
City crowds prior to the conversion to seats, it is extremely difficult to
judge the effects of the new arrangements on the age and sex composition of
crowds at Highfield Road. Club officials were hopeful that the new scheme
would help to attract more female fans to matches as part of the club's
commitment to appeal to a "family audience". Limited though they are, our
data suggest that the all-seater initiative had not, by November 1982,
attracted unusually high levels of female support to Highfield Road. An
earlier, smaller survey conducted at Leicester City, for example, produced
                                                                         15.


roughly the same proportion of female respondents as did the Coventry City
survey (*+). In each case, females constituted just over 12/& of the
respondents. A more recent fan survey at Brentford, however, drew responses
from a sample of home fans which contained 21?o females (5). At Leicester
and Brentford, of course, the traditional stand/terrace divisions persist.
In fact, there is little evidence from our survey to suggest that female
fans favour seating arrangements more strongly than males or that, in the
case of Coventry City, the all-seater attracted proportionally more female
fans to matches when compared with the old Highfield Road stadium. We will
provide a more detailed account of female perceptions of the Coventry City
all-seater scheme, later.

3.   Social Class Background (6 )

     Popular stereotypes of football crowds probably still hold the terraces
to be largely the preserve of male manual workers with, perhaps, the stands
catering for supporters from more middle class backgrounds and for a large
proportion of female football watchers. In some ways, of course, such
typifications were of significance in the launching of the all-seater at
                                                                         16.

Coventry City in the first place. However, our survey findings suggest
that there was a marked manual/non-manual and therefore social class mix
in both the stands and on the terraces at Highfield Road prior to the
conversion to seats. Table 6 shows that over b-Ofc of our respondents in
"white collar" employment used to watch Coventry City home matches from
the terraces. At the same time, over 35& of our respondents in manual
occupations claimed to have watched home games from the stands prior to
the conversion to an all-seater. The most popular "mixed" terrace was,
undoubtedly, the East Terrace which catered for "working class" and
"middle class" fans, for young and older fans alike, and also for over 2($
of our female respondents. However, few supporters, old or young, remained
loyal to the East end of the ground following the conversion to seats (see
Figure 3)« All told, over one in three of our female respondents watched
matches from the terraces prior to the conversion to seats.

*+.   Patterns of Attendance

     We were interested to examine the extent to which the introduction of
seating changed the context within which home fans watched matches at
Highfield Road. In particular, and in the light of Coventry City's aim to
attract a "family" audience to Highfield Road, we were concerned to examine
whether attendance with relatives increased as a result of the introduction
of seating. Our survey data suggest that it did not (see Table 7). However,
our data do suggest that the all-seater/flexible pricing policy scheme had
contributed to a decline in the proportion of spectators who attended matches
with friends, and to a sharp increase in the numbers of supporters who, since
the introduction of seating, attended matches alone. The comments recorded
below from a chartered surveyor who used to watch home games from the East

Terrace is typical of many we received from home fans who claimed that the
coming of the all-seater had had a considerable effect on patterns of group
attendance at Highfield Road. He wrote:
              For many years up to a dozen of us attended
              matches - we always stood in the same place
              and so a last minute decision to attend could
              be made and we could meet up at the same spot.
              The introduction of seats has meant this is no
              longer possible and the all-ticket games have
              meant that last minute decisions cannot be made.
              From the dozeh, only three of us are regular
              (season ticket). The other nine hardly ever
              attend. Furthermore, now the habit has been
              broken, I see little prospect of getting them
              back.

5.   Perceived Advantages and Disadvantages of the All-Seater Scheme

     The question concerned with the potential advantages and disadvantages
of the all-seater/flexible pricing scheme was, in many ways, the focal point
of the Coventry City survey. We asked our respondents to indicate whether
they,felt strongly about any of a list of seven potential advantages of the
new arrangements or about any of a list of seven potential disadvantages.
No limit was placed on the number of boxes respondents were allowed to tick.
The results of the survey are reported in Table 8 .

     It is clear from the data recorded in Table 8 that many of the central
aims of the Coventry scheme found favour with a sizeable proportion of our
local respondents. Over one third, for example, thought the new scheme
increased comfort, enhanced safety and made the stadium more attractive to a
family audience. Moreover, almost half our home respondents felt strongly
that an important advantage of the new arrangements was that they helped to
reduce hooliganism at Coventry City home games. In addition, over two thirds
of our much smaller number of visiting Luton Town fans thought the Coventry
stadium would be more attractive to families, while     were of the view that
seated facilities helped to reduce hooliganism.

     On the debit side, however, some of the direct "side effects" brought by
the new scheme were cited by large numbers of local fans as being among its
major drawbacks. Increased cost of admission and the inconvenience of "all­
ticket" matches were noted by the majority of our respondents as important
disadvantages of the new arrangements. These objections paled, however, when
compared with the almost 80?6 of our Coventry City respondents who picked out
"loss of atmosphere" as a major disadvantage of the all-seater.

     General discussions about football match "atmosphere" tend to reduce its
characteristics to those which are believed to be representative of working
class male culture. Our findings, however, suggest that both female and
"white collar" fans at Coventry City were almost as sensitive to the problems
of "loss of atmosphere" at Highfield Road as were their male and working
class counterparts. Table 8 , for example, reveals that over three-quarters
of our female respondents felt strongly that there had been a loss of
atmosphere at Coventry City matches following the introduction of the new
arrangements. Over 77% of our respondents who were from non-manual back­
grounds reported in similar fashion.

     The rather lukewarm reaction of female fans to the introduction of the
all-seater was, perhaps, one of the more surprising findings of the survey.
Two of the major aims of the Coventry initiative - a reduction in levels of
hooliganism and an increase in the attractiveness of home games to family
groups - did appear to have been fulfilled in the eyes of marginally more
female fans than of male fans. But in neither case did a majority of female
supporters feel strongly that this was the case. Moreover, there was a
substantial number of dissenting female voices, too. For example, a 3^ year
old secretary was disturbed - as were many fans, male and female - by the
lack of segregation in the Sky Blue Stand and in the Sky Blue Enclosure.
She was one of many fans who pointed out that the new arrangements had
served to make some parts of the Coventry City ground positively
unattractive to family groups. She wrote:
               I would be afraid to take my children to
               sit in the Sky Blue Stand or the Sky Blue
               Enclosure as you are offered no protection
               from away supporters. If ever we had a
               capacity crowd with a lot of away supporters
               I don't think the police would cope.

Another female fan, a 28 year old hairdresser, was one of a number who argued
that the new facilities did not satisfy the needs of female supporters.
According to this lady, and many like her, the Sky Blue Stand offered:
               Very poor facilities to lady watchers.
               Disgraceful toilets. If they (Coventry
               City F.C.) have enough money to change
               to the all-seater stadium, then they
               should supply enough toilet facilities
               to cope with more family needs (ie.
               women and children).

     By way of summary, we can say that female Coventry City fans did appear
to be concerned about crowd behaviour and about hooliganism. However, the
replies we received from female supporters who had remained loyal to Coventry
City throughout the period of change, suggest that sensible and effective
policing, adequate segregation and the improvement of basic facilities at
Highfield Road, were at least as important to them as were full-blown,
ostensibly "family-oriented" projects like the all-seater scheme.

     Figures k and 5 show that objections to the new arrangements were widely
held and were not concentrated, for example, in specific age groups. Nor
were they limited to supporters who preferred to watch matches from the
terraces. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, supporters who used to watch Coventry
home games from the terraces were consistently more critical of the new
facilities than were those fans who already watched home games from seated
sections of the ground. Nevertheless, criticisms of the new facilities by
stand supporters still heavily outweighed replies voicing positive sentiments
about the all-seater package. The fact, for example, that stand supporters
felt overwhelmingly that the new arrangements had resulted in a "loss of
atmosphere" suggests that it was the reduction in crowd size rather than the
conversion to seats per se that was of central significance in this regard.
Figure 5 shows that, for all age groups, a reduction in levels of hooliganism
at Highfield Road was the most popular perceived advantage of the new
facilities. (It should be said, however, that some respondents argued that a
reduction in hooliganism had been achieved simply because attendances at
Coventry City home matches had fallen). Our findings also showed that
respondents below the age of 30 were least impressed with the new scheme and
also that they were the most disturbed by what they perceived to be its
disadvantages. Fans between the ages of 31 and 40 seemed to be the most
sympathetic to the Coventry initiative and also the least concerned by its
disadvantages. Significantly, too, the increased costs of attending home
matches were criticised by over 55^ of our respondents who were over 50 years
of age.

     Finally, it can be noted here that, notwithstanding the general view that
the new facilities had had some success in curbing hooliganism, for a small
number of our respondents the new arrangements actually seemed to have
increased their experience of, and involvement in, hooligan behaviour both
inside and outside the ground. As we have already suggested, Sky Blue Stand
and Sky Blue Enclosure regulars found the new scheme least to their liking
because of the proximity of often large and rowdy groups of away fans in
those sections of the ground, and also because no formal mode of segregation
between opposing fan groups was operated inside Highfield Road any longer.
Thus, whilst 6.k% of our Coventry City respondents felt that the introduction
of seats had actually increased levels of hooliganism at home games, that
figure rose to over 10% for fans who now watched matches from the Sky Blue
Stand and to over 20% for Sky Blue Enclosure regulars. A 21 year old
trainee surveyor commented bitterly, as did many other local fans, about the
changed conditions in the Sky Blue Enclosure. He wrote:

               The claim that the all seated stadium has
               virtually eliminated hooliganism is an
               untruth put about by the chairman either
               through ignorance or in a deliberate attempt
               to save face. The atmosphere in the Sky
               Blue Enclosure has degenerated into hate and
               fear, and pockets of opposition fans may be
               observed in verbal and physical conflict with
               Coventry supporters on the other "terraces"
               as well... The chairman would observe the
               realities of the situation if he attended
               some games from the Sky Blue Stand...

     Towards the end of our questionnaire for Coventry City fans, we asked
our respondents to indicate whether they were broadly in favour of or against
the new scheme. The replies to this very direct question about the new
arrangements are reported in Table 9.


Table Nine;   DO YOU THINK COVENTRY CITY WAS RIGHT TO INVEST IN THE
              ALL-SEATER SCHEME?




                            Yes             No           Don't Know

              TOTALS      30.1 (881)    58.1 (1605)      11.8 (325)




It can be seen that less than one in three of our respondents agreed outright
that the club had been correct to convert to seats, while well over half
of the sample disagreed with the move at the time of the survey. (These
figures, of course, exclude those fans who had already stopped attending
home games precisely on account of the introduction of the all-seater).
While our male respondents were more pronounced in their disenchantment
with the new scheme than our female respondents, less than one third of the
female fans who completed the questionnaire positively favoured the change.
Table 10 shows that the responses of our Luton Town respondents broadly
support the views of their Coventry City counterparts. Thus, while many
visiting supporters found some aspects of the Coventry scheme encouraging,
only one in five of our Luton respondents favoured the introduction of
similar arrangements at Luton Town. Of course, their major objections in
this context may not have been to the seats as such but rather to Coventry
City's discriminating pricing policy. Nevertheless, fewer than one in ten
of the Luton fans who completed the questionnaire agreed that a national
growth in all-seated facilities would encourage them to watch more live
matches.

     Predictably, perhaps, Coventry's new arrangements were liked least by
the club's younger fans and by fans who previously watched matches from
the terraces. (See Figure 6). Only one in five young local fans below
21 years of age supported the decision to convert. More surprisingly, less
than '359^ of our "over 50's11 sample were in favour of the decision. More­
over, in all the major age categories, the majority of supporters expressed
the opinion that Coventry City were wrong to introduce the all-seater
scheme. Overall, just over 35^ of our stands supporters favoured the change
to seats compared with just 23*3^ who had seen their favourite terrace
vantage points replaced by seats. Those fans who vised to watch Coventry
City home matches from the home "end", the old West Terrace, were far and
away the biggest dissenters on this score.


6.   Summary of the Survey Findings.

     Our match survey suggests that the majority of Coventry City fans who
had remained loyal to the club following the introduction of seats were
not in favour of the new arrangements. Female fans were little more
approving in this context than were males; middle class and working class
fans disapproved in roughly similar proportions. Nor did "family groups" -
a specific target for the new scheme - appear to approve in the manner in
which Coventry City officials hoped or anticipated they would. 47% of our
respondents thought the new arrangements had helped to reduce hooliganism
at Coventry City home games, but almost four out of five local fans
complained that the new facilities had contributed to an overall "loss of
atmosphere" since August 1981. (There is strong evidence that supporters
perceived the reductions in hooliganism and the loss of atmosphere to be
closely connected with the shortfall in crowds at Coventry home games since
the introduction of seats).

     Young fans were the most disapproving of the new facilities but, for
all age groups, perceived disadvantages of the new scheme outweighed

were more approving of at least some aspects of the new arrangements than

PART Ills   THE ALL-SEATED SCHEME-^AND HOOLIGANISM


I.   Introduction

     Jimmy Hill and his associates at Coventry City began the all-seater
stadium's inaugural season in 198.fl with an air of expectancy and optimism.
The 1982/83 campaign began, however, with a, much greater degree of caution.
There were a number of reasons for this. Firstly, although the new scheme
had proved to be something of a financial success, especially in the early
part of the 1981/82 season, home gates at Coventry had fallen considerably
over the previous season. The introduction of the all-seater scheme seemed
to be accentuating locally the decline in attendances that was occurring
nationwide. (See Table 11). Moreover, local criticisms of the new arrange­
ments had continued throughout the. 1981/82 season, and had gathered pace
towards its end, as Coventry City^ once again, finished down the League
table, this time in fourteenth position.

     Secondly, season ticket sales for the 1982/83 season were down by over
2,500 on the previous season. Coventry City seemed unlikely to match even
the 1981/82 average home attendance figure of 13,000. Indeed, in anticipation
of a further fall in home attendances during 1982/8 3 , swingeing internal
cutbacks had been introduced by the club in the close season. The club's
full time playing staff, for example, was reduced from 30 to 19 players.
Although early home results were good, after seven matches at Highfield Road
in the new season Coventry City had drawn home crowds of less than 9000
spectators on four occasions. Home attendances were considerably smaller
than those at all other First Division grounds with the lone exception of
Notts County. More significantly, perhaps, they were well below the modest
II,500 "break-even" figure now in operation at Highfield Road following
the raised admission prices brought by the all-seater and the close season
cut-backs.

     In November, and with home gates apparently diminishing as the weeks
went by, the "£5 on the day" element of the new scheme was finally relaxed
for an 'fexperimental" three-match period. From the beginning of 1983? the
match day restrictions were completely lifted, although visiting fans were
still "encouraged" by Coventry officials to buy their match tickets in
advance of the day of the game. Despite success on the field - by January
1983 the club had attained its highest ever League position, 5th place -
home gates at Coventry remained very poor. Local feeling about club policies
and about the all-seater initiative continued to run high. Was it really
necessary to introduce the Coventry -plain in order to curtail the hooligan
problem at Highfield Road? Let us now look briefly at the evidence about
the extent of the hooligan problem in Coventry prior to the conversion to
seats. We will then move on to look at the new facilities "in action" both
before and after the lifting of the "£5 on the day" restrictions.


2.   Hooliganism at Coventry City Before the Introduction of the All-Seater.

     Coventry City supporters do not have a national reputation for high
levels of violence and vandalism. In fact, there is evidence to suggest

Figures in brackets refer to the percentage fall in average
attendance between seasons. Thus, for example, between seasons
1978/79 and 1979/80 average crowds at Coventry City home games
fell by 13»6%. The corresponding fall in average attendances
for the rest of the First Division was 3-9%.
  that goal-end factions, especially those from the Midlands and the South,
  regard Coventry City fans as something of a "soft touch". This, at least
  in part, explains the generally large young away followings attracted to
  Highfield Road throughout the 1970's. Although incidents at Coventry City
  home matches have seldom put the club on the national "hooligan" map,
  a couple of cases do stand out: the death of a West Ham supporter in
  Coventry in the mid-1970's, for example, and the bus-wrecking escapades
  of Leicester City fans towards the end of the decade.

       For most of the 1970's, rival fans at Highfield Road were accommodated
  on the terraces of the West End of the ground, separated, not by pens or
  fences, but by lines of police officers. Interviews we conducted with
  police officers and with Coventry City fans now in their thirties, recalled
  the often turbulent scenes which occurred in that part of the ground. A
  senior police officer told us that, in those days, there were "battles
  every week" on the West End, but most of the fans we spoke to held the
  view that the worst incidents were confined to the visits of the same six or
  seven clubs each season.

       In 1978, a new system was devised for coping with visitors to Highfield
  Road. A fenced walkway was erected inside the ground to split the East
  Terrace, with away fans being allocated the Main Stand end section of
  terracing. (See Figure 2). This improved the situation inside the ground,
  but some police officers we spoke to noted that disturbances began to become
  more prevalent outside. Although statistics on football match arrests and
  ejections are notoriously unreliable as a measure of hooliganism at matches,
  data from the 1978/79 season do seem to suggest that spectator problems at
  Coventry City home matches were no more serious than those of nearby clubs.
  Table 12 shows numbers of arrests and ejections at football grounds in the
  West Midlands area for the 1978/79 season. It can be seen that, expressed as
  a percentage of total attendances, arrests and ejections at all these grounds
  are very small. Table 12 also shows that, with the notable exception among
  the major West Midlands clubs of West Bromwich Albion, rates of arrest and
  ejections at the major grounds are very similar.

     In accordance with the general picture provided by these figures,
most of our Coventry City interviewees agreed that serious disturbances
at home matches in the late 1970's were restricted to the visits of a
few identifiable clubs; that the prudent, well behaved fan could easily
avoid "trouble" when it occurred; and, that the so-called visitors "pen"
on the old East Terrace provided the most effective means of curbing
disorder at least inside the Highfield Road stadium. For example, an
electrician in his early thirties who had supported the club for fifteen
years, told us how he assessed match-day- prospects prior to the introduction
of seats. He said:
                What you do, you position yourself, don't you,
                in the ground, depending upon which team you're
                playing. You know, like, if it was Manchester
                United, then you make sure that you stayed in
                the middle of all the fans in the West End,
                but other games you might move further round
                the side. It depends upon who you played.
                If it was some team that wasn't notorious for
                causing trouble, then you might move somewhere
                else to get a better view. I think the people
                who wanted trouble found it, but if you didn't
                want trouble, there was always somewhere where
                you could go where you knew you'd be O.K. You
                knew the trouble clubs and you kind of tailored
                your suit to that. You always knew where the
                trouble spots were. There'd maybe be five or
                six matches a season when there might be trouble
                and you just didn't go there... (T)
Of course, not all Coventry City fans are liable to be as perceptive as this
man. Some "innocent" Coventry City supporters undoubtedly did get involved in,
or were frightened by, hooligan incidents prior to the introduction of seats.
Not surprisingly, too, Coventry police officers were more aware of serious
hooligan incidents at Coventry City home matches prior to 1981 than most of
our interviewees claimed to be. Nevertheless, the police view on the
occurrence of serious crowd problems following the introduction of penning
in 1978seemed   to accord with the general impressions recorded above. That
is, prior tothe introduction of seats, only a relatively small number of
matches at Highfield Road were perceived as posing potentially seriously
threatening public order problems. These matches could usually be identified,
as could the places where serious incidents were liable to occur. Well-
behaved home and away fans could, generally, avoid these trouble spots.


3.   Hooliganism and Policing:   The Effects of the All-Seated Stadium

     The ultimate aim of the all seater/flexible pricing scheme was, of course,
to eliminate hooliganism in and around Highfield Road. As we have already
pointed out, if taken as the sole indicators of the orderliness or otherwise
of League grounds, statistics of match-day arrests and ejections are extremely
unreliable. But, a brief consideration of the trends in arrests and ejections
over the last six years at Coventry City does provide at least some indication
of the effects of the new arrangements on crowd behaviour and on football
match policing. Table 13 illustrates these trends, together with trends in
home attendances, during the period 1977-1983.

     A number of important points are illustrated by the data in Table 13«
In the first place, the 1980-81 season was one of the worst at Highfield Road
in recent years in terms of ejections and arrests. Even so, only a very small

* First Season of the all-seater/flexible pricing policy
** No 'before' and 'after' breakdown available

SOURCE: Adapted from information from West Midlands Police Force
                                                              31.

proportion of the persons attending home games at Coventry City during that
period were apprehended in either of these ways. Secondly, in the first
season of the all-seater (1981-82), arrests inside the ground fell by almost
50$ from the previous season, although they rose again in 1982-83.
(According to the local police, this later rise in numbers of arrests inside
the ground can be at least partly attributed to the ease with which police
officers were able to identify offenders in the all-seater). The increase
in the numbers of arrests before matches during the 1981-82 season can be
explained, according to local police officers, by the tendency for away fans
and some home fans to continue to arrive at the Highfield Road ground
ticketless and unwilling or unable to pay the £5 match-day admission charge.
According to the police, this often meant that in the early months of the
all-seater/flexible pricing initiative, hundreds of disgruntled and
disappointed away fans roamed Coventry's streets, occasionally fighting with
local youths. On more them one occasion, too, visiting fans who had
insufficient funds for admission, turned their attention, instead,to stealing
from local stores. Because of these sorts of early problems, the reduction
in policecommitments that the all-seater was designed to lead to was rather
limited. One senior local officer told us:
               Initially, a lot of 'away' fans would come and
               find that they had to pay £5 on the gate.
               These supporters and, sometimes, Coventry City
               supporters would arrive and find they hadn't
               got the money and that led, of course, to a
               lot of supporters being shut out of the ground.
               Initially, this could mean three or four hundred.
               So, these would be walking around the ground
               during the match and be sometimes in the town
               centre causing trouble. So, this meant we had
               to bring in a lot more police officers to control
               that situation. At the beginning of this season,
               of course, it was quite different because by then
               'away' supporters had realised what it was like
               when they came to Coventry. So people who weren't
               able to pay £5 on the day didn't come and the
               Coventry supporters, the "bad element" who
               wouldn't buy tickets in advance, who weren't
               willing to pay £5 on the day, they stopped coming,
               too. But, of course, this year as a consequence,
               they've (Coventry City) had a dramatic drop in
               attendance figures.
Although there were clearly increased problems outside the ground, it was
primarily this "dramatic drop in attendance figures" at Coventry City which,
local police spokesmen claimed, resulted in a reduction in police personnel
at City home games following the introduction of seats, ie. it was not the
introduction of seats per se which enabled the local constabulary to reduce
its match-day commitments. It is certainly true to say that, following the
introduction of seats, Coventry City's bill for policing inside the Highfield
Road ground was reduced. For the 1982-83 season, the club actually paid for
21 officers per home match including one inspector. In the 1979-80
season, the corresponding payment had been for the attendance of 37 officers.
In both cases, and as is usual police practice, these figures do not
constitute the total number of officers available for use inside Highfield
Road, or, indeed, the number of officers who were actually deployed inside the
ground. In fact - and this was especially the case following the lifting of
the "£5 on the day" restrictions - police strategies inside the ground were in
a state of almost constant re-assessment throughout the 19&2-83 League season.
Thus, as a senior police officer wrote in a letter to the research team in 1983:
                                                               32.


               It is certainly true to say that although
               the bill to the club has been reduced,
               police officers on duty in the ground had
               to be increased, even after the installation
               of seating, in order to provide a physical
               segregation barrier between the home and
               visiting supporters.
In terms of the overall police commitment at Coventry City home matches -
ie. inside and outside the ground - decisions taken by the police about
manning levels continued to be made very much on a match-to-match basis.
Manning levels varied depending upon factors such as the importance of the
game; the expected strength of home and away contingents; and the
reputation of visiting supporters. At the beginning of the 1982-83 season,
police commitments at Coventry City home matches were sometimes down to
around 120 officers, (including 'special' constables) per match. However,
with the lifting of the "£5 on the day" restrictions in December, and with
continuing segregational problems on the Sky Blue Terraces, larger crowds
at Highfield Road, when they did occur, had police manning levels creeping
closer to the 200 mark that had been more common in earlier seasons.

     That policing problems did vary from game to game during the first year
of the new all-seater initiative, and often quite considerably, can be gauged
from the fact that just two matches, those versus Leeds United and Oxford
United, accounted for almost     o f the toal number of arrests in and around
Highfield Road in the 1981-82 season. There were 72 arrests in connection
with the Leeds United match (over 50 before the game) and     at the Oxford
United encounter. By contrast, arrests averaged only six per game for the
rest of the League and Cup programme at Highfield Road.

     Leeds United have since been relegated to the Second Division and the
Oxford affair was a "one-off" FA Cup match. In the latter case, confusion
about the allocation of seats may have played a part of some significance in
causing a number of violent incidents inside the ground. More importantly,
however, even since the conversion to seats, there appears to be a degree of
continuity in the clubs which can be expected to bring a troublesome element
with them to Highfield Road. More particularly, it is the visits of the same
"five or six" clubs mentioned by some of our interviewees and the police that
continue to cause problems in this regard. In the case of Coventry City,
these clubs seem to be their Midlands' neighbours, Birmingham City and Aston
Villa, and Spurs, West Ham and Manchester City.    From our previous
researches we also know that the visits of Leicester City to Highfield Road
often provide for crowd problems. That is, while the seats and flexible
pricing did to some extent reduce the number of arrests and-ejections at
Coventry City's home games, even after the introduction of the all-seater
the same few visiting contingents continued to cause the local force their
most difficult problems.

     Table 14 shows that, both before and after the change to seats, the
visits of some Midlands clubs and of some London clubs typically led to more
arrests and ejections at City home games than those involving clubs from
other areas of the country. In some, but not in all, cases, these "problem"
clubs also brought with them the largest travelling contingents. The table
includes only those clubs which made three visits to the Highfield Road
stadium between 1980 and 1983*

     Table 14 does not take into account important factors such as when
matches were played; size of the crowd and of the visiting contingent;
importance of the match; history of disorder between rival fan groups etc.
etc. Some of these factors undoubtedly account for some of the variations in

our figures. Nevertheless, the figures do suggest that the visits of a few
sets of opposing fans seem regularly to have resulted in a higher rate of
arrests and ejections at matches at Highfield Road. According to these,
admittedly very crude, statistics, the visits of clubs like Aston Villa,
Birmingham City, Tottenham and West Ham are rather notable in this regard.
Moreover, fans of the same few clubs seem to have been the principal
offenders both before and after the change to seats.(7)

     Our measures are too crude and the table covers too short a time span
for us to be in a position to make authoritative statements about the effects
of the all-seated arrangements on the behaviour of different visiting fan
groups. In most cases, however, the introduction of seats is associated with
a reduction in numbers of arrests and ejections although, for example, the
Arsenal visit of 1982-83 seems, from these data at least, to have proved
rather more troublesome than those made by the North London club in its two
preceding visits to Highfield Road. (We have no way of telling, of course,
whether this particular rise in ejections and arrests may have been in some
way directly connected to the introduction of seats).   Of the other clubs
mentioned in the table, it is arguable that the supporters of Sunderland F.C.
have been more subdued by the seats than most visiting contingents. Since
1981, no fans have been arrested at a Coventry City v Sunderland match.
However - and this gives substance to our point that statistics such as these
should be treated with extreme caution - we do know that, since the change to
seats, a Sunderland fan was attacked with a knife by a local fan outside the
Coventry City ground.
                    ♦                                      •

     A further limitation of Table 14 is that it takes no account of whether
matches in the 1982-83 season involving those visiting sides listed were
played under "£5 on the day" or "pay at the gate" conditions. Table 15
compares arrests and ejections for the 1982-83 season for matches played with
and without the match-day ticket restrictions.

     After the lifting of the "£5 on the day" restrictions, there is,
according to these figures, no discernible increase in home attendances at
Highfield Road. (One could argue, of course, that a continuation of the
restrictions into 1983 might have resulted in even lower gates during that
period). It is noticeable, too, that although the local police force and club
officials continued to argue in 1983 that the match-day pricing policies
deterred "hooligan" fans from attending matches at Highfield Road, average
levels of arrests and ejections actually decreased slightly following the
lifting of restrictions. (This may be partially accounted for by the fact
that, early in 1983, some visiting contingents appeared not to be aware of
the changes made in the Coventry City policy). But more to the point, perhaps,
is the fact that, restrictions or no restrictions, the familiar names of
"troublesome" visiting contingents continued to crop up, once again providing
support for the observations of our interviewees and the police about the rates
of match-day disturbances, and when they are most likely to occur.

     Finally, in this brief section on offenders and arrests at Highfield Road,
we shall make a simple comparison of the ages of offenders and of the offences
committed in connection with Coventry home matches before and after the change
to seats. Once again, the comparison is a crude one, not only because of the
limitations of the official statistics in this context, but also because we
have figures from only one pre-all-seater season - 198O-81 - for purposes of
comparison with the situation since the advent of seats. (See Tables 16 and
17)• Notwithstanding these limitations, our figures suggest a decrease in the
proportion of juvenile arrestees in and around Highfield Road since the change
to seats. (This is in addition, of course, to an overall decline in the
numbers of arrests at Coventry City since the conversion to an all-seater).

As far as offences at Coventry City home games are concerned, the ubiquitous
Section 5 of the Public Order Act continues, although declining, to account
for the bulk of offences after the change to seats. The small number of
arrests for offences like assault, carrying an offensive weapon arid criminal
damage also appeared to be in decline after the new stadium's inaugural
season.

4.   Observing Crowd Behaviour at Coventry City Home Games, 1982-83

     Thus far we have spent some time looking at statistical data relating to
the changes introduced at Highfield Road in 1981. Let us now move on to more
qualitative data about crowd behaviour and crowd control during the second
season of the all-seater arrangements. From participant observation with home
and away fans at Coventry City home games throughout the 1982-83 League season,
it was possible to gain some impression of the adequacy with which the new
facilities were operating both for opposing fan groups, and for the police.

     Coventry City's new arrangements for home and away supporters constituted
                                                               37.


a break with the recent past in more ways than simply through the provision
of seating and a new pricing initiative. The installation of seats brought
with it the removal of the formidable groundside fencing erected inside
Highfield Road in the late 1970's. Some major clubs have managed to resist
the resort to fences for large terraced sections of their respective grounds,
notably the London clubs of Arsenal, Queens Park Rangers and West Ham.
Coventry City's aims, however, were to rid Highfield Road, not only of
groundside fences, but also of segregated pens, an initiative which few
major clubs were likely to contemplate in the 1980's. Coventry City's aim,
of course, was to rid Highfield Road of all away fans. In the meantime,
police recommendations were that away fans should, typically, be allocated
tickets for the wing sections E and F of the Sky Blue Stand. This would
enable at least some division to be established between home and away
contingents.

     Crowd control problems became most apparent in the all-seater when
visiting contingents were too large to be contained in the Sky Blue Stand
or when visiting fans chose to watch matches from the unsegregated Sky Blue
Enclosure. This was likely to occur, for example, when visiting fans
purchased match tickets "at the gate". Sometimes, too, despite the £5
restrictions, away fans purchased tickets for specifically Coventry sections
of the ground. On the occasion of the visit of Arsenal in September 1982,
for example, the presence of away fans in the West End prompted fights and
police action.

     When pay-at-the-gate restrictions were removed in December 1982, crowd
control problems, especially those in the Sky Blue Stand and Sky Blue
Enclosure, increased. There developed a pattern which was to become familiar
at Coventry City home games. When away fans had settled in the upper and
lower levels of the Sky Blue seats, a contingent of young home fans who had
established themselves in the seats nearby would identify themselves by
chanting support for Coventry City. This usually initiated a rush by some
sections of the away contingent towards the Coventry lads, until police
officers moved into the banks of seats to establish a position between the
rival factions. Once this had occurred, "segregation" became a matter of
moving rival fan groups apart and, if possible, creating a "no-man's land"
of empty seats between the rival groups.

     The police and club officials agreed that a constant police presence in
the seats was inadvisable. After all, one of the aims of the scheme was to
reduce the role of the police to a minimum. No officers paraded on the
running track during matches, for example, despite the removal of ground­
side fencing and the almost constant fear, on the part of the police, of
pitch invasions. Also, senior police officers and club officials were
understandably reluctant to place police officers between banks of groundside
seats for the simple reason that their presence would be likely to obscure the
view that some fans have of the match. (We should say in this regard that the
police force at Leicester City, for example, shows no such reluctance in its
policing of the groundside seats in the Filbert Street ground's East Stand).

     Despite this reluctance on the part of the police and club officials to
have officers "patrolling" banks of seats in the Sky Blue Enclosure,
occasionally it seemed unavoidable. When Spurs fans visited Highfield
Road in the early months of 1983, for example, young London fans were soon
"exploring" the Sky Blue Stand and the Sky Blue Enclosure. About 100 of them
infiltrated the home section of the Sky Blue Stand before the game and were
removed after disturbances there following the arrival of the teams on the
field. Spurs' fans also dispersed throughout the Sky Blue seats. Again,
given the lack of formal segregation and the lack of any stringent checks on
                                                                 38.

ticket seat numbers, it is almost impossible to prevent this sort of
incursion. In this case, Coventry City fans were forced to take evasive
action following fights in the Sky Blue Enclosure.        About 50
Coventry City fans moved over the advertising hoardings onto the running
track, urging Spurs' fans to do the same and fight. The Kop and the rest
of the away contingent urged their representatives on, while Spurs'
"reinforcements" poured into the area from Block 'F'. Eventually, the
City fans were ushered by police into the West End.

     For much of the encounter against Spurs, the local police felt compelled
to maintain a standing presence between opposing fans both in the upper and
lower tier seats in the Sky Blue Stand area of the ground. It was a policy
which could not, however, prevent some fights in the West Stand, another
ostensibly "home" section of the Highfield Road ground which, clearly, had
been infiltrated by visiting supporters.

     Later still in the 1982/83 season, and despite the lack of serious
problems during the visit of Manchester United fans in December and that of
a large Liverpool contingent in April, West Ham United and Birmingham City
fans repeated some of the scenes which had caused such discomfort to well-
behaved fans in the Sky Blue Enclosure earlier in the season. Apart from
repeating some of the sorts of pre-match confrontations practised at the
Spurs' game, West Ham United fans made inroads into the corner of the West
End, a manoeuvre which led to fights in that part of the ground, prior to
confrontations between rival groups after the match on what is know locally
as "Pork Chop Hill", a grassy bank,off the streets behind the West End. The
behaviour of visiting Birmingham City fans in April, proved to be more
orderly than some senior police officials had feared. For example, a pitch
invasion was strongly predicted by local officers, but it never came. How­
ever, the volatility of the large Birmingham contingent did lead to the
closing of the Sky Blue Bar at half time.

     Problems between rival fans in the Sky Blue Bar were not uncommon
towards the end of the 1982/83 League season. The bar was open to rival
groups in the Sky Blue Stand and the Sky Blue Enclosure. Typically, police­
men (usually 'special' constables with full time officers in command) tried
to keep the bar facilities open, even if this meant, as it sometimes did,
segregating rival supporters inside the bar. But fights and bouts of
(plastic) glass and beer throwing were regular features, occurring most
seriously at the games versus Luton Town, Norwich, Watford and West Bromwich.
On at least three other occasions on police recommendations *(the matches
against Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United and, as we have already pointed
out, Birmingham City), the bar was not opened at half time at all. Even
after the all-seater scheme had been introduced, disturbances continued to
arise in streets and pubs around the ground, especially when the larger
and more notorious away contingents were the visitors. Generally, however,
opinions from club officials, the local police and many Coventry City
supporters were that the pre-match situation outside the ground was more
relaxed than had been the case prior to the introduction of the all-seater.
Some police officers argued that this may have resulted simply from the
fall in attendances since 1981 and, in any case, police knew where disturb­
ances were liable to arise and were consequently able to keep such regular
trouble spots under close and almost constant surveillance. In short, it
is difficult to say to what extent, if any, the feeling of relaxation can
be attributed solely to the introduction of the all-seater.

     After matches, confrontations between rival fans remained a problem
even following the decline in crowds and the introduction of seats. Post­
match segregation arrangements outside the ground were, almost by necessity,
                                                               39.

rather different at Coventry City from those now in operation at most
major grounds. In the first place, because of the unsegregated character
of the Sky Blue Enclosure and the Sky Blue Stand it was difficult to
follow the procedure of many clubs and to "hold" away spectators inside
the ground until home supporters have dispersed. In "mixed" seated
enclosures at other grounds - notably at Nottingham Forest - away fans
are held until home supporters have left the ground but, according to the
Nottinghamshire police officers we spoke to, this policy often seems to
affront many orderly fans. At Coventry, it was clearly decided to minimise
the risks involved in doing this. The Coventry scheme did, however, produce
some difficulties outside the ground, especially when home and away fans
flooded simultaneously into Swan Lane. Needless to say, such problems were
generally more severe when a large away contingent was present.

     For many local fans we talked to, the siting of away fans in the Sky
Blue Stand area and the changes in police after-match strategies introduced
in tandem with the all-seater, made the post-match situation more unpleasant
and potentially more dangerous. Some cited their own experiences at away
grounds at which the "delayed departure" approach was implemented. These,
they contrasted favourably with what happened under what was clearly regarded
as the rather haphazard local approach, an approach which was perceived to
be closely tied to the conditions brought by the all-seater stadium and the
new arrangements for away fans. In many ways, the ecology of the area
surrounding the Coventry City ground, and in particular the siting of the
away coach park, makes for easier segregation and maintenance of order after
matches than at other grounds. There is but one entry to the official 'away'
coach park, and the park itself is probably less than 200 metres from the
back of the stadium. After City home games, police personnel are concentrated
on blocking access to Swan Lane from the West End area of the ground but,
because of the lack of formal segregation in the Sky Blue Enclosure, young
home and away fans often mix in the vicinity of that street and, occasionally,
fights between opposing fans take place there. Once away fans who have
travelled by coach move through the Swan Lane/Leicester Road junction and
into the coach park, policing problems are at a minimum, although after a
League Cup tie against Burnley we were told that a group of Coventry fans
had managed to throw a brick through the window of a Burnley coach as it
prepared to leave the park after the match.

     For away fans travelling by British Rail, the journey after the match
from ground to railway station measures more than a mile. Potential flash
points here include Gosford Green where, traditionally, young defenders of
local masculinity gather to "see off" opposing fans. On occasions during
the research period, police on horses and on foot dispersed groups of youths
on Gosford Green and broke up fights between opposing fans as small groups
of away fans managed to break away from the main phalanx of police-escorted
away supporters. We were assured by local police and by Coventry fans we
spoke to, however, that "this was nothing to what it used to be like" on
the Green, when home and away fans could be expected to confront each other
in much larger numbers.

     The complaints we listened to from home supporters on post-match
segregation were quite often strongly made but they were dwarfed in intensity
and number by the complaints of local male and female Sky Blue Enclosure
fans who found themselves caught up in the antics of opposing fan groups
inside that unsegregated section of the ground. Some of the people we
spoke to expressed fear about the presence of what they perceived to be
hostile visiting supporters. Many more, however, simply pointed to the
inconvenience of attempting to watch a match while police officers and
young supporters seemed to be in a constant state of flux around them.
     Some visiting supporters to Highfield Road were not appreciative of
the new arrangements either. Certainly the facilities offered to away
fans were second to none: seats; good refreshment areas; some cover;
a view unhindered by fencing etc. However, many young visitors to
Highfield Road continued to complain about the boredom attached to watching
from a seat. (Indeed, much of the police work in the Sky Blue Stand away
sections was concerned simply with getting away fans to sit.) There were
also complaints from visiting supporters who usually watched matches from
the stands, and were therefore used to being separate from the main body
of visiting fans and their police escorts. These fans, understandably,
resented becoming "involved" in disputes which were occurring in the Sky
Blue Enclosure, and which, to their mind, would normally be acted out
between rival terrace factions. A few examples of the sorts of complaints
we received from away fans on this score are listed below.

                   All-seated stadia don't really help
                   because hooligans will be sitting by
                   real supporters and annoying them.
                   The seats won't stop them throwing
                   things on the pitch as well.
                                                 (13 year old schoolgirl)

                    Whilst I agree in theory with the all-
                    seater idea, in practice it creates a
                    situation where the "idiot fringe" are
                    now in the seats amongst the civilised
                    fans instead of in their cages which,
                    whilst unsavoury, tend to control them
                    at other grounds.
                                        (34 year old financial director)

                   Moving the young, aggressive (sometimes
                   drunk) element of the crowd in with the
                   "family crowd" is no answer. I will not
                   return to Coventry until I am allowed to
                   sit away from those who want space to
                   "express" themselves.
                                       (35 year old cost clerk)

                    Making the ground all-seater throws the
                    yobbos in with those who sit to avoid them.
                                        (21 year old trainee service engineer)

     Finally, we should say that the Coventry City arrangements for away
fans seemed unlikely to improve relations between orderly fans and the local
police. A minority of our Luton Town respondents mentioned the police, and
when they did, it was almost always unfavourably. For many of these fans,
and especially for those who usually watch away matches from the stands,
their trip to Coventry City was probably their first direct experience of
some of the problems faced by the police in, e.g. segregating home and away
contingents. For some, as the following remarks show, it was not altogether
a pleasant experience. A 55 year old company director, for example, wrote:

                    Whilst I deplore the hooliganism which
                    is killing football, there must be some
                    distinction between hooliganism and high
                    spirits and I consider Coventry to be
                    over-policed almost to an intimidatory level.

A 30 year old insurance broker agreed, recommending that the local police
should:

                     Treat away fans with respect. We're
                     hot all hooligans who require constant
                     policing etc.

     Let us now conclude our report by considering some of the developments
which led up to the demise of the all-seater at Coventry City in 19831 and
also the pattern of events at Highfield Road since the present research was
completed.


PART IV   THE DEMISE OF THE ALL-SEATER STADIUM AT HIGHFIELD ROAD:    APRIL
          1983 ~ OCTOBER 19


     The commitment of the Coventry City club to an all-seater stadium,
the first of its kind in England, lasted almost exactly two years. Plans
to convert to seats were made public in April 1981. In April 1983,new
plans were announced to re-open a section of the old Kop terrace for card-
carrying standing Coventry City supporters. "Something which is revered
in Aberdeen", commented Jimmy Hill, "is almost spat upon in Coventry".
Within three weeks of the decision to re-introduce terracing at Highfield
Road, Hill resigned.

     Hill was correct to point' to local resistance to the all-seater scheme
as being the major reason for its failure. The manner in which the new
facilities were introduced, set as it was against a background of local
disillusionment with the club and with personalities like Hill who were
centrally involved in its development, undoubtedly contributed to the
scheme's early unpopularity with the Coventry football public. In many
cases, too, it was argued locally that the all-seater scheme, with its price
rises and especially with its match-day ticket restrictions, was a totally
inappropriate response to the problem posed by hooliganism. In this context,
and as we have tried to suggest in this report, the recent DoE report on
Football Spectator Violence is right to argue that "soccer spectator violence
at domestic football matches is sporadic and local and associated with a
relatively small number of clubs" (p.13)* Few Coventry City fans, for
example, saw the relevance of the match day anti-hooligan measures for the
visit of clubs like Ipswich Town. It may well have been more productive for
Coventry City to have concentrated its efforts on "all-ticket" policies for
the visits of those groups of supporters who are well known for causing
crowd problems at Highfield Road and elsewhere. Used for all League and
Cup matches, regardless of the size and the reputation of visiting contingents,
the policies actually implemented seemed, to many fans, to be unnecessary
and to be having an adverse effect on match attendances.

     Coventry officials agreed later that, in the club's eagerness to be
first with the new format, the manner in which the new arrangements were
introduced was heavy-handed and poorly thought-out. Good public relations,
traditionally one of Coventry City's strong points, were badly lacking
during this period. Coventry officials also complained about lack of support
from other clubs. On the day the plans to re-introduce terracing at Highfield
Road were announced, Gordon Taylor, Secretary of the PFA, reflected gloomily
that Coventry City's decision represented a "backward step" for football.
Backward step it may have been, but no other League clubs had promised to
follow the Coventry lead. Had more clubs done so, it was argued by Coventry
officials, then it may have helped the Midlands club to lose its
                                                               42.


"experimentation" tag.

     Coventry City's ambitions to exclude away supporters from the
Highfield Road ground or, failing that, at least to dispense with formal
modes of segregation between home and away fans, were new and controversial
initiatives. During the research period, both fell short of achieving their
objectives. Away fans continued to attend games at Highfield Road even when
match-day ticket restrictions were in operation. Problems of segregation
between opposing fans, especially in the Sky Blue Enclosure, have never
been satisfactorily resolved. In 1983> following recommendations from the
police, a small, wooden dividing fence was installed in the Sky Blue
Enclosure to provide a physical barrier between rival contingents. Predict­
ably, during the early months of the 1983/84 League season, the fence
provided something of a focal point for the attentions and activities of
rival young fans. Early in the season, visiting fans from West Bromwich
came over the fence, initiating scenes in the Sky Blue seats and on the
running track similar to those of previous seasons. The fence did, however,
make the Sky Blue Bar effectively "off limits" for most away fans, and so
helped to reduce crowd problems in that area before matches and during the
half time interval.

     As visiting contingents to Highfield Road grew to their pre-all-seater
levels during the 1983/84 season, Coventry City began to experience increas­
ing problems of pitch invasions. In January 1983> for example, Leicester City
and Coventry City fans spilled onto the playing area, halting the match between
the clubs. Pitch invasions also occurred in karch during the visits of
Birmingham City and Spurs. On Leicester's return to Highfield Road in
September, rival groups of fans again poured onto the field two minutes after
the start of the match. In all, the match was halted for 10 minutes as
police attempted to separate rival groups who were fighting on the field.
As a result of the Leicester experiences and of the further pitch invasions
and other forms of crowd disorder that occurred during the visit of Arsenal
later in the same month, Coventry officials, under pressure from the F.A.,
decided to re-introduce groundside fencing as soon as possible at a cost.,
of £60 ,000.

     For the new regime at Coventry, the all-seater stadium seems little
more than an expensive mistake. There are discussions presently in hand
to provide more standing enclosures at Highfield Road, with special emphasis
on the need to provide a penned standing enclosure for away supporters.
Measures of this kind reflect, not only crowd control considerations but
also financial contingencies. Coventry City has already raised admission
prices at Highfield Road by 1CP/o to pay for the club's new groundside fences.
New Football League guidelines on the retention by the home club of all
home gate receipts make it even more imperative•that League clubs concentrate
on generating the maximum revenue from home matches. In such circumstances,
and as Table 18 shows, on 1982/83 attendance figures, Coventry City stands
to benefit least from this change in the financial structure of the game.

     Since Jimmy Hill's departure from the club in May 1983> and since the
arrival of a new chairman, Derek Jamieson, and a new manager, Bobby Gould,
Coventry City have returned to a more traditional and perhaps more cautious
approach to club/fan relations and football spectating. The all-seater
scheme as practised by Coventry City is still maligned by local fans and is
now subject to extended national criticism following repeated spectator
disorders at Highfield Road. Ironically, Luton Town is a club currently
considering a move to a new all-seated facility at Milton Keynes. Oxford
United are another club with designs for an all-seated stadium away from
the cramped Manor Ground. Each of these clubs, and other clubs with an eye

experiences of pioneering clubs like Coventry City.

We were aIso a s k e d by a great                  number       of s upporters           of all     age    g r oups

them.         The m a j o r i t y of the        people    carrying 4 packs and asking                      for

directions           to the    public      houses were all            in groups          of 5 to ten         people.

hrs)    a growing          number     of the      persons with 4 packs were seated on                         walls

appeared         to be     no     problems with these as there were a number                       of

Officers          in the v i c inity w ith them,              and also a highly visible                 presence

of Offic e r s         in the area.



The a t t i t u d e      of the    supporters         towards       us was   very jovial       in fact

corniTients were          passed to the effect               that    they were    not used to Poxice

the a n n o y a n c e     of many motorists.             Inspector Millett           had    informed us

that     there was         problems      at the Leppings             Ln entrance     to the ground and

that     due      to the    large     volume     of spectators           in Leppings       Ln no vehicles

could get through.                 Serv i c e   buses were a d v i s e d of the         sit u a t i o n and

they took a l t e r n a t i v e       routes.        To the     best     of my knowledge        the youths

who    had       been sat on the walls               with their 4 packs must            have    set      oft

      to walk           to our Phase        2 position,



      As    I a pp r o a c h e d the ground there                appeared      to be a large            number     of

*Jr   supporters              walking a way from the ground towards Leppings Ln                             roundabout



      A lot        of    lo-cal    res i delves were      cornplaining about             the    problems      c a u s ed by

      the    large        number       of supporters        that    had been there and the                 large

      am o u n t    of    cans an d fish and            chip w r a ppers      thrown      into their        gardens.



      Upon     reaching           the L e p pings Ln entrance            I was      informed that          there    had

      been     trouble          inside    the     ground and that wit h other                  serials,     nad to

      some were           shouting abuse           to Pi>i,ice Officers.               Virtually      i mme diately

      our    serial was            called    into the       grourH^to       the     rear of the West S t a n d ,

      of    people were            trying    to    pass messa g e s      together.

r e 1aIi v e s ' N x I was    instructsd to          clear a way         for ambul a n c e s      to get

through.        A 1 ong, wit h other           officers    the    centre    part     of this a rea was

cleared to a l l o w \ c c e s s        for ambulances.            I was    then told to stand with

other Officers           f o r m i n g a ^cordon     ar o u n d a number of bodies             lay      on the

floor      at the      perimeter wall.



At    this   time      X had no        i d e a at all what       had happened,       all    orders          were

given verbally as             the      radios were still          unreadable.        There         were a

large amount ^ s h o c k e d            civilians walking about               in the area,           there

were also a 1arge                aunt    of spectators           shouting abuse         d i r ected towards

An    i nstruction was          given     to    clear     everyone from that area,                and

the m a j o r i t y    of the youths were           escorted       out of th Leppi n g s Ln

entrance,       these      leaving      under     protest.        It was     quite     obvious       that an

incident       of a p a r t i c u l a r l y serious       nature    had occurred and              it was

            and    for everyone             to leave      the ground.        The m a j ority of the         people     left

            this     part of the            stand    in silence       others     thanked the O f f icers         for

            their      help whilst           one or two       continued, to be abusive.



            Once     the    stand was          cleared along wit h PC Wade               I went     into   the    seating

            are a and with other Officers,                      conducted a search for              property with

            negative         result.



            I then       left     the      ground and m.et up witNa the             rest of my serial            outside

            the L e p pings Ln entrance,                  where we were        railed     into the main stand for

            At 9.00am on S a t u r da y                 15 April       1989 I commenced duty at Force

            H e a d q ua rt er s       for deployment             in connection with the FA Cup Semi Final

             between Liverpool                   and IMottingham Forest.

            Toget her with several                      hundred other          officers,       I a t t e n d e d a briefing

             given by Chief S u pe ri nt en de nt D u c k e n f i e l d and other                      senior      police

             officers          in the N orth S tand at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football                  Ground,

            Hillsborough.                   Fol l o w i n g    the briefing at         10„45am     I was d e p l o y e d on

            mobile        patrol        in the Middlewood,                O u g h t i b r i d g e „ Deepcar and

            Sto c k s b r i d g e areas with                  instructions      to watch for Liverpool               supporters

            approa c h i n g          along      the A616        route.       Of the    three mobile       serials      under

            my    command,            I commenced             patrol   w ith Police Sergeant Hunt and his

             serial.

            For      two hours we m ai n t a i n e d a patrol                   along    the A616,       paying

             particular a t t e n t io n to                   licensed    premises along the           route.

             T hr o u g h o u t   this        time there was a steady               stream of vehicular              traffic

            a p p a r e nt ly bringing               fans to the football              match.     Some    public      houses

            a p p e a r ed to be well                f r equented      by football       supporters       but     during    this

             period       I did not encounter any trouble.

             At   1.42pm together w ith Sergeant Hunt,                             I visited       licensed       premises

             know as The Silver Fox at Stocksbridge.                                   These    premises were         crowded
                                                                                                      PAGE        2
                                                                                                      R273

with Liverpool          support ers who were         drinking and who were                in very high

spirits,    singing and shouting.              As    I left      the     premises,       I spoke       to

the    licensee who       said that the fans were              not      presenting       him with a

problem.        I told him that         if they     continued to consume                drink,    it was

unlikely that        they would      be a d m i t t e d to the football               match.

As    the time     for the m a tch approached,            I deployed p r o g r e s s i v e l y        nearer

to H i l l s bo ro ug h and at about 2. 3 0 p m we          positioned our vehicle                in a

side    road,    just     off the main     road at O u g h t i b r i d g e .      By this time

traffic    travelling        towards S h e f f i e l d was much          lighter       than    it had

been and there were           very few football           fans still making              their way

towards the match.

It was our       intention to go to C l a y w h e e l s Lane Traffic Garage                      to take

a meal    at 3 . 1 5 p m as we had been ordered               but as we listened to the UHF

radio    transmissions,        it became      inc r e a s i n g l y    clear that all          was not as

it should be in the vicinity of the football                            ground.        Radio

transmissions        began to be shouted            in an a g i t a t e d manner and on

several    occasions        over a five minute          period I heard the               phrase       "Open

the gate'.         This    phrase was     repeated at         least      six times and on each

occasion there          seemed to be more         urgency       in the voice           of the    person

tr a n s mitting    the message.         I have     no idea from whom the message

originated.         At this    stage     however,      there was nothing               to suggest          that

there was a n y thing        other   than a busy sporting                event    taking       place.

Since our       pre-match duties were          complete,          I ordered the          driver       to

make    his way towards        the football         ground and from there we would go

to C l aywheels Lane         if we were     not     required further.                 Radio

t r a n smissions    continued to be a g i t a t e d and were becoming                    confusing and

unintel l i g i b l e and    it became     i n c r easingly apparent             to me that

something       serious a p p e ar ed    to be building           up.

I a p p r o ac he d the ground by way of C a t chbar Lane and turned                           left    into

Lepp ings Lane.           There was a group of about                  si.;-; Police    officers at the
Catchbar Lane,         L e p pings Lane j u n ction and they gave the appe a r a n c e                    of

just having        completed their          pre-match duties.

On a p p r o a c h to the turnstile a rea at the Lepping Lane                     end of the

ground there were            still a few fans mill i n g around              but there was       no

crush and no disorder and as a result                     of what     I saw,    I ordered my

serial     to    remain    in their vehicle whilst              I went   to find out         if we

were    required for         further    duties.     There       seemed   to be sufficient

Polic e offic e r s at          the turnstile area to           cope with     late a r r i v a l s and

the fans were         being a dd re s s e d by an       Inspector who was         sitting      on the

roof of a Police Land Rover and using                     the    v e h i c l e ’s public address

system.         I a sk e d Chief     Inspector Waring       if my serial        was    required and

at    first     he said that he had nothing             for us but it was          clear      that he

himself       did not know what         the sit u a t i o n was    inside the      ground.       Fans

were    still a r r i v i n g    in Leppings Lane at 2.33pm.               Many were waving

tickets       in the air and were           behaving     in a manner w hich        indicated that

they had been drinking.                For the    number    of fans that were           in the area

at that time,         I w o u l d say that there were            sufficient Po l i c e       officers

deplo yed at       that    location.        At some stage        I was   told that the ground

was    closed and that we were              required to     prevent further           fans    from

entering.         T o g ether wi t h officers      from Inspector Mi l l e t t ' s       serial,       we

formed a cordon across               the entrance an d      prevented further           fan,    some

of whom were waving              tickets,    from entering.

S u p e r i n t e nd en t Marshall   then orde r e d that        the a rea    i m m e d iately to the

rear of the West Stand be               cleared of fans as          the area was        becoming

congested and we thought               that the game       had been stop p e d for some

r eason w hich was as yet             unknown to us.        As    I went     to the    rear of the

West    stand,     I passed an am b u l a n c e w h i c h was      parked on the        riverside

roadway w hich        runs      round towards     the S outh stand.          Several     injured

people were        being a t t e n d e d to at    the    rear of the a m b u l a n c e and as         I

strode over one           person     I noticed that       he was     receiving     oxygen and
                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                            R 273

that    he was blue        in the face.              Inspector Millett             said    "It    looks as

t hough he's a gonner".                 This    person was          receiving a t t e n t i o n at              the

time and our a s s i s t a n c e was           not    required there.              W ith hindsight               I now

r ealised that that           person was a l r e a d y dead.

As we a r r i v e d at the       rear of the West              stand near to the entrance                         to

the tunnel,          it became        clear to me that           it was      impossible          to    clear the

are a because        there were too many                injured      people    on the ground.                   We

w ou l d have     been driving          u n injured      people      over the top of             people who

were a p p a r e n t l y ser i o u s l y injured.   The s i tuation at this stage was

yet    unknown to me the fans were a p p r o a c h i n g Police                      officers and

saying     that      it was all        the fault       of the Police.              In between various

outb ursts of violent abuse                   from the       fans,    many of whom were                drunk,          I

a t t e m p t e d to assess     the situation.               Police    officers and fans were

carrying      injured      persons          up the tunnel        from the terraces.                   The

injured were strewn on the ground at the                             rear of the West             stand and                I

only began to realise                 the    real    e n o rmity of the s i tuation when                    1

turned     round and saw that the head of one of the                               injured had been

covered over and he had been                    left     u n a t t e n d e d and quite a p p a r e n t l y

dead.      This was the first                time that       I knew that someone             had been

k illed and from that            point        on it became apparent                that man y         people          had

been killed.           Injured and dead fans were                    being    carried out of the

tunnel     co n t i n u a l l y and    taken to the          rear    of the Leppings Lane

entrance.         I gave artificial             r e s p i r a t i o n to one full         grown male

person whose face was                 covered       in thick     vomit.       My    impression was                that

I was     pumping      beer   out of the body w h i c h showed no signs                          of    life at

a n y time.       Eventually          I was joined by an a m bulance a t t e n d a n t who

a d m i n i s t e re d oxygen for a short             time    but to no avail.              I left          the

body and went to find someone who                        could still         be helped and this was
the s i t uation faced by many officers at that                                     location.       The are a was

event u a l l y      littered with             probably about             15 bodies         none of w hich had a

P olice      officer         in attendance.               I tried to allocate a Police                   officer

to each body but                  I believe       that      I failed        in this task as the           officers

were even t u a l l y each faced with                      life or death situations                   where    they

m ay have        been of help to someone who                         could be saved.

This was a very               confused period during w h i c h                      I had    little    or no

perception of time a l th ou g h                    I can remember several                  times

a u t o m a t i c a ll y    looking at my wristwatch,                     the time did not            register.

At various          times         during     this     period       I saw and Spoke to S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Marshall,         Chief       Inspector Waring,                Inspector Millett,              Inspector Bullas

and    Inspector Sykes.

We were        later        required to go onto the                   pitch and face the              crowd,    most

of whom were               still    in the stadium.               During          the time that       I was    on the

pitch,       I remember speaking                  to S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Greenwood,         Inspector

Harper,        Inspector P ur d y and Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit.

I remained           in the        stadium until           it had been             cleared of fans and          later

r egrouped together with about 200 officers                                       in the briefing area of

the N orth stand.

B y this time all                 the officers were              suffering          from deep shock and at

the s uggestion              of S u p e r i n t e n d e n t B r o o k f i e l d    I assisted     in trying to

identify Police               officers who            required        immediate        help.

During       the main         part     of this        incident        I never made          use   of the UHF

radio      system as           I judged that any atte m p t                  to have done so w ould have

been futile.                The    radio message was               inaudible,         incessant and       confused

A fter     being       released from the ground                      I assisted        in general       policing

                  disorderly.

                  seemed         in order.          They were about            twelve    s upporters     outside this

of what was            occurring.



At about 3.1            ,                    ook up a position         in front       of the S p i o rj/K o p

w hi c h housed N o tt i n g h a m Forest            supporters.          I could see that T h e r e

was    disorder at the West Stand,                    I initially      thought a pitch          invasion

was    occurring,           a number     of supporters were          running       from the West Stand

t owards        the Spion Kop and            ripping a dv e rt i si n g    hoarding and        returning

to the area            in front    of the West Stand.              For some        ten minutes         I

o b s e r v e d the s ituation and saw that there were                       injured supporters

being        carried towards ambulances.



At this         time my a t t e n ti o n was drawn to a ma n              lying    behind m e^ em the

pitch,         I hadn't      seen anyone       deposit     him there,        I heard^afomeone          say,

" D o n ’t worry about           him he's dead',         a black     coat co/ered the upper                 part

of this man's            body,    he was a well         built man,        nvidd 1e a g e d .    I d o n ’t

recall         what    he was wearing.            There were        number        of supporters         around

him but         none were touching            him,    an am b ulance was        driving from the West

S t an d towards         the P en ni st on e    exit.        I could see        this man was          lying    in

its    path.           I moved him to one side,              as the am bu la nc e      neared     I

man on the            pitch.      The    driver      stated the a m bu la nc e was        full.        At

this     time a supporter           called for my a s si st an ce            he and another

               My name is                    I am a married man arid I live a / the above

               address with my family.    I have been a life long Liverpool supporter

               and I am a season ticket holder. About a week before the semi final at

               Hillsborough I queued at An-fV^eld and paid £ 1 y for a north stand

               ticket. On Saturday 15th A/ril 1989, I setyfcf f from home at about 8.

               30am, with my son        (S2) a friend              he lives in

                         . Also a chap called               who lives at

                        I drove in my car, a green Rover                   along the M53,   56

               towards Stockport and then the       A606 towards Sheffield. We     had a clear

               run through we d i d n ’t stop for   any reason and we only had about a 5

               minute traffic delay as we came off at Stockport. We arrived in

               Sheffield at about   11.30am .

               We parked the car in a pub car       park at The Meadows Meadows Home. They

know us there we always go there.         Its a nice quite little place.        I t ’s

about a 25 minute walk back by the ground.           I had a meal and a couple

of pints of bitter. About 5 Nottingham Forest Supporters joined us at

the meal and we all walked along the road together,            joking with each

other. There was no trouble in the pub, there was a good atmosphere.

We left the pub at about 2.00pm, we were going for a bus at 2.00pm and

it was full. There was a steady flow of people along the road,             but

there was no trouble at all.         I d i d n ’t see any Police along the route I

took into the ground. We were separated by now from the few

Forest Supporters we had walked down with. We walked down Leppings
                                               uS •
Ln, it was crowded, by now it would be abo u t 2.35pm, there wasp no

jostling or pushing. Because last year as I reached

the grounds L was pick pocketed. This year I had room and/time to do

my jacket /p and check my pockets.         I didn't see any Pol/ce     presence as

I approached the entrance to the ground. As I got nea/er the main

gntiNanare? gates,   it was heavy,   thick,   there were tl^ysands h e r e .

Because    I knew we were having to get the north stand entrance we began

to shoulder our way through the crowd. B}y^naw we were really squashed,

theres no other word for it.

We got to the far side of the main entrance gates of the North Stand

entrance and I saw two mounted PolHjjre officers. The one officer              looked

frightened as if he just d i d n ’t know what to do. He was shouting

something but you w o u l d n ’t know what. They appeared to have

lost control    comjaleVely« There was a desperation to get in, by now it

                     fc)pm. The language was a bit choice as you can well

imagine.    I was getting worried by then,       I grabbed hold of the main

gate I ’d got parted from my son in the crowd, a n d             had made off to

the right. My son had a ground ticket along with                       was at

the side of me hanging onto the gate.          I said that I ’d got to get out

of there, we pushed our way through the press of bodies             into the
                                                                             PAGE       3

corner shop.    I went    into the shop and brought a bottle of lemonade. A

few other fans came into the shop for refuge. The shop keeper                locked

the front door,    its only a tiny shop. Only for the fact that there

were grilles on the window,       the bobby on the horse, with the crowd

forcing him over,    the horse was pressed right up against the window

and I think but for the grilles the window would have gone in. The

front door was even creaking.        We even laughed and joked with the

owner,   telling him to get his telly down,        there was no way we were

going to move out of that shop,        until the crowd had moved.       The owner

had a radio on in the shop and we heard the kick off. All of a sudden

that crowd outside had gone, we didn't know where to. We could see

that the people had been frantic outside only seconds before kick off.

That was just the pushing and shoving,         there was no fighting as such.

They'd just got the kick off fixed in their mind. Once the crowds had

gone we came out of the shop and we walked with ease into the ground.

There was a little trickle of late comers but they were moving.                I went

through the north stand turnstile.          I ripped my ticket and gave

the half in they wanted.       There were    lots of tickets just lying on his

desk where people must have thrown them in. By know it must have been

about 3- 10pm I stopped and brought a programme,           I made the comment of

’what a mickey-mouse place this is* she said,          ’I t ’s you lot you should
                                                                      »
behave yourselves*       I told her to behave a n d         calledyner a

cheeky cow.    I d i d n ’t see any stewards or Police in the/courtyard.          I

more or less knew where       I had to go to get my s e a t . A   d i d n ’t see or

w a s n ’t aware of any signs directing me to my matctp viewing point.            I

went straight up the steps to get to the North stand and as we got to

get to the back of the North stand,          fans were saying,    "They’re

fighting t h e y ’re fighting".   The players had gone off the pitch. We

went into the stand and we could see what did look like fighting over

to our right in the central       pens, by now they were over onto the
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               S1767

    pitch. We made our way to our sea t we obviously thought         it was
                                                       Cl&jpto '-I f o !
    f ight i ng by now it was aboutf 3.30pmJ We still dicrn’t V&hov what was

    really going on. We h^rlnea rd Kenny Dalglish appeal over the tannoy

    system, asking p6r     calm,   to follow the stewards and listen to the
                    /
    Police that i a s the first time,     I had heard anything over the ta/moy

    system,    it did go slightly quieter when Kenny spoke. Then ah^ut £00

    Police* officers    came onto the pitch from the Pennistone F^ad side and

    they lined up on the touch line in front of the North sfrand. I saw

    jbodies being placed on the ripped down hoardings and carried along the

/   pitch,    their faces were covered with their shifts and I asked

    why were the faces    covered,    I just didn't tfacnk what was happening.

    All of a sudden a certain amount of F ores/ Supporters started to

    chant,    "Heyse1 Heysel" nobody knew what/was going on. All o f a         sudden

    there was 4?group of about 50 - 60,       or Liverpool Fans th^fX were on the

    p i t c h a.rted to go down the Forest end. That was understandable

    reaction on both fans parts because, again nobody really knew what was

    happening. The line of 200 bobbies swung themsel/es across the halfway

    line to contain any potential trouble. By now/xhere were a lot of

    bodies on the pitch, with lots of people giving first aid or trying

    to.   I remember seeing one lad walking abound holding his arm that was

    obvoiusly broken,    I remember seeing that his arm was bent horrendously

    and that it looked like a z ig sag. By now it was about 3.40pm we

    decided to get out there.        I couldn’t see right into the pens because

    there was a just a mass of people in front,       so I couldn’t comment on

    the immediate Police response in that area.

    There were Police there,       fans there and even fireman there,      I wondered

    what they were doing there because I d i d n ’t know what was happening

    down there.     I could see people being lifted up into the West Stand.

    From where I stood all those ground pens looked full to me,            it d i d n ’t

    enter my mind that people’s lives were at risk, all that was on my

mind was that there were hooligans fighting.             There was not a word

of information over the tannoy to the rest of the ground at all.                   We

decided to go for a cup of tea.           We were told by someone in the tea

queue that there were five dead.           By the time we got served our tea,

it had gone up to fifteen dead.           I took         Ito the back gate    in

the stand,    looking over    into the gymnasium,       I was showing

where I'd gone last year to report my pick-pocket.              It was then that I

saw at least 25 bodies laid out with white sheets over them.                 A senior

Police officer was walking up the line writing something down

on a clipboard.     I wouldn't know the officer again,          other than he had

braiding on his cap.     We could see other bodies being brought             in on

hoardings and laid down.           It was then my bottle went and my blood

began to boil, with worry I suppose.           I started to think o f a n d

         and what may have happened to them.          I began to realise that the

game had been called off,          it was then I saw a girl with her boyfriend,

he was    coughing up blood there was blood on his shirt and jacket.                 He

was as white as a sheet.           The girl said he *d been squashed,      she was

very upset with tears    in her eyes, she wanted to get him medi cal help.

I said there was a gate over there with a steward on it, the steward

said she couldn't go through that gate,            I told him not to be so

stupid,    I was pulled away because I couldn't understand why the poor

lad couldn't get to the medical help that way.              They turned around and

went back towards the west stand.           His arm was around her and she was

helping him to walk.     Then we decided to leave the stand.              We wanted

to go and look for           and           it must have been about 4.15 (1615),

we hadn't heard any thing over the tannoy about the game being

abandoned or to remain in our seats,          nothing    like that.     We got out of

the ground more or less the same way we came in, without much trouble,

but we left through an open side concertina gate rather than the

turnstiles.     We didn't see any Police or stewards.           A lot of people

were walking out by now.      Before we left the stand we had seen an

ambulance on the pitch by the pens and one by the gymnasium.              Even

then we still assumed the trouble was down to fighting, we just didn't

know anything.    We got into Leppings Ln,    near the first set of traffic

lights, there on the pavement sat my son.       He told us about the

crushing and the pushing that had gone on, you heard all the stories

about the gate being opened.      My son did not go through a turnstile

but through a gate,    he'd been carried through by the crowd.           There

were a group of police in Leppings Ln.       Some of the crowd were abusive

to the Police.    One of the scouser fans hit a policeman who had told

him the fans should have behaved themselves.          I d i d n ’t actually see

this officer being struck,      it was just what was going on generally in

this crowd.    We made our way back up the top of Leppings Ln and sat

and waited for            It was a place we went to if we ever got

separated.    By now there was more Police at the top of Leppings Ln.

There was a bobby in a white jag. who I was shouting abuse at.                 He

came over to me and said he was very sorry,         it was nothing to do with

him,   he said he'd just been called in from a long way away.            I'm not

sure where from; he was a traffic bobby.       I could recognise him again.

His attitude was OK.      He was just as much in the dark as me.          Even the

foot patrol bobbies didn't know what was going on.           We went to queue

up for the phones to let our families know we were all          right.     A

lady in a cake shop called us over to let us use her phone.              I told

my wife I cou ldn’t find         but my wife said        was OK, because he'd

gone back to the Meadows      pub and had called his wife.      I was furious,

absolutely livid with          going off like that,    in a funny kind of way

it was anger and relief at him.       I got back to the pub with                    and

        and met up with          The figures were going up

as soon as he saw me.      By now the figures were up to 90 odd.          He

       with his side of the story.     I understood then what had happened

to him in the ground,       he'd been stuck in the centre pens.            We got into

the   car and turned on the radio,        it must have been the 7 o'clock

(1700)    news,    I heard this Mr PRATT, who I think is a very senior

Police Officer,       say that the Policing at Hillsborough that day had

been "in line with        tried and teamed meth o d s . ”     I repute this on the

evidence of what Iwitnessed>and personally experienced that

afternoon.        The lack of policing, it was just not there at the

relevant    points and times.      Leppings Ln end should be one of the

easiest entrances to a ground to be policed.                T h e y ’ve got plenty of

room,    right from the top of the lane, to get people in order and

filtered down to the ground.          As they go through the first set of main ,

iron gates the Police and Stewards             can be th^/e separating the people

to go into the respective entrances or wh^rfX tickets they hold.                 To get

them into proper       lines up to the turnsl/iles,         compared to last year

when I att e n d e d , the Policing started way over in the main streets,

with the Police escorting the crowd down the Leppings Ln,                 it was still

about the same time 2.45 (1445), 2.40 pm (1440).                There we/e Police on

horseback and on foot getting         people into lines in froniC of the

turnstiles.        There were Police on every turnstile aryf they were

checking your tickets before          entry.     Overall,    from the Leppings Ln       it

was bad Policing.         They must have had those 200 police officers on               the

half-way line,       from somewhere   , why w e r e n ’t they used in Leppings Ln

at the crucial times.        I think the fans could have been better-

informed as the authorities became aware of the situation.                   I ’m sure

the chanting from the Forest fans would not have come up if t h e y ’d

been told what was going on.          I can only say from my view point that                  '

who ever decided to open those gates transferred the problem from

outside to inside the ground.          I c an’t really blame him for making

that decision because he w o u l d n ’t have been called on to make that

decision if the Policing had been better.              The injured lad I saw,       I

         d o n ’t think I ’d recognise him again,   other than he was a teenager,

         quite well built,   dark hair, and I think he wore a leather jacket.

         The girl had blonde hair,       they were about the same height.

         I am willing to surrender my stub portion of my ticket to the Inquiry

         if required to do so.     I felt so strong about the whole incident      I

         sat in the garden and wrote reams and reams,       there was a lot of anger

         in the first draft,    I felt    I had to write.   In the end I calmed down

         and wrote a 3 page letter directly to Justice TAYLOR.          I hand a copy

         of this letter to WPG                 (      <            ).   I went back to

         Anfield and to the cathedral service and found that helped me a lot.

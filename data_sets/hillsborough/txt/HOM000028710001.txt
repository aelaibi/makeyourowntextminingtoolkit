Dear Dr Eastwood

TBSSWQ Q& BARRIERS
1 m trying to locate the test data which relates to the examination of all
those crash terriers which were ocanined in 1983* At the present tiae the
Health and Safety Executive haveTgiven an indication of the results of
those tests but not the supporting data similar to that produced to Lord
Justice Taylor’s Inquiry in respect of the 1988 tests.

I wonder if you could help me by checking your records to see if you have
in your possession those barrier testing record sheets. If so, I will
arrange for an officer to collect theo from you without delay.

An early response would be appreciated by Lord Justice Taylor, preferably
by fax.

I thank you in anticipation of your co-operation.

Yours sincerely




Assistant Chief Constable

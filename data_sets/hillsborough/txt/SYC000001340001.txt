                           A F F I D A V I T



I, Albert Page                               make oath and say as
follows:
1.   I am the Chief Executive of South Yorkshire Metropolitan
     Ambulance and Paramedic Service which was granted NHS Trust
     status on 1 April 1992. Prior to that I had, since 1982, been
     the Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer for South Yorkshire
     Metropolitan Ambulance Service (which was then part of Trent
     Regional Health Authority).

2.   I swear this affidavit in opposition to the applications for
     Judicial Review of the inquests of six of the victims of the
     Hillsborough Disaster which took place on 15 April 1989.
     Except where otherwise appears, this affidavit is based on
     matters within my own knowledge, information and belief.
I am a Justice of the Peace, a Fellow of the Ambulance Service
Institute, and a member of the Association of Chief Ambulance
Officers.   Since 1986, I have been an instructor at the
National Health Service Training establishment at Harrogate on
courses for senior ambulance officer development. I recently
acted as chairman of the inquiry into the failure of a newly
installed computer system at the London Ambulance Service.

I have read the memorial and supporting documents that are
exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Hawthorn.      There are some
matters in the memorial which, due to the fact that they have
been paraphrased, are not completely accurate; I am anxious
that any incorrect impression be rectified.      I restrict my
comments to matters which I consider to be relevant to the
ambulance service; these comments largely relate to the claims
concerning the involvement of the ambulance service, a lack of
care and the cut-off point of 3.15 pm which are referred to in
paragraph 5 of the memorial.

In paragraph 9 of the memorial, it is suggested that, in his
inquiry, Lord Justice Taylor recognised that a quicker response
to the emergency by the police to ensure the attendance of the
emergency services might have saved at least some lives, and
that these findings raised the further question of whether the
crush injuries had been aggravated by a lack of care.         I
presume that the memorial is referring to paragraph 252 of Lord
Justice Taylor’s Interim Report (which I refer to below). This
question was very fully canvassed before Lord Justice Taylor's
Inquiry. Arguments were submitted to the Inquiry by Leading
Counsel for SYMAS, and by Leading Counsel for the police.
Witnesses were cross examined on this point at length, and
after hearing all the evidence and all the submissions, Lord
Justice Taylor concluded that "it is unlikely that these
services (ambulance and fire) could have saved lives if they
had been called promptly, but it is possible". This conclusion
followed that in paragraph 251 as to the effect if any that an
earlier call for doctors and nurses in the crowd might have
     had, namely that "probably there was little that could have
     been achieved ... but there were marginal cases where earlier
     attention might have made a difference.”           Both these
     conclusions are to be read in the context of Lord Justice
     Taylor’s finding that the disaster occurred, and the fatal
     injuries had been suffered by 15.06 when the police recognised
     the fact and stopped the match.

6.   There is now produced and shown to me marked “API" a true copy
     of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report. I wish to refer to
     the following paragraphs of the interim report:

     Paragraphs 87-90     which give details of the response of
                          the St John's Ambulance Brigade,
     Paragraphs 105-106   which give details of the ambulance
                          service response, and give statistics
                          relating to the number of ambulances
                          involved and the casualties,
     Paragraph 252        which states that it is unlikely that
                          the emergency services could have saved
                          lives if they had been called more
                          promptly, but it is possible,
     Paragraphs 296-301   which include the specific finding that
                          the    ambulance   service    responded
                          promptly, that it brought appropriate
                          equipment and that their personnel
                          operated efficiently. There is also a
                          specific finding that, in view of the
                          nature and extent of the crushing, the
                          time the police rescue began and the
                          pathetically short period for which
                          those unable to breathe could survive,
                          it is improbable that quicker recourse
                          to the emergency services would have
                          saved more lives.




                                3
The BMJ Article of 30 November 1991
Paragraph 10 of the memorial refers to the BMJ article of 30
November 1991. I saw that article in early 1992 and I wrote
to the editor of the BMJ in relation to factual inaccuracies.
There is now produced and shown to me marked "AP2" a true copy
of my letter to the editor of the British Medical Journal dated
29 January 1992.

The BMJ article shows that no one who suffered a cardiac arrest
and was taken to hospital actually survived. Of the 14 victims
who suffered a cardiac arrest and were taken to hospital, five
were dead on arrival, resuscitation was attempted but failed
on seven of them, and two were resuscitated and taken to
intensive care but then died. The article does not support the
conclusion that the Applicants seek to draw.

The BMJ article also points out that most of the seriously
injured arrived at the hospital within the first 30 minutes.
I believe that this not only shows the rapid response of the
ambulance service, but also indicates that the ambulance crews
were selecting the more seriously injured victims and taking
them to hospital first.

The suggestion that a jury might take a different view of the
two doctors’ evidence gives me some disquiet. The two doctors
gave interviews to the press at the time and subsequently.
They were the only two eyewitnesses to make any criticism of
the work done by the emergency services at the ground. These
criticisms were aired fully before Lord Justice Taylor’s
Inquiry and found to be groundless. In particular, Dr Ashton
had stood and watched the scenes on the pitch but made no
attempt to go and assist, although he apparently appreciated
there were many injured and dying persons in need of aid, until
the tannoy announcement at just before 15.30. Moreover he told
Lord Justice Taylor that he could not say that any lives would
have been saved if the emergency services had arrived earlier.
11 . Both of these doctors’ criticisms were found to be without any
     factual basis when the detailed evidence was examined. It may
       be, and certainly Dr Ashton conceded this in terms, that what
       they said at the time was merely their impressions gained from
       a limited vantage point. They both conceded however when faced
       with the facts as recorded on film and the SYMAS records, that
       their criticisms were based upon limited information. What use
       to a jury their evidence could now be must be questionable.
       If their evidence is the same as it was to Lord Justice
       Taylor’s inquiry, it has already been shown to be based on
       incomplete and inaccurate information.    If their evidence is
       to   be   differentthe jury will be faced with conflicting
       evidence from the same witness, and as the court well knows
       that is not conducive to arriving at the truth. In order that
       this Honourable Court may judge the strength of the criticisms
       now being advanced by the two Liverpool doctors I shall deal
       with each in turn.


       Pr Phillips
12 .   Paragraph 12 of the memorial refers to the evidence of Dr Glyn
       Phillips. There is now produced and shown to me marked "AP3"
       a true copy of the transcript of the evidence that Dr Phillips
       gave to the Taylor inquiry which Counsel will refer to in more
       detail at the hearing of the applications for Judicial Review.
       As far as the specific claims made in the memorial in relation
       to Dr Phillips’ evidence are concerned:
       12.1   Neither his statement nor the transcript of his
              evidence demonstrate that lives could have been saved
              by what the memorial refers to as "proper emergency
              help".   In fact the opposite is the case and I would
              draw attention to the following extracts from Dr
              Phillips’ statement:-
              Page 9    ”1 could not    find anybody seriously ill
                        needing help.   Just dead or seemingly minor
                        injuries and shaken people."
              Page 11   "Remembering the fan we had resuscitated I
                        gave a policeman my name and address. I felt


                                  5
                   it very unlikely that he would have survived
                   and reconciled myself by the fact that if he
                   had he would have been brain damaged."
12.2    His statement makes no reference to his asking for a
       ventilator. It does, however, refer to his asking for
        a defibrillator. Lord Justice Taylor’s Interim Report
        (at paragraph 298) states        "I am satisfied on
       overwhelming evidence that to attempt to use a
       defibrillator on the pitch with people milling about
       would have been highly dangerous owing to the risk of
       injury from the electric charge".
12.3   I gave evidence to Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry, as
       did some of my officers, as to the effects of
       attempting to use a defibrillator in crowded and
       confused conditions. In particular, we had in mind the
       situation at Hillsborough as shown on the video film.
       In short our evidence was that the use of a
       defibrillator was discouraged unless the operator had
       a clear working area with no risk of contact between
       the patient and any other person, and where the
       operator could with confidence diagnose an arrhythmic
       beat.     The use of a defibrillator in the wrong
       circumstances could easily kill the patient, a more
       detailed argument against the use of a defibrillator
       appears in the exhibit referred to in paragraph 13
       below.
12.4   Dr Phillips claimed to have been given an empty oxygen
       cylinder. This is dealt with in paragraphs 14 to 16 of
       Appendix 6 of Lord Justice Taylor’s Interim Report
       which concludes that Dr Phillips may have been mistaken
       as to the cylinder of which he complains being empty.
12.5   The last sentence of paragraph 12 of the Memorial is
       not borne out by the evidence.           There was no
       significant lack of equipment, let alone such as would
       have contributed to the deaths of some of the deceased.




                           6
13.   There is now produced and shown to me marked "AP4" an extract
      from the submissions made to Lord Justice Taylor on behalf of
      the ambulance service. They respond to criticisms made by Dr
      Ashton ("Dr A") and Dr Phillips ("Dr P").       The detailed
      response to Dr Phillips' complaint about a lack of a
      defibrillator appears on pages 4 to 6 of AP4.

      Dr Ashton
14.   The memorial1s account of Dir Ashton1s evidence is misleading
      and fails to take account of what he said in giving evidence
      to the Taylor Inquiry. It also fails to take account of the
      findings of Lord Justice Taylor. The memorial claims that by
      3.35 pm only one ambulance had arrived at Leppings Lane. In
      cross examination Dr Ashton accepted that the video evidence
      showed that by 3.30 pm at least four ambulances had attended
      at the back of Leppings Lane. There is now produced and shown
      to me marked "AP5" a true copy of the transcript of Dr Ashton's
      evidence to the Taylor Inquiry and I would refer to the page
      numbered 121. I would also refer to the first four pages of
      exhibit AP4 which deals with each of Dr Ashton's complaints.

15.   In paragraph 296 of the Interim Report, Lord Justice Taylor
      stated - "The only attack on SYMAS came from two Liverpool
      doctors. One claimed that ambulances did not arrive swiftly
      or with sufficient equipment and that there was a lack of
      triage.   He was proved to be wrong in all three respects.
      Unfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 15 April
      when he said more lives could have been saved if staff and
      equipment had arrived earlier. Apart from being proved wrong
      in fact as to the times of arrival of ambulances, he conceded
      in evidence that it was not possible to say whether lives could
      have been saved.         His comments on television were
      irresponsible".

16 . In the circumstances,    it is clearly wrong to conclude, as
      paragraph 13(h) of the memorial does, that Dr Ashton’s evidence



                                  7
raises the issue that lives might have been saved by a more
timely response.

Mr Eccleston
Paragraph 14 of the memorial refers to Mr Eccleston's evidence.
He is described by Lord Justice Taylor as an impressive witness
 [Appendix 6 paragraph 8]. Unlike Dr Ashton, Mr Eccleston went
to lend assistance as soon as he realised that people were
hurt. This was when the match was stopped, namely 15.05. His
description of what he found when he arrived at the area behind
the goal was consistent with all the other evidence from the
video films and the other witnesses who gave evidence. There
is now produced to me and marked "AP6" what I am informed and
believe to be a true copy of the transcript of the evidence Mr
Eccleston gave to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry. It is clear
that his recollection at the time when he made his statement
quite understandably was not entirely accurate as to the time
at which certain events had taken place. He makes no criticism
at all of the response by SYMAS. His references to lack of
equipment are references to St John Ambulance at an early stage
in the proceedings, and his reference to lack of leadership are
a reference to the police actions after the match had been
stopped.    In my respectful submission the effect of his
evidence was fully considered by Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry,
and does not support the Applicants' case that the lives of
their relatives may have been saved.

It is clear that, with the possible exception of one point, to
which I refer in paragraph 24 below, Dr Phillips, Dr Ashton and
Mr Eccleston are not able to give evidence that directly
relates to the deaths of any of the six victims whose inquests
are the subject of these proceedings. Whilst I do understand
the feelings of the families of the six victims, I am also
concerned for the welfare of my officers and men.          This
Honourable court ought to be aware that the events of that day
had a considerable effect upon the ambulancemen and women who
attended the ground. Trained and experienced in all sorts of
       emergencies as they are, what they had to endure that day took
       a toll upon -their physical and mental welfare that bare
       statistics hardly begin to describe.       Seventy-four SYMAS
       personnel attended Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.     The vast
      majority of them received counselling in the days following the
      disaster, and many received further therapy.       Whilst I am
      unable to put a figure on the sick leave that resulted from the
      effects of the disaster on ambulance personnel, I believe that
      a significant amount of such sick leave arose. Great care was
      taken to help those who were called to give evidence and thus
      had to relive the events in detail. I do not want to labour
      this point because I do sympathise with the families, and I do
      understand their desire to find out what happened. The awful
      fact, however, is that where there is no direct eye witness to
      any particular person's death, much will remain a matter of
      inference and speculation. To hold the equivalent of another
      Inquiry will not reveal to the Applicants any more than what
      is already known, but it will have a devastating effect upon
      those who may be called to give evidence again some five years
      later (by the time another Inquest could be arranged).     If I
      believed that some useful purpose could be served, I would
      support such a course of action.    But I do not believe that
      another investigation would serve any purpose, and certainly
      not on the basis of the ill informed criticisms which were
      fully canvassed before Lord Justice Taylor.

19.   Paragraph 15(ii). There is no evidence at all, and certainly
      none advanced by the Applicants in their Memorial, that the
      emergency services were slow to respond to the plight of the
      injured. SYMAS received the call for their services at 15.07,
      and the first ambulance was at the stadium at the Leppings Lane
      Entrance at 15.13, and another at the Penistone Road entrance
      at 15.17. The only basis for the allegation in this paragraph
      is that of Dr Ashton, and his observations were refuted by the
      logs produced by SYMAS to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry. The
      other wide ranging criticisms in this paragraph also emanate
      from the same witness, and were found to be unsustainable when


                                  9
      the evidence of the video films and the other witnesses was
      considered.

20.   In paragraphs 18 to 22, the memorial gives some detail of the
      evidence relating to the deaths of the six victims whose
      inquests are the subject of the applications for Judicial
      Review. I shall comment on each in turn.


      Pawl Carlisle
21.   The Applicants have produced a report of Dr West of the
      Department of Forensic Medicine of Guy's Hospital.     In his
      report Dr West refers to two different types of traumatic
      asphyxia. The first type is "classic" traumatic asphyxia. He
      doesn't give a label to the second type.

22.   Dr West states that most of the individuals who suffer from the
      classic form of traumatic asphyxia do not survive if they are
      severely affected and not rescued rapidly.

23.   Dr West's report indicates that Paul Carlisle suffered from
      "classic" traumatic asphyxia.    Even if he was alive after
      3.15pm it seems highly unlikely that he could have survived.

24.   The evidence indicates that Paul Carlisle was taken to the
      Leppings Lane area, perhaps about 10 minutes or so before Dr
      Ashton arrived in that area.   It does, however, seem likely
      that Dr Ashton saw Paul Carlisle and decided that he was dead
      and that there was therefore no point in him being placed in
      an ambulance or taken to hospital.

      Ian Glover
25.   I can see nothing in the information contained in the memorial
      and its supporting documents that justifies the suggestion that
      Ian Glover might have survived had there been a "more timely"
      attempt at resuscitation.




                                 10
      Michael Kellv
26.   I can see nothing in the information contained in the memorial
      and its supporting documents that justifies, the suggestion that
      Michael Kelly's death was preventable and that he died because
      of some shortcomings in the care he received after he was
      handed over to the St John's Ambulance Service.

      Kevin Williams
27.   Dr" West puts Kevin Williams in the category’ of ''olassi©"
      traumatic asphyxia, and even if he was alive after 3.15pm, it
      seems highly unlikely that he could have survived.

      Richard Jones
28.   Dr West indicates that Richard Jones suffered from "classic"
      traumatic asphyxia, and there is nothing to indicate that he
      was alive after 3.15pm. In the light of Dr West's expert view,
      even if Richard Jones was alive after 3.15pm, it seems highly
      unlikely that he could have survived.

      Peter Tootle
29.   The memorial does not suggest that there is any evidence that
      Mr Tootle was alive after 3.15pm. Furthermore, Dr West accepts
      that the evidence given to the inquest was consistent with a
      degree of "classic" traumatic asphyxia.

30.   Paragraph 23 (ii). In this paragraph, the applicants repeat
      their earlier assertions but in more positive terms. There is
      no evidence to support these allegations and I respectfully ask
      the Court to reject them as a basis for granting the Applicants
      the relief they seek.     While it is true that Lord Justice
      Taylor found that the police might have called SYMAS earlier
      if they had appreciated the true nature of the difficulties
      behind the goal at the Leppings Lane end, there was no
      suggestion ever made that once called, SYMAS were slow to
      respond. I do not understand the basis for the assertion on
      oath that "the evidence was very strong that there had been
      shortcomings   in the   response   of   the emergency   services."


                                  11
      Furthermore I do not understand the basis for asserting that
      such shortcomings played any part at all in the causation of
      any of the deaths of the Applicants' relatives.            More
      particularly, there is no evidence to suggest that any of these
      six lives could have been saved by more prompt medical
      attention.

31.   Paragraphs 23(iii) and (iv). There is no evidence to support
      the assertions in these paragraphs that there may have been
       "some failure in medical attention" nor that the deaths were
      preventable "by suitable emergency response".

32.   Paragraph 24(i).      There is no evidence to support the
      suggestion that the response of the emergency services was not
      adequate, and thus there is no basis for an inquiry into
      whether the deaths of any of the Applicants’ relatives might
      have been prevented by "more prompt and adequate medical
      intervention". It is a fairly safe assumption that if SYMAS
      had been summoned earlier then its ambulancemen and women would
      have started their rescue work earlier than they were able.
      It is arguable that they may have saved more lives had they
      been on the scene earlier, but there is no evidence at all to
      support any suggestion that SYMAS was dilatory in its response
      to the emergency call: on the contrary the facts demonstrate
      the swiftness of their response.     In those circumstances I
      respectfully submit that the Applicants' argument rests solely
      upon the allegations made by Dr Ashton and Dr Phillips.

33. I respectfully submit that the basis of the Applicants'
    submissions are not supported by the evidence.      The Taylor
     Interim Report states that the ambulance service responded
    quickly and efficiently and I think it appropriate that I quote
    from paragraphs 297 and 298 of that report:
     " 297. I find that all three of the emergency services named
            above responded promptly when alerted,       that they
            brought appropriate equipment and that their personnel
            operated efficiently.


                                 12
        298. It would be unreasonable to expect, at any sports
             stadium, medical facilities capable of dealing with a
             major disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at
             the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, other
             equipment and medical staff sufficient to deal with
             over 100 casualties is not practicable. "

34.   The memorial refers to examples of "successful resuscitation"
      but the memorial puts forward no evidence that anyone who
      suffered a cardiac arrest subsequently survived.       On the
      contrary, the BMJ article states that no one who arrived at
      hospital, having suffered a cardiac arrest, ultimately
      survived.

                            THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
                                        15 APRIL 1989

                                           I N T E R IM R E P O R T O F IN Q U IR Y


                                                       IN T R O D U C T IO N

    1. O n 15 A pril 1989 a football m atch to decide a semi-final round o f the FA C up com petition was to be
 played between th e Liveroool an d N ottingham Forest Clubs. T he neutral venue chosen was Hillsborough
 Football Stadium . Sheffield W ednesday's ground. Only six m inutes into the game, play was stopped when it
 was realised th a t spectators o n th e terraces behind the Liverpool goal had been severely crushed. In the result.
 95 died a n d over 4 0 0 received hospital treatm ent.

   2. O n 17 April 19891 was ap p o in ted by you to c a m out an Inquiry with the following term s o f reference:

       To inquire into the events at Sheffield W ednesday football ground on 15 April 1989 and to m ake
       reco m m en d atio ns about the needs o f crowd control and safety at sports events.

   3. Two Assessors were ap p oin ted to assist me: M r Brian Jo h n so n Q PM . C h ief C onstable o f Lancashire,
an d Professor Leonard M a u n d e r OBE. BSc. PhD . ScD. FEne. FI Mech E. Professor o f M echanical
Engineering at the U niversity o f Newcastle upon Tyne. Their help has been invaluable an d 1 am very grateful
for their expert advice a n d wise counsels. W hile the soie responsibility tor this report is m ine. 1 am comforted
in the knowledge th at both Assessors agree with it.

  4. M r R obert W halley was app o in ted Secretary to the Inquiry. H e an d his assistants have worked
prodigiously and skilfully to give m e all the advice and support 1 could have wished. 1 also wish to acknowledge
the help 1 have received, as always, from my clerk. M r Ernest Pott.

   5. T he policing arrangem ents for 15 April were in the hand s o f the South Yorkshire Constabulary. T he
efficacy o f those arrangem ents an d th eir im plem entation was from an early stage called into question. It was
therefore decided that the investigation o f the disaster and the gathering o f evidence for this Inquiry' should be
conducted by an in dep en den t police force. M r Geoffrey D ear Q PM . C hief Constable o f West M idlands
Constabulary, undertook this task. He was m a d e responsible directly to me: he ap p oin ted Assistant C hief
Constable M ervvn Jones to take full-time charge o f the investigation. 1 am deepiy indebted to both o f them.

   6. O n 18 April I visited Hillsborough Stadium . 1 inspected the scene o f the disaster on the terraces and all
relevant parts o f th e stadium an d its approaches. My Assessors and 1 have m ade further visits during the
Inquiry. I also visited Liverpool on 21 an d 29 April.

       The Lord M ayor and the Sheffield City Council kindiy offered to m ake the accom m od atio n and facilities
o f Sheffield Town Hall available for the hearing oforai evidence. T his ott’c r was gratefully accepted and 1would
like to record my thanks for those facilities an d for the co-operation afforded to the Inquiry by the authorities
in Sheffield.

   S.    O n 28 April 1989.1 held a p relim inary hearing to announce the d ate when the oral evidence would begin,
to give som e d irections as to the procedure 1 intended to follow a n a to n ear applications from those wishing to
be represented at the hearing. 1 accorded representation to the following:
     (1)      T hose bereaved o r injured as a resuit o f trie disaster.
     (ii)     The Football Supporters' Association.
     (iii)    T he Football Association.
     ( I V)   Sheffield Cu> Councii.
     (v>      Sheffield W ednesday Football Club together with the Football League, the C lub's casual staff and
              th eir insurers, the Sun Alliance.
     <V I )South Yorkshire C onstabulary
     (vii) South Yorkshire Fire and Civil Defence A uthority
  Subsequently, d u rin g the hearing. I further accorded representation to:
        (viii) T ren t Regional H ealth Authority, for the South Yorkshire M etropolitan A m bulance Service
               (SYMAS).
  a n d (ix)   D r W Eastwood, consultant engineer to Sheffield W ednesday Football Club.

      9. Since the circum stances o f the disaster raised urgent questions o f safety, especially at football grounds,
  you indicated a t the outset th a t you would welcome any recom m endations, even o f an interim nature, which I
  m ight be able to give in advance o f the new football season d ue to com m ence in mid-August 1 9 8 9 .1 therefore
  a n n ou n ced a t th e prelim inary hearing on 28 April that 1 would conduct an oral hearing w ith all possible
  expedition as th e first phase o f th e Inquiry to discover the tacts an d causes o f the disaster and enable m e to
  m ake any im m ediate interim reco m m en d atio ns necessary in the short term.

    10. T h e West M idlands Police investigation began on 24 April. A “ Freephone" n u m b e r was ad v e rtise d to
 enable m em bers o f th e public, especially those who had atten d ed the m atch, to offer their evidence to the
 Inquiry. Initially this n u m b e r was available for three days on 28 different lines. T he response from the public
 was such th a t the lines were continued for a fu n n e r tnree days by th e en d o f which 2.666 calls had been
 received. T h ere were also m any w ritten offers o f help. Some 440 West M idlands officers were deployed on the
 Inquiry. To service this operation, special poiice offices were established in Birm ingham . Liverpool and
 Sheffield a n d c om p u te r technology was used to the full. In all som e 3776 statem ents were taken. T here were
 also som e 1550 letters to M inisters, to the Inquiry and to m e personally all o f which 1 read. T he police.
 Sheffield W ednesday Football C lub an d the BBC had video cam eras filming at the ground on 15 April. In
 aggregate, they recorded som e 71 hours o f film covering the period before, during an d after the disaster. T hus
 the m aterial gathered and potentially available for presentation at the oral hearing was enorm ous. From this
 m ass it was essential to select only sufficient good and reiiabie ev idence necessary to establish the facts and
 causes o f th e disaster.

    11. W here it seem ed likely th a t any allegation o r criticism might be m ade o f the conduct o f any person o r
 party, the Treasury Solicitor, after consultation with Counsel for the Inquiry, wrote to the party concerned
 setting o u t th e likely grounds for com plaint. This foliowea the practice established by the Royal C om m ission
 on T ribunals o f Inquiry (the S alm on Commission).

     12. T h e h earing began on 15 May. It continued, sitting lone hours, for 31 days concluding o n 29 June. In
 th a t period. 174 w itnesses gave oral evidence. Counsel s supm issions were delivered in w riting on 7 July and
 on 14 July I heard th eir b riefo ral subm issions suppiem enting tne w ritten argum ent.

  13. Witnesses were not sworn. Since this is a departm ental inquiry, there was no power to a d m in ister the
oath but there was no instance o f any witness giving evidence which 1 considered m ight nave been different
had he o r she been sworn.

   14. The witnesses called were only a small fraction o f those from w hom statem ents were o r could have been
taken. Nevertheless. 1 am satisfied that they were sufficient in n u m b e r and reliability to enable m e to reach the
necessary conclusions. To have called m ore would nave prevented m e from presenting an interim report in the
required tim e an d would not have added significantly to tne relevant evidence. 1 have, however, been able to
take into account m any w ritten statem ents in addition to orai testimony.

    15. A part from the evidence called by Counsel for m e in a u iry which was draw n from statem ents taken by
the West M idlands Police and others volunteered b> indi viauais. each o f the represented parties was given full
o p p o rtu n ity to pu t forward any w itnesses they consiaerea snouid be called. A final subm ission was m ade by
Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police that since tne investigation by West M idlands Police is still continuing,
all the evidence has not been assem bled and n wouid be unsafe tor m e to m ake findings o f fact. 1 should
therefore m ake clear that the investigation continues p rm c ip a ih to furnish as m uch detail as possible to H M
C oroner for the City o f Sheffield as to the cause oi aeatn. the precise position at death and the care and
m ovem ent o f each o f the 95 victim s individually 1 am assured by C hief Constable D ear and Assistant C hief
C onstable M e m n Jones that it is m ost uniikei> an\ m rtn er evidence garnered will significantly alter o r ad d to
the history o f events which emerged at the nearini;.

  16. 1 should like to thank all those who m ade n rossipie ior tne oral hearing to take piace so soon after the
event and for evidence to be efficiently presented ana lesiea so as to give a full and fair account o f what
happened in all its aspects w ithout irrelevancy or au n n cau o n . i pay tribute particularly to the West M idlands
Police for their speed and dedication in earnerm:: me evidence and to all those responsible for processing it.
 T h e m o st eloquent trib u te to th e fairness a n d thoroughness o f th e police investigation cam e from th e Secretary
 o f th e Football Sup po rters’ A ssociation. H e said there had been initial anxiety in Liverpool as to w heth er th a t
 investigation wouid be fair a n d objective. H is A ssociation therefore collected 200 witness statem ents
 them selves. H aving h e a rd th e o pen in g statem ent by Counsel to th e in q u iry based up o n th e evidence gathered
 by th e police, he fou nd th a t it acco rd ed entirely w ith his A ssociation’s evidence a n d th e initial anxiety was
 wholly dispelled.

   17. Before a n d d u rin g th e In q uiry I derived great assistance o n a wide range o f technical issues from the
H ealth a n d Safety Executive w ho providentially have a laboratory in Sheffield (the Research a n d Laboratory
Services D ivision) w here tests were co nducted a n d re p o n s p re p a re d swiftly a n d efficiently. T h is was d o n e
in close consultation w ith Professor M aunder. 1 am m ost grateful to the Director. D r A Jones, a n d to the
D e p u ty Director. D r C E N icholson, for th e ir invaluable help.

    18. I' wish to c o m m e n d Counsel to the               M r A ndrew Collins Q C. M r Alan G oldsack a n d M r
Bernard Phillips for th e ir industry, care a n d fairness in selecting a n d presenting th e necessary evidence: also.
Counsel for all those represented w ho tested th a t evidence fully bu t expeditiously. T his in te rim R eport could
n o t possibly have been p rep ared in so s h o n a tim e h a d 1 noi h a d th e whole-hearted co-operation o f all those
m en tio n ed a n d m an y others.

   19. T h e second phase o f th e Inq u iry will be directed to m aking final a n d long term reco m m en datio ns about
crowd control a n d safety at sports grounds. 1 need to consider in d e p th inform ation, o p inio ns a n d argum ents
from a w ide range o f sources a n d contributors both here a n d abroad. It was clear from th e outset th a t this
second phase could no t be carried to com pletion before th e next football season. However, a t an early stage o f
the oral hearing I invited evidence from all who wished to contribute to it a n d specifically from m an y sporting,
local authority, em ergency service an d police bodies as well as technical consultants. 1 asked th a t subm issions
should be in w riting a n d should be m a d e prom ptly so th a t th e second phase o f th e in q u iry could
follow im m ediately a fter the first. 1 shall now proceed to consider the large body o f w ritten evidence which has
been subm itted. I shall w ant in so m e instances to have further oral evidence o r discussion in conjunction with
m y Assessors. We will also need to m ake a n u m b e r o f visits a n d inspections.

   20. I now p resen t my interim R eport a n d R ecom m endations. 1 shall prepare m y Final R eport an d
R eco m m en datio ns as soon as reasonably possible.

                                                       CHAPTER 1

                             THE GROUND AND PRE-MATCH ARRANGEMENTS

  Fixing The Venue
     21. O n 20 M arch 1989. th e Football Association (the FA) requested that their C up semi-final between
  Liverpool a n d N ottin g ham Forest be held on 15 April at Hillsborough Football Stadium . T he corresponding
  semi-final between the sam e two team s had been held there in April 1988. The arrangem ents had been
  successful in the view both o f the police an d o f the host club. Sheffield Wednesday (the Club) were therefore
  willing to accom m o date the 1989 m atch. South Yorkshire C onstabulary were prepared to police it but only if
  the ticketing arrangem ents were the sam e as those for 1988. Otherwise, the FA would have to look elsewhere.
  T hose arrangem ents did not please Liverpool o r its supporters either in 1988 o r 1989. T hey thought the ticket
  allocation was u n fa ir for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the poiice requirem ent was
  accepted an d the m atch was fixed for 15 April at Hillsborough.

  The Ground
    22. T h e H illsborough Stadium is some 2:; miles to the north-west o f central Sheffield in the district o f
  Owlerton. T h e ground was opened in 1899 on what was tnen a greenfield site by the river Don. T he pitch lies
  roughly east to west. A plan o f the ground and its im m ediate environs is at Appendix 1.

   23. T he west end. with which this Inquiry is principally concerned. is known as the Leppings Lane end. The
 east end abuts on Penistone Road, the A 61. To the south is the river D on and to the north a residential street.
 Vere Road, which runs between Leppings Lane an d Penistone Road North.

    24. Alongside the river is a private roadway giving access to the south stand, to the D irectors' an d players'
 entrances, an d to the adm inistrative block u nd er tne stand. The roadway gives both vehicular a n d pedestrian
 access between Penistone R oad a n d Leppings Lane, but there are gates which can shut it o ff at each end. There
 is som e car parking along this roadway principally for Directors, players and employees o f the Club. T he south
 stand dates from 1914 and is th e oldest at the ground, h is all seating with places for 8.800. 5.500 o f those are
 roofed over a n d 3.300 are uncovered.

   25. T he north stand is also all seating and accom m odates about 9.700. Behind it is a gymnasium o r sports
 hall. T here are also a first aid room an d police room close by

    26. T he east end is all terracing a n d is known as the Spion k o p . It was enlarged and rooted over in 1986 and
 now accom m odates som e 21.000 standing spectators. T here arc crush barriers in the Kop running parallel to
 th e goal line but no d iv id in g fences to prevent tree m ovem ent trom side to side.

   27. At the west o r Leppings Lane end o f the ground there is terracing close to the pitch. Behind it is the west
stand which provides covered seating and was built in 1965 tor World C ud matcncs. som e o f which were held
at H illsborough in 1966. T he covered stand accom m odates 4.45o seated spectators. The terracing in front o f it
extends higher in th e corners between the stanas anu its totai capacity was stated to be 1U. 100. At both the Kop
end a n d the west end access to the pitch is oarrcd by perim eter fencing. The fencing is about eight feet high
m o un ted upon th e low wall at the toot o f the terracing. At tne too o f the fencing the wire returns back at a sharp
angle for som e 15 inches to m ake it difficult tor anyone to ciimn oyer towards the pitch. T here are gates at
intervals along the perim eter fencing to afford access between terrace and pitch. These gates are less th an a
m etre wide a n d were designed to be opened oni\ ironi the nitcn side lor noiice purposes o r in an emergency.
T hey are m arked a n d num bered on the pian Appendix i .

   28. Unlike the Kop end. the west terracing has not oni\ erusn carriers parallel with tne goal line but radial
fences at right angles to it. dividing the area into nens. Tins o n ision was begun alter an FA C up semi-final in
 1981 when crushing occurred due to overcrowding anu cates n a a to ne ooened. It proceeded in stages, the final
arrangem ent beingshow n on the plan A ppendix ! T.'ie urst section oi the west terracing moving south to north
contains gates I a n d 2 a n d is known as pens i an c I altnougn in tact constituting oniy one pen. Next is pen 3
with on e gate: next pen 4 with one gate: pen       wmcn is extrcmeiy narrow, was intended as a stcriie area to
d ivide pen 4 trom pen 6. This was 10 isolate nome and aw-ay fans on occasions wnen both mient be
accom m odated on the west terracing in separate oens. Finaih m ere isoen " at the north-west corner. Pens 5. t
and 7 each have a perim eter gate. At tne oack of the pens, unu er m e ironi of the west stand, there is a gate in
  each radial fence. W hen th ose gates are open, the back row o f the terracing is intended to p erm it access from
  pen to pen along the whole west side. In practice, when substantial num bers are present, those gateways are not
  readily visible o r accessible. T h e present layout o f the pens, fences, crush barriers a n d gates has resulted from a
  series o f piecem eal changes. T h e n a tu re and effect o f those changes m ust be considered later.

  The Turnstiles
    29. Because o f th e housing in Vere Road there is no access from the north side o f the ground. Along
  P enistone R oad N o rth there are som e 46 turnstiles which usually give access both to the Kop a n d to the east
  end o f th e north stand. T h ey are m arked 43 to 88 inclusive on the plan. T he 12 n um b ered 77 to 88 are designed
  to feed th e n orth stand but were not used for th at purpose on 15 April in o rd e r to segregate supporters o f the
  two team s as appears later. Two o f them . 77 a n d 78. were however used for access to the Kop.

    30. At. th e south side o f the ground there were 24 turnstiles in um bered 19 to 42 on the plan). Those
  nu m b ered 37 to 42 led to the Kop an d the rest to the south stand.

   31. In summary, th e so uth a n d east sides o f the ground acco m m od ated som e 29.800 whose access on the
 day was through 60 turnstiles.

   32. T he o th e r two sides o f the ground, north and west, with a capacity o f 24.256 were ted solely from the
 Leppings Lane entrance w here there were only 23 turnstiles.

 Travel to the Ground
    33. Most supporters were expected to com e by road although rail transport was available. N ottingham
 su pporters travelling by tra m would arrive at the m ain line Sheffield M idland Station whence they would be
 directed a n d escorted north w ard s by the police. They would arrive at the ground along Penistone Road.
 N ottingham supporters travelling by coach, m ini-bus or car would approach Sheffield from the south m ainly
 on th e M 1. Again th eir arrival at the ground would p redom inantly be via Penistone Road o r H e m e s Road.

    34. Liverpool supporters travelling by norma) rail service would arrive at Sheffield M idland Station iust
 like th eir N ottingham counterparts. T he poiice aim ed to segregate the rival fans a n d put them into separate
 coaches. Liverpool fans could alternatively travel by special train to Wadsley Bridge, a British Rail station
 catering soleiv for football supporters an d situated to the north o f the ground. A police escort was available to
 conduct them on foot to the Leppings Lane entrance. Those com ing trom Liverpool by road w ould approach
 Sheffield e ither via the M 62 a n d down the M 1 from tne north or across the Pennines from the north w-est. All
 such routes would bring them to the ground via one o r other lim b o f Leppings Lane as shown on A ppendix I .
 Broadly, therefore, arrivals from Liverpool would be from the north and west: arrivals from N ottingham
 would be from th e south a n d east.

Allocation of Places and Tickets
   35. Experience in recent years has produced a policy ot segregation to prevent trouble between supporters
o f rival teams. T he need for this poiicy to be m ain tain ed was endorsed an d em phasised by the Poppiewell
R eport following the Bradford City disaster in 1985. Accordingly, before the 1986 semi-final the police decided
that sections o f the Hillsborough Stadium should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation o f
Liverpool an d N ottingham Forest fans. T he section to be granted to each was determ ined by th e direction
w hence each p redom inantly approached. Thus. Liverpool were allotted the north a n d west sides o f the ground
forw h ich access was from Leppings Lane. N ottingham Forest were allotted the south a n d east sides with access
from Penistone Road.

    36. T he effect o f th e decision was that for this all-ticket I up Tie. Liverpool were a llo tted only 24.256 places
as against 29.800 for N ottingham Forest. T his, altnougn average atten d ance or supporters at hom e m atches
was substantially higher at Liverpool than at N ottingham . Moreover, with standing tickets at £ b a n d seats at
£12. N ottingham Forest had 21.0UU standing D i a c e s com pared with Liverpool's lu .lu u . So. Liverpool's
allocation was m ore expensive as well as smaller. L n a e rsta n d a b h . Liverpool were aggrieved by the allocation
o f places and tickets. They sought with som e support from tne nost c l u b and the FA to have it changed m
 1988. but the police w-ere a dam an t. To switch ends would, in their opinion, nave involved rival supporters
crossing each o th e r's p a th 1! when approaching the ground thereby frustrating attem pts at segregation a n d
creating a risk o f disorder. In 1989. when the sam e pian was proposed. Liverpool again challenged it. The
police, however, m ain tained their view, adding that tnose who had attended in I9kjs would be tam ilia rw ith the
a rra n g e m e n isa n d that any chance would lead to confusion.
 Access from Leppings Lane
    37. As the plan Appendix 1 shows, the approach to the west turnstiles is across a narrow neck o r forecourt at
 a bend in Leppings Lane w here, com ing from th e north, it tu rn s to the south-west a n d crosses a bridge over th e
 river Don. Parking areas for the L iverpool supporters had been arranged north and west o f th e ground. They
 were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both limbs o f Leppings Lane a n d would converge on the
 forecourt a t th e bend. In an arc across that forecourt is a line o f railings with six sets o f double gates, inside
 those perim eter gates is th e short approach to the turnstiles. As shown in the photographs A ppendix 2. the
 latter a re in tw o sections divided by a fence. T he northern section consists o f turnstiles 1 to 16. N um bers 1 to
  10 gave access to th e n orth stand. T hus there were 10 turnstiles for the 9.700 with north stand seats. T h eir
 tickets were m ark ed “Entrance A" a n d were colour-coded brown. Turnstiles 1 to 10 correspondingly had the
 letter A above them a n d brown boards on the wall.

    38. Turnstiles 11 to 16 were for those with seats in the west stand. T hus 4.456 were served by six turnstiles.
 T hey were th e next block to the right o f those m arked A. However, instead ofrhese turnstiles a n d tfre west stand
 tickets being m ark ed B as m ight alphabetically have been expected, they were m arked C. T heir colour-code on
 tickets a n d boards was red.

    39. O n the o th e r side o f the dividing fence in the approach area, there were only seven turnstiles to serve
  10.100 with tickets for th e west terracing. Those seven turnstiles were labelled A to G. T his was because there
 had originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings Lane an d the sequential num bering co ntinu ed from 19 upw ards
 on th e south side o f the ground. When the n um ber at Leppings Lane was brought up to 23 the present
 arrangem ents o f 1 to 1-6. A to G an d then 19 upwards was adopted to avoid re-num bering all rou n d the ground.
 However, above the lettering A to G was a large letter B. "E ntrance B” also appeared on tickets for the west
 terrace. Thus, the three blocks o f turnstiles encountered by a ticket holder at the Leppings Lane end read from
 left to right A. C. B. T h e colour-code for west terrace tickets a n d the boards beside turnstiles A to G was mauve.
 To th e right o f turnstile G is a tubular steel barrier to divide the queue tor that turnstile from the roadway to the
 south stand.

 Inside the Leppings Lane Turnstiles
   40. Turnstiles 1 to 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north stand. There is an exit gate (m arked A
 on A ppendix 1) between turnstile 1 and the adiacent housing.

  41. Inside turnstiles 1 to 16 is a concourse leading to pens o and 7 an d the steps to the west stand. T here is a
wall dividing this area from that inside turnstiles A to G. It had been built to segregate hom e an d away fans at a
tim e when the C lub intended they should share the west terrace. That idea was not pursued but the wall
rem ained. T here was. however, a gateway in the wali which did perm it access between the two areas. An exit
gate (m arked B on A ppendix i >was provided from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 1o.

   42. Finally, anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse hounded on the left by the wali iust
m en tio ned a n d on the right by the wall o f the private roadway coming irom the south stan d to Leppings Lane.
T h ere was an exit gate in the latter wall (m arked C on Appendix 1 1just inside turnstile G.

    43. All three exit gates. A. B a n d C'. were o f conccrtina design. They could be opened only from the inside
a n d were not intended for entry oi spectators into the ground

   44. T hose entering through turnstiles A to G had three options once inside the ground. They could by
moving to the right go rou n d the south end ol the west stand a n d gain en tr. into pens 1 an d 2. They couid go
through th e gap in the dividing wall towards the concourse behind lurnstties 11 to lo an d then rou nd the north
end o f the west stand into pens h o r ". However, tnere were no consm euous signs inviting them to take either o f
those courses. T h e obvious way in was straignt ahead o f the turnstiles where a tunnei u n d e r the middle o f the
west stand gave access to pens 3 a n d 4. Above its entrance in i n r i ; i d l e r s was the word "S tanding'' and a iarcv
letter “ B“ . Thus B ticket holders were drawn inwards tne tunne.

    45. The length o f the tunnel is som e 23 metres. It rises siiehm at tirst men levels ot: but tinalh d escend1'

them was effected by a series oi piecemeal vnangev Again, n uiii ne necessary toanaiyse tneir resultant effect
  Policing Arrangements
     47.      At the 1988 semi-final, policing had been u n der the control o f C h ief Su p erintend en t Mole, then
  C o m m a n d e r o f F D ivision w ithin w hose area Hillsborough lies. H e was still in post .on 20 M arch 1989 when
  th e FA broached th e 1989 semi-final, but he was due to han d over c o m m a n d o f F D ivision on 27 M arch to
  Superin ten d ent D uckenfield on th e la tter’s prom otion to C hief Sup erinten den t. Both were p resent at an initial
  m eeting on 22 M arch, but on 27 M arch M r Mole bowed out a n d M r D uckenfield took over. U n d e r him were
  Sector C om m anders, all S up erin tend en ts with m uch experience o f policing football m atches at H illsborough
  an d elsewhere. In particular. S up erin ten dent Marshall was in charge o f th e area outside the Leppings Lane
  en tran ce an d th e approaches to it. Superinten den t G reenw ood was in c o m m a n d inside th e ground, bu t this
  included the area between th e turnstiles a n d the perim eter fence. They thereby sw apped roles from the
  previous year. U n d e r M r D uckenfield’s overall com m and were som e 801 officers a n d m en on duty at the
 g round plus traffic officers an d others from D Division to deal with the influx o f supporters into the city centre,
  hr*all. therefore. som e 1; 122 police were deployed io r this m atch a m o u nting to a bout 38 p e r c e n t o f the total*
 South Yorkshire force. Included in th e m o un ted section o f 34 were officers from Liverpool a n d N ottingham to
 assist respectively in marshalling th eir hom e supporters. The total at the ground was divided into serials
 consisting usually o f eight to ten C onstables d Ius a Sergeant and an Inspector. T he serials were posted to duties
 at various stations in an d around the ground in three onases: before, during and after the m atch. All o f this
 was provided for in an O perational O rd e r which followed cioseiy the O rd e r drawn up for the 1988 semi-final
 and took into account the force's “Standing Instructions for the Policing o f Football G ro un d s". T he O rd er
 described the duties o f each serial at each phase. It was supplem ented by oral briefings before an d on the day o f
 th e m atch.

 Sheffield Wednesday s Arrangem ents
  48. T h e Club provided 376 stewards, gatemen and turnstile operators for duty on 15 April. T h e stewards
were briefed as to th eir duties on the m orning o f the m atch by police Inspectors an d were allocated round the
ground. T hey wore yellow tabards. T h e Club's control room , situated below the south stand, could
com m un icate by V H F radio with the stewards. Ciosed circuit television was installed by the Club with
screens in their control room showing all the turnstiles rou n d the ground. A com puterised counting system was
incorporated in the turnstiles. T his flashed onto a screen in the Club control room the running total o f
spectators passing through the turnstiles section b> te c n o n . Thus, at the Leppings Lane end, there would be
separate running totals for turnstiles 1 to iO ino rth stand), turnstiles 11 to 16<west stand), and turnstiles A to G
(west terraces). W hen th e total for any section was witnin 15 per cent o f its perm itted capacity a warning pulse
showed on the screen. For the west terracing that warning wouid occur when the num bers were w ithin 15 per
cent o f the total terrace capacity o f 10.100. W hat the system couid n ot do was m o n ito r the distrib ution o f fans
on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give no warning tnerefore if one pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

Police Communications
   49. T h e nerve centre for police controi is the control room or pox situated at the south-west co rner of the
g round between the south stand a n d pen 1 ot the west terracing. The box is elevated an d reached by a num b er
o f steps. It has windows c o m m an din g views across tne pitch and straight along the line o f the west perim eter
fence. T h e box is very small and has seats for only tnree officers. Superinten den t M urray was in control o f it
and was ad viso r to M r D uckenfield as he had been to Mr Mole the year before. Next to him sat Sergeant
G o d d a rd who operated the radios. T h e third seat was for Police I onstable Ryan who operated the telephone
and public address systems. At the back o f the box stood Poiice l onstable Bichard who was in control o f the
police closed circuit television system operated by a row oi consoies on a bench in front o f him an d behind the
three seated officers.

   50. T h ere were five television screens snowing mows ot' m e roving cam eras fixed at high points on the
stands and directed both inside an d outside the ground. There was also a m aster screen which flicked in
rotatio n from one cam era view' to a n o th e r and whicn m ad e a n ideo recording. T h e cam cras have a zoom
facility to close in on any point o f interest. specificali\. tncre were uoou cam era views ot the west terracing, of
the Leppings Lane turnstiles and beyond them o f Lernm gs Lane itself.

  51. T he Tannoy public address system was rcia\eo tnm ugn sneakers fixed at vantage points inside the
ground an d outside the turnstiles. It was used b\ a uisc iockcv nouseu und er the poiice control box. to reia>
m usic before the m atch, but n could be overridden ny ihe police. Messages could be relayed tnrough all
speakers o r if app ro priate to one area only
   53.    Radio contact at Hillsborough from control to serials operating both inside and outside the ground was
UHF on channel 25. There was a W1 FU portable base station in the control box and if it failed there was a
stand-by station under the operator’s bench. Hand sets were issued to all ranks o f Sergeant and above.
Community Constables on duty would already have their own. Other Constables had no radio.
Communication was on “talk through’*i.e. any message from any source would be heard by everyone tuned in
and if more than one source spoke messages could become garbled. Ear pieces were issued to some officers in
an attempt to overcome the loud crowd noise which made receipt o f signals very difficult. There were other
radio channels open to Sergeant Goddard: VHF to police Headquarters at Snig Hill, channel 35 to FI
Sub-divisional Headquarters at Hammerton Road and channel 19 used by C1D. There was also a set tuned to
Sheffield Wednesday’s radio system between its control room and the stewards.

                                      15th APRIL: THE BUILD-UP TO 2.30pm

 Early Arrivals
    54. 15 April 1989 was a w arm sunny spring Saturday. T h e m atch was a sell-out. so 54.000 ticket holders
 were expected. O thers would com e w ithout tickets hoping to acquire them o r even to gain access otherwise.
 T h e following account concentrates, as did the evidence, on the western approaches and the Liverpool
 supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. They began to a m ve in the Hillsborough area qu ite early in
 small num bers. Som e brought cans o f beer with them an d were seen drinking as they walked: others took
 advantage o f the w eather an d sat about on walls and open spaces. W hen the public houses opened, m any
 resorted there, d rinking inside o r spilling out into the sunshine. Leppings Lane and its environs com prise a
 m ixed sh o p p in g a n d residential area. Local residents saw groups o f Liverpool supporters keen to fix u la public
 ho use or off-licence. M any were asking for tickets or "spares". T h ere were a few touts selling them at inflated
 prices. From an early stage, som e o f the fans were using private gardens and yards to urinate. As the m orning
 wore on. nu m bers increased. Requests for tickets and trespass to urinate also increased. Still the prevaiiing
 m o o d was one o f carnival, good h u m o u r and expectation.

 Public Houses
   55. T here were som e 74 shops with off-licences in and around Sheffield. In general, they opened at 8 am.
 Liverpool supporters did visit them but the evidence did not suggest a great am ount o f alcoholic drink was
 bought there.

   56. O pening tim e at public houses was in general 11 am. Some rem ained ciosed all day. O f the others, some
72. mostly in the city, were frequented b> iocal p a t r o n s only. Som e 23 public houses, however, served over a
h un d red Liverpool supporters each. A n o t h e r 5 i s e r v e d m o r e t h a n 20 each. Little trouble was reported, but
m any supporters d ra n k enough to affect their m o o d . At first excitement: later frustration.

The Gathering Crowd
   57. Towards the end o f the m orning, fans garnered on and a ro un d the o r d e e near tne Leppings Lane
entrance. T hey seemed reluctant to en ter tne ground earlv. All turnstiies were open at 12 noon and o ne o r two
as early as 11.30 am . Some 53 police had been deployed to operate outside tne turnstiles an d in the Leppings
Lane area. T hey enquired at random w hether fans nad tickets. Those who had not were advised to go away:
nevertheless, m any returned m ore than once. Those wno had tickets were guided in the right direction. T he
poiice tried to persuade tnem to enter the ground eariy Officers, male and female, had been posted outside
each turnstile with the d uty o f searching e ntrants lor weapons, drink o r drugs. Once through the turnstile, an
entrant w a sh a b le to be searched again by one of a serial o f officers positioned just inside.

   5S. At about 12 noon Chief Inspector Creaser asked Superintendent M urray w hether the pens on the west
terrace were to be filled one by one successive^. but was told that they should all be available from the start and
the fans should find their own level,

   59. By 2 pm it was ap p arent to those inside tne ground an d those m onitoring events in the poiice a n d Club
control room s that the n u m b er o f N ottingnam tans in tneir places greatly outnu m bered those from Liverpool.
The R od and the south stand were filling u p steadiiv but the north and west stands were half empty. It was
noted about that tim e that the turnstile figures snowed o ni\ 12.000 had entered as against 20.000 at the sam e
tim e the previous year, o n the west terraces, aitnougn nens 3 and 4 were filling, tne wing pens 1 .2 .0 and 7 were
nearly empty. At 2.15 pm a T anno\ message askea lans in pens 3 an d 4 to move forward and m ake room for
others,

  60. There had been tnree special trains irom Liverpool in W8<S. T his tim e, tnere was only one. It arrived
early, just before 2 pm . at Wadsie> Bridge station. Tne 35'» passengers were met by botn m ou n ted and foot
police officers who escorted tnem in a crocodile down Leppings Lane. They were orderly and passed through
the turnstiies into the ground n> aooul 2.2u om w itnout incident.

  6 !. B> tnis tim e the poiice Traffic D ivision reported tnat tne Liverpool routes were clear, so the m ajority o f
Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area The num ners converging on the Leppings Lane entrance were
increasing rapidly. Between tne perim eter gates and tne turnstiies tne crowd became congested. There was no
ionger a separate q ueue at eaen tu rn stiie b u t a single onaian.x filling tne whole approach area. T he foot officers
outside the turnstiles were no ionger abie to searcn e \e r \o n e a n a nad difficulty in searching even selectively
Mounted officers in and outside the turnstile area were having difficulty manoeuvring in such a dense crowd.
The poiice were beset by fans bemused by the ticket and turnstile labelling asking for directions. Many had
been drinking but up to and just after 2.30 pm the mood remained good.

   62.     Superintendent Marshall was on foot amongst the crowd. He became anxious about the numbers
coming down Leppings Lane and spilling out onto the roadway where buses and cars were moving. At 2.17
pm be radioed to control to have motor traffic in Leppings Lane stopped. This was eventually done at about
2.30 pm. Up to this time, despite the large mass outside the turnstiles and the numbers still approaching, there
was still no panic in the crowd; no perception o f crisis by the poiice. In the control room Mr Murray, who could
see Leppings Lane on the video, advised Mr Duckenfield that they would get everyone in by 3 pm. Mr
Duckenfield reaffirmed to him the policy about a delayed kick-off. It would be ordered only if there was some
major external factor such as fog on the Pennines or delay on the motorway: not if spectators merely turned up
late even in large numbers.

                                        THE CRISIS AT THE TURNSTILES

      63.     In the 20 m in utes from 2.30 p m to 2.50 pm there were crucial developm ents both inside a n d outside
  the ground. In pens 3 a n d 4 there was a steady increase in pressure as m ore fans cam e through the tunnel to the
  favoured area behind the goal. By 2.50 pm these pens were already full to a degree which caused sen o u s
  discom fort to m any well used to e n d u n n g pressure on terraces. T he num bers at that tim e were clearly in excess
  o f th e m ax im u m density stated by the H om e Office G uide to Safety at Sports G ro un d s (1986 Edn) (the G reen
  G uid e) i.e. 54 persons p e r 10 square m etres. <Although the G reen G u id e has no statutory o r legal force, it is the
  only official advice available a b o u t safety at sports grounds.) In the wing pens 1. 2. o a n d 7. there was still
  am ple room a n d bare patches o f concrete were visible.

     64: M eanwhile, th e crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance. As m ore arrived at the back the crush at the
  front grew worse. Entry to the turnstiles becam e m ore difficult. T h eir efficiency was im paired a n d their rate
  reduced. Arrivals at the back exceeded deliveries through the turnstiles, so the build-up increased. T he foot
  officers outside were unable to function a n d in danger themselves so they went through th e turnstiles and out
 again through gate C where they did w hat they could to relieve pressure by the tu b u lar barrier. T he m oun ted
 officers were su rro u n d e d by the dense m ass ot people and became ineffective. Superinten den t M arshall was in
 the m idst o f the turm oil. He extricated him self and stood on a parapet o f the bridge to get a clear view. A
 dru nk en fan tried to push him off: a beer can was thrown at a m o u nted officer. But these were isolated acts by
 individuals: the m enace cam e from the m assive num bers singie-m mdedly d eterm ined to be in for the kick-off
 with tim e running out. At the back o f the crowd fans were frustrated by the lack o f progress as 3 o'clock
 approached. Some, mostly young m en who had been drinking, tried to push a n d force their way forward. At
 the front, people were ja m m e d together a n d against the turnstile walls. Som e panicked as the pressure
 intensified. Some youngsters a n d w om en were fainting and in distress. They were helped ou t through the
 tu bu lar b arrier by turnstile G or were passed over the turnstiles elsewnere. Fans ciim bed up a n d over the
 turnstile building o r on to the dividing fence. T his was to escape the crush rather than to gain free entry since
 m ost o f them had tickets.

      65. At 2.44 pm M r Marshall radioed for reinforcements, tor the Tannoy to request the crowd to stop
   pushing a n d for a vehicle with loudspeaker equipm ent to come an d request the same. Unhappily, at about 2.40
  pm. radio c o m m un icatio n on channel 25 becam e detective. For a period of two o r three m inu tes the control
   room lost contact. A com m u nication s officer cam e prom ptly ana switched to the standby station. W ith the use
  o f a handset at control, contact was restored. D espite this hiatus, two o f M r M arshall's requests were received.
  T he Tannoy was used but with little effect. Reinforcem ents, including m o un ted officers from Penistone Road,
  were sent. T he th ird request, for a Landrover. was received direct by its d river PC Buxton w ho arrived at 2.46
  pm a n d urged the crowd by loudspeaker not to push. T his was no m ore effective than the Tannoy. The
  m o un ted officers besieged near the turnstiles cam e outside m e perim eter gates. An a ttem p t was m ade to shut
  them against the crowd outside, to enable the throng inside to be dispersed o r at ieasi th in n ed through the
  turnstiles. T h e pressure from w ithout, however, opened the gates again. M ounted officers, now reinforced to
  greater num bers, form ed a cordon across the elbow o f Leppings Lane from the sw-eet shop to the bridge, again
  with the object o f reducing pressure inside the gates. T ne\ were successful in this for som e m inutes despite
i desperate individuals forcing their way u n d e r o r oeuveen m e nurses. Howev er, this exercise was overtaken by a
  m ore d ram atic relief o f the pressure.

“Open the Gates"
   66. Between 2.40 p m and 2.45 pm the crowd inside and outside the turnstile approach had swelled to
over 5.000. At the h ead o f the phalanx c onditions had become intolerable. Those w ho got through were short
o f breath a n d sweating profusely. M any com plained to police officers on the concourse inside the turnstiles
and asked them in forceful term s to do som ething. Exit gates A and B were being shaken. It was d e a r the crowd
could not pass through the turnstiles by 3 pm. Police Constable Buxton radioed from the L androver to control
asking that kick-off be postponed. T h e suggestion was acknou ledeed but rejected.

   67. S uperin tend en t M arshall realised the crowd nad become unmanageable. Although loth to do so. since it
was contrary to basic police strategy, he decided to request the exit gates be opened to relieve the pressure.
O therwise, he feared fatalities would occur. O ther senior officers outside the ground agreed. At 2.47 pm he
radioed control to p erm it the gates to be opened. A: 2.46 pm. whilst Mr Duckenfield was considering the
request, gate C opened to eject a youth who had climbed in with no ticket. Immediately, fans outside took
advantage a n d about 150 m anaged to get in before a m ounted officer enabled the gate to be closed again. Mr
Marshall repeated his request. Still no response trorn control. He repeated it a third tim e, add ing that if the
gates were not opened someone was going to be killed. In the control room. Mr Duckenfield had not made a
decision. Mr Murray asked him “Are you going to open the gates?”. Mr Duckenfield gave the order and Sgt
Goddard radioed to Mr Marshall “Open the gates”. Neither the Club control room nor any police officers
inside the turnstiies were told o f this order before or after it was given or o f any action it would require.

  68. At 2.52 pm. gate C was opened wide. Fans behind turnstiles A to G and from the concourse beyond
came round to flow through it in large numbers.

   69. About two minutes iater the pressure outside gate A led Sgt Higgins to radio, despite the gateman’s
objection, for it to be opened. If it was not. he said. “It’ll go and someone will get killed”. Permission was given,
but this time reserve serials were alerted to monitor the inrush towards the north stand. Gate B was also briefly
opened against the gateman’s wishes and about 200 of those pressed at turnstiles A to G gained entry to their
left.

   70. The largest entry, however, was through gate C In the five minutes it was open about 2.000 fans passed
through it steadily at a fast walk. Some may have had tickets for the stands. No doubt some had no tickets at all.
The majority had tickets for the terraces. O f these, some found their wav either right to pens 1 and 2 or left
through the dividing wall to 6 and 7. But a large proportion headed straight for the tunnel in front o f them.

                                                   THE DISASTER

    71. T h e initial influx through gate C. augm ented by entrants via the turnstiles, cam e through the tunnel
 with great m om e n tu m . F ans spoke o f being swept through, feet off the ground. T he 1 in 6 gradient accelerated
 their progress. U pon reaching th e crow ded pens, some wished to go back but were unable to d o so. T h e new
 arrivals found them selves p ushed forw ard and the pressure becam e intense. At 2.54 pm . shortly after this
 influx began, the team s cam e o n to the pitch. As usual, this was greeted by a surge forward. M any were now
 acutely uncom fortable a n d som e were in distress. T he mass seethed about but voluntary m ovem ent by any
 individual was difficult; h an d s down could not be raised and som e fans found it hard to breathe. Still th e flow
 continued through the tunnel causing fu rth er surges forward. There were shouts for help a n d for the gates to be
 opened to the pitch. Police officers on the p erim eter track, did not im m ediately react. In the deafening noise
 from ch a n tin g a n d shouting they did not at first recognise the problem . Realisation cam e at different m om ents
 to different officers in different places.

    72. G ate 3 sprang open u n d e r the intense pressure from w uhin. An officer quickly closed it. Shortly
 afterwards, it sprang again; officers tried to shut it. Those seeking to escape were urged an d pushed back. G ate
 4 was opened by a policem an who n oticed the crushing. People began to spill ou t through it an d were directed
 to the wing pens w here there was still am ple room . Meanwhile, gate 4 was ciosed again a n d then re-opened. At
 gate 3. a Constable, now alive to the crisis, followed strictly his w ritten orders and radioed for perm ission to
 open th at gate. Receiving no reply, he took it upon him self to open it.

   73. Ju st before 3 pm . the m atch kicked off. At the same time, gate C. which had been closed at 2.57 pm .
 was reopened and a steady tn c k ie continued to enter through the tunnel.

    74. To escape the crush, fans began clim bing the radial fences out o f pens 3 and 4 into pens 2 and 5. Others
 tried to get over the front p erim eter fence but were at first turned back by police w ho feared a pitch invasion.
 N e a r the front, fans, mostly youngsters, were weakened to the point o f collapse and in som e instances death but
 they were held upright by pressure all round. F u n n e r back, m ost were so preoccupied with the pam o f being
 pressed against barriers and with b reathing problem s that they saw nothing o f the game. But at the rear there
 were m any who. although cram ped, were w atching the football unaware o f the distress at the from .

    75. At 3.04 pm . Beardsley for Liverpool struck the crossbar at the K.op end. There was a roar from the
Liverpool fans a n d at the same tim e a powerful surge forwards in pen 3. T he several surges which occurred after
the influx from gate C carried th e pressure down the pens towards the pitch. The force becam e such as to twist
a n d break two spans o f a crush barrier towards the front o f pen 3. T h e evidence does no t establish with
certainty when this happened. Probably it was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm. But I am sure it occurred after
the influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen. When the barrier broke those w hom it had
su pported were projected towards the perim eter fence. Many fell an d the involuntary rush o f those behind
pressed th em down. T h e crushing force was tran sm itted and dispersed so that all along the front o f pen 3 fans
were pressed hard up against the low wall a n d the wire mesh o f the fence above it.

  76. In pen 4 no b arrier broke. N evertheless those at the front were crushed against wa.i a n d fence. Further
back, two barriers were bowed a n d som e individuals succumbed to the pressure around tnem.

   77. Surges on terraces are co m m on . U sualh. tnev go forward, then recede. Here, with the weight o f
num bers, there was no receding. T h e pressure stayed and for those crusned breathless by it. standing or prone,
life was ebbing away. If no relief c am e in four m inutes there would be irreversible brain damage: if longer,
death.

   78. In the control room no-one noticed the overcrowding or anytning am iss in pens 3 an d 4 until the first
fans spilt out o n to the perim eter track ju st before kicK-on. Tnen. the officers in c o m m an d assum ed that there
was an atte m p te d pitch invasion. They called up reserve seriais waiting in the gym nasium and all available
officers elsewhere to go to the pitch. A request was m ade to HO for doe nandlers.

   79. S u perintendent G reenw ood, th e G ro u n d C om m ander, was ny tne players' tunnel at the kick-off. He
noticed fans on the track and went to the west end behind the goal. As ne approached, he did not think the pens
overcrowded until he was very close and saw tnose pressed against tne iencc. Even then, he thought the
situation "retrievable” if those higher up the pen relieved tne pressure. He climbed on the wall below the lence
an d signalled with both hands to those behind to move pack. O ther officers loined him . h was impossible.
T hose fans who would have wished to comply were poweriess to do so. Behind them, there were still man\
unaware o f the crisis, watching the game. The football continued to joyous shouting and singing round the rest
o f the ground while those crushed and trapped slowly expired.

   80.    When Mr Greenwood’s signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried to radio for the match to be
stopped. At first, his message was not received by control, so he signalled with his arms towards the control
box. Mr Duckenfield sent Mr Murray down from the box to have the match stopped via the linesman, the
agreed emergency drill. Before he could do so. Mr Greenwood ran over the pitch to the referee who stopped the
game. It was 5'6 minutes past 3.

                                                    THE AFTERMATH

  Rescue Attempts
     81. From 3 o'clock, gates 3 a nd 4 had been open and rem ained so. At first, fans had walked o r staggered out
  w inded a n d faint. But th e final surge at 3.04 pm . and the struggle to reach the open gates, caused a horrendous
  blockage o f bodies. T h e dead, the dying and the desperate bccam e interwoven in the su m p at the front o f the
  pens, especially by th e gates. Those with strength left clam bered over others subm erged in th e h u m a n heap a n d
  tried to clim b ou t over the fence. They were now helped by police and other fans who hauled them u o a n d over.
  N um bers o f fans were climbing over the radial fences into adiacent pens. At the back, m an y were nauied up
  into th e west stand to relieve the pressure.

     82. T h e steps from th e sum p ai gateway s 3 a n d 4 were so congestedw ith bodies live an d d ead that each had
  to be prised from the pile by th e poiice. Initially, no officer took effective charge. A n u m b e r o f individual
 officers a n d fans worked frantically to free those trapped but the gateways were so narrow th at only two o r three
 could get at the entw ined bodies Willing hands got in one an o th er's way. M ore officers arrived from the
 gym nasium an d elsewhere in the ground. Many used lh ciro w n initiative to he!p those laid o ut on the pitch, to
 assist in getting others over the fencing and to comfort the distressed. But som e stood in groups near the
 p erim eter fence no t knowing w hat to do. They had been sum m oned in response to w hat was thought to be a
 threat to public order. W hat they found was a horrific scene ot carnage and some young officers were shocked
 into im potence by w hat they saw.

     83. It was truly gruesome. T he victims were blue, cyanotic, incontinent: their m o uth s open, vom iting: their
 eyes staring. A pile o f dead bodies lay an d grew outside gate 3. Extend ing further an d fu rth er on to the pitch, the
 injured were laid down and a ttem p ts m ade to revive them . M ore and m ore walking survivors flooded out on to
 the pitch as the players left. T he scene was em otive and chaotic as well as gruesome. As the enorm ity o f the
 d isaster was realised, m any o f the fans milling annul were bitter and hostile to the police, blaming them for
 w hat had happened. Officers were confronted, abused, spat upon and even assaulted. A small n u m b e r o f
 hysterical fans had to be subdued.

    84. A dding to th e chaos, a n u m b e r oi press pnotoeraphers dodged about am ong rescue workers apparently
 avid to secure photographs at point biank range o f those dying through the wire mesh a n d those laid on the
 pitch. Angry fans sought to assault them . Police had to intervene.

   S5.    At about 3.12 pm. C h ief Superintendent Nesbn. C o m m a n d e r of the Traffic D ivision, arrived on the
pitch. He took charge at gate 3 an d organised a cnam o f officers 10 simplify and expedite the extraction o f
casualties from the pen. in the absence o f any m echanical means, police and fans together pulled and worked
at the wire m esh with their bare hands and their ;eei to breach the fencing. They succeeded in both pens,
enabling officers to get in a n d fans to be soi out.

   86. By now. som e officers o f their own initial i\o went round from the pitch to the tunnel w here they m et
o th er officers from the turnstiles and the west stand. Toeether. they tried to persuade fans at the rear o f the pens
to go back through the tunnel. Some com piled, but m an\ resisted, wishing to stand their ground. Casualties
were brought out through the tunnei. ana as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers were able to get
fu rther in and brine out m ore casualties, dead and aii\e. rh e v w e re iaid on the ground in the concourse outside
the tunnel a n d a tte m p ts were m ade to revive ineni.

First Aid
  S?. T h e St Jo h n A m bulance Brigade had sonu- 3" personnel posted round the ground for the m atch - 25
adults and 5 ju n io r cadets. They were cunckiy on tne scene when the first casualties em erged a n d sought to
revive them. T h e ir D ivisional Sunerintenoeni. M r Wells, tried u n s u c c e s s f u l to help those pressed against the
fencing by feeding oxygen to them tnrougn the mesn until the> could be got out.

  88. Dr Purcell, Sheffield W ednesday's doctor, cam e ironi ins scat in the south stand an d a ttem p ted
resuscitation. Assisted by a maie nurse irom m e crowd, h e m m e d irom patient to patient doing what he could,
but in m ost cases it was too lave.

  89, At 3.13 pm a St John's am ouianee came onto the pitcn at the north-east co rner a n d drove to the
perim eter fence close to gave 3. T here was no ca!I lor doctors an c nurses on me public address system until
nearly 3.30 pm. Nevertheless, as vne m inuies tickea oust, som e of them came onto the pitch to help o f their
 own accord w hen they saw th e casualties a n d the am bulance a n d realised th e gravity o f th e situation. M any
 fans also worked prodigiously in a tte m p ts to revive the dead a n d the dying, in som e cases th e ir own relatives
 a n d friends. Artificial respiration, m o u th to m outh respiration a n d cardiac massage were applied by th e skilled
 a n d th e unskilled bu t usually in vain. T hose capable o f survival mostly cam e rou nd o f th e ir own accord. T he
 rest w ere m ostly do om ed before they could be brought out a n d treated.

     90.     T h ere was a n urgent need to get casualties off the pitch a n d to hospital. T here were six stretchers in th e
 first aid ro om a n d three in the St Jo h n 's am bulance. They were quickly brought into use. T hen th e fans
 im provised by tearing down th e hoardings a ro u nd the edge o f th e pitch a n d against th e stands so th a t lengths o f
 bo ard could be used as stretchers. Im provising in this wav. parties o f fans a n d poiice ran repeatedly the length
 o f th e pitch bearing casualties to th e north-east corner. A n u m b e r were d ead on arrival there.

 In the Control Room
    9T. M r Duckeftfierd’stayed in the control rOom. C hief Inspector M cK obbie was th ere in civilian clothes a s
 an observer. M r D uckenfieid sent him down to the track to tell a policew oman at gate I to ad m it those
 displaced from the centre pens. M r Duckenfieid did not realise there were injuries until he saw som eone laid
 o n th e pitch. Even then, he did not realise the n atu re o f the problem o r its scale.

   92. M r M urray returned from his a ttem p t to stop the m atch a n d M r D uckenfieid sent him down again to
 clear th e pitch a n d assess the situation. A message was broadcast requesting fans to clear th e pitch. T his was
 because M r Duckenfieid could not from the control room see ciearly w hat was happening for the milling and
 increasing num bers.

    93- T h e Assistant C hief C onstable (Operations). M r Jackson, had a tten ded the m atch in civilian clothes as
 a guest o f the Club. He cam e from his seat in the south stand to ask w hat had happened. M r D uckenfield was
 unable to say: he did not tell M r Jackson th at the exit sates had been opened on his authority. M r Jackson went
 dow n to th e pitch to discover the situation.

   94. At 3.06 p m M r Duckenfieid. still primarily concerned about public order, caused a message to be sent
to H ead q uarters asking for O peratio n Support. T hat was a call tor all available additional police resources to
com e to the ground to strengthen the poiice presence.

   95. M r Jackson was told by M r G reenw ood th at there were casualties a n d returned im m ediately to control
to m ake sure emergency services were alerted. Meanwhile. M r M urray had seen th e plight o f those behind the
fence. H e radioed to control that a fleet o f am bulances was required. He also asked for a Tannoy broadcast to
those in the pens to move back but there is no d e a r evidence that it was m ade.

   96. O nly w hen M r Duckenfield received the request for a fleet of am bulances did he realise the nature and
gravity o f the situation. T hen, supported by M r Jackson, he caused messages to be sent co n v e n in g O peration
S u p p o n into calls for the M ajor D isaster Plan.

No Information
   97. A p a n from the message to clear the pitch an d the belated call for medical assistance about 3.30 pm . no
inform ation o r advice was broadcast on the pubiic address system. M r D uckenfieid feared th at the crowd
might tu rn hostile o r might all a ttem p t to leave togetner thereby ham pering the em ergency services if they were
given inform ation about what had happened. The result was th at a p a n from those close enough at the west end
to see the terrible truth for themseives. the majority o f the crowd were left in ignorance. Many, especially
N ottingham su p p o n e rs in the K.op. still thought tnere had been a pitch invasion o r o th e r m isbehaviour by
Liverpool fans. T hey continued singing and chanting incongruously. This infuriated som e Liverpool fans who
were already distraught. A few began to run towards the K.op end. T he police feared violence m ight result on
top o f the existing disaster. Accordingly, they deployed a large n u m b e r o f officers to form a line across the
w idth o f the pitch at the k o p end a n d advance up to the halt way iine sweeping any Liverpool fans back as they
moved. T here the iine stood as an insurance against disord er but doing nothing. O th er officers were posted to
the perim eter track facing the n o n h stand for the same D u r o o s e . To those distressed an d distraught who
w anted urgent action, this large contingent of passive officers was seen as an affront. Feelings against the poiice
intensified.

Misinformation
   98. At about 3.15 pm . Mr G raham Kelly. C hief Executtve of the FA. M r K in o n also o f the Fa and M r
G ra h a m Mackrell. Secretary o f Sheffield Wednesday, went to the control room for inform ation. M r
Duckenfieid told them he thought there were fataii ties and tne game was likely to be aban d on ed. He also said a
  gate had been forced a n d th ere had been an inrush o f Liverpool supporters. He poin ted to one o f the television
  screens focussed on gate C by th e Leppings Lane turnstiles a n d said “ T h a t’s the gate th at's been forced: there's
  been an in ru sh ”. Inevitably M r Kelly was interviewed a little later live on television. He spoke o f th e two stories
  concerning th e gate - the fans’ acco u nt that the poiice had open ed it. the poiice assertion that th e fans had
  forced th e ir way in.

    99. A bout 3.30 pm there w as a fu rth e r m eeting in the Club's boardroom . M r Duckenfieid went there a n d
  m e t M r Kelly, th e referee a n d representatives ot the three clubs. ACC Jackson was also there. M r
  D uckenfield indicated the m atch was likely to be a b and o ned although no firm ruling was given. He added th at
  he did no t w ant people to know it was to be a b an d on ed lest the dispersing crowd ham per th e emergency
  operations.

  Public Announcements
    100. L ater th e m anagers o f th e two team s were as+;ea to eo to the co n tro l room . T h e y were in v ited there to
 m ak e a public a n n o u n cem en t to calm the crowd. M r Kenny Dalglish agreed to d o so. H e told the crowd that
 there were problem s an d asked them to assist the police and those rendering first aid. H eask ed for calm a n d his
 message was well received. It was then 3.5b pm. Ai 4.10 pm it was anno un ced th at the m atch was abandoned
 for th a t day. Again that message was received calm h by the crowd m ost o f w hom behaved responsibly as they
 dispersed.

 Fire Brigade
    101. M eanwhile the em ergency services had been in action. At about 3.10 pm a request cam e from the
 p erim eter fence to control for bolt croppers to cut the wire mesh. Sergeant G o d d a rd contacted the poiice garage
 close by w ith ou t success. At 3.13 pm . PC Bichard reauested H ead q uarters to call the fire service to bring
 hydraulic cutting equ ipm en t to the Leppings Lane entrance.

    102. T h ere was no arrangem ent for a fire officer to be present during the m atch. However, the M ajor
 D isaster Plan required all e m erg en c y services to be alerted . After phone messages which m ust be described
 later, fire appliances arrived at both Leppings Lane an d Pem stone Road at 3.22 pm . At both entrances their
 arrival surprised poiice who were uninform ed as to why tney had been called o r where they should go.

   103. At Leppings Lane a poiice inspector told Station Officer Swain "1 don't really think we need you".
A no ther poiice officer then asked for m ore resuscitators as peopie were dying so M r Swain radioed for ten fire
appliances. Each carries oxygen and resuscitation equipm ent.

   104. At the Kop end. Leading Firem an Housiey arrived with an emergency te n d e r and Station Officer
Fletcher in a n o th e r appliance, each witn a crew, The em ergency ten der cam e along the roadw ay by the south
sta n d b u t owing to its height was unable to proceed further. It therefore backed out an d went to the Leppings
L ane entrance losing som e eight m inutes. From there. M r H ousiey an d his crew went onto the pitch with
resuscitation equipm ent. They rendered help there and later at the gym nasium . M r Fletcher a n d his m en ran
along behind the south stand carrying cutting eauiDm ent a n a oxygen cylinders. W hen they arrived at the
fence, the cutting equipm ent was not reauired as ny then the last o f the d ead a nd injured were being rem oved
from the pens. M r Fletcher set up a casualty clearing area under the police box an d firem en assisted in carrying
victim s as well as rendering first aid on tne pitch

South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SYM AS)
    105. Before 1986 there had been no SYMAS representative routinely present at Hillsborough matches. The
C lub was content, as indeed are m any o th er ciubs. to rciy upon the Si Jo h n 's A m bulance Brigade an d a 999 call
if necessary. From 19So onw ards, after representations, the Club prov ided two seats in the south stand for
SYMAS staff at League m atches. At one stage it was suggested they would be best placed in th e north stand
close to the gym nasium w hich had been designated a s t n e c a s u a m centre in the event o f a m ajor incident. T he
south stand seats were allotted as they placed the SYM AS staff cioscr m the players' tunnel should a player be
injured. These seats were, however, not available a: t tip semi-finals. SYMAS representatives nevertheless
atten d ed at the semi-finals by arrangem ent witn tne nonce in i          an d again in ! 989. T he SYMAS officers
stood on the ram p leading to the pitcn at tnc norm -easi corncr. They had one am bu lance o utside the ground
an d one on standby .

   106. On 15 A pril 1989. Officers Higgins an d Eason were at m e ground with an am bulance and crew. They
noticed fans on the track and went to tnc Leppines Lane end wniisi the gam e was still in progress. They began
to atten d to casualties. Meanwhile, a; 2.5WDm. tnere nad oeen a call from Police C onstable Waugh at ponce
 H eadq u arters to the Hillsborough police control asking if am bulances were required. T his was on the
 instruction o f C h ie f Inspector E d m un d son who had heard over the radio, as had Police Constable Waugh
 himself, crowd noise a n d snatches o f speech from Hillsborough suggesting distress a n d possible injuries. T h e
 reply from th e control box was: no reports o f injuries but keep standing by. At 3.07 pm after hearing from the
 ground th a t there m ight be injuries, police H eadquarters notified SYMAS th at am bulances m ight be required.
 T h en, seconds later. M r M urray's request for a fleet o f am bulances was relayed to SYMAS. They reacted at
 once. A m bulances began to arrive at the Leppings Lane entrance at 3.13 pm and at the Penistone Road
 entrance at 3.17 pm . In all. som e 42 am bulances attended. 31 o f them from SYMAS an d 11 from
 neighbouring authorities. By 4.30 pm. they had conveyed som e 172 casualties to the N orthern G eneral
 H ospital a n d the Royal Hallam shire Hospital.

 Gymnasium
    107; T he gym nasium had been, in use for serving meals, to the poiice. W hen the M ajor Disaster Plan was
  ordered, it was cleared and divided into two. O ne end becam e a tem porary mortuary" the o th e r was used as a
 casualty clearing area for the injured. As the stretchers, designed and improvised, brought in m ore an d m ore
 casualties, the scene was initially an d inevitably chaotic and harrowing. T here was intense distress am ongst
 the injured a n d bereaved: relatives were reluctant to be D a n e d from the dead and sought to revive them . T here
 were people looking for missing friends and relations: there were recrim inations, there were scuffles. Som e o f
 those involved were the worse for drink. Doctors an d nurses had followed the casualties in from the pitch an d
 sought to atten d the injured as best they c o u ld in the adverse circumstances. Those in m ost urgent need o f
 hospital treatm en t were taken to am bulances as they arrived, triage being employed to determ ine priorities.
 D octors were requested by the poiice to exam ine each person thought to be deceased to confirm an d certify
 death. A police Constable was detailed to attend and guard each o f the dead and a photograph o f each was
 taken by a police photographer so th at relatives coming to identify bodies could be spared the ordeal o f
 searching am ongst all who had died.

The Dead and the Injured
  108. O f th e 95 w ho died, the evidence suggests that at least 1o and probably 21 came through gate C after it
open ed at 2.52 pm . T h a t is established by the statem ents o f relatives an d friends who cam e through with them
but survived.

    109. By com m endable hard work, a team o f pathologists headed by Professor U sher com pleted
post-m ortem exam inations on all the deceased within 48 hours. T hey found that 88 o f the victim s were male
a n d seven female. Thirty-eight were under 20 years ot age. 34 were between 20 an d 29 years an d only three were
over 50. In virtually every case the cause o f death was crush asphyxia due to compression o f the chest wall
against o th e r bodies o r fixed structures so as to prevent innalation. In all but nine cases that was the sole cause.
In one. pressure on the chest had been so great as to rupture the aorta: in six cases there were also injuries to the
head, neck o r chest: in the rem aining two cases, natural disease was a contributory factor. In 18 cases bones
were fractured. T hirteen o f those were rib fractures. However, one was a fractured femur, one a fractured
radius a n d the rem aining three involved fractures o f bones o r cartilages round the voice box. T hese injuries
suggest the victim s m ay have been trodden wmie on tne ground.

   I     i 0. Blood sam ples were taken from the dead. No aiconoi was found in any o f the females. O f the males. 51
had no m o re than 10 m illigrams per cent in their biood wmcn is negligible: 15 had o v e r8 o milligrams p er cent
an d six over 120 milligrams p er cent.

  111. Although the great m ajority o f those who died were in pen 3. at ieast five were in pen 4. Most death s
occurred at the front o f the pens but there were a few laiaim es tu rtn e r back.

  112. In all. som e 730 people com plained oi oeins m iurea inside the ground and 36 o utside it. O f the 730.
abo u t 30% are thought to have entered througn g a te <. a l t e r 2.52 pm. T he largest category o f injury was

  113. I have given m y findings as to the basic factual background an d the m am sequence o f events in
narrative form. T here was very little conflict as to the principal events save as to som e tim ings a n d num bers.
Indeed, the consistency o f the evidence has been a rem arkable feature o f this Inquiry. T h e experiences o f m ost
witnesses were unforgettable and no doubt the early hearing helped to preserve accurate memory. Also, the
existence o f tim ed videos a n d photographs an d o f logged a n d taped messages provided reliable checks by
which to pro m p t an d test witness recollection. Accordingly. 1 have not for the m ost p a n b urdened the narrative
with citations from the evidence o f individual witnesses.

   114. However, there were several instances o f detailed evidence an d assertions being highlighted by the
m edia in d ram atic a n d em otive term s d u rin g th e hearing. Since som e o f those m uch-publicised incidents gave
rise to unfair criticism , they ought to be the subject o f specific findings. 1 have therefore deait with them
individually at A ppendix 6.
                                    PART II - WHY DID IT HAPPEN?


                    "Events o f the magnitude o f Hillsborough don 't usually happen ntst for one
                 single reason, nor is it usually possible 10 pm the blame on one single scapegoat . . .
                 . . . Disasters happen because a whole series o f mistakes, misiudgments and
                 mischances happen to come together m a deadly com bination."
                                                              D r Jo h n Habgood. A rchbishop o f York, preaching at
                                                             the Hillsborough M emorial Service on 23 April 1989.

   115. T his disaster was the worst in the history o f British football. It happened because pens 3 and 4 becam e
grossly overcrowded. T h e y were uncom fortably overcrowded by 2.50 pm at least to a degree which required
that they should be closed to fu rth er arrivals. Even the num bers com ing through the turnstiles in the last 10
m in u tes would have increased the pressure beyond danger p oint and there would have been injuries if not
fatalities. As it was. the influx through gate C after 2.52 pm so increased the pressure m the two pens as to
cause fatal crushing.

    116. T h e overcrowding up to 2.52 pm was due to a num ber o f factors which can be considered broadly
u n d e r three heads.
   (i) T h e layout at the Leppings Lane end.
  (ii) Lack o f fixed capacities for the pens.
 (iii) Lack o f effective m onitoring o f the terraces.

   117. T h e crushing and fatalities after 2.52 pm m ust be considered under a num ber o f headings.
 (iv) T h e build-up at the turnstiles.
  (v) T h e blu n der on opening the gates.
 (vi) T h e barriers in pen 3.
<vii) T h e crushing not recognised.
(viii) T h e response o f the police.
 <ix) T h e p erim eter gates were too small.

                                 THE LAYOUT AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END

    118. I have already observed that the layout o f the turnstile area, o f the terraces a n d o f th e concourse
  between them was the result o f piecem eal changes. A brief history o f these changes is now necessary.


 The History
     119. Before 1965. th e Leppings Lane end consisted entirely o f terracing like the Kop. in th a t year, the west
 stand was built a n d th e terraces rem aining in front o f it were tru n cated to their present depth, front to back. As
 to w idth, they consisted o f a single standing area with no dividing fences. D uring the early 1970*s. hooliganism
 a n d pitch invasions m a d e it necessary to prevent access to the playing area and th e p erim eter fences were
 thereforeerected in 1977.,


    120. Section 1 o f the Safety o f Sports G ro u nd s Act 1975 em pow ered the Secretary o f State to designate a
 sports stad ium having, in his opinion, accom m odation for m ore th an 10.000 as a stadium requiring a
 certificate from the local authority. Hillsborough was so designated with effect from 1 Jan u ary 1979 by SI
 1978/1091. in anticip ation o f th at date. Sheffield Wednesday instructed Eastwood a n d Partners, a firm o f
 consulting engineers, to act on th eir behalf especially in their dealings with the local authority. D r Eastwood,
 the p rincipal o f th e firm, is a highly experienced civil an d structural engineer and has advised several m a jo r
 football clubs. He reco m m en ded that a n u m b e r o f additional crush barriers should be ad d ed since those
 already in place were insufficient to comply with the G reen G u id e (1976 edition). T h a t work was approved
 an d carried out during 1979.

     121. T h e relevant local au th o rity at the tim e was the South Yorkshire County Council. It set up an O fficer
 Working Party consisting o f representatives o f the poiice. the fire service, its own building surveyor's division
 a n d its own legal a n d a d m in istratio n departm ent. The Working Party m ade inspections a n d consulted with the
 Club a n d D r Eastwood. A Safety Certificate was issued on 21 D ecem ber 1979 for an indefinite period, it has
 rem ained in force ever since and has not oeen am ended.


   122. Schedule 3 o f the certificate sets out the m axim um crowd capacity for various areas in th e ground. T he
figure for th e west terrace is 7.200 and for the north-west terrace 2.900. These figures were in ten d ed to be in
accordance with the G reen G u id e (1976). Paragraph 15.4 provided for a m axim um "packing density" o f
between 54 and 27 persons p er 10 square m etres depending on the condition o f the terrace. D r Eastwood had
calculated 8.000 for the west terrace on the basis o f 54 per 10 square metres. He thought this a justified starting
figure in view o f his im proved system o f barriers. However, he reduced it to 7.200 because there were no
gangways on the terrace an d he did not think it teasible to provide any. So. the total figure for the Leppings Lane
terraces was and is 10.100.


The 1981 Semi-Final
   123. As already m entioned, there was crushing at the C up semi-final in 1981. T h e m atch was between
T otten h am H otsp u r and W olverham pton Wanderers. The poiice debriefing m in u tes after the incident
prophetically refer.


  "to the late arrival o f a large num b er of spectators who were still waiting to en ter the Leppings Lane
  enclosure when the m atch started. T he flash point occurred when T ottenham scored" (at the K.op e n d ) “after
  only three m inutes. T he spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was happening and caused a
  crush, w hich resulted in the injuries".


   124. T hose being crushed called for the perim eter gates to be opened onto the track. T here was no
im m ediate reaction, according to M r \au.x who was there, but lortunately a police in specto r gave instructions
an d th e gates were then opened. Abou: 250 cam e out onto the track. T here were broken arm s, legs and ribs and
38 were treated either m nospitai o r by tne St Jonn Am bulance Brigade, it is ciear from the docum ents (ai that
the turnstile readings snowed the capacity figure o f 10.10U h ad been exceeded by over 400 (b) th a t the police
shut o ff further access to the terraces Decause oi crusnmg. and ic> the poiice view after the event was that the
capacity figure o f 1I U 00 in the Saiety (. ertificate was too nigh. T his latter view was com m u nicated to the Club
by the ( h ie fS u p e n n ie n d e n t then in com m and o f F Division but n was not pursued.
 Three Pens
     125. After this incident in A pril 1981 the poiice requested that the terrace should be divided into sections.
 T h e object was to improve crowd control by reducing sideways m ovem ent. D ivision would enable m ore even
 d istrib ution to be effected w hen there was a capacity crowd. It would also enable the west end to be used for
 both h o m e a n d away supporters who could be segregated in separate pens, if necessary w ith an em pty pen
 between them .

     126. T his proposal was agreed by the Club and the Officer W orking Party an d was approved by the local
 authority. Two radial fences were accordingly fitted in N ovember 1981. T hey are the fence now separating pens
 2 a n d 3 a n d th a t now separating 5 a n d 6. T he resuit was to divide the whole terrace into three pens. Access from
 th e concourse to the m iddle pen was through the tunnel and to the wing pens rou n d th e sides o f the west stand.
 D r Eastwood suggested a nd illustrated an altered layout which would have provided separate access through
 separate banks o f tu m stiies to the north stand, to each end o f the west stand, and to each o f the three pens.
 W hilst th e m ain object o f this was segregation, strch a layout would have e nabled each o f those a re a s to be
 m on ito red num erically via th e tu m stiies so as to ensure its m ax im u m capacity was not exceeded. T h e plan was
 no t adopted. T he m axim um capacity for the new centre pen was calculated at 2.200. but no alteration was
 m a d e to the Safety Certificate so to lim it it nor was there any m eans mechanically o f counting the num bers
 going into th at pen.

 The 1985 Changes
     127. By 1985. Sheffield W ednesday had been prom oted to the First D ivision an d was drawing larger
 crowds. T he im provem ent o f th e Leppings Lane end was raised again by the Club an d D r Eastwood prepared a
 n u m b e r o f drawings. T hese illustrated various schemes for achieving segregation by providing m ore tum stiies
 in separate banks an d divisions o f the concourse. The poiice w anted further divisions o f the terrace itself
 again to im prove control a n d segregation. T here was m uch discussion o f these schem es which included
 suggestions o f 29 a n d even 34 tum stiies in total, in th e result, the following alterations were carried out in
 1985.

 New Radial Fences
    128. O n th e terraces, two m o re radiai fences were fitted. O ne div ided the existing central pen into the
p resent pens 3 and 4. G ates were fitted at the m o uth o f the tunnel to enable each of those pens to be closed off.
T h e second fence was placed in th e new pen 4 so as to create the narrow pen 5 intended to be a sterile area. Li nti I
those two fences were added there existed only perim eter gates 1 .2 .4 . 5 an d 6. T he creation o f pen 3 required a
new gate 3 to be fitted which was done.

Barriers
    129. T h e lines o f the new radiai fences ran across existing crush barriers so that w ithout m odification those
barriers would have run through th e fencing. T h e poiice considered th e barriers would be used by fans as
convenient m o un tin g points to scale the new fenccs. tnereby defeating th eir object. T hey therefore wished
spans to be rem oved from th e barriers. H ad th eir wishes been m et in full the result would have been an
u n im p ed ed run in pen 3 from th e m outh o f the tunnel down the south side o f the new fence to the perim eter. D r
Eastw ood dug his heels in against th a t proposal which he rightly regarded as dangerous. H e did however agree
to som e m odification to the m iddle row o f barriers in the newly created pen 3. chiefly to facilitate access.
Likewise in the new pen 5. T h e 1985 m odifications to the pens arc shown on the plan A ppendix 4.

The Turnstiles and Concourse
   130. At the entrance, m odification but no increase in nu m ber was m ad e at the turnstiies. T h e bank 1 to 16
was div id ed from A to G by the metal fence now in placc and that division was projected across the concourse
inside th e tum stiies in the form o f a brick wall. A personnel gate was provided for access through th a t wall but
was enlarged to its present size at the request of the police. Those alterations were m a d e in the interests of
segregation. T h e m ore elaborate divisions which D r Eastwood had suggested, giving separate access to each
sub-division o f the accom m odation, were not pursued m r financial reason'., in May 1985 the Bradford
disaster occurred. T h e south stand at Hillsborough had wooden decking an d the C lub realised n would have to
u nd ertake expensive remedial works there. The cantiiever root o f th e same stand was also discovered to
require expensive repairs.

   131. In fact, shortly after th e new dividing fence and wall had been built at the Leppmgs Lane entrance and
concourse, the Club, by agreem ent with C hief Superintendent Mole, ceased to acco m m od ate hom e supporters
at the Leppings Lane end. T here was tnerefore no longer any need for segregation at that end. but the wall
rem ained.
    132. Also in 1985. electronic counting e q u ip m en t was installed at aii turnstiies. T his conveyed the running
 count fo r each b ank o f turnstiles, for exam ple A to G. to a television screen in the C lub control room w here the
 figures were displayed. In 1986. a n electronic eye was installed in each turnstile booth to catch and record
 anyone w ho clim bed over the turnstile.                                                      . -

 Barrier 144
    133. In Ju n e 1986. the police requested th a t the crush barrier nearest to the tunnel at th e entrance to pens 3
a n d 4 should be rem oved to assist the flow o f fans into the pens. T hey found it caused obstruction because it
was in a good viewing position a n d spectators liked to stand against it in num bers thereby blocking access by
others fu rth e r in to th e pens. T he police also suggested it might h am p er effective evacuation through the tunnel
especially in an emergency. D r Eastwood considered the pros an d cons o f this proposal and accepted the poiice
view. T he O fficer Working Party approved the proposal a t a m eeting on 7 August 1986 on site. A uthority was
given then an d th e re b y M r.B o w n e so n b ehalf p f the Sheffield City Council which had taken over responsibility
for th e Safety Certificate from South Yorkshire C ounty Council on I April 1986. Two spans o f th e barrierw ere
therefore rem oved, leaving only one span in pen 4 as shown on Appendix 4.

Effects of the Layout
    134. T h e result o f these changes was to divide the terrace into a n u m b e r o f small areas w ithout providing
any com puterised o r mechanical m eans o f iim iting entry numerically in to any one area if ail areas were open
for choice. Before the fences a n d pens had divided the terrace, the overaii figure o f 10.100 could be m onitored
via the tu m stiies a n d in theory the crowd could even itself out laterally. Even then, it was no t possible strictly to
ensure com pliance with Schedule 3 P a n 1 o f the Safety Certificate which prescribed a m ax im u m o f 2.900 for
th e north-w est terrace a n d 7.200 for the west terrace. Paragraph 3 o f Schedule 2 o f the Safety Certificate
provides:

  “T h e n u m b e r o f spectators a d m itted to the S tadium and to the severai areas of spectator a ccom m odation
  w ithin the S tad ium shall not exceed th e figures specified in P a n 1 o f Schedule 3".

  T h e C lub h a d to rely upon visual m onitoring.

   135. T h e situation becam e worse however with the division o f the west terrace into pens. Not only were
there m o re a n d sm aller discrete areas but som e were likely to attract m ore than th e ir a pp rop riate share o f the
 10.100 total. It is well recognised th at the area behind the goal is very popular. Moreover, the position o f the
tunnel vis-a-vis the tu m stiies A to G. its labelling a n d the absence o f signposts advertising th e wing pens would
draw to it those with terrace tickets. It was therefore highly likely that pens 3 an d 4 would fill to capacity and
indeed exceed it unless preventive steps were taken. H ad D r Eastw ood's plan for separate turnstile access to
separate sections with separate toilet a n d refreshm ent facilities been im plem ented, total com puterised control
could have been kept.
                                                         CHAPTER8

                                   LACK OF FIXED CAPACITIES FOR THE PENS
     136. In 1981, w hen th e terrace was divided into three areas. D r Eastwood gave the Club the figure o f 2.200
  capacity for th e centre pen. H e based this on the G reen G uide, m aking such allowances as he thought right. No
  d ou b t th e nu m b ers could have been counted in via the tum stiies if only that pen was in use o r if such pens as
  were in use were filled sequentially, but not otherwise.

    137. A fter th e 1985 changes. D r Eastwood did not him self give any figures for the new pens 3 a n d 4.
 Som eone on his sta ff however split the figure 2.200 into 1.200 for pen 3 a n d 1.000 for pen 4. T hose figures did
 n ot even take accou n t o f th e fact th at pen 5 h a d been carved o u t o f pen 4 which was bound to have a reducing
 effect on capacity. Nevertheless, the figures o f 1.200 a n d 1.000 were put on a drawing em an atin g from
 Eastwood a n d P artners a n d th e figures have been notionaiiv regarded since as applicable by the Club a n d the
 poiice. T hey are in fact to o high.

   138. D r Nicholson, at the Research an d Laboratory Services D ivision o f the Health an d Safety Executive,
 has calculated th a t th e figures for pens 3 an d 4 respectively would be 1.015 an d 1.036 if the strength and
 spacing o f the crush barriers h a d com plied with the G reen G uide. But they did not.

 Departures from the Green Guide
    139. In pen 3. four ou t o f five gaps in the lines o f crush barriers do not conform with paragraph 115 o f the
 G reen G u id e (1986). In pen 4. n ine out o f ten do not conform . In particular, the spans taken out o f the barriers
 in pen 3 in 1985 left gaps well in excess o f the m axim um o f 1.4 m etres prescribed. O ne gap was 57% w ider than
 the G reen G u id e m axim um . Moreover, that gap was in direct diagonal line from the m outh o f the tunnel to the
 b arrier which collapsed. D r Eastwood justified these larger gaps by the absence o f gangways. Fans had to be
 able to get in a n d ou t and stan d ard gaps tended to get blocked up. T he effect o f his reasoning was th at the
 absence o f gangways, recognised as having a safety function, led to the sacrifice o f a second safety feature,
 nam ely gaps o f strictly lim ited width.

   140. Again, the removal o f barrier 144 was bound, as D r Eastwood conceded, to affect capacity. In fact it
did more, as 1 shall indicate later.

   141. C apacity should also have taken account o f two further departures from the G reen G uide. If. as was
the case, the perim eter gates were not regarded as exits, som e 40% o f those in pens 3 and 4 were m o re than 12
m etres from an exit (and th ere was no gangway i contrary to the aim o f paragraph 96. Four out o f five o f the
crush barriers in pen 3 a n d six o u t o f nine in pen 4 were below the height prescribed in paragraph 110. These
were the old barriers which had been repaired and plated where th eir bases had corroded a n d fresh concrete
had been applied, raising the level o f the steps. T he point is not academ ic since, in the event, m any fans were
bent painfully over barriers u n d e r great pressure.

   142. D r Nicholson calculated th at when all relevant factors regarding the configuration and th e G reen
G u id e are taken into account, the m axim um capacity for pen 3 should have been 822 and for pen 4. 871.

Safety Certificate
   143. W hatever should have been the m axim um capacities tor Dens 3 an d 4. the fact is that no figures at all in
respect o f th em were p ut into th eS a te ty C'ertiticate. D espite all the changes in layout of the fences a n d barriers,
the two figures. 2.900 for the north-west terrace and 7.200 tor the west terrace, have rem ained as the only
m axim a with which the Club has to comply.

  144. Section 2(1) o! the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1           pr ovi des (so far as is relevant):

  "A Safety C ertiticate shall contain such term s and conditions as the local authority consider necessary or
  expedient to secure reasonable safety at the staaium when u is in use.

  Section 2(2) provided (so far as is relevant):

  “W ithout prejudice to sub-section / 1 >above, a Safety C ertiricate-
  (a) shall specify the m axim um num b er of soectators to be ad m itted to the stadium:
 (b) m ay specify the m ax im u m nu m b er to os adm itted to different parts o f it:
 (c) shall include term s an d con d itio n s-
 ... (iii) as to the number, strength and situation o f any crush Darriers."
 Section 2(2) was repealed by th e Fire Safety an d Safety o f Places o f Sport Act 1987. section 19. which
 gave power lo th e Secretary o f State to lay down, by order, term s a n d conditions. N o o rder has yet been
 m ade an d guidance from the H om e Office has recom m ended local authorities to ap pro ach th eir
 function u n d e r section 2(1) in accordance with the criteria in the repealed section 2(2). (See H om e
 Office C ircular 71/1987 d ated 25 N ovem ber 1987. Annex A. paragraph 6.)

   145. It is d e a r that when the certificate was first issued the South Yorkshire County Council went
 further than simply to fix the m ax im u m num bers tor the whole Stadium . They prescribed figures for
 each p art o f the ground no t m erely by the four points o f the com pass but by specified sections.

     146. Section 8(1) o f the 1975 Act requires the holder o f the certificate before carrying out any
 proposals to alter o r extend th e stadium o r any ot' its installations while a Safety Certificate is in
 operation to give notice o f those proposals to the local"'authority: T h a t obligation is specifically
 repeated in Sheffield W ednesday's certificate a t Schedule 2 Paragraph 5(2). T he Club com plied with
 the requirem ent. H aving received notice o f the alterations to the pens and the barriers, the local
 au th o rity ought, in my view, to have a m end ed the Safety Certificate accordingly. They did not d o so.

 Why was the Safety Certificate not Amended?
     147. Although D r Eastw ood acknowledged that the various changes to the layout would have had
 an effect on capacity, he did not take active steps to see th at a p p ro p ria te am end m en ts were m ade. He
 says he m en tio n ed from tim e to tim e th at the alterations would have an effect on capacity a n d that he
 d id not realise the Safety- C ertificate was not regularly updated. However. 1 find two m e m o ra n d a in
 early 1987 highly significant. D r Eastw ood's assistant M r Strange was concerned w ith queries from
 the FA as to H illsborough's capacity for a semi-final. M r Strange recorded these questions in a
 m em orandum :-

   “ Has any account been taken for alterations done on Leppings Lane over the last few seasons? Is the 10.200
   o r so figure still correct? 1 said th a t in my opinion n needs to be adiusted. b etter d o it now than later."'

   148. M r Strange's next m em o (a few days laten records as foliows:-

   “ D r Eastwood says leave the capacity at Leppings Lane end as it is. providing police have gates u n d e r West
   stand open so th at people can d istrib u te througnout the terrace evenly ."

Although he says th e last nine words d o not report him accurately. D r Eastwood accepts th e rest of that
message.

    149. In my view the provisions as to capacity in the Safety Certificate ought to have been reviewed and
altered. T he unhappy situation is th at the poiice believed even the overall figure o f 10.100 to be too high as far
back as 1981. T h at was reported to the Club but apparently not to D r Eastwood. Meanwhile, th at global figure
had been rendered academ ic by the sub-ai vision of the terrace which was not reflected in th e Safety Certificate
a t all. If p ro p er m axtm um figures had been inserted in the certificate for each o f the pens, the Club and the
poiice m ight well have been p ro m p ted to find some m eans of iim iting the num bers entering those pens other
than by visual m onitoring. T his could have been done ny im plem enting one o f D r E astw o o d s pians for totally
separate sections, turnstile to viewing area. It couid nave been done by insisting on sequential filling o f pens at
all matches: alternatively, by co unting fans into eacn viewing area.

T h e City Council
   150. T h at the Safety C ertificate was not am ended and individual capacities not reviewed can no t be laid
solely at D r Eastw ood's door. He was. after all. consultant engineer to tne Club and responsibility for the
certificate was that o f the iocai authority. When the so u th Yorkshire County Council han d ed over to the
Sheffield City C ouncil, the latter delegated all its powers and duties u n d e r the 19 7 5 Act to its G eneral Purposes
Panel. Apparently, therefore, the decision-maKing oocn on benaii o f the C ouncii was that Panel, although two
specific functions were delegated to the Head ot A dm inistration and Legal D epartm ent - the power to issue a
prohibition un d e r scction lU o f th e 19 “ 5 Act and tne power ot entry and search under section 11 ofthe.A ct.

   151. In practice. M r Bownes. the C ouncil's C hief Licensing Officer in the A dm in istratio n a n d Legal
D epartm ent, bore the brunt o f th e C o u n c iis duties under tne Act.
      152. T h e O fficer W orking Party was superseded by a Safety o f Sports G ro u nd s Advisory G ro u p , but
  a p a rt from th e change o f the na m e the system continued as before. M r Bownes a tte n d e d the inspections
  a n d m eetings o f the Advisory G ro u p together with the representatives o f the police, the fire service, the
  d e p a rtm e n t o f health a n d co n sum er services, an d the building engineer's division o f the Council. The
  la tter was an engineer a n d ought therefore to have been alive to the sam e issues as D r Eastwood.

    153. T h e Advisory G ro u p seems to have worked in a v ery inform al m anner. A short passage from M r
  Bownes’ evidence gives th e flavour o f it:—

       “Q     W ho was taking the lead in the working party as you understood it?

        A     T h a t is a good question, sir. Leads were com ing from several different directions really.

        Q     W ho chaired it. if anyone?

        A     N obo d y as such. sir. It was an inspection ra th e r than a m eeting as 1 understand it.

        Q     W ho decided what should be inspected0

       A    Effectively the group itself, sir. it seemed to me. T here was also som e input from              the Club
             representative as to. if you like, an elem ent o f direction as to what should be looked at.

       Q    A p art from the inspections the working party m et. presumably, o r did they only m eet on
             inspections?

       A     N o. sir. I have referred to three previous meetings.

       Q     W ho took the ch air when it met?

       A    1 suppose it could be said that 1 did. to som e extent.

       Q     T here is no point in having inspections unless you form conclusions as a result o f that inspection, is
             there?

       A    T h a t is correct.

       Q    There m ust presum ably have been some m eeting following the inspection at which you all sat down
            together and decided what, if anything, should be done.

      A     T here was not. to my recollection, no.

      Q     How d id you decide w hat should be done, ifa n y th in g needed to be done?

      A      T here were discussions on th e site, particularly in relation to barrier 144. which took place ax the
             time.

      Q     N othing m ore than that and no record anywnere of any decisions that were m ade?

      A     No. sir."

T he decision to remove b arrier 144 was assented to on behalf'of the C m C ouncil by M r Bownes. It was not
referred to the G eneral Purposes Panel. W hether M r Bow nes strictly had any power to assent to it is to say the
least very doubtful. But he him self adm its that he was ill-equipDed to do so. He knew very little about football
grounds. He had read the file passed on from South Yorkshire c ounty Council a n d assum ed all had been run
satisfactorily by them.

   154. It was recorded, however, in a report which Mr Bownes drafted that "the conditions (in the Safen
C ertificate)give som e cause for concern as they ap p ear to be inadequate or in appropriate in some areas” . T he
report to the G eneral Purposes Panel suggested tnai new Sat'et\ C ertificate conditions should be dratted.

   155. The task o f revising the Safety Certificate was begun in Ju n e 1986. In July 1987. a draft was sent to the
fire service to which they replied in August. In Septem ber 198 the Panei was inform ed th at the redrafting was
 "progressing steadily'* an d should be subm itted to the Panel in October. T he final draft was not circulated until
 30 M arch 1989. 16 days before this disaster.

   156. M eanwhile, the Safety C ertificate has rem ained un am end ed since 1979. The enlargem ent o f the Kop
in 1986 increased its capacity to 2 1.000. Although this was known an d agreed by the Council it had not been
the subject o f any change in the certificate which still showed the capacity o f the Kop as 16.850. M r Mackrell.
Sheffield W ednesday's Secretary, raised the question o f am end m ents to the Safety Certificate and in p articular
with regard to the k o p in April 1987 with Eastwood an d Partners but nothing resulted.

  157. Sheffield U n ited Football Club was designated u n der the 1975 Act on 3 July 1984. A Safety Certificate
was a b o u t to be issued by South Yorkshire C ounty Council at the tim e it handed over to the Sheffield City
Council on I April 1986. No certificate has yet been issued to Sheffield United.

     L58v T h e explanation.given for these delays, wa&pressure o f wock. Mr. Bownes as,C h ief Licensing Officer .
was responsible for 32 o ther licensing systems when this one was add ed to his burden. He had a staff o f only
five. 1fully accept th at the a d d ition o f further statutory responsibilities to the already heavy w orkload of a local
a u th o rity with curbs on us expenditure creates problems. But 11 is clear that the a tten tio n given to this
im p o rtan t licensing function was woefully inadequate.

Summary
   159.      T he Safety Certificate contained no m axim um figures for individual pens. There was therefore no
sanction o r provision focussing attention as to the need to limit entry to the pens by num bers. The layout ai
Leppings Lane as it evolved m ade electronic or mechanical control over num bers entering individual pens
im practicable if all pens were to be available. G iven an im p ortan t m atch and a capacity attendance, fans were
likely to crowd into popular sections like pens 3 and 4. Those pens were likely to become overfull well before
w arning cam e from the turnstiles that num oers were approaching the terrace m axim um o f 10.100. Control
over num bers and the avoidance o f overcrowding therefore depended entirely on visual m onitoring o f the
crowd.

                          LACK O F EFFECTIVE MONITORING OF THE TERRACES

      160. M onitoring th e spectators on th e terraces so as to avoid overcrowding involves observing the num bers
  a n d th eir distrib u tio n in each area, m aking decisions as to when an area is ••full", taking steps to close it o ff
  a n d m oving spectators from one area to another, if necessary. It is a function beset by three problem s. 1) W ho
  should carry it out? 2) W hen is an area “full”? 3) Fear o f hooliganism.

  Who should Monitor the Terraces?
     161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? Should it be the police? Should it be both? O r should it be by
  arrangem ent, depending upon the ground o r section o f the ground in question?

     1'62. In prineipte: a football club which invites the public to a m atch on its prem ises for reward*-is ••
  responsible for securing safety at that event. T he Green G u id e (1986) provides:

         “ 23. The safety o f th e p ublic inside the ground is the responsibility o f those who stage the event and
               ad m in ister the ground in which it is held, ic the "m anagem ent". This responsibility applies in
               both norm al an d emergency situations...

          195. ...there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:

                (a)    controlling or directing m em bers o f the public who are entering or leaving the ground, to
                       help achieve an even flow o f people to the viewing areas an d safe dispersal o f spectators on
                       the terraces o r viewing slopes:

                (b)   patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, eg raisins alarm s o r extinguishing
                      fires:

                (c)   m anning entrances, exits an d o ther strategic points, especially exit doors and gates which
                      are continuously open whilst the ground is in use:

                (d > assisting police as ap pro priate or as requested w ith crowd control: and

                (e)   undertaking specific duties in an emergency.”

The Interim Poppiewell Report
   163. T here was considerable controversy in the course o f the public inquiry held by M r Justice Poppiewell
in 1985 as to the responsibility o f the club and the Dolice. In paragraph 3.6 o f his interim report. M r Justice
Poppiewell quoted from a report produced for the M inister of Housing a n d Local G overnm ent in 1969 as
follows:-

  "T h e responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is divided between the police and the club operating the
  ground. T he broad line o f division being that poiice are responsible for m ovem ent o f spectators in public
  thoroughfares and from public thoroughfares into the ground, while tne club is responsible for the control o f
  spectators once they are on the club s premises

M r Justice Poppiewell said he did not auarrel with that view an d went on to observe that in practice the poiice
have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (paragraph 3 .8 1:

  • i t follows, therefore, that as a m atter ot practice, w-hiie the physical safety o f the building and the
  m ain ten an ce an d good housekeeping o f the ground m usi aiways be the responsibility o f ine club, the police
  have to take the ae taao responsibility of organising tne crow d, with all tnat entails, during the game . .

M r Justice Poppiewell went on to instance evacuation ot tne ground as a procedure in whicn only the poiice
could bear the responsibility ot supervising the organisation ot tne crowd.

The Final Poppiewell Report
   16 4 . He harked back to this subiect in cnanter 4 ot h i s Final R c d o h . Tnerc. h e came down m ore firm n m
favour o f holding the club responsible tor c r o w d satetv Ai paragraph 4 . 1 3 he said “ Because, as a m atter ot
 practice, police officers have regularly attended in large num bers at tootball grounds, it has somehow been
 assum ed by the clubs that the responsibility tor control o f w hat goes on inside the ground has passed from
 th em to th e police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcem ent o f law and order. T hose responsible
 for organising a private function, however, have the prim ary an d continuing obligation and responsibility to
 ensure reasonable safety for those who are invited on to their prem ises." M r Justice Poppiewell ended that
 section as follows: "It can no t be too strongly em pnasised th at it is upon the club, o r the occupier o f the ground
 who is p u ttin g on the function, th a t the prim ary and continuing obligation rests.”

     165. T h ere rem ains, however, the question w nether there are som e grounds o r p a n s o f grounds where the
 club m ay need to rely upon the police <whom they pay to a tte n d ) to control filling o f pens a n d m onitoring them
 for overcrowding. In o th e r words, w hilst the dutv in law to ensure safety rests upon the club, they mav need,
 an d by agreem ent be entitled, to em ploy the poiice to act as their agents m certain circumstances. T h •< very
 difficult an d grev area as to club a n d police responsibility will need to be reviewed in greater depth at stage two
 o f this Inquiry.

 Arrangements at Hillsborough
   166. W hat is clear, however, is that dc racro the police at Hillsborough had accepted responsibility for
 control o f the pens at the Leppings Lane end. T he evidence o f the senior officers who had been concerned with
 policing a t Hillsborough over the years was aii one way on this point. Only M r Duckenfield. w ho had not
 policed at Hillsborough for som e 10 years prior to i 5 A pni. took a different view.

    167. M r Lock is now security officer at Sheffield W ednesday and was formerly a police Superintendent at
 Hillsborough m atches occupying M r M urray s roie. He claimed there had been a form al although unwritten
 agreem ent between the Club an d the police in aoout 1982. wnereby the police agreed to steward the Leppings
 Lane end o f the ground. Such a form al agreem ent is denied by o th er senior officers an d I do no t accept th a t any
 form al agreem ent was reached. Nevertheless, a practice or arrangem ent did develop which was known an d
 accepted by both Club and police. Its effect was that throughout the ground the stewards were responsible for
 m a n n in g exits and entrances, for controlling entry into the stands, for assisting spectators to their seats in the
stands an d for helping to control the exits after tne match. T hey were also responsible at the Kop end on the
terraces for keeping gangways clear an d helping to control the crowd which usually consisted o f hom e
supporters. At the Leppings Lane end. however.-there were no gangways on the terraces an d the crowd
consisted usually (and always since 1987) o f away supporters. M r Mole and otner senior officers accepted that
it w ouic r.a •e been unreal and unreasonable to expect stewards to go onto those Leppings Lane terraces. T hey
would not nave been effective there: moreover, tney could well have been in some danger from hostile away
supporters. T h e police accepted, therefore, that ihc proper filling o f the pens and m onitoring them for
overcrowding could an d would not be c a rn e a out by stewards. Many stewards have tended to be either
extrem ely young o r somew hat elderly. T hey are Data only a m odest sum (£9 at Hillsborough) and they are not
suitable either by physique o r by training to cope on a crowded terrace with no gangways.

Case for the South Yorkshire Police
   168. N otw ithstanding the overw helm ing evidence from senior police as already m en tio n ed an d from the
Club. Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police continued tnrouenout the nearing to contend that the C lub and
no t the police were responsible for filling an d m onitoring the pens a n d that this was well known to both parties.
H e m a in tain ed that the poiice were there essentiaih to secure and preserve law an d order. Q uite ap art from the
poiice evidence to the contrary at this l n q u in . tne official stance o f the South Yorkshire Police has not always
been to that effect.

Harris -v- Sheffield United Football Club Limited
   169. In M arch 1986. the South Yorkshire Poiice A uthontv obtained a m deem ent against Sheffield U nited
Football Club for m oney due for police services provided at Sheffield U nited's matches. T h e defence had been.
inter aha. th at the police were not providing "S D eciai police services". They were doing no m ore than
perform ing their norm ai poiice d u ties o f securing an a preserving iaw ana order am ongst a crowd. T he police
argum ent was that they had a dditional duties. In ms luoecmeni. Borenam .1 sum m arised the instructions for
policing as providing fon-

 "i a ) the m aintenance of enforcem ent of law ana oraen

  (b )   the enforcem ent o f the C lub's ground regulations. m a n \ of which are conccm co with law and order:

  (c) the safety and comfort o f the spectators, officials an d piavers."
  He referred to the argument o f Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police as follows:-

    “Thirdly, here th e police were no t discharging their own duty to the public: they were in fact discharging the
    Club’s duties to th e spectators w hom th e Club invited to the ground. T h e Club chose to invite large num bers
    to th e ir private prem ises: it was th e Club's duty to provide for th eir safety, health an d com fort. T hey could
    have employed a security firm as banks an d others have to do to protect their interests: they chose to request
    the police to p erform th o se duties knowing th at the poiice expected paym ent. Fourthly, th e police w ithin the
    ground provided services w hich it was not w ithin the scope o f th eir public d uty to perform . For instance,
    they assisted in crowd m an agem en t and in the enforcem ent o f such ground regulations as refused entry to
    those who tried to e n ter w itho u t paying or prohibited spectators encroaching on parts o f th e ground which
    th e ir entry fee d id not entitle th em to enter. It m a y be. subm its M r Bentley, that the m ain ten an ce o f law and
    o rd e r was th e p re d o m in a n t aim but there were other services perform ed."

 Thfc learned Judge found:-

    “ In a d d itio n to w hat may be called their law and ord er role the police were expected an d did take p a rt in
    crowd m anagem ent, ensuring the safety o f spectators, the enforcem ent o f the C lub's regulations and to be on
    hand to assist in the event o f som e emergencies such as fire or accidental injury."

 Poiice Practice at the Leppings Lane End
     170. At League m atches at Hillsborough, the police practice was to decide in advance how many a n d which
  pens would be used. If a m odest crowd was anticipated only one o r two pens might be needed. It was b etter to
  confine the fans to lim ited spaces (a) to prevent them running about an d (b) to reduce the n u m b e r o f police
  required. T h e practice was th en to fill the pens one by one. T his involved m aking a judgem ent as to when a pen
  was full. T h ere would then be a police decision to close that pen an d fill another. It was regarded as impractical
 a n d unsafe for police officers Oust like stewards) to go o nto the Leppings Lane lerraces with away supporters.
 T his m eant that m onitoring the num bers in any pen had to be done from vantage points outside it. Here, the
 police were m uch b etter placed than the stewards. There was a good view from the control box an d the
 television screens there. T h ere were officers on the perim eter track. No stewards were placed there becausc
 having both police a n d stewards interfered with the viewing. T here were also police in the west stand who
 could look down on the pens. Intelligence from ail these sources could give the police a good appreciation o f
 the state o f the terraces. W hen it was necessary to shut off access to the pens officers on the concourse could be
 inform ed by radio an d could take the necessary steps.

“Find Their Own Level"
    171. At C up semi-finals, a different approach was adopted. All the pens were opened from the start a n d the
policy was “to let the fans find their own level". This phrase was repeated again an d again by police officers at
the Inquiry. W hat it m eant was that no specific direction was given to fans entering through the turnstiles.
T hey were free to go wherever they wished on the terraces. If th ey becam e uncom fortable o r wished for any
o th er reason to move their position, then theoretically they could m ove elsewhere. In this way it was hoped that
the fans on the terraces would level themselves out and th at distrib ution would be achieved w ithout policc
intervention. O n these occasions, the gates at the top o f the radial fences were locked in the open position. It
was sought to argue, therefore, that there was freedom of m ovem ent from one pen to a n o th e r enabling fans to
“find their level".

    172. T h is argum ent was bad both in theory and in practice. In th e o ry the whole object o f the radial fences
had been to achieve even distribution by directing fans into aesirea positions. To say then that they could move
freely from one pen to a n o th e r would defeat tne object and enable fans to go from a less popular to a m ore
p o p u la r area w ithout inhibition. In practice this did not n appen because the position a n d size o f the gates was
such that once a substantial n u m b e r o f spectators were in. the gates were unnoticeabie an d inaccessibic
especially to those towards the front who might nave most need o f them.

   173. T h e sam e argum ent was deploved to suggest that indi viaual m axim um capacities tor individual pens
need not be assessed since the presence of the onen radiai gates stili m eant that the lerrace was one area. In
practice this simply was not so. T he pnotograpn at Appendix 5 taken irom the north stana at 2.5V pm shows
very clearly the congestion in pens 3 and 4 com rasica w nn m e sparseness in pen t>. This gives the lie to the
suggestion that the fans could, if uncomfortable, "find their own ieve!".

  1 74. T heeffeci o f this policy was that whereas at League m atcnes tne poiice had to m ake a positive decision
when to close one pen and open anotner. at scmi-tinais. where overcrowding was m uch m ore likely, the police
  left it to th e fans them selves to "fin d their own level". Effectively, they were left to m o nitor th eir own comfort
  and safety so as to avoid overcrowding. T he police would only intervene when there was some o v e n sign that an
  area was “full”.

  When is an Area “FuH**?
    175. O ver the years, spectators on terraces have com e to accept conditions which are often very
 uncom fortable an d n o t infrequently downright dangerous. T hey are subjected to buffeting an d squeezing to
 get in a n d out o f the terraces. T hey are packed tightly a n d exposed to surging an d swaying during the match.
 They pu t up with these co nditions because they are devoted to the game an d because there is little they can do
 about them . They believe the discom fort w ill pass and nothing very untow ard will happen. Usually th at is the
 case and they are reassured by it. M ost clubs nave not. um ii very recently, consulted their supporters as to their
 grievances o r suggestions. T h e practice has been to pack them in on the assum ption that if they are prepared to
 pu t up with it the conditions m u st be tolerable. Although crowd figures at football grounds have been reduced
 in recent years, this has been due principally to the increased p roportion o f seating as against standing
 accom m odation. Terraces have stillb een packed.

    176. It is said th a t m any fans enjoy these teatures o f terrace viewing. Clearly close proximity, shared
 discomfort, weathering sways and surges together and chanting the sam e songs and slogans en m assed o evoke
 good h u m o ur and have produced a spirit or cult o f the terraces which m any enjoy. Equally there are m any who
 simply endure these things for the football, for a cheap ticket or indeed for the chance o f getting in at all. And
 before Hillsborough m ost fans on the terraces, even if they enjoy the huriy-burly. had not realised the narrow
 margin o f safety between an uncom fortable crusn and a faiai one.

     177. The G reen G u id e sought to improve safety and com fort by laying down criteria for m axim um
 capacity, ie defining w hat is “full". The standard set was 54 persons per 10 square metres in favourable
 conditions but fewer, down to 27. in less favourable conditions. T he tendency m ay have been to aim off too
 little from the higher figure for shortcom ings in the lavout. C ertainly the figures considered appropriate in
 pens 3 an d 4 at H illsborough were too men. as already indicated.

   178. Even taking the highest figure suggested in the G reen G uide, the problem rem ained that those
supposed to be m onitoring pens visually had and have little idea o f w hat 54 persons per 1U square m etres iook
like. M r D uckenfield's o pinion was that when a pen was full to capacity, the spectators would be "shoulder to
shoulder a nd chest to back". T h at view may derive from seeing the sort of density crowds regularly endure
w ithout injury resulting. But it is m uch m ore dense m an the G reen G u id e m axim um .

    179. T he South Yorkshire Fire Brigaae provided the I n q u iry with ph : ogrophs o f people standing in an area
o f 10 square m etres at various densities of packing. Together w ith m> Assessors and others. 1 took part in a
sim ilar experim ent at the Health and Safet> Executive s Isr.eitield laboratory. We stood in a room o f m easured
area at densities o f 54. 80 and 10U per lu square metres. It was clear from the photographs and from our
experim ent that the m axim u m densit> set out :n tne G reen G u id e left considerably more room than those
m onitoring the terraces would have left before oeciarine an area "full”.

   180. T he tendency has been to allow the nens to fiii until the fans com plain or show signs o f discomfort. If
the density at the front appeared less than a: tr.e nack. the Tannoy would invite the fans to move forward to
make room for m ore. T h e evidence before tne lncuiry a n a m any anecdotal letters I have received cleariy snow
there have been frequent occasions wnen trv.- packing on terraces, not oniy at Hillsborough, has caused
discom fort and som etim es, for brief periods, rear. I sually the surge recedes, the sway returns, the pressure
eases an d the incident passes unrecorded.

  161.    After the crushing at the 19sl sem i-una:. Hillsborough was not chosen again by the FA until 198~.
There was evidence that the centrai nens were uncom fortably overcrowded on that occasion and again at the
1988 C up semi-final, although entry to tne lunnei was biocked off by police shortly before kick-off in 1988
because the pens were deem ed to be "full**.

Fear of Hooliganism
   1S2.    ( >ver the last few years, hooliganism a: anu associated with footbaii m atches has strongly influenced
the strategy o f the poiice. In their pians and m anagem ent tn e \ have concentrated on averting o r containing
threats to public order. This is understandable arid indeed com m endable. But it has led to an imbalance
between the need to quell a m inority oi irounicm akers and the need to secure the safety and comfort o f the
maiority. In the police O perational Order, me em nnasis was unon prevention o f disorder and in particular
prevention o f access to the field o f piay T nere was no express requirem ent that officers on the perim eter track
or in the west stand should keep watch for any possible overcrowding on the terraces, indeed, the view was
expressed in evidence that packing fans close together on the terraces assisted in controlling the unruly since
the less room they had the less scope there was for misbehaviour.

Summary
   183. Although the police had accepted d e facto responsibility for monitoring the pens, their policy on the
day was to leave fans to “find their own level” and to concentrate their own attention on possible disorder.
Whilst in theory the police would intervene if a pen became “full", in practice they permitted the test of
fullness to be what the fans would tolerate.

  184. By 2.52 pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 and 4 were over-full even by this test. Many were
uncomfortable. To allow any more into those pens was likely to cause injuries: to allow in a large stream was
courting disaster.
                                                      CHAPTER 10

                                      THE BUILD-UP AT THE TURNSTILES

    185. T h e decision to open gate C. a n d subseauently gates A and B too, was forced on to the police by the
 crowd conditions which developed outside the turnstiles. The crush was so severe th at injuries were being
 suffered a n d deaths were feared unless th e pressure could be swiftly relieved. Why the crowd pressure had built
 to such intensity was one o f the principal issues during the hearing. T he suggested causes m ust be considered in
 turn.

 The Physical Layout
     186. I have already described an d illustrated the approach to the turnstiles (A ppendices 1 a n d 2). At
 Penistone R oad and a t m any o th er grounds, turnstiles are in a straight line, adequately spaced an d with a
 sufficient waiting area far 4 um es.t 0 .fann . Not so at Leppings Lane. T he building line, the bridge over the Don
 a n d the bend in the road, left a wedge-shaped approach to perim eter gates set in an arc. an d across a short
 forecourt, to turnstiles also set in an arc. T h e pairs o f turnstiles were ciose together and the forecourt, especially
 as divided by the m etal fence, provided little space tor a waiting crow d.

 The Number of Turnstiles
    18 7. T he decision to fill the whole o f the n orm stand from the Leppings Lane end required the 23 turnstiles
 there to a d m it 24.256 spectators. O f those, the seven turnstiles <A to G i serving the terraces had to adm it
 10.100. te an average o f ju st u n d e r 1.450 through each turnstile. At the Penistone Road end. 29.800 were
 served by 60 turnstiles, or.iust u n d e r 500 p er turnstile.

    188. T h e G reen G u id e recognises (paragraph 47) that the rate at which spectators can pass through
turnstiles depends on a variety o f local circum stances but states "in general based on observation an d
experience, it is unlikely that the m ax im u m notional rate per turnstile would exceed 750 p er hour". Since the
semi-final was an all ticket m atch requiring no cash transactions, the Club considered that a higher rate o f
a b o u t 1.000 p er h ou r per turnstile could be expected. Even at this higher rate, which assum es the turnstiles
w orking at m axim um efficiency non-stop, it would have taken nearly 1 ; hours to a a m n all those with terrace
tickets. At 750 per hour, it would have taken nearly two hours.

   189. T he G reen G uid e provides (paragraph 44 >-

   “ Turnstiles should be o f such nu m b ers as to a a m n spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are
   kept w aiting for adm ission

   190. T he Officer Working Party had discussed in 1985 the need, and D r Eastw ood's various schemes, for
im provem ent o f the turnstile arrangem ents. T he m athem atics are elementary. Both the police and the Club
should have realised th at the Leppings L ane lum stiles and the waiting area outside them would be u n d e r strain
to adm it all the Liverpool supporters in tim e. Success depended on the spectators arriving at a steady rate from
an early h o u r a n d upon the m ax im u m turnstile rate being m aintained. In fact neither o f these requirements,
which are inter-linked, was fulfilled. T h a t they might not be so was in my view foreseeable.

The “Late" arrival of Liverpool Fans
   191. Between 2.30 pm a n d 2.40 p m the crow a waiting for the turnstiles swelled to over 5.000 and became
unm anageable. T he case m ade for the police was that large num bers of Liverpool supporters arrived late: a
high proportion o f them were dru n k and unco-operative: a high proportion had no tickets: all o f them were
hell-bent on getting in on time. They say this was unforeseeable and explains why they lost control.

   192. W hether those who arrived between 2.3m pm and 2.4u pm were "late" was m uch debated. T he ticket
sim ply requested its holder “to taxe up [hisi position 15 m inutes before kiek-ofiH. T hat may have been
intended to persuade those with stand tickets to take their seats, but 11 would not be unreasonable for a
standing spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.3u nm and 2.4u pm        hether they were "late" o r not.
however, there was certainly a large concentration o f Liverpool tans arriving at aoout 2.30 pm and after.

Traffic Delays
  193. It is unlikely that traffic co nditions had an\ significant effect on this. True, there were delays on the
Liverpool traffic routes. There were roadw orks on the M62 which was the recom m ended route. At various
points the carriageway was reduced from tour ianes or tnree lanes to two. but no serious delays were reported.
 O n the M 63 there were longer delays d u e to a contraflow a n d at its ju n c tio n with th e A560 there was heavy
 congestion du e to volum e o f traffic. However, the Liverpool routes were clear by 2.20 p m a n d those witnesses
 w ho com plained o f delays en ro u te had nevertheless m anaged to be in range o f the ground in am ple time.

 Fine Weather and Drinking
    194. T h e likeliest explanations for th e sparse Liverpool a tten d an ce in the ground before 2.30 pm were four­
 fold - the w arm weather, drinking, disinclination to en ter th e ground early and prolong the standing, a n d a
 tendency o f Liverpool supporters to cut it fine.

     195. T he police em phasised th at at the 1988 semi-final there was no com parable build-up o f “late" arrivals.
 T h ey claim , therefore, that they had no reason to foresee it in 1989. However, in 1988. although the w eather
 was fine, it was 1P F cooler than in 1989.15 April was the s o n o f fine sp n n g day which tem pted fans to sit or
 stand about in the sun with a drink. If you had a ticket it would seem m ore pleasant a n d sensible to relax in that
 way than to enter the ground early a n d stand on the terrace tor an extra hour. Pre-m atch entertainm ent in the
 g round had been advertised but d id no t take place. Ev en if it had. it m ay n o t have been an encouragem ent to
 m any fans to e n ter so early.

 Was Drunkenness a Major Factor in the Crisis at the Turnstiles?
     196. O f those who arrived at 2.30 pm o r after, very m any had been drinking at public houses o r had
 brought d rin k from hom e o r an off-licence. 1 am satisfied on the evidence, however, th at the great m ajority
 were no t drunk n o r even the worse for drink. T he police witnesses varied on this. Some described a high
 p ro p ortion as drunk, as “lager-louts" o r even as “anim als”. O thers described a generally norm al crowd w ith an
 unco-operative m inority who had d ru nk too much. In my view som e officers, seeking to rationalise their loss
o f control, overestim ated the dru n ken elem ent in the crowd. T here cen ain lv was such an element. There were
youngsters influenced by d rin k an d bravado pushing im patiently a t the rear o f the crowd thereby exacerbating
the crush. But the m ore convincing police witnesses, including especially Detective Superintendent McKay
a n d C h ief Inspector C reaser as well as a nu m o er o f responsible civilian witnesses, were in my view right in
describing this elem ent as a minority. Those witnesses a ttrib u ted the crush to the sheer num bers o f fans all
anxious to gain entry. T here was no criticism o f the crowd by any o f the witnesses in the period up to 2.30 pm
o r even 2.35 pm. W hat h appened then was not a sudden deterioration in the m ood o r sobriety o f those
assem bled there. No d o u b t those coming behind would have had m ore to drink and would have included the
unruly minority. But the crisis developed because this very large crowd became packed into a confined
turnstile area an d its very density ham pered its passage through the turnstiles.

    197. Superintendent M arshall an d o th er officers criticised the crowd as unco-operative because police
exhortations to stop pushing an d to ease back were not heeded. How could they be? In th at crush m ost people
had no control over their m ovem ents at all. Two incidents involving police horses illustrate the point. O ne
horse was found afterw ards to have cigarette bum s on its rum p. Clearly that was the despicable work o f a
hooligan w hether in drink o r not. However, tnere were also eyewitness accounts o f a horse being physically
lifted o ff its feet by the crowd. T h at occurred, as the poiice accepted, w ithout m alice o r intent but as an
involuntary consequence o f crowd pressure which those by the horse's flanks could not resist any m ore than the
horse itself.

Reduced Efficiency of the Turnstiles
   198. T he labelling o f the turnstiles in the order A.       B was confusing. A fan with a B ticket who w ent by
m istake to the w rong side o f the metal tence would nave had the greatest difficulty in getting pack and round to
the correct side. T he colour coding was inefficient because the coloured w ooden panels were affixed to the
turnstile walls so low th at they were no t easily visible through a crowd. T he inform ation on the ticket printed by
Sheffield W ednesday Football Club was misleading and its layout unhelpful, as M r Mackrell frankly conceded.

    199. T he result was that in the early stages, poiice officers were pestered by fans for help as to where the\
should go. Later, as the crowd becam e m ore dense, tans were presenting their tickets at the wrong turnstiles.
There were also Liv erpool supporters w ho had acquired ticKets for the k.op end bu t sought entry at Leppings
Lane. They caused delays in the turnstile operation when entry was refused an d after a while the poiice
instructed the operators to let them tnrough. There was l urtner delay oecause the crush m ade it difficult for
fans to get tnto the turnstile entrances, o n c e tnerc. tne pressure irom oenind was such as. on occasions, to jam
them in the doorway or against the paddle ot tne turnstile. Finaliy. there were tans w ithout tickets who sought
to enter by offering paym ent. b> seeking to go over or u n a e r the paddle o r by sliding through with a ticket
holder. All o f these activities slowed down the turnstile rate which at the worst period was only about 600 per
h o u r per turnstile. T he waiting crowd tneretore expanded a n a as the m inutes passed frustration grew. Visitors
  w ho had paid for tickets and travelled from afar realised they were m aking little forward progress. Frustration
  increased pressure and induced p an ic at th e front. D eterm ination to get into the m atch was intensified by
  determ ination to get out o f th e crush.

  Were Fans W ithout T ickets a M a jo r Factor in the Build-Up?
   200. It has becom e a fact o f football life that fans do turn up at all-ticket m atches w ithout tickets. It is not
 possible to give an accurate figure o r even a reliable estim ate o f the n u m b e r w ithout tickets on 15 April. Police
 estim ates varied from about 2 0 0 to about 2.000. T here were certainly frequent requests for tickets o r “spares”
 during the hours before th e build-up. M any o f those w arned o ff by the police were seen to return to the area.
 Som e were hanging about on th e bridge. Again, however, the police witnesses who m ost im pressed m e did not
 consider the n u m b e r o f ticketless fans to be inordinately large. T his accords with two o ther sources o f
 evidence.

    201. First, there was a w ide range o f witnesses who observed inside the ground t h a t the Liverpool end w asat
 a late stage well below capacity save for pens 3 and 4. The north stand still had m any em pty seats an d the wing
 pens were sparse. T he m atch being a sell-out. there were clearly m any ticket holders to com e and they could
 account for the large crowd still ou tside the turnstiles. H ad the Liverpool accom m odation been full by 2.40
 pm . one could have inferred th a t m ost o r m uch o f the large crow d outside lacked tickets.

    202. Secondly, such figures as are available from the C lub's electronic m c r : tc ring svctem and from analyses
 by the HSE suggest th at no great n u m b er entered w ithout tickets. They s.          that w -.um ber who passed
 through turnstiles A to G plus those w ho entered through gate C roughly equa;: j J the -T--ce capacity figure o f
  10.100 for which tickets had been sold. The C lub's record showed 7.038 passed through turnstiles A to G.
 However, the counting m echanism on turnstile G was defective, so the HSE did a stuay using the video film
 an d projecting figures from the o th e r turnstiles. T his gave an assessm ent o f T.494. with a m axim um o f 7.644
 passing through A to G . Again, using the video, the HSE assessed the n u m b er who entered the ground whilst
 gate C was open at 2.240 with a m a xim u m o f 2.480. Accordingly, the H SE's best estim ate o f the total entering
 through gate C an d turnstiles A to G was 9.734 w ith a-m axim um o f 10.124.1 recognise that these can oniy be
 rough checks because, for exam ple, som e w ith terrace tickets were allowed through turnstiles ] to 16 and there
 would be o th er sim ilar factors which have not formed part o f the assessm ent. Nevertheless, the figures do
 suggest that there was not a very significant body o f ticketless fans in the crowd which buiit up.

T he “Conspiracy" Theory
  203. On b ehalf o f South Yorkshire police. the theory was advanced that the "late" arrival o f so many
Liverpool supporters was planned to buck the system. T he suggestion was that fans w ithout tickets conspired
to arrive late and create such trouble as would force the police to adm it them to the m atch. The slender
evidence upon which this theory rested cam e from two sources: overheard conversations in public houses and
the antecedent history o f Liverpool supporters at away matches.

   204. One witness said he heard three Liverpool supporters saying, in effect, that they wouid m anage to get
in w ithout tickets by causing trouble so that poiice would open a gate, and that they had done this before.
A nother witness heard two o f a group o f Liverpooi supporters say they hao no tickets, that they would go to the
ground .iust before kick-off. th at no-one would stop them getting in an d that they had not been stopped yet.
Statem ents were p u t in relating to two o tner small groups talking in sim ilar terms.

Liverpooi Supporters at Away M atches
   205. T he South Yorkshire police prepared a dossier o f reports on the behav iour o f Liverpool fans at away
m atches with the object o f showing a pattern of troublesom e behavio ur by large num bers either w ithout tickets
o r with forged tickets. W ithout setting out the w noie msiory. it can be sum m arised as follows.

   206. On three occasions Liverpooi fans w ithout tickets were allowed into all-ticket m atches upon payment.
( At Watford on 13 February 1988. 1.50" were adm itted: at S o u tn am p to n on 24 Septem ber 1988. 150 were
adm itted: at S outh am pton again on ;2 D ecem oer            750 were adm itted.) At Norwich on 1 April 198v.
Liverpooi supporters arrived w ithout t.cKets but 1.2 "2 tickets nad been returned and tans trom both Liverpool
and Norwich were allowed to buy them lorcash. A sim ilar situation occurred at W im bledon on 13 May 198°.
T here were six o th er occasions from I vso to date, including the C up finals o f I Vfiftand I w hen num bers of
Liverpool supporters turned up w ithout tickets orotnerw ise behaved badl>.

  20". Four points m ust be noted, however, o n none o f the occasions when ticketiess fans were adm itted for
paym ent was the m atch a sell-out. There was tneretore room in tne ground on each occasion. At a sell-out tans
  m ight not expect to be allowed in. even for paym ent. Secondly, no trouble o f th e kind alleged was encountered
  at th e 1988 semi-final w hen Liverpool visited Hillsborough. Thirdly. Liverpool visited H illsborough again in
  Jan u ary 1989 w ithout any trouble. Finally, no forged tickets were in use on 15 April a p art from three crude
  photocopies.

 No Conspiracy
    208. I have already found th a t there was not an abnorm ally large n u m b er o f fans w itho ut tickets on this
 occasion. With on e o r two exceptions, the police witnesses them selves did not subscribe to th e “conspiracy"
 theory. I a m satisfied th a t th e large concentration at Leppings Lane from 2.30 pm to 2.50 p m did not arrive
 as a result o f any concerted plan. T here were. 1 accept, small groups w ithout tickets who were willing to exploit
 any adventitious chance o f getting into the ground. They, together with the m inority who had dru n k too m uch,
 certainly aggravated th e problem faced by the police. But th at m ain problem was simply one o f large num bers
 packed into th e small area outside the turnstiles.

 The Police Operation at Leppings Lane
   209. T h e O perational O rd e r for 15 April followed closely that laid down for the 1988 semi-final. T he
 em phasis was on m aintaining law and order. Side roads were to be blocked o ff to prevent dam age in residential
 areas. Pairs o f officers were to patrol streets to prevent “clash o f rival supporters". Officers were to watch public
 houses, shops an d superm arkets “where looting could take place". O utside the turnstiles, officers were to ensure
 supporters entering did not have banners, weapons, missiles o r alcohol.

   210. Unfortunately, hooligan behaviour has m ade all these steps necessary. But the only w ritten provision
 aim ed at effecting controlled entry to the turnstiles was one enjoining officers “to ensure orderly queues are
 form ed". T here was no provision for controlling the entry o f the crowd into the turnstile area.

   211. As long ago as 1924. the D epartm ental C om m ittee on Crowds stated:-

   “T h e control o f crowds should begin at a point some considerable distance from the entrance to the ground.
   T h e advantages o f an arrangem ent o f this kind a r e ... in preventing congestion at the entrances to grounds."

T his was particularly im p o rtan t at Leppings Lane where the turnstile area was so small and awkwardly laid
out. If a large crowd was perm itted uncontrolled entry through the p erim eter gates, the form ing o f queues at the
turnstiles and control by officers, w hether on foot o r m ounted, would becom e im practicable. Th ose waiting at
the turnstiles would becom e a single growing mass. Once that happened, it would be difficult to retrieve the
situation.

  212. W hether steps were taken and what steps to avoid this happening was left to oral oriefm g and ad hoc
instructions on the day.

Previous Experience
  213. T he senior police officers said it had never happened before so there was no reason to foresee it. In fact,
the only two previous occasions when the Leppings Lane terraces had been used to fill the whole o f the north
and west sides o fth e ground were at the two semi-finals, in 1 987and 1988. In 1987. the m atch was on a Sunday,
scheduled for 12 noon, and kick-off was postponed for a q u arte r o f an hour because o f late arrivals.

Policing in 1988
    214. As to 1988. there was a very iarge and consistent body o f evidence that, on the day. the police in
Leppings Lane conducted an efficient filtering exercise designed to keep awa> those w ithout tickets an d
control the flow o f fans towards the ground. 1 do not beiieve that so m a n y witnesses w ithout eith er opportunity,
o r reason to put their heads together could be m istaken about what they experienced on that occasion. Yet. the
police m aintain that no filtering exercise o ther than on a ran dom basis was conducted in 1988 an d that their
policy and practice then were no different from those o f 1989.

  215. T he answ er to this conflict m ust. 1 think, be that whilst the policy ma> have been no different, in
practice the policing in 1988 was m ore efficient and was not put to the sam e test and strain as a year iater. There
was not so large a swell in num bers approaching the ground from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm as in 198^.
Nevertheless, there had been w arning signs in 198S. Detective Superintendent McKay gave the following
evidence:
                                                                     C 0/1009/92

Dear Sir,

Re;    The Hillsborough Tragedy - Article in BMJ

I have seen the article which appeared in the BMJ on 30th November 1991.                                    I
am concerned that the article could be considered to be critical of the
South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance and Paramedic Service (SYMAPS).

The tragedy has already been the subject of a great deal of public
investigation and comment which I do not wish to add to unnecessarily.  I
shall not, therefore, respond to a number of points with which I would
otherwise take issue, but I must point out the error relating to the claim
that there was no notification to the Northern General Hospital that a
major incident was taking place.

Notification of a major incident was given to the Northern General Hospital
at approximately 1525 hours, before any casualties arrived.  That
information was given, in person, by an ambulanceman to a member of the
hospital staff, who appeared to act upon the notification.  Any suggestion
that the hospital had not received notification is, therefore incorrect.

Finally, with regard to the paragraph implications for disaster planning.
This service made formal representations at the Lord Justice Taylor enquiry
and were instrumental in introducing legislation to increase the emergency
provision within football stadia.   SYMAPS also declare, on behalf of the
other emergency services, a major incident by contacting the relevant
Accident and Emergency departments.

Please point out these errors in the next issue of the BMJ.

A. Page,
CHIEF METROPOLITAN AMBULANCE OFFICER
   “Q    Were you aw are o f a build-up o f num bers last year towards the latter stages at the turnstiles?

   A    Y e s .. . T here was a huge build-up a ro und 10 m inutes to 3 when many, m any Liverpool supporters
         cam e a t th at tim e. They had been drinking, the ones th at 1 saw an d there was q u ite a sizeable crush
         built-up - sizeable queue.

   Q     Q ueue o r crush?

   A    C om pacted queue, built-up in th e area by the turnstiles which I believe are m arked A to G. T h a t crowd
        reached back alm ost to the gates. It never got any bigger than that an d the turnstiles o p erated relatively
        freely a n d they dealt with th a t crowd. Fans were still arriving at about 10 past 3 but by then t h e . . .

   Q    T his crowd th a t you have described o f the late arrivals at about 10 to - was ii an orderly crowd?

   A    O h no. No. T h e orderly crowd had gone in. and when 1 say they were n ot an orderly crowd, obviousiy
        m ixed am ongst those people w e re . . .

   Q    O f course, b ut taking it generally?

   A    But by an d large they had taken a lot o f drink on board and they were in such num bers th at excluding
        them from the ground was completely out o f the question.

   Q    Were they standing in an orderly q ueue o r was there som e pushing and shoving?

   A    T here was a lot o f pushing and shoving. T here was an urgency to get into the ground.

   Q    But fortunately it does not app e a r to have been in nearly such num bers as this year.

   A    It wasn't."

Police Intelligence in Advance
  216. A part from that experience in 1988. the tendency o f Liverpool supporters to arrive late was not
unknow n. W itnesses said that they get through the turnstiles at their hom e ground. Anfield. qu ite quickly and
tend therefore not to arrive early. Indeed, a general recent tendency to pc pone arrival was noted by the
Sheffield City Council Advisory G roup, with police present, on 23 M arch 19*^ . T he m inu te rea d s:-

  " As far as th e turnstile question was concerned, a pattern has developed o f people arriving som e 15 m inutes
  before the start o f the game hoping to gain adm ission. T his trend may be due to the banning o f alcohol at
  sports grounds which could lead to people going elsewhere for refreshm ent prio r to the football m atch. As
  the available turnstiles operated q uite effectively for the m an *:ty o f the tim e, and th at th e late arrival
  problem could perhaps only be dealt with by education o f the spectators" (su).

  217. In so far as Liverpool supporters* b ehaviour at away matches may have been indicative o f what police
problem s m ight arise on 15 April, m ost o f the facts should have been available at the planning stage. As in o ther
forces. South Yorkshire Policc had a liaison officer whose jo b was to seek, receive and collate relevant
inform ation as to the visiting supporters. T he Association o f C h ie f Police Officers' G uide to Polu'ing Football
highlights the im po rtan ce o f such liaison:-

  **lt is im p o rtan t th at the officer responsible for policing the m atch determ ines the pre-m atch planning in the
  light o f the intelligence at hand. W hilst th at intelligence can oe obtained from a variety o f sources, the p rim e
  source for football intelligence is th e Police National Intelligence System which is based on the network o f
  police liaison officers. Sum m aries com pleted by poiice officers of the hom e club force are forwarded to tne
  visiting club's liaison officer m aking available intelligence about fans' behaviour at both hom e and away
  fixtures. This inform ation will be collated and m aae available for future m atches involving that club".

  218. T he FA had also laid down in a m em o randum issued in tne 1985/ft season m easures to be adopted by
the away club which included th e following:-

 “ lt is th e responsibility o f the away club to advise the hom e club o f the recent behaviour o f th e ir supporters
 at away m atches, irrespective o f w hether the benaviour has resulted in disciplinary action by the Football
 Association o r not".

  21°. It does not seem that inform ation of this kina was passed to the Sheffield W ednesda\ Club o r played
  any p a rt in the South Yorkshire Police plans. H ad the latter been inform ed o f the history contained in the
  dossier an d sum m arised above it m ay well have influenced poiice strategy in Leppings Lane.

    220. T here ispresently a proposal that a national com puter-based police football intelligence system should
  be set up to m ake the necessary inform ation readily available.

  Police Intelligence on the Day
    221. T h e unfilled space in the Liverpool areas inside the ground, the figures tor entry available from the
 C lub’s co m p u te r an d observations on the video screen should have enabled those in the control room to
 m o n ito r th e num bers arriving a n d still to arrive at Leppings Lane. R adio contact with m obile (Tango) patrols
 detailed to m o n ito r licensed prem ises in the district could have indicated the num bers still to come. But at 2.30
 p m w hen M r M urray told M r D uckenfield they would "get them all in by 3 o'clock" he seems not to have
 a ppreciated that in additio n to those visible at the turnstiles there were m any m ore still to come. Certainly. M r
 M arshall'outside the turnstiles was not told and could not otnerw ise have known that there w erestill m any
 Liverpool ticket holders to arrive.

 Mr Marshall and Mr Greenwood
    222. T he division o f com m an d between these two officers did not help. M r Marshall was in charge o f the
 serials outside the perim eter gates in the Lcppings Lane area and in the roads beyond. In practice he operated
 inside an d ju st outside the turnstile area. M r G reenw ood s area as G rou nd C o m m an d e r extended from the
 pitch to the perim eter gates. H e in fact stationed him self n ear the players' tunnel. He was wholly unaware o f the
 growing problem s at the turnstiles and was in no position to exercise control over his officers who were under
 pressure there. No-one in the control room thought to tell him.

 Control Lost
   223. In the result, the large concentration of arrivals from 2.30 pm to 2.40 pm pressed unrestrained into
th e turnstile area through the perim eter gates which were fully open. When that area was full, later arrivals
swelled the crowd out to the forecourt an d even into the road. As already recounted, the foot officers at the
turnstiles becam e trapped an d endangered and retired through the turnstiles. T he m ounted officers could not
o perate am idst such a dense crowd in a confined-space. They cam e out o f the turnstiie area. There were then
the belated attem pts to close the perim eter gates and prevent m ore fans.joining the m ass until it had a chance to
dim inish through the turnstiles: still later the attem p t to p ut a cordon o f horses across the entrance.

   224. D espite knowledge o f the difficult layout, the very iarge n u m b er of fans to be got through so few
turnstiles and the tendency o f fans to arrive in the iast half hour, no contingency pians were m ade to avoid a
crush such as occurred. Even on the day. the need to close Leppings Lane to traffic before 2.30 pm and the
o th e r available intelligence already sum m arised, should have pro m p ted those in co m m and to take precautions
against such a crush. If som e o f the perim eter gates had been ciosed and cordons o f m ou nted and foot officers
had been placed a little distance from those gates, the flow o f fans into the turnstile area could have been
controlled before that area becam e engulfed. It was the crush itself which produced the frustration and the
p an ic a n d brought out the worst in those who had drunk too m uch. Earlier control o f entry would have
prevented the crush and m ain tained the good m ood which had prevailed until 2.30 pm.

  225. It should moreover have been obv ious by 2.40 pm. if not earlier, that a large part o f the crow d could
not be a d m itted until well after 3 pm . H ad a decision to postpone kick-off been m ade and announced m uch o f
the frustration and with it the im petus crushing tne crowd would have been reduced. A com bination of
controlled filterin gand a postponed kick-off would probably have obviated the need to open the gates.

Postponement of Kick-off
    226. At various stages in his evidence. M r D uckenfield gave three accounts o f why he thought it too late to
p ostpo ne kick-off. O nce it was that one o f the team s had airead> com e o n to the pitch. T hen it was that a group
o f photographers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to tnink that the team s were com ing out. Finally, he did not
know why he thought the team s were com ing out. They did not in fact come o nto the nitch until 2.54 pm. two
m inutes after gate C' was opened. Policc I onstabie Buxton haa asked tor a postponem en t o f kick-off betorc
gate C was opened. It should not. however, have needed a police c onstabic in the thick o f the crowd land there
were others o f like m ind) to think of postponing the kick-off. T he need should have been d e a r in the control
room.

  227. T he truth was that M r Duckcnficld applied inflexibly tne poiicv he had discussed with M r M urray
Rick-off would not be postponed unless there were some m aior causc for delaved a rn v ais ci’ a lam on the
m otorw ay o r fog. I accept that the th in kin g behind this policy was not callous o r punitive. If kick-ot't is
postponed w henever a proportion o f fans choose to leave the public houses late, the practice may grow a n d
k i c k - o f f lim es would becom e m eaningless. But. a com m an der m ust deal with the problem o f the d a y Faced
with a situation which was becom ing dangerous, crowd safety should have been his pa ra m o u n t co n sid eratio n .
K i c k - o f f should have been delayed.



Summary
   228.       T he layout o f the turnstiles a n d th e n u m b e r they were required to serve left n o m argin o f safety against
a n uneven flow o f fans. Because police strategy in advance and on the day did not cater for it. the arriv a l o f a
large n u m b e r o f supporters between 2.30 p m and 2.40 pm created an unm anageable crush. T he presence o f
a substantial m inority o f tans w ho had d ru n k too m uch aggravated that problem . H aving lost co ntrol an d
rejected the option o f postponing kick-off. the police were faced with a serious danger o f deaths o r in iu n e s .
T hey were left therefore with no alternative but to open the gates. Superintendent M arshall was right a t that
stage to ask for w an d M r Duckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects o f so dram atic a step re a u ire d

                                  THE BLUNDER ON OPENING THE GATES

   229. T he decision to o rd e r the opening o f the gates was not ac com p anied o r followed by any o ther o rd e r to
 deal with the consequences. W hen gate C was opened, a steady stream o f about 2.000 fans poured through it
 over som e five m inutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground som ewhere an d unless they were di v e n e d
 their likeliest route was through the tunnel for reasons already given. N o warning was issued from the control
 room th a t th e gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse were not alerted. N either the C lub control room
n o r the C hief Steward at the Leppings Lane end was w arned. N ot even M r G reenwood, the G ro u n d
C om m ander, was inform ed. From 2.47 pm when M r M arshall m a d e his first request until 2.52 pm when M r
 Duckenfield acceded to it. there were five m inutes in which o rders could have been given as to how the influx
was to be absorbed. It was no t done. In evidence. M r D uckenfield began by saying that no officer m ade any
wrong decision but he later conceded he had erred in this regard. H e said he did not consider where the people
would go when the gate opened. Even after it opened, when he could see the influx on the television screen, no
ord e r was given to steer the fans to the wing pens. M r D uckenfield said it did not cross his m in d to detail
officers on the concourse to shut off the tunnel. Those officers could not have known from their position how
full pens 3 an d 4 were. T hat was a m a tter for the control room to m o n ito r from its own observations an d using
intelligence from around the ground.

  230. Since pens 3 an d 4 were full by 2.50 pm. the tunnel should have been closed off w hether gate C was to
be opened o r not. T h e exercise was a simple one and had been carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was
for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel a n d divert fans elsewhere. U nfortunately, the
1988 closure seems to have been unknow n to the senior officers on d uty at the time. It did not figure in the
debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning tor 1989.

  231. Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in th e control room where there was a view o f the
pens an d o f the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If orders had been given to that effect
when gate C was opened, the fans could have been directed to the em pty areas o f the wings an d this disaster
could still have been avoided. Failure to give tnai ord er was a b lu n d e r o f the first m agnitude.

   232. Significantly, when perm ission was given to open gate A. M r Duckenfield d id o rd e r serials to go to that
part o f the concourse to m o n ito r the influx towards the north stand. H e did this because he feared that if fans
went to the north stand w ithout tickets, they would not get seats and. there being no perim eter fences at the
north side, they might invade the pitch. This illustrates again th e preoccupation with avoiding pitch invasion
as against safety an d the risks o f overcrowding. Because those entering through gate C could not get onto the
pitch, it was not thought necessary to alert officers to m o n ito r them . T he possibility o f overcrowding simply
was not considered.

                                               THE BARRIERS IN PEN 3

 Barrier 144
    233. T h e removal o f barrier 144 in 1986 should have reduced the notional capacity o f pen 3 as already
 m en tioned. But it did m ore. In the absence o f barrier 144. the influx o f fans after 2.52 pm m et no retarding
 structure as it cam e in to pen 3. T h e pressure created was free to push fans straight down by the radial fence to
 th e lowest line o f barriers. T he pressure diagonally from the tunnel m o u th down to barrier n u m b er 124a which
 collapsed was unbroken by any intervening barrier. 124a was also vulnerable to pressure straight down the pen
 through the gap in the b a m e r above it created in 1985.

    234. Inspector Bullas. positioned in the west stand, described what he saw looking down on the pens
 a ro u n d 3 pm.

   "... I saw from the direction o f th e tunnel a kind o f m ovem ent down th e te rra c in g ... the type o f thing that you
   see on the nature program m es, the m olten lead flowing down the side o f the m ountainside, the m olten la v a ...
   a "riv er o f p e o p le " ... going directly low ards the pitch but there again sp re a d in g ... out."

   235. D r Eastwood conceded in evidence that the removal o f barrier 144 was likely to have c o ntributed to
the collapse o f 124a. Later, he sought to resile from that answer. but 1 think his earlier adm ission was correct. It
was argued that if b a m e r 144 had rem ained, the influx from gate C would have built up fu rther back and the
tragedy might have occurred in the tunnel o r might have broicen barrier 144 itself. T his is speculative an d I
think unlikely. W hat rem ained o f barrier 144 in pen 4 did not cause a build-up: n or did it collapse. But its
rem aining in position m ay well have accounted for no ca rrie r fu n n e r down pen 4 collapsing an d for th e lesser
carnage in that pen.

W hen did Barrier 124a Fail?
   236. Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police sought to argue that this barrier collapsed o r m ay have
collapsed at about 2.47 pm . H is purpose was to suggest that the opening o f gate C was not causally linked with
th e crushing and fatalities resulting from that coliapsc. I nave already found that whilst the evidence does not
p e rm it the tim e o f collapse to be fixed with certainty, it was after 2.52 pm . I now give my reasons:

   (a) 1 have several tim es watched the BBC video tape on which Counsel relied. I do not find the incident he
       identifies at 2.47 pm suggestive o f a collapse at that time:

   (b) the evidence o f fans who were near or at the barrier was overwhelmingly to the effect th a t the collapse
       occurred at o r after 3 pm:

  (c) the biggest group o f witnesses was that which related the collapse to the surge following Beardsley's
      "near-m iss” at the k o p end at 3.04 pm:

  (d) the appearance on video and p h o to g r a p h s o n a n s in the area o f barrier 124a after the incident at 2.47 pm
      and before the finai crush is not consistent w an it having collapsed so early:

  le) it is highly unlikely that if so catastrophic an event had occurred as early as 2.47 pm . the police on the
      track and elsewnere would have taken until nearly 5 o'clock to realise som ething was serio u sly w’rong.
      Indeed, if Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police were correct in his tim ing o f the collapse, the failure o f
      the poiice to respond for so long would expose tnem to even graver criticism than that m ade in this
      Report.

Dr Eastwood's Testing of the Barriers
   2 3 ” . Two sections o f barrier 124a in pen 3 coliansed as a result o f the overcrowding. T hat collapse caused a
n u m b e r o f deaths. D r Eastwood and his staff haa undertaken tne periodical testing ot crush barriers required
by tne G reen G uide and by the Safety C cnificate. b arrier 124a nad oeen tested in J u h 198b and passed.

  23S. T he test had been carried out in accordance with D r Eastw ood's interpretation ot Annex C' to the
Green Guide. That requires an evenly d is tn o u te a force o f t>.0k.vm etre width to be applied for 3 live m inute
  periods, th e interval between applications to be as short as possible. A record has to be kept o f the am ount o f
 d eform ation during each loading an d o f the percentage o f recovery. If the recovery is less th an 50% after the
 th ird application o f force, the b arrier has failed the test. If recovery is between 50% and 75%. there m ust be a
 re-test. T h e question is: 50% o r 75% o f w hat? Is the recovery to be in relation to the position o f the barrier
 before th e first application o f force o r before the third? If the former, a span o f 124a recorded 53% at the 1988
 test a n d should have been re-tested. If the latter, it recorded 100% and passed. U nfortunately the G reen G uide
 is un clear a s to the correct interpretation. D r Eastwood took the latter view an d so passed the b am er. He
 ju stified his interpretation in evidence. H e said failure to recover to the original position could be due to a
 “shake-dow n” effect related to som e giving in the ashes un d er the concrete or to some o th e r extraneous factor
 ra th e r than to any defect in the m aterial o f the b a m e r itself.

    239. I think, after consulting Professor M aunder, that safety ought to have dictated recovery should be by
 reference, to the position o f the barrier before the first application o f force. I accept, however, that the Green
 G u id e is am biguous an d D r E astw ood's interpretation is tenable. It has some support from the British
 S tand ards tests on steel structures. Clearly, however, for the future, the Green G uid e should be clarified on this
 point.

 Corrosion
   240. Inspection o f barrier 124a. and indeed other barriers at Hillsborough, by the HSE showed
 considerable corrosion o f the m etal at vulnerable points where w ater could accum ulate. D r Eastwood agreed
 that i f a significant degree o f corrosion was observed on visual inspection, a b arrier should be condem ned.

   241. T h e G reen G uide does not specifically refer to corrosion. Paragraph 39 provides, inter alia:

   “C rush barriers and balustrades should be exam ined for deform ation or any other oven signs o f weakness".

Paragraph 6 o f Annex C provides:

  “ I f d u ring any test, even though the b a r r ie r ... satisfies the above loading requirem ents, dou bt should arise
  for any reason (including such m atters as cracking o f the terracing o r d isto n io n o f connections) as to the
  safety o f the b a r r ie r ... a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless the results o f this investigation
  rem ove the dou bt as to safety o f the b a r r ie r ... (i t ) should be deem ed to have failed the test".

  242. Since corrosion is a likely cause o f deterioration, a revision o f the G reen G uide should m ake specific
reference to it.

Causation
  243. Tests done by the HSE suggest that although barrier 124a passed the loading test in 1988 and probably
would have been able to sustain a force which did not exceed the test load, n was unable to resist the load
im posed upon it by reason o f the num bers in pen 3. the excessive gap in the barrier higher up the pen and the
absence o f b arrier 144. C orrosion probably played a p a n . but the effective cause o f the collapse was the
excessive a n d unanticipated pressure to which the barrier was exposed.

                                         THE CRUSHING NOT RECOGNISED

     Observation from Control Room
       244. As th e stream from gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers in the control room could be expected
    to keep a close watch on pens 3 and.4. T hey had a direct view o f them from an elevated position through their
    window. Although they had no field-glasses, there was the zoom facility on the TV cam era. T he radio was by
    then w orking again an d although reception was difficult due to crowd noise and possibly excessive a ir traffic
    on channel 25. attem p ts could have been m ad e to a le n officers on the perim eter track to watch for
    overcrow dingand report theiro bservatio ns. In the event, pens 3 and 4 becam e m o re a n d m ore crowded, surges
    took place, fans were show ingand signalling distress. N one o f this was seen o r recognised in the control room.

    Officers on the Track
      245. T he 2 0 officers detailed to the perim eter track were distributed round the pitch so th at some five
    officers were at the west end. T h eir w ritten instructions m ade no reference to the avoidance o r detection o f
    overcrowding. T he sam e applied to the officers in the west stand. M r Greenwood adm itted that his oral
    briefings also contained no m ention o f m o nitoring the pens for overcrowding.

       246. T h e O p eration al O rd e r for 1988 had instructed officers to forbid anyone “access to th e track from the
    terraces w itho ut the consent o f a senior officer (except to receive m edical atte n tio n )”. At the end o f the 1988
    semi-final, there was a m in o r pitch invasion. Accordingly, that p rohibition was em phasised in the 1989


•
     O p eration al O rd e r by being put into capital letters. T he com bination o f no instructions as to overcrowding and
    a strong prohibition on opening the gates was likely to m ake poiice recognition o f crushing slow an d their
    response reluctant. Small w onder th at the growing pressure and congestion between 2.50 pm a n d 2.59 pm
    went unheeded o r ccrtainly unrem edied. Even when officers recognised there was a problem , the rule required
    consent o f a senior officer before a gate could be opened.

      247. “ Senior officer" m eant an officer o f Inspector rank or higher. T he Inspector in charge o f the 20 officers
    on th e track was M r Darling. He stationed h im self by the players' tunnel, the most central position for
    supervising his men. In evidence he said:

      “ 1 would only take action if 1 thought crowding had got to such a stage that the fans were in danger. I'd then
      inform ground control and 1 would expect som eone deployed to the back o f the stand."

      T h a t underlines the in hibition against opening perim eter gates. So did the evidence o f one C onstable who
    said it had been so d ru m m ed into officers not to open tne gates that when he saw distress in pen 4. he "debated"
    with him self before opening the gate, thinking: " I f I'm wrong. I'm going to get a right bollocking for this.*'
    Naturally, one would hope that com m on sense and hum anity would m ake som e officers cut through the rules
    and o pen a gate if fans were clearly in distress.

        248. T his is what happened, but not until officers recognised the distress and even then not immediately.
     Hence, gates 3 and 4. having been opened, were shut again before they were finally opened and at first those
^ k e e k i n g to clim b out over the fence were pushed back. This reaction o f the police did not go on for as long as
     som e witnesses believed. They probably m isinterpreted the hand m ovem ents from M r G reenw ood an d others
     aim ed at persuading fans to move back an d relieve tne pressure as attem p ts to stop those clim bing out at the
     front.

     249. Nevertheless, there was a period during which the failure to recognise the problem an d the inhibition
   against tackling it caused vital tim e to be lost.

                                          THE RESPONSE OF THE POLICE

  The Officers in Command
     250. Even w hen realisation o f th e problem cam e to officers on the track, it was som e m in utes before it
  reached th e control room . W h en spectators first appeared on th e track, th e im m ed iate assu m ption in the
  control room was th a t a p itch invasion was threatened. T his was unlikely at the beginning o f a m atch. It
  becam e still less likely w hen those on th e track m ade no move tow ards the pitch. M r M otson, th e BBC
  com m entator, recognised a n d said, well before the m atch was stopped, that the trouble seem ed to be
  overcrowding a n d n ot m isbehaviour. Still, the assum ption to the contrary persisted in the control room . Until
  M r M urray radioed for a fleet o f am bulances, about 3.06 pm. M r D uckenfield continued to trea t the incident
  as,a th r e a t to th e pijtch and to public order. T he message calling up all available officers m entioned a pitch
  invasion. O p eratio n S u p p o n was in itiated and dog handlers were requested.
     251. U ntil C h ie f S u perin tendent Nesbit a m v e d . there was no effective leadership either from control or on
 the pitch to harness and organise rescue efforts. N o orders were given for officers to e n ter the tunnel and relieve
 pressure. Som e officers did this on th e ir own initiative. Apart from the Tannoy request to clear the pitch, no
 a tte m p t was m ade to clear and m ark off a casualty area where first-aid could be given w ithout hindrance by
 fans a n d photographers milling about between the bodies. T here was no co-ordination o f the early provision o f
 first-aid or o f stretcher p a n ie s o r o f the rescue effort through gates 3 and 4. N o request for help was broadcast to
 doctors and nurses in the crowd until about 3.29 p m when it was too late. Probably, there was little that could
 have been achieved in m ost cases however soon doctors had been sum m oned, but there were m arginal cases
 where earlier attention m ight have m ade a difference.
   252. T he plight o f those behin d the fencing and the existence o f injuries were known to officers a t the scene
 from 3 pm . But the M ajor D isaster Plan was not started until 3.06 p m at earliest when the am bulance service
 was called. N o request for cutting gear o r for the fire brigade was m ade until 3.13 p.m. Again, it is unlikely that
 these services could have saved lives if they had been called promptly, but it is possible.
 Poiice on the Pitch
     253. D espite the initial lack o f leadership, m any officers d id all they hum anly could to rescue an d revive the
 victim s. M any supporters w ho gave evidence paid tribute to these efforts. It is also fair to say th at the num ber
 o f officers who could at first be usefully involved at the two open gates was necessarily limited.
   254. C h ie f Superintendent N esbit's action in deploying a line o f officers across the m iddle o f the pitch has
already been m entioned. I can well understand the resentm ent it caused. However, th e police assertion th at a
 rush by som e fans towards the Kop end raised fears of conflict are well borne out by the video tape. In my
jud gem ent. C h ie f S u perintendent Nesbit was well justified in using some o f the m an y officers called up
p u rsu a n t to O peration Support to prevent possible violence. To have had open fighting in a ground where
som e 90 spectators already lay de a d would have been an unthinkable and obscene developm ent.
Fans on the Pitch
   255. M any fans who escaped on to the pitch alive were in a state of collapse or close to it. M ost o f those who
retained their strength strove m agnificently to assist the victims. T hey helped pull them clear: they helped with
first-aid: they helped carry the im provised stretchers.
  256. T here were fans, however, w ho were distraught, angry, drunk, o r all three. T h e ir conduct in abusing,
assaulting an d spitting at the police was disgraceful, the m ore so since earlier police failures had little to do
with those officers now doing th e ir best for the lniured. In ad d itio n , there were abuse an d assaults on
am bulance m en and firem en in the course of their rescue work. T h is was probably because their sim ilar
uniform s caused them to be m istaken for police. However, although the abuse was w idespread, the nu m b er o f
assaults an d spittings was on the evidence com paratively small. In deploring them , one m ust recognise the
uniquely horrifying experience w hich those responsible had jusi suffered and were still suffering.
False Reports
   257. Before this Inquiry began, there were stories reported in the press, and said to have em anated from
police officers present at the m atch, o f "m ass drunKenness '. It was said that drunken fans urinated on the
police while they were pulling the dead an d m iurea out. that otners had even urinated on the bodies o f the dead
and stolen their belongings. N ot a single witness was called oefore the inquiry to su p p o n any o f those
allegations although even- o p p o rtu n ity was afforded for any or the represented p a n ie s to have any witness
called w hom they wished. As soon as the allegations 1 nave m entioned were m ade in the press. M r Peter
Wright. C h ief Constable o fS o u th Yorkshire, m ade a digm fiea statem ent dissociating him self from such grave
an d em otive calumnies. Those w ho m ade them , and those who dissem inated them , would have d one better to

                                   THE PERIMETER GATES WERE TOO SMALL

     258. T he perim eter gates in the pens were not designed as exits. T hey were intended to afford access by the
 police to cope w ith any local d iso rd e r o r with an emergency. T he kind o f emergency contem plated was not
 m assive crushing but. for exam ple, the collapse or illness o f an individual. Emergency evacuation o f the pens
 had been considered by the O fficer W orking Party. Although fire risk was m inim al since the lerraces. west
 stan d an d tunnel were o f concrete construction, the fire brigade were the principal arbiters o f evacuation
 procedure. They aim ed to be able to em pty the pens m six m inutes. T h e plan was to evacuate spectators via the
 tunnel. If for any reason that option becam e im practicable, f e d u e to a b o m b threat, then th e alternative route
 would be along the back o f the terraces, through the gates in the radial fences a n d round the sides o f the west
 stand. T he fire brigade were satisfied th at each o f these routes would enable the pens to be evacuated in less
 th a n six m inutes, w ithout relying ©n the gates to the pitch. T hose gates w o u ld also,he. available, but their use
 was excluded from the calculation o f evacuation time.

    259. T he n eed to provide for speedy an d large scale evacuation from the front o f the pens to the pitch was
 n o t anticipated. T he Green G u id e (1986) provides as follows:

   “ 209. Access to the pitch m ust be m ad e as difficult as possible in norm al circum stances while at the same
   tim e ensuring that the police have effective access to the terraces for the purpose o f crowd control and
   enabling the pitch to be used (where appropriate) in the event o f serious emergency . . .

   214. . . . at some m aior soccer stadia, where restriction on crow d m ovem ent forms a necessary p a n o f the
   safety measures, it may be necessary to have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in norm al
   c irc u m sta n c e s . . . but allows for access in emergency,

   215. For m ost m aior stadia, w hether used for association football or o th er spons. the pitch p erim eter fence
   w ill be required either to prevent access to tne pitch as m entioned above, o r at least to discourage attem pts
   by spectators to enter the playing area. G ates or o ther access points (m inim um width 1.1 m etres) should
   nonetheless be provided for use in an e m e rg en o , . Provision o f such gates or access points is particularly
   im p o rtan t to allow full access to the piaying area lor tra c k ) where it is likeis to be usee as a piace o f safety in
   an emergency.           Such gates o r access points should be properiy stewarded and                              clearly
   m arked so that im m ediate access to the piaying area or perim eter track can be ensured".

  260. G ate 3 was .82 m etres in width: gate 4 was . “ v m etres in w idth. There were therefore clear d e p a n u re s
from the G reen G u id e standard.

   261. The Safety Certificate provided (by Schedule 2 Paragraph 24) as follows:

  T he (d u b ) shall arrange for the S tadium to be inspected by a suitably qualified C h an ere d Engineer . . . at
  least once each period o f 12 m o n t h s . . . and . . . shall as soon as possible after each inspection supply to
  the . , . Council a Certificate by the said Chartered Engineer as to the current com pliance or non-com piiance
  with . . . the appropriate provisions an d recom m endations o f the <G reen) G uide o f all structural p a n s o f the
  Stadium . . .

   262. It was argued that there was no oreacn of tne Safety C ertificate since the G reen G uide specifically
provides for flexibility However, in m> view tnc Safety C ertificate cannot and certainly should not be
interpreted so liberally as in effect to ieave sucn basic rcauirem en ts as the size o f exit gates to the total
discretion of the club and its advisers. O ne or tne m atters for consideration at stage two o f this in q u ir y will be
whether, an d in wnat respects, the G reen G uide neeas to be cianfied and toughened.

   263. D r Eastwood explained the small w idtn oi tne cates by reterence to the d iiem m a facing the police. They
w anted a gate sufficient for its inten ded purpose ic poiice access a n d small scale emergencies. On the o ther
hand, they did not want a flood gate of sucn size as to endanger tne prim e principle o f preventing pitch
invasions. In the light o f Hillsborough, this is pcrnaps tne most poignant exam ple ot the difficulty o f achieving
a balance between stopping hooliganism and ensuring crowu satety

   264. Even if the width o f gates 3 and 4 had complied with tne present Green G u id e standard, they would
have been wholly inadequate to relieve pressure and release spectators swiftly on 15 April. Moreover, the
G reen G uide says n o m in e aoout the n u m per or cates reauired tor a pen o f given size. Whilst the Ciub.
D r Eastw ood, th e O fficer W orking Party a n d the local au th o rity can be criticised for failing strictly to conform
to th e G u ide, th e real failure was co m m o n to all those w ho have been responsible for considering safety on the
terraces. T h e anxiety to protect the sanctity o f the pitch has caused insufficient attentio n to be paid to the risk
o f a crush due to overcrowding. C e n a in it was. that once the crush occurred on .l 5 April gates 3 an d 4 were
wholly in ad eq u ate for rescue purposes.

                                                     CHAPTER 16

                                          BRIEF SUMMARY OF CAUSES

  265. T he im m ediate cause o f the gross overcrowding an d hence the disaster was the failure, w hen gate C was
opened, to cut o ff access to the central pens which were already overfull.

  266. They were already overfull because no safe m axim u m capacities had been laid down, no a tte m p t was
m ade to control entry to individual pens num erically and there was no effective visual m on itoring o f crowd
density.

   267. W hen th e influx from gate C entered pen 3. the layout o f the barriers there afforded less protection
th a n it should a n d a barrier collapsed. Again, the lack o f vigilant m onitoring caused a siuggish reaction an d
response when the crush occurred. T h e small size and n um ber o f gates to the track retarded rescue efforts. So.
in the initial stages, did lack o f leadership.

    268. T he need to open gate C was du e to dangerous congestion at the turnstiles. T h a t occurred because, as
both Club an d police should have realised. :ne turnstile area could not easily cope with the large num bers
d e m a n d e d o f it unless they arrived steadily over a iengtnv period. T he O perational O rd er and police tactics on
the day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival o f large num bers should that occur in a short
period. T hat it m ight so occur was foreseeable and it did. T he presence o f an unruly m ino rity w ho h a d drun k
too m uch aggravated the problem . So did the Club's confused and inadequate signs and ticketing.
                                                      CHAPTER 17

                                          T H E FA’s C H O IC E O F G R O U N D

    269. T h e FA were strongly criticised by the Football Supporters' Association an d others for having
im posed th e Hillsborough venue on Liverpool for a second year running. T h e Liverpool supporters had to
travel m u ch further to Sheffield th a n th e ir N ottingham n vals. T h e police required th at if th e m atch was to be at
Hillsborough a t all. Liverpool would have to have the west a n d n o rth side accom m odation. T h e disadvantages
o f th a t a n d th e disparate num bers o f hom e supporters o f the two clubs have already been set out. Liverpool had
h a d to knuckle un d er to the arrangem ent in 1988. They resented having it im posed in 1989. To hold the m atch
at O ld Trafford would have been a perfectly good a n d acceptable alternative. Indeed, the FA no m inated O ld
Trafford as the venue for the replay should there be a draw at Hillsborough.

   270. M r Kelly, the FA's C hief Executive, sought to give reasons for preferring Hillsborough, but the only one
which seem ed to have any validity was that the 1988 m atch had been considered a successfully m anaged event.
H e a d m itte d that a telephone call from the C hief Executive o f the Liverpool Club protesting and pu ttin g
Liverpool’s case had not been m entioned to the FA com m ittee which finally decided the venue. M r Kelly
frankly conceded that “there was an elem ent o f unfairness" to Liverpool in choosing H illsborough for a second
tim e. I think the decision was ill-considered. No doubt in future the FA will be m ore sensitive an d responsive
to reasonable representations.

  271. However, it was not suggested that the choice o f venue was causative o f this disaster. T he only basis on
which th at could be said would be that, because ot its layout, the Leppings Lane end was incapable o f being
successfully policed for this semi-final. I do not believe that to be so.
                                                      CHAPTER 18

                                                         POLICE

  Choice of Ends by the Poiice
     272. T here was m uch bitterness am ongst Liverpool supp orters that they had to m ake do again for the
  second year w ith the L eppings L ane end. But. cogent as th e ir com plaints were, they am o u n ted to reasons for
  choosing a different g round altogether. G iven Hillsborough as the venue. 1 think the police were right to
  allocate th e sections o f th e ground as they did. T he direction o f arrival an d the need for segregation m ad e it
  sensible a n d to reverse th e 1988 arrangem ents would have m a d e for contusion. As with choice o f venue. 1 do
  not consider choice o f ends was causative o f the disaster. H ad it been reversed, the disaster could well have
  occurred in a sim ilar m a n n e r but to N ottingham supporters.

  Poiice Planning
    273. T h e O p eratio nal O rd e r for 1989 left m uch unsaid. A part from the lack o f any provision for late o r
 congested arrivals, o r any provision for the avoidance o f overcrow ding on the terraces, there was a n u m b er o f
 o th e r om issions. For example, there was no specific deploym ent o f officers to m an the p erim eter gates. T he
 O rd er d id not detail the duties o f the m ounted officers deployed at the Leppings Lane entrance, w ho included
 Liverpool officers to assist in m arshalling their own fans. T he duties o f Superintendents (especially M r
 G reenw ood a n d M r M arshall) were not defined so as to acnieve clarity a n d efficiency. By an oversight, the
 provision requiring m obile (Tango) patrols to assist the emergency services was o m itted from the text.

    274. T he 1988 O rd e r was never substantially reviewed save to reduce the n u m b e r o f officers deployed in
 shopping areas a n d to em phasise in capital letters the em bargo on tans having access to the pitch. Satisfaction
 with the 1988 event led to complacency. T h at som e tnought the pens overfull in 1988 an d that the tunnel was
 closed o ff on that occasion d id n ot figure in o r influence the pian for 1989.

    275. M r D uckenfield was prom oted and put in charge o f F D ivision only 21 days before this semi-final. T h e
 pre-planning was already in progress under M r Mole who had been in c om m and both in 1987 an d in 1988. It
 m ight have been wiser to have left M r Mole in charge o f this operation. O n the o th e r hand, it is quite
 und erstand able th a t M r D uckenfield should have been expected to take c om m and o f events in his D ivision
 from the date o f his p rom otion. In view o f his lack o f experience a t Hillsborough an d o f a semi-final m atch,
 however, it was im p erative th at he be fully briefed and th a t he should also b rief himself.

   276. H e was no t inform ed o f the crushing incident in 1981 n o r did he m ake inquiries which would have
revealed it. H e d id no t know th e arrangem ent as between C lub a n d police for m onitoring the Leppings Lane
terraces. H e d id no t visit an d to u r the ground before approving th e O perational Order. Although he atten d ed a
m atch on 2 April, there was only a small crowd present and he left control o f the game to the Superintendents.

Policing on the Day
   277. O n e o f th e regrettable features o f the football scene as it has developed is the e norm o us ex penditure o f
money, tim e a n d effort in em ploying large num oers o f poiice all over the country to guard against the sort o f
d isord er a n d m isbehaviour which have become endem ic. Poiice m anagem ent o f a gam e o f football has become
a m ilitary operation. T he problem s faced an d the responses received m ust be disheartening a n d m ay have
tended to harden police a ttitu d es to supporters in general.

   278. It is fair to state th at over m any years the South Yorkshire Police nave given excellent service to the
public. They have handled crowd problem s sensitively and successfully ai a large n u m b e r of football games
including m ajo r m atches, during strikes in tne coai industry an d the steel industry, an d in o th er contexts.
U nfortunately, th e ir policing on 15 April broKe down in the ways a lre a d y described and. although there were
o th e r causes, the m ain reason for the disaster was tne failure ot police control.

   279. In all som e 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I m ust report that for the most
part the quality o f th e ir evidence was in tnverse proDortion t o th e ir rank. T here were m any young Constables
who as witnesses were alert, intelligent an d o D e n . On the oay. tney an d many others strove heroically in gnasth
circum stances aggravated by hostility to rescue and succour victims. The> inspired confidence a n d hope.

   280. By contrast, with som e notable exceptions, the senior officers in co m m and were defensive a n d evasive
witnesses. T h e ir feelings o f grief an d sorrow were onvious and genuine. No d o u b t those feelings were
intensified by the knowledge th at sucn a disaster nad occurred under :n eir m anagem ent. But. neither tneir
handling o f problem s on the day n or their account ot it in evidence snowed the qualities o f leadership to be
expected o f th e ir rank.
     281. M r D uckenfield leant heavily on M r M urray's experience. Between them they m isjudged the build-up
 a t the turnstiles an d did little ab o u t it until they received M r M arshall’s request to open the gate. T hey did not.
 for exam ple, check the turnstile figures available from C lub control o r check with Tango u nits as to the
 num bers still to come. They d id n ot alert M r G reenw ood to the situation at the fringe o f his area o f com m and.
 T hey gave no instructions as to the m anagem ent o f the crowd at Leppings Lane. Inflexibly they declined to
 postpon e kick-off.

    282. W hen M r M arshall’s request came. M r D uckenfield's capacity to take decisions an d give orders
 seem ed to collapse. H aving sanctioned, a t last, the opening o f the gates, he failed to give necessary
 consequential orders or to exert any control when the disaster occurred. He m isinterpreted the emergence o f
 fans from pens 3 a n d 4. W hen he was unsure o f the problem , he sent others down to "assess the situation"
 ra th e r than descend to see for himself. He gave no inform ation to th e crowd.

   283. M ost surprisingly, h e gave M r Kelly a n d others to think that there had been an in ru sh d u e to Liverpooi
fans forcing open a gate. T his was not only untruthful. It set o ff a widely reported allegation against the
su pporters which caused grave offence an d distress. It revived against football fans, a n d especially those from
Liverpool, accusations o f hooliganism which caused reaction n o t only nationw ide but from Europe too. 1 can
only assum e that M r Duckenfield's lack o f c ando ur on this occasion was out o f character. He said his reason for
not telling th e tru th was that if the crowd became aware o f it there m ight be a very hostile reaction an d this
m ight im pede rescue work. He did n o t wish to divulge w hat had happened until he had spoken to a senior
officer. However, reluctance to tell M r Kelly the truth did not require th at he be told a falsehood. Moreover,
although A ssistant C hief C onstable Jackson was a t hand. M r Duckenfield did no t disclose the tru th to him
until m uch later.

   284. T h e likeliest explanation o f M r Duckenfield s conduct is th a t he simply could not face the eno rm ity o f
the decision to open the gates an d all th at flowed therefrom . T h a t would explain what he said to M r Kelly, what
he did not say to M r Jackson, his aversion to addressing the crowd an d his failure to take effective control o f the
disaster situation. He froze.

T he Police C ase a t the Inquiry
  285. It is a m a tter o f regret that a t the hearing, an d in th eir subm issions, the South Yorkshire Police were not
prepared to concede they were in any respect at fault in what occurred. M r Duckenfield. un d er pressure o f
cross-exam ination, apologised for blam ing the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But. that a p a n . the police
case was to blam e the fans for being iate a n d drunk, and to blam e the Club for failing to m o n ito r the pens. It was
argued th a t the fatal crush was no t caused by the influx through gate C but was due to b arrier 124a being
defective. Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to w hether lessons have been learnt, it would
have been m ore seemly an d encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.

                          T H E C IT Y C O U N C IL A N D T H E SAFETY' C E R TIFIC A T E

   286. T he perform ance by the City Council o f its duties in regard to the Safeiv Certificate was inefficient an d
dilatory. T h e failure to revise o r am e n d the certificate over the perio d o f three years preceding this disaster,
despite im p o rta n t changes in the layout o f the ground, was a serious breach o f duty. T here were, as a result, no
fixed capacities for the pens. T he certificate took no account o f the 1981 and 1985 alterations to the ground.

  287. A n u m b e r o f breaches o f G reen G uide standards were perm itted an d persisted eg the spacing o f the
crush barriers, the w idth o f perim eter gates and the gradient in tr.> tunnel (1 in 6 as against the G reen G u id e
m axim um o f 1 in 10).

  288. The Advisory' G ro u p lacked a prop er structure: n s p rocedure was casual a n d unbusinesslike. Its
accountability to the G eneral P urposes Panel was ill-defined. D ecisions were taken inform ally a n d too m uch
was left to M r Bownes. In particular, the decision to rem ove barrier 144 was not referred to the Panel and ought
not to have been made.

                                          T H E CLU B A N D D R E A S T W O O D

     289. It should be recorded th a t in general th e Club has over the years a d o p te d a responsible a n d
 conscientious approach to its responsibilities. It retained the services o f D r Eastw ood as consultant engineer
 a n d abid ed by his advice. For his part. D r Eastwood is skilled a n d experienced in this field, as already
 indicated, a n d h e sought I have no dou bt to act efficiently an d professionally in his a dvice an d practical work.
 T h e C lub also retained M r Lock w ho had acquired great experience a n d knowledge o f H illsborough durin g his
 police service. A nu m b er o f witnesses described H illsborough as a very good ground, “ one o f th e best in the
 country". T h e poiice agreed th at relations between them a n d the Club were good. O v e r th e last four years, the
 C lub h a d spent som e £ 1ft m illion on ground im provements.

    290. Nevertheless, there are a n u m b e r o f respects in which failure by the Club contribu ted to this disaster.
 T h ey were responsible as occupiers an d in vitors for the layout a n d structure o f the ground. T h e Leppings Lane
 en d was unsatisfactory a n d ill-suited to a d m it the num bers invited, for reasons already spelt out. T he C lub was
 aw are o f these problem s a n d discussed solving them in various ways between 1981 a n d 1986. In the result,
 there rem ained the sam e n u m b e r o f turnstiles, an d the sam e problem s outside and inside them . T he plan for
 this semi-final, involving as it did th e loss o f 12 turnstiles for the north stand and large num bers to be fed in
 from Leppings Lane, was one agreed between the Club a n d the police. T he Club knew best w hat rate o f
 adm ission the turnstiles could m anage and ought to have a le n e d the police to the risks o f th e turnstiles being
 swamped.

   291. T h e alterations inside the turnstiles an d on the terraces clearly affected capacity, but no specific
allowance was m ade for them . In that respect, both D r Eastwood an d the Club should have taken a m ore
positive approach. Either a schem e such as one o f tnose D r Eastwood p ut forward should have been ad o p ted
giving m ore turnstiles a n d total separation o f areas or at the very least the ca p ac ity o f the new pens an d o f the
terraces as a whole should have been treated m ore cautiously. T he police view in 1981 th a t 10.100 was too high
a figure was known to the C lub (although D r Eastwood says n o t to him). Yet. despite that a n d the sub-division
into pens, the figure rem ained.

   292. Although the police had assum ed responsibility for m onitoring the pens, the C lub had a duty to its
visitors an d the C lub's officials ought to have a len e d the police to the grossly uneven distrib u tio n o f fans on the
terraces. T h e C lub operated a n d read the ciosed circuit television an d the com puter totaliser. Liaison between
C lub an d police on the day failed to a le n the latter to the n u m b e r o f Liverpool su p p o n e rs still to come. T he
onus here was on the C lub as well as on the police.

   293. T he removal o f barrier 144 was the responsibility o f th e C lub although it clearly acted on the advice o f
D r Eastwood a n d the A dvisory G ro u p which in this instance was misguided.

  294. Likewise, the breaches o f the Green G uide were m atters which the Club should have appreciated an d
rem edied.

    295. Lastly, as already indicated, th e p oor signposting on the concourse tended to prod uce under-filling o f
the wing pens an d over-filling o f pens 3 and 4. Poor signposting outside th e turnstiles a n d the unhelpful form at
o f th e tickets also led to confusion aggravating the buiid-up in the turnstile area.

                                   FIRST AID AND EMERGENCY SERVICES

 No Fault by the Emergency Services
     296. 1 say a t th e outset o f this ch apter th at no valid criticism can be m ade o f the response by the St John
 A m bulance Brigade, by SYMAS o r by the fire brigade on 15 April. Indeed, no represented party ventured any
 criticism o f them . T he only attack on SYMAS cam e from two Liverpool doctors. O ne claim ed th at am bulances
 d id n o t arrive swiftly o r w ith sufficient e q u ip m en t and that there was a lack o f triage. He was proved to be
 wrong in all three respects. U nfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 15 April when he said more
 lives could have been saved if staff a n d e q u ip m en t had arrived eariier. A part from being proved wrong in fact
 as to th e tim es o f arrival o f am bulances, he conceded in evidence th at it was not possible to say w hether lives
 could have been saved. His com m en ts on television were irresponsible. T he o th e r doctor com plained o f the
 a b s e n c e o f defibrillators. 1 am satisfied on overwheim ing evidence that to attem pt to use a defibrillator on the
 pitch with people milling ab o u t w ould have been highly dangerous owing to the risk o f injury from the electric
 charge.

   297. 1 find that all three o f the emergency services nam ed above responded promptly when alerted, tha:
 they brought a ppropriate equ ipm ent and that th e ir personnel operated efficiently.

     298. It would be unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium , m edical facilities capable o f dealing with a
 m a jo r disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at tne ground, oxygen, resuscitators. stretchers, other
 e q u ip m en t a n d m edical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.

  299. W hat is required is a basic level o f provision for first aid. for professional m edical atten tio n and for
am bulance attendance, together with a system ot'co-ordination with the emergency services which will bring
them to th e scene swiftly in whatever num bers are required. W hat will am o unt to an appropriate basic
provision for the future eg the equ ipm ent in a first aid room, reauires e x p e n evaluation an d advice.

   300. O n th e day. there was no clear understanding between the Club an d D r Purcell as to his role. He
believed he was p n m arily there to atten d to the players'. The Club regarded him aiso as the "physician available
to atten d at th e first aid room if required", as laid down in the Safety C enificate.

  301. There was insufficiently close co-operation between the poiice and the emergency services. It is clear
that SYMAS an d the fire brigade shouid have been called earlier than they were. However, in view o f the nature
and extent o f the crushing, the tim e when police rescue began and the pathetically sh o n period for which those
unable to breathe could survive, it is im probable th at quicker recourse to the emergency services would have
saved m ore lives.

    302. Finally, there was evidence that an a d v e n isin g board had to be knocked down at the no n h -e ast com er
o f the ground to allow- an am bulance onto the pitch and that at the top o f the ram p leading to the pitch the
access for am bulances was inadequate. T here was aiso evidence that the pre-m atch arrangem ent for
am b ulances to use the two gates from Penistone Road ai tne n o n h -e ast end o f the ground as in and out routes
was frustrated by the presence o f vehicles ju st inside the ground. In the eveni. none o f these m atters affected
operations. T he hoarding was quickly knocked down. T he difficult access to the ram p was negotiated and
a m bulances used one entrance satisfactorily by bacKine out when loaded.

                           PART IV - INTERIM RECOMMENDATIONS
                                        CHAPTER 23 - INTRODUCTION

  Limited Objectives
    304. It is im p o rta n t to stress the lim ited objectives o f the interim recom m end ations I can m ake in this
 Report. My purpose is to propose instant m easures capabie o f being im plem ented forthw ith a n d where
 possible before the com m encem en t o f th e 1989/1990 season. They are designed to prevent overcrow ding and
 crushing on terraces in the short term and to improve safety procedures. T hey d o n ot and cannot m eet all the
 problem s or address all the issues o f post-Hillsborough football. W ider issues such as m em b ership schemes,
 identity cards, all-seater stadia, super-stadia and long term reco m m en d atio n s fall to be considered in m y Final
 Report. So d o a n u m b e r o f oth er specific m atters such as a com prehensive review o f the G reen G uide, the
 problem o f excessive pre-m atch drinking, fans w ithout tickets and ticket touts. I m ention these m atters lest it
 be thought 1 have decided no recom m end ations need be m ad e concerning them: T have not; But before
 deciding w hat if any reco m m en d atio n s to m ake about tnese and o th er m atters, m ore evidence an d study is
 required.

   305. Accordingly, the m ain thru st o f these interim recom m en dations, as a holding exercise, is to reduce
 num bers on the terraces, to increase vigiiance and to acnieve a p ro p er balance in crowd control between
 prevention o f disorder and m aintenance of safety.


 Perim eter Fences
    306. It would be im practical an d unwise to recom m end works o f construction or radical structural changes
 now. before com pleting the extensive study and consultation which will form stage two o f this inquiry. Hast>
 interim recom m endations of that kind might well prove 10 be ill-iuaged after further study an d require to be
 changed in a m a tte r o f m onths.

    307. In particular. 1 do not at this stage make anv recom m end ation as to removing perim eter fences or
 replacing them with structures o f different design. U nderstandably, there was a wave of popular feeling against
 such fences in the im m ediate afterm ath o f Hillsborough. T he horrifying spectacle of people being crushed
 against the fencing focussed blame for the disaster on the fences them selves. T here were pleas to dism antle
 them an d em otive references to the fans being treated iike "caged anim als". Som e clubs rem oved th e ir fencing
 straightaway. It was therefore very tem pting to consider a; an early stage m aking a recom m endation that the
 fences should be removed. 1 confess to being so temmcti.

   308. Regrettably, only a m on th after Hillsborouen. there were incidents which showed th at violence and
hooliganism are still liable to e ru pt at football grounds. Un 13 May at Selhurst Park. B irm ingham City
supporters invaded the pitch an d fought with supporters of the h om e club. Crystal Palace. Five police officers
and 16 supporters w-ere iniured and required treatm ent at a iocal hospital. O n the sam e day at a m atch between
Bristol City an d Sheffield U nited, spectators spilt onto the pitch and there was fighting on the terraces. At the
C up Final between Liverpool an d Everton on 2U M ay there was a pitch invasion, albeit a com parative!)
benign one.

   309. Even the Football Supporters' Association i FSAi icit it necessary to say m their final subm ission.

       "W ith som e reservations, the FSA accept that p erim eter fences are necessary for crowd c o n tr o l"

   310. Bearing in m ind those m atters, and the need to consider r u n n e r expert evidence. 1 have decided that it
would be unwise and p rem atu re fo rm e io make an;- recom m endations now eitner to remove or to preserve or
to alter the structure ot perim eter fcnces. 1 shall m ake recom m endations about them in my Final Report.

   311. For the present. 1 would em phasise that, aitnougn the lencing prevented escape, the real cause o f the
Hillsborough disaster was overcrowding a n a it is against tnai danger that my interim recom m endations are
prim arily directed. Whilst declining to recom m end ine removal ol m e lences. I do consider th at the gates to the
pitch should be kept open whilst the terraces are occupied. This will have, 1 nope, three beneficial effects.
( Jbviously. an open gate is a m ore read> escape route than one whicn nas to be locked. Secondly, the sight of
open gates will be reassuring io spectators on the terraces. T hirdK . the existence ot gaps in the fencing p\
reason o f the open gates will concentraie the m inds of ponce officers or siewards on the track to the need for
careful m onitoring of those on the terraces
   312. It will o f course be necessary to have a police presence sufficient to prevent pitch invasion for im p ro p e r
reasons through the open gates. However. 1 am encouraged to th ink that this is n ot an insuperable problem by
th e fact that, for exam ple a t Anfield. Liverpool's ground, there were no gates in the p erim eter fencing before it
was taken down. T h ere were instead gaps or "access poin ts” as they are called in the G reen G u id e (paragraph
215). T h e ir existence d id not. so far as 1 am aware, prevent the authorities from m ain tain in g order. Also, the
gates were o pen throughout the replay o f this ill-fated sem i-final at O ld Trafford on 7 M ay 1989.


Reduced Numbers
   313. In th e assessm ent o f figures for capacity, the criteria in C h ap ter 16 o f the G reen G u id e were n o t at
H illsborough, a n d m ay no t elsewhere, have been applied with sufficient rigour. Therefore, in a d d itio n to
rem inding a n d enjoining local autho rities and clubs to m ake all necessary deductions when assessing the
figure for m a xim um capacity in accordance with the G reen G uide. 1 recom m end reducing th a t figure by a
fu rth e r 15% a s a n in te r im measure;


Safety Certificate
   314. T h e Safety Certificate procedure should, if it is properiv adm inistered and enforced, go far towards
achieving crowd safety. W hether it succeeds depends upon the vigilance and co m m itm en t o f the local
au th o rity issuing the Certificate. 1 do not know w hether the p oor perform ance o f the local au th o rity at
H illsborough was typical. A rgum ents have been put to m e suggesting the need for som e national oversight or
inspection o f local au thority certification procedures. T h is raises complex issues which 1 shall w ant to consider
fu rth e r a t stage two o f the Inquiry. For the present. 1 m ake recom m endations as to the content o f Safety
Certificates an d arrangem ents for issuing, m onitoring, enforcing, reviewing, am end in g an d renewing them .
                                         CHAPTER 24 - TH E RECOMMENDATIONS

          315. T h e recom m endations which follow are the m in im u m necessary' to ensure that existing footbal)
        grounds can for th e present be safely used, based upon the evidence which I have heard a t Sheffield a n d other
        inform ation I have received. T hey com plem ent the recom m end ations w hich M r Justice Poppiewell set out
        after his inquiry at Bradford.

           316. T hose which are asterisked should be ea rn e d out before the J 989/90 season starts. T h e rest should be
        sta n e d fo n h w ith an d com pleted as soon as possible.

        Maximum Capacities for Terraces
        ★      1. W here a viewing terrace is divided into pens o r areas which are self-contained. the Safety Certificate
             should specify the maximum number of spectators to be adm itted to each such pen or area.

             A pen or area is to be deemed "self-contained” notwithstanding th a t it has a gate or gates affording access to
             another pen or area and whether such gate o r gates be open or shut.

    ★         2. Each figure for maxim um capacity should be assessed in accordance with C hapter 16 of the Green
             Guide ("th e Green Guide figure” ! subject to the following qualifications:-

             (a) in arriving a t "th e Green Guide figure'’, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
                 which should reduce the permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures specified
                 in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the G reen Guide:

            (b) after assessing “ the Green Guide figure", a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
                margin.

    ★          3. Arrangem ents should be m ade:-

            (a) to lim it the number of spectators entering eacn self-contained pen or area to the m axim um capacity
                figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
                ticketing arrangem ent, by counting or otherwise, and

            (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces
★             4. T here should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out th e ir respective
            responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
            other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. A m
            variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

★            5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or o ther terraced
            area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
            sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
            period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
            or police presence. H e should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
            below, and by radio to the control room.


Fences and Gates
                 6. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
            duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
            c r o w d densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
            demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
            different crowd densities.

★             7. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
            different colour from the rest of the fence and marked " E m e r g e n c y Exit".
        ★      8. Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fuliv open during the period
              when spectators are on the terrace.

    ★           9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
              a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.
              The officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by all
              stewards and police officers in that vicinity. He should be able to make radio contact with the control room
              either himself or via an officer close at hand.

    ★           10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
              are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
              necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
              brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it should be a decision of a
              nominated senior police officer at the ground.


    Crush Barriers
    ★           11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found
             to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

    *           12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
             complies with the criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not. the assessment of the
             maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
             reflect the fact.


    Safety Certificates
                13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
             which should consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
             ambulance service and the building authority. Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its
             object should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
             substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
             recommendations in this report.

              14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
            which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

              15. Every' Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
            Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


               16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
            amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
            accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
            effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
            with the local authority 's rules.

               17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
            of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services, of
            the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters' club. The Advisory Group's terms of
            reference should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
            ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
            and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
            written reports for consideration by the local authorin.


Duties of each Football Club
★             18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured. Thereafter, regular
            inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
            anticipated.
    *       19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such
          as to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
          turnstiles within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity’ of that viewing area should be reduced
          accordingly.

    *      20. Turnstiles should be dosed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be
         reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with tnrnstiie
         operators for this purpose.

           21. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
         concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

    *     22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensive!}’
         reviewed. It should; in relation to the arrangements for each, match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple
         and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing
         area.

*         23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
         the information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
         should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

*         24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
         by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
         admitting spectators to the ground.

           25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters' club as to the provision of pre-match
         entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good rme.


Police Planning
*        26. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated stadium or more
        should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authorin
        concerned in respect of the safety and control oi crowds.

*         27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing of all
        officers on duty there should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and. if any
        is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

*         28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
        any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
        sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

*        29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
        Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

           30.     There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television
        monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record oi any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers
        at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area oi me ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
        in the interpretation and use of these data.


Communications
          31.     There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
        received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should he such as to give operators in the control room
        priority over, and the capacity to override, otners using the same channel. Additional channels should be
        used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding ot the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
        sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.
            32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
          with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

           33. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual
         areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
         announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention oi the crowd despite a high level of
         noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
         match.

           34. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
         Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a simoie code of hand signals to indicate to
         the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.


    Co-ordination of Emergency Services
    *       35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
         liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

    *      36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
         ambulance service are given full details about me event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
         spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
         concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
         rooms of each of the emergency services.

*         37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of emergency vehicles from all three
        services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
        within the ground itself.

*         38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
        the arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
        they are required.


First Aid. Medical Facilities and Ambulances
*          39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1.000 spectators. The
        club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

          40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the
        equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority'after taking professional
        medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.

*          41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at each match and available to deal with
        any medical exigency at the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be
        present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
        match. His whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediately
        contactable.

*          42. At least one fully equipped ambuiance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
        attendance at all matches with an expected crow d of 5.000 or more.

          43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
        be specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambuiance service and should be made a
        requirement of the Safety Certificate.

                                              SPECIFIC INCIDENTS

 Mr Hicks’ Evidence
    1. Mr and Mrs Hicks’ two daughters died in the disaster. They had am ved early en t'amiiie but had tickets
 for different sections. The two daughters had standing tickets: they went into pen 3. Mrs Hicks had a seat in the
 north stand. Mr Hicks took up a standing position in pen 1just below and to the west o f the police box at about
 2.15 pm From there, he had a view o f the centre pens. He kept an eye on them as they tilled up since he knew his
 daughters to be there.

   2. His evidence was that by 2.50 pm he could see peopie were in distress. At about 2.55 pm he and others
 called to a senior police officer at the top o f the steps to the control box to draw his attention to the crushing. Mr
 Hicks was only about 10 feet from the officer. Ffe described trim as wearing a-fta*cap wkh-goid or silver braid,
 and a light coloured anorak. Mr Hicks believed he was the officer who stopped the match. Mr Greenwood, who
 did stop the match, was certainly not wearing a light coloured anorak, as can dearly be seen on the video.

  3. Mr Hicks says that he and others shouted several times to this officer in attempts to alert him to the
distress in the pens. There was no reaction although Mr Hicks believes the officer must have been in earshot.

   4. That officer descended from the steps and two cameramen whom Mr Hicks believed were from
television came and appeared to direct their cameras towards the pens. Another senior officer appeared two
steps down from the platform. He was a stocky figure: he also wore a flat cap but with black braid. Mr Hicks
says that he and two or three others tried several times to capture this officer's attention without success. Then
Mr Hicks says he shouted “ForChrist’ssake! Can't you see what's going on? We can. and you have cameras". The
officer is said to have replied dismissiveiy "Shut your fucking prattle".

  5. When the disaster occurred the two Hicks girls were crushed. Victoria was put in an ambuiance and Mr
Hicks accompanied her to hospital where she was found to be dead. Sarah died at the ground.

   6. Mr Hicks was an impressive witness and. despite his grievous loss, remarkably stoical. He gave his
evidence clearly and without rancour. He was certainly mistaken about Mr Greenwood being one o f those on
the steps and it has not been possible to identify either officer from Mr Hicks' descriptions. He may well also
have been imprecise as to timings. Nevertheless. I see no reason to doubt that what he described did occur in
relation to two officers. As Mr Hicks generously said himself, the dismissive abuse from the second officer
(although reprehensible) may have been due to his being preoccupied with trying to see what was happening at
pens 3 and 4 around kick-off time.

The Goalkeeper and Gate 4
   7. Mr Bambrock. a Liverpool supporter, said he went through the tunnel. He would have liked to have
turned back when he saw how crowded the pens were. He went with his father and 13 year old brother Stephen
towards the front o f pen 4. He saw the teams come onto the pitch. Conditions at the front were, he said, alright
until about 2 minutes to 3. Then the pressure in the pen increased and he and his father became separated. His
feet came o ff the ground. He shouted to police officers through the fence to get them out and help them. The
police did not react. The Liverpool goalkeeper. Bruce Grobbelaar. spoke to a policeman on the track. The gate
was then opened by a blonde policewoman and about 25 to 30 people went through it. They included the
witness's father and his brother Stephen who had a broken arm. A police Constable shut the gate. It was then
reopened by the same policewoman, the witness thought, and he got out.

  S.    Mr Ecdeston. a male nurse and an impressive witness, was sitting in the north stand. He noticed pens 3
and 4 were full and realised something was wrong when fans started coming over the perimeter fence but did
not invade the pitch. He said the Liverpool goalkeeper appeared to notice this too.

 9.    Mr Grobbelaar was out o f the country during the Inquiry and was therefore not called. However, he
made a statement which was put in as his evidence. In the course o f it he said:-

  “ Kick-off happened and we got into our stride pretty quickly - we forced a comer pretty early on and the ball
  came down to my end - I rolled it out to the full back once and play went on until Peter Beardsley hit the
  crossbar o f the Nottingham Forest goal from a comer and came back into play. 1 remember just after that
  there were shouts and screams from the crowd just behind me. it was different: not the ordinary crowd noise
  and 1 turned around to look. What amazed me first was the concentration and squash o f fans in the centre
   section, the end areas still had plenty o f space. It was only then 1 became conscious that the crowd was
  squashing forward and wasn’t able to go sideways and that's when 1 noticed the fencing alongside them
  holding them in. 1 saw fans being pulled up into the stand above the terraces. 1 saw fans climbing over into the
  empty areas at the side and 1 saw fans climbing out over the front onto the pitch which was particularly
  difficult because o f the spikes on the top o f the fencing but they were getting out.
     MPiay was still going on and 1 was in a terrible position trying to concentrate on play and having my
  attention taken by what was happening behind me. The ball came down to our end and Nottingham Forest
  won a corner, it was taken and we cleared our box area and as play was going forward over the centre line I
  heard a shout. ‘Bruce - please help' - a desperate shout from a fan squashed up against the fencing to the
  right o f my goal as I looked at Leppings Lane terraces. He screamed. ‘Please get the fucking gate open - Help,
  help’. All the people who could speak were pleading for help. There were two policemen near the gate right
  alongside the fan who had shouted to me and so 1 shouted to them. ‘Get the gate open*. 1 was still trying to
  concentrate on play and was still having my attention taken by what was happening behind me - there were
  lots o f fans onsite pitch behind the goal area by them too. 1 called again to the policemen. ‘Open the fucking
 gate’ and one just turned away from me and looked back at the crowd but the other went to the gate and
 opened it and it was like taking the top off a shaken coke bottle - people were everywhere on the play area
 around my goal. Play was still going on and it came down towards me again for the left hand corner, li was
 a Nottingham Forest throw-in. away to my left, the ball was out o f play and a fan came up to me on the
 pitch and said, ‘Bruce, they’re killing us’. 1 said ‘Who's killing you?’, and he said ‘They're crushing us-our
 fans’. 1 said ‘Go and get some help', and then a policeman came on and spoke to this fan. 1 don’t know
 who the fan was. and then he led him off. it was about this time 1 saw a policeman running onto the pitch
 from my right across my box and to the referee who biew up. recovered the ball and told all players to clear
 the pitch."
     10. It is clear from the video that Mr Grobbelaar's recollection o f the sequence o f events, even with regard
 to the game, is inaccurate in a number o f respects. For example, the two Nottingham Forest comer kicks
 occurred minutes before Beardsley struck the bar. Further, it seems highly probable from other evidence that
 gates 3 and 4 were open continuously well before Mr Grobbelaar says the fan asked him to get the gate open. It
 seems surprising too that with all the noise Mr Grobbelaar would hear the precise words o f an individual fan.
 let alone respond twice to them, whilst the game was m progress.
    11. As to Mr Bambrock's account, the evidence of PC Fiona Richardson was that she was the only
 policewoman on the track in the early stages although others came from the seated area as the incident
 developed. PC Richardson began at gate 1 and. although she did go and help people out through gate 3. she
 did not go to gate 4. and did not open it twice or even once. The two officers who spoke o f opening gate 4 were
 both male.
   12. I think Mr Grobbelaar did become conscious o f distress in the crowd behind him and did speak to a
police officer at some stage, probably earlier than he now thinks. Not to reach that broad conclusion would
involve attributing his whole account to invention or fantasy and 1 see no grounds for doing so. However, his
detailed account was not tested in cross-examination and its inconsistencies and errors when compared with
other incontrovertible evidence would make it unsafe to derive more than the broad conclusion stated above.
The incident shows how honest witnesses can become confused and their evidence flawed when recollecting
events experienced under tension or emotion.
    13. As to the opening o f gate 4 there was an apparent conflict o f evidence. PC Illingworth said that about
five minutes to 3 he opened it and guided fans emerging through it to gate 5. PC Hooson said that it was he
who opened gate 4 just before kick-off. I am satisfied from the evidence o f a number o f fans that, like gate 3.
p t e 4 was opened more than once. The probability is. therefore, that whilst PC Illingworth was shepherding
fans to gate 5, gate 4 had been closed again until it was re-opened by PC Hooson two or three minutes later.
Oxygen
   14. It was alleged by a doctor that an oxygen cylinder provided to him on the pitch was empty. Dr Phillips, a
 Liverpool supporter, had been in pen 3 with his brother and others. He came under pressure and climbed into
pen 2. When the disaster occurred and gate 2 was opened, he went through it. injuring his head as he did so. He
came onto the pitch sometime after 3.10 pm and siarted resuscitation procedures. He was given an oxygen
cylinder. He believes this was from St John Ambuiance. It was. he ihought. too eariy to be the fire service. Trn*
cylinder was switched on but Dr Phillips says it gave no oxygen since it was empty. There was one oxygen
cylinder on the St John’s ambulance which came to the scene. Mr Wells, tne Divisional Superintendent o f St
John, took that cylinder onto the pitch. He said n was effective. In particular, he recalls going to a patient oeing
treated by Dr Phillips and says that oxygen was flowing mio that patient. Moreover. Mr Wells tested the
cylinder afterwards and found it was still half full. It has a capacity that will last for 5 hours 40 minutes on a
high setting.
     15. There was evidence from Assistant Chief Fire Officer Hornsby that a Maxaman resuscitator had failed
  to work properly. It was delivering an oxygen flow appropriate to a "child" setting rather than a full “adult"
  flow. On examination, it was found that a retaining nut in the control knob had worked loose, possibly due to
  vibration in transit, and this had affected the flow o f oxygen.The device had last been tested on 10 April 1989.
    16. 1 accept the eviccnce o f Mr Wells that the St John Ambulance cylinder was charged with oxygen and
 working properly. In my view. Dr Phillips may have been mistaken as to the cylinder o f which he complains
 being empty. He agreed he was under great pressure, in an awkward situation: his head was injured and he
 became very angry at what he regarded then as wholly the fault o f the police. He conceded that if the cylinder
 was not empty there was a possible alternative • that the master tank top valve was shut. It seems unlikely that
 he could have been referring to the fire service resuscitator as he was dear that the bottle he received was a
 simple piece o f equipment not designed to breathe for the patient but merely to supply oxygen.
    17. I conclude that on a balance o f probabilities the evidence does not justify a finding that an empty
 cylinder was brought to the scene.
 Calling the Fire Service
    18. PC Bichard’s call to police Headauarters at 3.13 pm for the fire service to bring hydraulic cutting
 equipment to cut metal fences <see paragraoh 101 supra) was heard by Chief inspector Edmundson. He went
 into the adjacent operations room to give instructions for the message to be passed to the fire service. There, a
 temporary control room assistant was already speaking to the fire service about a house fire. Mr Edmundson
 interrupted the call and asked the assistant to tell the Are service that cutting equipmentwas wanted at
 Hillsborough. There followed a conversation between the assistant and Miss Davies at the fire service m the
 following terms:-
   Police          Can we have cutting gear for Hillsborough, please - straight away?
   Fire Control    Just a minute. Right - what’s the address?
   Police         Cutting equipment for Hillsborough football ground - straight away.
   Fire Control    Hillsborough football ground?
   Police         Yes. Hillsborough football ground.
   Fire Control    What road is that on? Do you know?
   Police          There has been a major accident, all the ambulances are up there.
   Fire Control    What road is it on?
   Police         I have no idea: Hillsborough football ground.
   Fire Control   What road is it on? Do you know 0
  Police          "Hillsborough football ground - what road is it on?" (this was said to someone in Police
                  Force Control) - “Penistone Road” (to Fire Control).
  Fire Control    Penistone Road.
  Police          Penistone Road! OK.
  Fire Control    Penistone Road, just a minute - what's exactly involved?
  Police          It's football, a big match. Liverpool v Notts Forest.
  Fire Control    Yes. but why do you want us: you said it was an RTA [Road Traffic Accident].
  Police          No. no. no: m a jo r incident inside tiie ground.
  Fire Control    Major incident inside - do you know exactly what it is?
  Police          No. 1don’t: they want all the cutting gear.
  Fire Control    For what - do you know?
  Police          Hang on a sec.
  At th a t p o in t C h ief Inspector E dm undson intervened and spoke for the police. T he conversation
con clu d ed :-
  Police          (M ale voice I - Hello!
    Fire Control   Hello! Now you wnt some cutting gear - what exactly is it for?

    Police         There has been a major accident at Hillsborough football ground where the semi-fmal is:
                   the crowds have forced their way in. they have broken fences and gates down. 1 don’t know
                   exactly what it is but there are people trapped.

   Fire Control    Right! O K -lea v e it with us.

   That conversation took 1 minute 13 seconds. It was published in a number o f newspapers with strong
 critical comment mostly against the fire service. The thrust o f the criticism was that valuable time was wasted
 by the fire service asking unnecessary questions as to where and why cutting equipment was required.

    19. There was a meeting o f the emergency services in August 1988 to discuss procedure in the event o f a
 major disaster at Sheffield Wednesday's ground, it was pointed out and minuted that “Hwasimpteraiive that
 the Police Control give the exact location o f any fire or incident and as much detail as possible. No senior fire
 officer is on duty at the m atch.. . Fire service will attend via Penistone Road or Leppings Lane as directed by
 the police.”

   20. The message from PC Bichard contained all the necessary information - Leppings Lane end. hydraulic
cutting equipment, to cut metal fences. Regrettably, it was not passed on by Headquarters in those terms. Miss
Davies had rightly been trained to require a precise location and needed to know the problem which would face
the fire service so that the appropriate response could be made. In fact, there are several football grounds in the
Hillsborough district although clearly Sheffield Wednesday's ground is the principal one. In the result,
although Chief Inspector Edmundson clarified, to an extent, the nature of the problem, the locus which
emerged in the course of the conversation (Penistone Road) was not that contained in the original message
from ground control (ie “Leppings Lane end.”) Whilst on the face o f the conversation the fire service may seem
to have been slow in the uptake or perhaps pedantic, in my view the police ought to have been more specific.
They had the necessary information to be so.

  21. I am satisfied, however, that the delay o f 1 minute 13 seconds over the call, and even the delay
occasioned by the cutting equipment going to Penistone Road rather than Leppings Lane, did not affect the
outcome. Even had those with cutting equipment gone directly after a briefer ’phone call they would not have
arrived at a stage early enough to make cutting the fencing a helpful exercise.

Mr Kenny Dalglish
  22. When the Liverpool manager went to the control room and agreed to make the announcement
broadcast at 3.56 pm. he says in a statement that he could not get the Tannoy to work. Spectators could see
him trying to address them and indicated to him manually that nothing could be heard. An officer pressed
buttons on the machine and Mr Dalglish says he tried again with similar lack o f success. He was then taken
under the police box to the room used by the disc jockey to broadcast pre-match music. There, the microphone
worked and he broadcast his message.

   23. Mr Dalglish was not called. There was no other evidence about this incident. 1 accept it occurred as he
described. Why the Tannoy could not at that time be successfully operated from the police box is. however,
strange and unexplained. Unlike the radio, it had operated satisfactorily from the police box at the critical
times save that its messages may not always have been heard above the prevailing noise. It had worked at about
3.30 pm when it called for medical staff. 1 can see no grounds for criticising the police in regard to this incident
and certain it is that the brief delay in relaying Mr Dalglish's message can have had no significant effect.

               Dr. Phillips, may I just asK you a couDie questions about the
               use of the defibrillator as you appear to be familiar with it.
B              It is right in acdition to being certain that the patient is
               in fibrillation you have got. .to be certain. of the typ*. of
               fibrillation? “here is a course and fine fibrillation, is not
               there? - A. Usually ir. carciac arrest one cf two situations
               exists.  There may ce absolutely no fibrillation and it mav
               actually be asystclic.

                                                           _me.     is net it. on the machine?

          handed to witness) Do you recognise any of those? - a. These
          are all ECG tracings. I assume.

      0. Yes.  what is the first one? - a. The first one demonstrates
         patient in carciac arrest most likely who is fibrillating.   2
         don't reaily see the point of drawing a distinction between
         the types of fibrillation.
 B
               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am wondering where the whole of
          this is taking us, quite frankiy.

                 MR. KALLIFSTIS;    can do it in two sentences, sir:

      0. Dr. Phillips, wouic ycu have used the defibrillator in all cf
         these conditions? - a. This is not a condition.  This is a
         piece cf paper.

      o. I am sorry.  Short circuit.   The conditions as revealed by
         these readings? - a . This does not reveai anything.  I want to
         see wnat the patient looks like. Has he got a palpable heart
         beat?

      ■0. The point is this, you can see that for example the
D         distinction between - 2 nd 5 is very fine, is not it;

      0. - is in fact a ventricular fibrillation and 5 is merely a
         loose leao cn the nacr.ir.e. You see the point? - a. These
         traces are net coming off 2 defibrillator.   They are coming,


        ,\'o. no. tr.ey come from the defibrillator which prints a read­
        out . That is wnat you nave to monitor before you use the
        macnine.     In a crcwcec situation that Mr. Phillips described
        to you con ’t you tnink it would be very difficult to
        cisti.nguisn between - and 5. for example? - a. I don’t thir.it
        you wou.iO have oeer. attempting to ..use, the defibrillator as a
        oiasr.cstic neoncc un.ess vou hac 2 collapsed' patient wno you
        were .airlv o ar t a m was in carciac arrest.

                                     eart pattern is cefcre you apply tne
        paccles cf tne csf icriilatcr    f you don't .take tn*":^eacinf ;y
        ■first? - a . I con’t see' tne point o

        n s n t condition : tr it. end tnat means taking a reading.of his
Q ;    heart    beat or tne aosence of it? - a. That is not entirely
  !    true,    because tnere are defibrillators tnat don't give a read'
        out. in wnicn case you use tnem purely on clinical grounds.

  ;          MR. •■-ALLIPET I£:£ir. I don't think I need take this

        you haa been working for 15 minutes, that was behind tne goal
        I think, was not it? - a . That is right, yes.
 B                           Cress-Examined bv MR. WOODWARD:

        Dr. Phillips, you went into pen j? -                    a   . Yes.

        And having got into pen i you perceived there was quite a
        crowa of people in it? - a . Yes.

        At that stage if you had wanted to what was there to prevent
C
        vcu from returning anc retracing your path if you did not like
        what you found? - A. There was nothing to prevent it. but 1
        did r.ot know there was anv other way on to tha terrace.

        But you got cn to tr.e terrace, and does it follow from your
        continued path across the terrace to where you took up a
        position that was b y choice? - a. Yes.

             0. So tne evidence you would have the Inquiry accept is that from

               that point until climbing over?

            -. Yes? - A. I am fairly soon we got to that position by about
               2.20. at tne most 2.30. .^nd as 1 have said I am not sure when
               I climbed over zr.e fence, but it could have been rouna about
               iO-past-3.

                          CRITICISMS OF SYMAS

A.   Implicit       criticisms of SYMAS appeared in quotations
     contained in an article which appeared in The Times and The
     Independent, of 17 April 1989.     They also appeared- in other,
     newspapers.       The remarks were made by two doctors who
     attended Hillsborough as Liverpool supporters on 15 April
     1989.    During the course of the evidence it became clear
     that the first five criticisms by Doctor A related to events
     in the area behind the Leppings Lane stand and terrace (day
     25 pl21D).




     DOCTOR A


     1. "At 3.30 pm there were no medical personnel apart from
        one or two St John's ambulancemen. There was no medical
        equipment and there was only one ambulance."
       FACTS:
       a.    Ambulances arriving at Leppings Lane (see video RJH2)
             1513     S407 arrives (leaves 1523)
             1516     S203 arrives (leaves 1528)
                      (by 1530 Mr Early from this ambulance is on
                      the pitch - video MAPI)
             1521     S208 arrives (leaves 1532)
             1535     R608 arrives
             This doctor cannot have arrived in the concourse
             until about 1535.
       b.    About 40 casualties are taken from the Leppings Lane
             end by SYMAS, of which 5 were removed by 1532.   All
                                 1
           casualties had been removed from that end of the
           ground by 1606 (SYMAS recording track 19 page 19).
           Therefore about 35 casualties, all of whom survived
           were conveyed by SYMAS vehicles between 1532 and
           1606.



2.    "Lack of triage"
     FACTS:
     a.   SYMAS personnel operated triage:
          -   see   Miss Moffat's statement, paragraph 7
          -   see   Mr Yoxall's evidence - day 23 page 126F
          -   see   Mr Williams's statement - paragraphs 15 to 18
          -   see   Mr Litster's statement - paragraphs 16 and 21
     b . Other personnel - police - also:
          - see Miss Pearson's evidence - day 17 page 159E-H



3.   "A full casualty team with resuscitation equipment did
     not arrive from the hospital until about 4.15 pm."
     FACTS:
     a. A full casualty team arrived at the designated
        casualty clearing station (the gymnasium) at the
         Penistone Road end of the ground.     Miss Moffat's
         statement paragraph 12 shows that the medical team
        left Northern General Hospital at 1544; it would
        therefore have been at the ground by 1550 at the very
         latest.
     b. A casualty team did not attend at Leppings Lane and
        all casualties had been removed from that end of the
        ground by 1606 (see above).
     c. A further casualty team arrived from Barnsley
        District General Hospital at the designated casualty
        clearing station but was not required.
     d.   The implication that only the casualty teams would
          have resuscitation equipment is wrong.   All SYMAS
          frontline ambulances carry portable and fixed
          resuscitation equipment which was used at Leppings
                                 2
          Lane.   Fire service also carried resuscitation
          equipment.



4.   "There was no oxygen, airway tubes and drips.

     FACTS:
     a.   No oxygen     -   Wrong »     All SYM.AS frontline
                            ambulances carry pneupac minuteman
                            oxygen resuscitators and have a
                            static supply of oxygen on board.
     b.   No airways - Wrong:
                         i. All SYMAS frontline vehicles carry
                            a selection of airways, and a large
                            number were inserted.
                        ii. If the doctor means to refer to the
                             lack of intubation equipment, such
                             equipment is carried by paramedics
                             for use by them as they are trained
                             to use it.     Although there were
                             some doctors present in the crowd
                             who were competent to use such
                             equipment had it been available for
                             general use (apart from that
                             brought by paramedics and the
                             medical team) it is impractical to
                             expect a supply of such equipment,
                             which can only safely be used by
                             those trained to use it, to be
                             available on the off chance that
                             suitably qualified persons may be
                             among spectators. (This doctor
                             admitted that it was some time
                             s i n c e he had c a r r i e d out an
                           ' intubation himself - see day 2 5
                             page I24D).
                      iii. A consultant anaesthetist (day 25
                           p27D) agreed that if the tube were
                           wrongly inserted it could kill the
                           patient. The treatment that was
                           being a d m i n i s t e r e d by police
                           officers, fans, St John's and SYMAS
                           ambulancemen, namely CPR, was the
                           correct treatment               in the
                           circumstances and undoubtedly did

                                save lives.
         c.    No drips     -   Wrong:
                             i. Infusion equipment is carried by
                                paramedics, and requires special
                                training, however, there is no
                                evidence that any casualty was
                                prejudiced by the lack of infusion
                                equipment.
                            ii. Medical Team (gymnasium) obviously
                                had I .V. drips because spectator
                                nurse F J Eccleston gave evidence
                                that he set up 10 drips ready for
                                doctors (Transcript day 5 pi50).



    5.   "More lives could have been saved if staff and equipment
         had arrived earlier."
         FACTS:
         a.   Before he was reminded that he had made such a
              statement to the press, Dr in chief (day 25 page 115G
              to 116G) accepted that it was pure speculation
              whether or not further lives could have been saved
              (day 25 page 115G to 116D), and on cross examination
              (day 25 page 127C to D) a g r e e d that it was
              "unfortunate" that he had sought out the press to
              make public pronouncements which it was not possible
              for him to make.
         b.   If as SYMAS submit, the crushing started at the very
              latest at 1459, by the time that any medical
              a s s i s t a n c e got to the most severely crushed
              spectators they had been deprived of oxygen for over
              4 minutes and therefore it is unlikely that the
              presence or otherwise of such equipment made any
              practical difference.



    DOCTOR P
    6.   "Complains about the lack of defibrillators"
         FACTS:

                                 4
a. We believe that the Inquiry accepts that the use of
    defibrillators on the pitch in the circumstances of
    this tragedy would have been professionally
   irresponsible, (day 19 page 31C) (day 24 page 103F)
    (day 25 page 24a and 29A).
b.   In case anybody has any doubts about it we list the
     difficulties:
       i.   If wrongly used it can kill:
            - the patient
            - the operator
            - any third party coming into contact with the
              patient.
      ii.   Before being used national guidelines for
            ambulancemen lay down that an ECG reading for
            diagnosis should be obtained from the machine.
            In order for the reading and diagnosis to be
            accurate the patient and the defibrillator must
            be completely isolated from any movement and
            t h e s u r r o u n d i n g e n v i r o n m e n t m u s t be
            sufficiently stable to permit an accurate
            assessment of the ECG recorded. Spurious
            readings can occur in a crowd.
     iii.   In the circumstances of this tragedy when
            otherwise relatively fit individuals were
            rendered hypoxic (lack of oxygen), the likely
            heart pattern is asystole (continuous line of
            electrical activity with no effective heart
            contractions) and not ventricular fibrillation.
            The purpose of a defibrillator is to jolt a
            fibrillating heart rhythm back into a normal
            pattern.   The standard treatment for asystole
            is CPR. Successful CPR would normally produce
            a regular heart pattern rather than ventricular
            fibrillation.
     iv.     However, given the length of time during which
            most of the patients had been deprived of
            oxygen, even the use of a defibrillator would
            not have made any practical difference (see Dr
            P's statement to the police, page 7 "my
            thoughts that in view of the length of time he
            was pulseless it would probably be kinder if he
            died.   I am sure he must have been severely
            brain damaged by that time" and at the bottom
            of the page "I looked desperately for somebody
            not dead but seriously ill who needed help. I
            could not find anybody in that category in the
                             5
                    goal area.   They were either all dead or okay
                    with nothing in between.")
B.   Ambulance Equlpmenr
     1.   A list of equipment carried by all SYMAS frontline
          ambulances, the contents of a rescue box carried on a
          frontline ambulance, the contents of an ambulanceman's
          satchel and the equipment carried by an extended trained
          ambulanceman are contained in Section V.
     2.   This equipment is intended for use by SYMAS personnel and
          not by third parties.
     3. Much of the equipment has to be kept with the ambulance
         for use on the journey to hospital.
     4.   The primary purpose of the ambulance is to give immediate
          treatment to casualties and convey them to hospital.
     5.   On 15 April 1989 many SYMAS ambulancemen treated
          casualties with CPR and resuscitation, as well as
          conveying 172 injured to hospital. Any criticism of lack
          of equipment on SYMAS vehicles is ill-informed.

              Ycu saw police horses though, cid you? • A. There were one
              or two police hers as ~r.au I saw. Triere were only about
              hair* a dozen officers -hat I saw in total, and that rnav be
              cenercus, actually.

       Q.     I think it is right, is it not, that your children joined
             the crowd cf people going through the turnstiles but you
             chose not to?     A.    It was too unpleasant,  vie cot to
 BT"         within about 10 yards-cf the tujcasriles anci it was too
             crushed.   I didn't like it.     I became somewhat claustrophobic
             and I withdrew,    iiy nephew, who is 24, said that he was"
             going in and it would gat worse before it got better, and
            “so he said he was going on. i-iy two teenage boys insisted
             on going with tneir cousin, so I found ntyseif witndrawing

             And wnere did you go back to when you left the crowd of
             people?   A. The first ti:ne I withdrew, I just withdrew
             as far as the Landrover which had appeared at that point.
             It was about quarter-to-2 and tnere was a Landrover by
             tne cates.

 very strongly tnat tr.at point ,needs to be iaade.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Bld>_y.CU take what the piyn had
 said seriously?     A. Yes, I was quite shocked and •— -

 DidLyou_say anything to the policeman?   A. I. said “Don't
 you think you'd better see what the problem is*. He wasn't
 actually —
 You said that, did you?            A.   Thar is my recollection.
       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          Yes.   -•

      Mr. PHILLIPS: Ycu v;en- up tne stairs and I tnink
 locked for your seat, '..'as it congested in the Kest Stand
when you went up tnere?       A. Well, I had now begun to
worry because my two sens ana ray nephew nad cone and I
had reaiisea that there was something going on. This was
tne first time I realised that there was really a problem
as opposed to my anticipation that there could be a problem
at cuarter-to-3. So I hurried up the stairs and found
that it was very congested at the top of the stairs, that
there were people in tne aisle all the way back up to the
cop of the stairs, and that I couldn't make progress down
to the row cf seats v;here we had tickets booked, which was
the second row from tne very front.     I couldn't get down
tnere because there ••'era so rnanv people actually in the
stand.

V:hen you got ir.ee tna .stand, were you able to see out on
tc the field of clay?     A . iicc immediately.

■.'.".'er. you -.vers arle tc loo.-: out or. to tne field of play,
was tne match still m progress?               A. Ho.

I tnink you eventually managed to struggle down to your
sons and your nephew?         A. Yes, I went along the row
adjacent tc where I had come cut at tne top of the stairs
us cause I decided tr.at would be the easiest way to get
down t: the front, and m e n I stecusd down, over tne rows
 »w »**i                 rrw tc wnere thev were ar.c four.a that
         sre ail n - . ‘

Can: you say w n a t .tims it would be wnen 'you* got tnere?
A.   ihat must have- been about-xan-past-5''-0r justp-fft-er/.
cecause the came nad stopped.       I didn't even know tne
game nad ever started, to be .honest.

You would not nave seer, any of it at all, wouid you?
A.   No.

And what was happening at the front of the terrace? A. I:
was just chaos.   The immediate impression there was of
large^numbers of people being pulled up into the stand
from the terrace.   My nephew was involved in that. He
was pulling up people with other people; and then you
could see people on tne_^J.tch lying clearly very severely
ill, aistressea, some cf them looking as though they may
already be dead - one or two - at that stage.

    Were you able to see into the terrace from where you were?
    A. Oh yes.   Into the terrace?

    Into tne terrace.  A. Only really towards the front.   I
    didn't really take ir. the terrace. My attention was drawn
    to the whole area cf the pitch really.

   what did you do?    A. My immediate concern was with the
  pressure that tnere was there at the front rows, because
  It was very squashed in the front' rows of the stand because
  there v/ere so many people in there; and I wanted to get
  my own cnildren back away from that pressure, so I persuaded
  :r.v two sons to come back a few rows. My nephew, Carl,
  stayed cecause ne was helping to puli people up-s Then
  wnen I got back about eight or ten rows, you know, I was
  tnen aoie tc appraise tne situation in the stand and lock
  across and see what was actually going on across the pitcn.

 These people who were being brought up into the West Stand,
 did they appear tc you tc have any injuries or to be
 distressed physically?      A.   -’hev v/ere' distressed. At
 tnat point there were no obvious serious injuries among
 tnose who v/ere coming -up.    This happened last year as well,
 tnat people were brcugnt up from the terrace into the
 stand. You could sea.them from where I was in the terrace
 last year; people were pulled up into the stand.

At ’
   ..'hat stage die it happen last year? A. I can't rememoer.
It's a long time age. =ut I remember seeing people being
pulled up into tr.e stand last year.

Cculd you say hew many people were pulled up last year?
A . I couldn’t say.  I just remember noting it, you know.

•lid you near anything on the tannoy?     .A. Tes, the tannoy
was    tailing peopletc get off the pitch and get backinto
tne     ground, wnicr. Ifound in retrospect---

I can't ae certain arout whether they said to get back
or. tne cround.   The-/ sai d tc get off the pitch.

     Mr. PHILLIPS:    All right.  Did you hear anything about
doctors on the tannoy?   A. Not until about 20-past-3.

And wnat did you near?     A.  I can't remember tne precise
•.;ords but they tanncved for maybe doctors and nurses; it
may nave been medical personnel.    It was to make themselves
available to go down.

                   in carrying out people, injured or dead people? - A. There
                   •./ere but the impression you had v/as a lot of supporters had
                   get involved in either carrying cut people cr trying to
                   resuscitate people.    It was very impressive hew many support ars
                   v/ere actually involved.

              Q. Did you     see any ambulances when you v/ere down there in the
    B            yard? -     A. Well at this stage r was aware of one ambulance,
                 outside     the gate and I v/as also a\*are that people were being
            !    carried     out of the cats into the lane at the bacl-:.

            j q.    Can you tell us what time this was? - A. lie11      i t   m is t   have
            J       been about 3.30.

                . Did you -not see a succession of ambulances at that time on
                  Leppincs Lane at the back? - A. i-Io. A succession of
        ■        aabulances did not materialise until it must have been
        j         about a quarter-to-4.

   j c. *,vhat cid you yourself actually do? -      ;.*eli having seen the
   •     situation I went back up and brought my two sons downstairs
        and put them in a safe place. That was the first thing I
Dj      did.    I then initially attended two people who were lying
        on the floor.     I ascertained that one of them v/as not”
        seriously' injured and one cf them was dead, "hen I realised
        that because there was nobody in control cf the situation
        there was no crder _c what was happening and the ambulance
        that '..•as outside seme cf the Police were about to put people
        in it who v/ere not actually critically ill, so at that* point
        I realised that what was needed •..•as- somebody to take an
E :     overview of the entant of the injuries and to actually specif
        ./he should be taken away tc the hospital as quickly as possib
       .because there was no medical presence, there was no equipment
        Thera was nothing one could do on the ground. People v/ere
        doing the best they could just with normal resuscitation
        attempts but that '.'to ;ne limit cf what cr.e cculc do and
        there .;are a lot :f. tecpis doing tnat, sc the important
        thing was to make sure that the critically ill people went
F? ' ■ m -'*■ priority order,'to the. hospital casualty department.

                   :;eren •t the ambulance people doing this themselves? - A. :;ot
                   really.    I mean, they, did net seem to have very much in the
                   way of e q u i p m e n t . T h e r e was just the one ambulance there
                   at first as I say and then later on there were more ambulance,
                   came and the emergency response improved very much towards
                   I suppose 4 o'clock.
g   ;
                   When I asked that question. Dr. Ashton, I v/as asking about
                   really whether the xAmbulance people v/ere themselves classif-i:
                   people into priorities? - A. Ho, they weren't. I actually
                   v/as instructing them who to take first and second.   I actually
                   categorised people into ones who could wait and ones who
                   needed to co and the Ambulance r?eoole resoonded to me.

              I don't recall them bringing any oxygen cylinders out from

              in the Lane or the terrace area to my recollection until
              the Fire Service arrived and an anaesthetist and I presume
D             a crash team from the-hospital turned up some time after 4.

    A   Q. >rell we may hear differently. vrhat else would you think
           should have been available? - A. IJell onygen and crip lines
           and salines.

        Q. Drip lines and salines? - A. Yes.

        Q. At the crounc? - A. '.fell I think from my understanding of
           continental Clubs that the big continental Clubs have a fully
    B      equipped firsz aid post and casualty post at the grounds in
           Ssain.

                     Could I just add:  it seems to me if there are 50,000
              people in one place that is like a small town and the normal
              kind cf medical facilities should be there for a small town.
              I don't mean thaw ir. an extreme sense but there is likely
              to be events happening tc people when you have got 50,000
              people in one place for several hours, the sane tilings will
              happen. Ycu would enpect that some people will have a
              coronary; some people will have ocher things happening in
              the normal course cf events, so there should be some kind
              of first aid post available anyway.

              There v/ere first aid facilities on the ground of course at
              the far end cf the ground.    ',That perhaps we might like tc

         was there, that if equipment of this nature had been
         available it would have ."ace any practical difference to
         the number of people who survived? - A. I think it is a
         very difficult question because of the nature of the
         injuries.    It saens to tae that a lot of people were actually
         dead when they ’./ere brought out from the ground so we are
         really in the realms of _soeculation. r  Jhat I would say is

                   correct.

                have a properly                                      d emergency response at grounds for

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Can you just help me. The people
 you say you were helping to dispatch, there uere those who
 were dead and there those with very minor injuries who you die
 not dispatch.     The ones you helped to dispatch, what sort cf
 injuries did they have which you thought they were going tc be
 able to be helped with at hoscital? - A. There were things
 like clearly crush injuries to the chest.     They looked as
 though they had fractured ribs or they might have had a
 punctured lung,..

 Eut they were still breathing all right? - a . They were
 breathing, but tney were obviously seriously ill. They
 obviously needed medical attention as soon as possible.        They
 needed to be got off to where that was available.

was that the principal fora of injury of the casualties ycu
dispatched? - a . Quite a lot of chest injuries and some
abdominal rigidity which sight have indicated they might have
ruptured intestines anc that kind of thing.

      MR. PHILLIPS:    Did you find any deficiency in supply of
ambulances to take these people away? - A. When I went down
into that area at the back at half-past-3 there was one
ambulance there, a second one came shortly after, but they die
not come in a constant stream into the area there until I
would put it at about cuarter-to-4.      I understand there is
some dispute about this. but I am telling ycu that the
ambulances were not -here in Leppir.gs Lane itself where they
could be utilises until that tine. I don't -'.now wnere they
were.   They -ust r.ave beer, stuck on the way cr something, cr
in traffic.

you found wner. you get to the gymnasium that things had been
pretty well cleared up :y then? - a . Yes. they had.

Anc I tnink it was not Ions after that you left with your
family? - A. '.-'ell,, oaf ore that I went back to the Leppings
Lane end to just''•finally      neck what was going on there.    : war
as see to certify tne ceai oy cne cf the Officers. So I began
to certify the dead at tnat end.        There was a general
practitioner who.r.aa ceen i n v o l v e d a s well,■..«**■ also
involved certifying tne dead." Th«';/%*io of us caffilKi cut tnat
task.   That was from accut 2.£-pa|6t-4 for abour:%'df.'lO
minutes.   Then I tncugr.t presumaoly somebooy will have a
                 ing.     Presumably the. people who were involved,
in tnis    wouid ail oe gathered together ano there would be some
kind cf     debriefing. So I went back to the gymnasium to see.-:
that out.   This time wnen I got to the gym I found it very
difficult to gain entry.       The Police were excluding everybodv
and the emergency people inside the gym hac been told to go
cut, the people wno had been helping, and the only people wno
were allowed to be in the gym were the Police.        Somebody
senior in authority ox the Police had got all the Police to
cne end of the gym and was giving them some kind of
cebriefing, but not the -medical people as far as I could see. -
I could see I was not wanted so I left.
                                                        J.   ASHTON



               Then on ny way back to Lappings Lane for the final time I
         aet a constable who was totally broken down and weeping and ir.
         tears. I comforted hia. and he said, "They are going to blame
         us now.   They will blame the Police.  They will say it was our
         fault, but it was the senior officers' fault because they
         didn't take control ana didn't organise things, and when they
         came they just got in the way” . That is what he said.

    0.    He said that to you? - A. Yes.

    Q.    In your statement, Dr. Ashton, you   say towards the very end
         something about this:

              "On Saturday I believe this belief about football
              supporters contributed to the apparently slow initial
              response by the Police tc what was happening. It seemed
              that they mistook the tragedy for crowd trouble” .

         What was it that you saw that made you form that conclusion? -
         A. There are many things that happened that day, but the one
         image that sticks in my mind is the image of that very large
         line of Policemen across the centre of the pitch at the time
         when tney should have -been helping people to get out of the
         grounc.

a. To get out cf the grcunc? - A. To get out of the terrace.     The
   assumption, was that tnev needed to keep -the supporters from
   going town to tne ctr.er enc.

I. could you see wnat was going on at the front of the pens, what
   ctr.er Police Officers were coing at tnat time? - A. I
   understand from reports I have read that the Police were
   involved in helping people, but I also understand and I have
   had a large number of eye witness accounts sent to me from
   people who wer -- aouseo or pushed back into the terrace. I
   have one person I have the account which I have submitted of
   somebody who had actually managed to get out and then was made


0. So it is on the casts c: that you are saying the' Police
   mistooK it .for crcwc trouble? - A. That is my impression.

0. Yes. . Thank you.very such.

                     Cross-Examined bv HR. KALLIPETXS

0. Cr. Ashton, you are a lecturer?         Is that right? - A. Yes.

0. Do you also have a practice? - A. I am a public health
   consultant with Mertey Regional Health Authority and a
   lecturer at Liverpool University.

Q. That is not quite an answer to the question.  Do you also have
   a practice? - A. I no longer practice clinical medicine as
   such.  I am a community physician involved in public health.

q   . When was tne last time you did have a practice, may I ask? -
                                                              ASHTON



       A. You may, yes.       1 was a general practitioner until 1976.

 0.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    From? - A. From 1974 to 1976.            I
       was a junior hospital doctor between 1970 and 1974.

 o.             MR. KALLIFETIS:   So two years in general practice? -       a   .
       ye s .

 Q. And then you went into - I don't mean it unkindly - the
    academic side? - A. It is not, actually.  It* is quite a-•
    practical side.  I am involved in public health in preventive
    medicine, which incorporates a wide'range of activities,
    including an interest in things like crowd safety and
    environmental protection and so on. So this area has some
    professional interest to me as weil.

 Q. You told us what happened when you arrived at the ground anc
    when you went through tne turnstiles.  When you were about to
    go up the staircase that you have indicated to take your seat
    you told us about this man who came out from the tunnel area
    saying, "There are kids dying in there” . My Lord asked you
    whether you took that seriously, and you said you did. - A.
    Yes. he was very distressed.

0. Did you mean what you said to my Lord that you did take that
   seriously? - A. Yes. I did.

      You tr.en told .ty Lore you said to the Policeman. "I think you
      sr.cuic go anc oc screening or find out about it".    Is that
      right? - A . I ;si: sometning like, "Don't you think you r.ac
      better I oo k into it?", because he cidn't respond at all.   He
      .rust carried on inspecting the tickets.

0.     What tic he reply t; ycu? -     a   .I don't think he replied.   I
      cor.'t rememcer hi” replying.

      Ycu as a community pnvsician with a great interest in
      co“ .unity rr.ecicme anc as a doctor, did you think you might
      go there, and fine cut if people really.were dying? - A. At
      tnat point my concern was to find out where my two sons were
      and my nephew.

0. The answer to my question is. you did consider it or you did
   not consider it? - a . At tnat point I felt the balance cf -v
   .priorities was to go anc iook and see where my two sons were.

C. Is the answer that you did think about it but you thought it
   was more important to go and find out where you sons were? -
   A. That is correct.

0. So you did think about going in there? - a . a s you can see I
   didn't hold back later on in the afternoon.    I became
   involved.  It was thrcugnout the afternoon I had this balance
   tc strike between looking after my own children and becoming
   involved in the emergency, situation, and it was very difficult,
   because it was cifficuit to know what was happening.

 having described the crush situation which you preferred not
 to get into? Is that right? - a. That is correct , but they
 are not full grown yet, and one of my son’s friends was one of
 those who was killed in the disaster.

 When you got up to the stana. Dr. Ashton, had play started? -
 A. Presumably play had started and stopped, because there was
 no- play "going, on wnea. I got up there.

Were the players still on the pitch? - A. No.

They were not ?   a   . :.'c.

You are certain about that? - A. I can’t be certain because
there were a lot cf people on the pitch.  There may have been
players but I didn't see them.  I think they had left.

Again you told us you could see people on the pitch, sone of
whom were clearly seriously injured, and I think you said some
of them were dead? - a. By about quarter-past: I found myself
saying to the person standing next to me, "There are two
people dead there.   There are three, four, five dead there” ,
because you could see-front where I was, because it was very
close to the front of- the stand, not very far from the
goalmouth front tne vantage point down, people who were lying.
They looked completely still.and they looked as' though they
were dead.   People had been trying to resuscitate them and
leaving them.   People at first were incredulous that this was
what tne situation was, but that was my impression.

Were they being administered to by St. John's Ambulancemen cr
amculancemen cr Policemen cr fans? - A. You have a much better
assessment cf tnat frcm tne film. but....

I am interested in wnat you saw. Dr. Ashton, you understand? -
A. The impressicn I hac was there were not very many St.
John’s Afflouiar.csmer. tr.ere :n the pitch and a lot of the
attention was ceir.g f en cy supporters.

Yes, supporters wr.cm ..zu had no reason to believe were
medically.qualified? - A. That is correct.

Again as a .doctor with the concerns that you have, did you
think it might be a good idea if you went down to offer your
help? - A.'There was no way out forwards.

I am sorry, I d o n ’t understand that. - A . I was in the stand.
It was impossible to get forward on to the pitch.

The question was did you think it would be a good idea if you
went down to offer your help? - A . Yes, I was considering it,
and as soon as they Tannoyed for medical assistance I went anc
offered my help.

They Tannoyed for assistance just before 3.30. - A. I would
place it a t ....

 Q. I think we can prove that, Dr. Ashton, just before 3.30. - a.
    Yes, I accept that.
 Q. So you waited for the Tannoy announcement before you went
    downstairs? — a . Yes. You assume that at large events people
    have got things under control and that there are emergency
    services and there is an emergency plan.

 0.   Forgive me. Dr. Ashton, but you are telling usthey were not
      there from your view in the stand. Is not that right?  -a .
      Yes.

 Q. That assumption would not assist.   So you waited for the
    Tannoy announcement before you went down? - a .  Yes.

Q.     So you-arrive down in the yard some time about 3.30? - A. If
      the Tannoy was 2.30 then it must have been a little after
      that.

0.    I think it was just before 3.30. - A. OK.

0.     Ycu would accept I ant sure that your area of vision is limitec
      to what is immediately in your vicinity at any one time? - A.
      At the game?

•j. Downstairs' in- the -/arc. -      Yes., the-part for which I car.
    sp e a K is the area behir.c Leppir.gs Lane stana and in Leppings
    Lane itself.

j . Your impression, and I an not in any way suggesting you are
    anything other tnan an honest witnesses, please understand
    that, cut your impression is there was oniy one ambulance anc
    no equipment, and I am not going to recite ail of your
    evidence, but that is your impression that you have of this
    day? - A. Eehind Leppings Lane end, yes.

j.. iy 3.30 at least four smouiances had already attended at tr.e
  . back of Leppings Lane.  Does that surprise you? - A. Well, if
    they had been they had been ana gone.

O,' You don't seem to have catered for that possibility. One., cf
    them had been and. gone.and three were in position before 3.3-:.
    - a . Yes.

0.    We can see that also cn the video. - A. OK.  I accept that,
      but the ambulances cia not arrived in the kind of numbers
      that were neeaed until later than that, when they started to
      ccme in a steady stream.

O. Dr. Ashton, you as an experienced community physician will
   understand that one does not have hundreds of ambulances
   sitting around doing nothing? - a . I think this does raise
   questions about how many ambulances are available.

0.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   How many do you suggest there
      ought to be available before a football match? - A. To be
                                                          ASHTON


      present at a match?
 Q. Yes. - A. My experience is limited on these matters.

 0.   I am asking for your professional view? - A. 1 think what is
      needed is that there neeas to be studies of events. There is
      literature on events which I am not....

 <3. Are you not going- to be able to help me?-   a   . No, probably
     not.

Q.         MR. KALLIFETIS:    How many ambulances do you think
      should have come tc that event once it was realised the size
      of the disaster? - A. I would say there was something like
      40 seriously hurt people at the back of Leppings Lane.   So
      it is the numoer cf ambulances that were needed to take
      those people to hospital.

Q. Your   assessment is remarkably accurate, Dr. Ashton, because in
   fact   from the SYMAS records about 40 patients were conveyed
   from   the Leppings Lane end via ambulance to hospital. - a .
   That   is right, because I was involved in dispatching them.

0. Well, are you saying all 40 you sorted? - A. I think what you
   are telling me is tnare were a number who were sent off before
   I became involved, and I accept that, but....

j. would you also accept tnat before you arrived on the seen
   those ambulance Officers had the training and intelligence anc
   the presence cf mind to remove patients who were clearly not
   seriously injured from the ambulances who had entered of
   their own accord, anc put in patients who were seriously
   injured and needing to be taken to hospital immediately? -
   A. I am telling you what I found when I went down was that
   the Police were caking people to the ambulances not in order
   of priority of the severity of them.

0. That may well    be r ~. My concern is for the ambulance people
   wncm you have    cescrioeo as unable to sort the serious
   casualty ,froa   the less serious casualty.    A. I think you are
   trying to put    worts in -my mouth, actually.

o. I have no wish to co that.  If I have got the wrong iapressicr.
   I snail be happy to be corrected. - a . I don?*t.know whether
   tney were able or unable, but what I know was that it was r.ct
   happening when I went cown there, and I began to do the
   sorting and to tell the ambulance people which ones to take,
   and they were very happy to go aiong with that.




                            •"j. Dr. Ashton, if we are at

                                                                                  ASH'i'CN

             Q.    Dr. Ashton, if we are at cross-purposes, then we can cut
    ^              this short. Are you talking about the conveying of
                   casualties zo the ambulances by m e police or are you
                   r aikinc about, the conveying of casualties by the ambuian
                   to tne ncsoital?        You've thrown me now.

             Q.     I an sorry to have dene that. Are you talking about the
                   conveying or casualties by the police to the ambulances
                   when you said that there was no sorting of that priority,
    B"             cr are you talking-■about the coaveying ,o.f. casualties by” ...
                   ambulance to hospital when you say there v/as no sorting
                   of priorities?    A. What was happening was that the peopi
                   were being taken fro- the yard out by the wall in the" lar.s
                   and they v/ere being leaned against the wall or laid out
                   by tne wail in the lane, in a long line, and the police
                   were taking people from one end of the line as the
                   ambulances came, to put into the ambulances, and the
                   ambulancemen were going along with loading them up in
                   that way; and what I said was "*?his isn’t the right way
                   to dc it. We need tc actually decide who is the priority,
                   and ir. fact there are two people down that end who need
                   to co next, net these people here".   That v/as the kind cf


                   Dr. Ashton, you w i n forgive me if I suggest that whiie
    D              that night have beer .happening on occasions, it certainly
                   was r.ot the pattern cf the ambulance people.that afternoon
                   and cr.ey v/ere sorti.i g casualties as indeed tney are trair.e
                   to do?    A. Well, t .■'.ere are other medical witnesses wno
                   vou ccuiu Cdi i         suld substantiate what I have just sai

                  And equally I ecu Id eal_ every arnbuiar.ee officer who
                  attended if I tncugnt it necessary.    Hut will you perhaps
    El            accept tne statistic tnat of the 40 people who were
                  conveyed from Leppings Lane to hospital, only one was
                  found dead on arrival?     A. I think that that is a
                  vindication cf tr.e triage approach tnat was aaooted.

                                                                                    ay   cy   m e
                                                     <***    vwiiw   f    «■        s no t
                                          •C r t i e n      i t .in-, that way.      tni nk

        .
        •*. Precisely so.    A. 5ut there-was'■nobody in overall charge,
             whicn is my point.

  ;w.             You say tnat the ambulances had no equipment.    Did you
  i               inspect any c f tne amou lances?   A. racre was no equipment
Qj                brought from the ambulances into the area outside the
  J               ambulances.   Most o f the people were actually outside in
  !               tne lane and in tne yard, s o the equipment v/as neeaed
        j         outside.
'       !

        !i.       Did you not see ambulancemen with portable resuscitacors
                  and bacs and masks?   A. clot until later.

H           _•    - suggest .tnat you are wrong about tnat, and if necessary
                  you car. ioo.< at a video ana be corrected about it and see
                  -n<=:r. on cne video actual Iv using them at the back of Lepoi:
      Lane.        A.    Can you cell me how many?                .

      As many as   had arrived, Dr. Ashton. Each ambulanceman
      carries with him his nor-able treatment bac, including
      a portable resuscitator? A. And my point was that
      between half-oast-5 and about cuarter-to-4 there were
      only three ambulances during that time and it was after
      cuarter-to-4 that they began to come in a steady stream.

      Dr. Ashton, I am not going to bandy words with you because
      the evidence that we have heard comes from reliable
      sources.  Dr. Ashton, will you also accept that the
      equipment on an ambulance is necessary to stay on the
      ambulance to treat a patient while he is being conveyed
      to hospital?   A. Wei*, yes, but sometimes it needs to
      be used off the ambulance as well.

      Of course, but the primary purpose of an ambulance is to
      convey a patient as quickly as possible to hospital, is
      it not?   A. It is the main purpose most of the time, but

  “hat is sufficient, thank you very much indeed, Were you
  wearing a brcwn suit or brown jacket on that day? A. Mo.

  Cr a light coloured jacket?                   A.     No.

  You tali: a tout the intubation treatment.' Have you ever
  intubated a patient?     A. Yes, but not for some time.

  Would you risk doing one or. that occasion?                          A. In that
  situation, I would, yes.

                          :■£ last resort, is it .tot?                A. Intubation?

    A   Q.    My Lord asked you wha: equipment you would have liked tc
              have seen outside the ground to assist those patients who
              had been carried cur.   You described them as sufferine

              thev are likely to be bieedincr internally and it would be

              kind of fluid ran1seament.

              Ar.vthing else?   A. ~hcse are the two main things that

 As a matter of fact, Dr. Ashton, fay 3.30 four ambulances
 had already attended behind Leppings Lane and two
 ambulance officers regained assisting the iniured bv
 3.30 in the area of the yard there.        You are not talking
 about any other part of the ground and I will not bore
 you with the statistics in relation to that. S f c o n d l v ,
 you are reported to have said "I had to assume control
 of— the-©asua-l-ty-. situation myself; and carry out a triage” .
 Did you say that?        A. Yes, I said that.

As.a matter of fact, ambulancemen were there at.3.13,
15.12 and 15.20 and each of them carried.out triacre-
before the casualties were conveyed b y then* t o -hospital.
Do you accept that?    A. Well, that v/as not what I found
at 3.30 when I went cut there.

Very well.      You also are quoted as.saying that     »1 1
casualty team with resuscitation equipment- did not*-arrive
frcra the 'hospital until about 4.15? A. Tha t 's correct.

Where were ycu talking about?       A. In the back of Lepnincrs
Lane.  All cf the ce m e n t s that I made during that oerioc
were specifically about behind Leppings Lane, but Hlknow
from the submissions -that I have received and which’I have
forwarded to the Inquiry from various other medical anc
nursing personnel that much the same situation*--seem s *to
have applied ir. ctr.sr rlaces.    I have suggested 'that' they
be called but I her. 'r kr.cw whether they are being called.

■-'hat evidence is cailet is r.ct a natter for r.e, Dr. Ash ter.
and I hare :av that t : s e v/ho are concerned with it will
take r.cts c: your ccr.r.er.ts. You are also reported as
saying "No oxycen, airway tubes or dries". Obviously
you have said that, because you have said it again today?
A. That's ricrht.

     Q. I suggest to you and I put it to you that oxygen and
        airway tubes were there with the ambulance and we have
        heard evidence about that.   You did not see it?
        A.   No.

     Q. "More lives could have been saved if staff and equipment
        had arrived earlier", did you say that?   A.   It is my

They cic not keep to the pavements, they climbed over the
walls and get in the shortest cut possible? - A. Yes.

When they cane into the shop, where did they go to first of
ail? - a". Straight to the drinks.

And you said that some were putting it into their pockets
or into their coats? - :A. Yes.

How cid they respond to the reasonable requests of the citizens
around? - A. Foul language and then I said tc the lady, they
were very flustered, they did not know what to do, so I
said:  ’’Just 'phene the Police because there is plenty in
the area. A couple would he here in a couple of seconds", sc
then they started acted like children and saving:   "Oh telephone
the Police, 'phene the Police" and just giving abuse out.

The crowds that you have described sitting around Halfords
and that area, tr.e Gateway Supermarket area, were they
Liverpool supporters, were you able'to tell? - A. I cic
net notice. There was ;ust such a mass.      I was just so
 ho Cited, at the amount or people lying around drinking.

You came cut and saw-'   thi..I^crowd at -the shop at about iO-to-3?
  A. Yes.

How far is that away from the ground, what s'ort of distance
is it in walking terms? - A. Well I would say perhaps ten
minutes.

When they came out did they make for the ground or did you
see where they went to? - A. No, I did not see.

      MR. WOODWARD:      Thank you.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Thank you very much, Mrs. Ellis.


             FREDERICK JAMES 5CCLEST0K Called
                                   F.J. SCCLESTON


      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I am sorry you have had to
come back, but I am sure you understand.

      MR. PHILLIPS: What is your full name plfease? -
A. Frederick James Sccieston.

I think you are a Senior Nurse Manager? - A. I am indeed.

And you live in the Wirral near Liverpool? - A. That is
right.

You went to the match, did you, with your son and another
young man? - A. That is right.

what tine did you get to the ground? - A. Approximately
approaching the Leppings Lane end 25-past-2.

What was the situation that you saw as you approached at
that tine? - A. We came from the river end, across the
bridge, having parked some two niles away from the ground.
The actual approach to where you get to the turnstiles
it was not too bad at that stage. I am aware of a bus
discharging some of its passengers, a coach. At that poin
I actually'spoke to a young man who works in the theatre
of the hospital that 2 work at so we were not crushed, we
had a cuist and pleasant conversation for a couple of
minutes.

Were ycu able tc get tc the perimeter gates of the ground?
- A. Yes quite easily, but once you got to the perimeter
gates, which were open, there was then a tremendous crush.
There is no doubt about that.




                     /Q. Were the people
                                                    P.J. ECCIESTON




 Were the people behind you still coming along? - A. There
 were people coming along the Lappings Lane and thera were
 people behind me across the bridge. There was no crush at
 that time.

Bow long did it take you to get to the turnstile? - A. It
took us a good ten minutes or more and that journey to the
turnstiles was probably the worst I've had.  I mean I go to
every Liverpool*gams, home and away, and we were a little
frightened to say the least, but there was humour in the
crowd.  For instance thsrs were three Police Officers on
horseback and one of the horses nudged my glasses and the
Polios Officer, we smiled at each other and he apologised
in fact, and there ware Police Officers at the side of the
rivsr on foot.

Did you see any in the crowd itself? - A. Yes. The
Police Officers on horseback were actually in the crowd but
there was no orderly forms of queues as thera normally is
ac football matches these days.

which turnstiles wsrs you going through? - A. Thers was
one cz four we wers aiming for. Thers wasn't one in
canicular.   We wers trying to get in one of those four.

Whicn set of turnstiles? Would you li‘<e to look at
the clan? - A. It is these four. v

■Those over there?    -       A. Yes.

Turnstiles A to G?        -   A. That is right.

Was it crushed the wncie of the time that you were going
            -                A. Frc.t the perimeter gates to the turnstiles
''thers'was a trsrr.er.icus crush,, yes, and that spilled out ■■
 towards the river.      The ether side o f .t&t-.bac that is shown
thers" . . .                    ■         V       ,:- ■/ .

Ths railings?'  - A. The railing, y#s. ':"Th« crowd
spilled - in fact at one stage we were that side of the .bar
and we had to negotiate cur way underneath that to, get in
direct line with the turnstiles.

Wers you not able to go back and wal.< round the end of the
railings? - A. No, that had become impossible.

Did you get through the turnstiles?           -   A. Yes.

Straight through?          - A. Yes. The last ten yards we were
catapulted.          My feet did not touch the ground and my son
and c o m p a n i o n were the same. We ended up in different
turnstiles and in fact I had my son’s ticket and he
actually had to leap over the turnstile it was that bad,
                                            ?,J. ECCLESTON



 and I then handed his ticket with mine.
 Yes. - A. I had never come across that before. That             last
 ten yards, as I say my feet ....

 The turnstile worked efficiently did it?        -   A. Yes it
 did.

You then find yourself in the yard behind the turnstile? -
A. Thats right.  As soon as we came through the turnstile
my son actually was remonstrating with a steward and the
Police Officer and the steward told him to shut up because
other fans had done the same thing and had been forcibly
ejected, so we obviously took notice of that.

where was this Police Officer and steward? Can you again
loo*? - A. immediately behind the turnstile, within two
or three yards.

Can you say what -he time was at this point? - A.
Approximately just, before twenty to three I should think.

Did you know where you were going to go? - A. Yes because
I had been to the previous year's game, and it was a
totally different approach this time.  The year before I
arrived at tan co three because oc transport problems.

I will come to that later if I may, bat can you tell us
where you had stood or sat on the previous yeac? - A.
Yes.   When we came to the turnstiles the previous year
thera was a line cf Police Officers and stewards that
stepped us going through the .tunnel. They quite gently but
forcefully said/ "Look, this is full, you've got to go to
the. left or the right" and the;previous year I had my
daughter 'wizh me, we vant to the right, and then it was
still crushed because we w*ra under the scoreboard and I
saw tr.e previous year to the.left of the blue boards ....

would :yo u like again' to lo6k:'ac .the plah 'there.' •? "A. :t*ve
actually-got the 'picture".of the ground whie.^1 *v»

It may help us if you turn round and see there. .Can you
see.  If you show us where you went to once you got inside
this year.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       We are talking about this year
now are we?

      MR. PHILLIPS:      Yes.   -   A. We went straight to the
toilet in fact.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       That is just to the left of the
tunnel, we knew that.
                                                      F.J. SCCLSSTQW



      Q.         MR. PHILLIPS:    Then after that where did you go to?
            -   A. As we came out of the toilet my son said, "Look at
            this” and one of the gates was being opened and so I said
            to them, "Right, follow   me* and we turned to the right.

      g... Turned to,.the right. -   A. It went past the open tunnel.
           In fact I have a unique recollection of looking down that
           tunnel and seeing daylight as we ran past, because I knew
           from my previous year's experience to go to the left which
           was a better vantage point and a safer vantage point.

      Q.    Look at where the pointer's going. Did you go        up thera
            then to the right? - A. No we went the other          way.

  Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Through the gap in the wall?            -
           A. Through the gap in the wall.

  Q. And round to the north side.            -   A. That is correct, and up
     the stairs.

  Q.              MR. PHILLIPS:    Ana you went into that corner pen did
           you?     - A. No we were high   up on the left hand side.

 n.         High up on the terracing there?      -   A. Dc you mind if I ...

 Q.             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       You go and show us.    -    A.
           Exactly there.

                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes I see.

 O'.              MR. PHILLIPS:   Thank you very much.    Are you saying
           che previous year you had been in fact on the opposite side
           o f 'the ground?  - A. Me. We had first tried to go on the
           opposite side cf the ground' buc it was very crushed so I
           r,td':looked up to that ocher side and I ’d ta.<en my daughter
           cut cf che orusn and gone round the way we went this year.

'ft        So what, was the situation like in that 'part of the ..
           terracing, where you were?  - A. Reasonably comfortable.
           There were plenty of fans- in there, more than the previous
           year but it was comfortable standing there, and what amazed
           me at quarter to three was that th-e tar side, and that is
           under the scoreboard and the right hand pen were half
           empty.

Q. Yes.              A. I was astounded to see that this year.

Q. Were you able from where you were to see the centre pens 3
   and 4? - A. Yes, very easily.

Q. What did you oee there?             -   A. Absolute jam packed at
   auarter to three.
                                         f.j   : - ecclestoh



, Did you keep an eye on that or were you lookingoat to the
  field as well? - A. I was looking out to thefield as
  well.

 Do you remember the teams coming out on to the field?         -
 A. Very distinctly.

 And did you take any particular notice of the terraces when
 that happened? - A. No, not particularly. I didn't taka
 much notice that I'd done when I first took my place. That
 was what really astounded me.

 Do you remember    the kick-off?   -    A.    Yes.

 Anc the game starting?    -   A. Yes.

 During that time again I suppose you were watching the
 field ware you? - A. Yes, undoubtedly.

And you remember the uhot which hit the goal post?   - A.
Yes, it is the only thing I shall neverforget. I   am
eternally grateful that Liverpool never scored because I
think ....

Did you notice any effect?      -   A. Yes..

Tell us about that please?   - A. Whenever a side attacks
like that, whether it is this game or any game, the crowd
surge forward and they did on this occasion.

Which crowd are you talking about now? - A. I'm talking
about the Liverpool crowd behind the goal.

In 3 and 4?   -    A. In 3 and 4 yes.

 Did ycu notice anything particular about that, what was
 happening thera?    - A . I then noticed that people were
.beginning ts be 'passed down across the,'heads. So» fehfV is
■|r.sign" that thera is 'problems. ■

Did you.see anything else in those'pens? - A. 'Yes. This
coincided with the teams going off. The front o i the pens
were flat. Now when you're at a football match you're
looking down on a crowd. The heads bob all the time.
There is movement.   On this occasion I noticed they were
flat and I knew something was wrong.




              /Q. You recall seeing the Police Officer
                                                           F,J.    ECCLESTCN


You recall seeing the Police Officer run on to the pitch then
to stop the game. do you? - A. X do. indeed.

And from then on aid you pay particular attention to these two
terraces? - A. Yes, you could not help but not to because the
fans were trying to get over the fence. Soae of then were
being pushed back. Some managed to get over. One fan was
arrested and was pleading not to put him back. You could tell
he was pleading for something.

Did you see Police Officers on the perimeter track? - A. Yes.
we did.

Did you see the gates open for pens 3 and 4? -a . There was
one." One gate was being opened.  It was at that time that I
turned to my son ana said, "Look, they're in trouble down
there.  I am going down because they need help".

Can you say which gate it was that was open? -A. I think it
was the one behind the goal, immediately behind the goal.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          Pen 3 or A? - A. I don't which
pen.

          MR. PHILLIPS:   I think that would be        a   . in fact:

So when did you first realise. by reference to what was going
on on the field, wr.en tie you first realise there was
something caaiy wrcr.g? -a . a s the teams went off.

as the teams went cff? - a. as the teams went off. The Police
Officer ran on to get the referee      to stop it, and youreyes
then moved as tc wny tr.is was happening, ana you concentrates
on the area oeninc the goal.     That is the thing I can reaemoer
to this dav is tnis flatness of the immediate crowd in front
cf the t a m e r tr.at iec.tc the pitch/' -

So vcu I thir.K tr.en went dawn, to the; pitch, did you not? - a .
That is ri'gnt. I *new.■•.siy. w«ry from .last:ytar;s. 'experience.- anc
I got a stewart t f f , t a i s * a n d wfte did nor hlsitat* at-ill.  I
said. "Look, you            trfcufclCwt ther#:.        a    trained
nurse",.-ana he tcoK me tne quickest/way under the stand, anc a
Police Officer let me--on tne pitch.                              1

And you went to the area benina the goal in the first place? -
A. That is correct.

And Police Officers, what were they doing at that time when
you went down? - A. Some seemed to be standing around, but
some were working like beavers atthe gate.  The one I
remember. I am on video with him.   that is the Police
Officer without any hair, and we were literally pulling
people by any part of their body we could grab hold o f .
their arms, their legs.  They seemed to be spilling down
in a cascade towards that gateway, and there were three
Police Officers ana I was just behind them helping them
     --           -              -e■;             rhar r    a     OUt t hey
        were just shocked. They could hardly breathe.

Q. Were you helping them on to the pitch after they had cone out
- A. That is right, immediately on to the pitch behind the net.

0. The first people who came out. were they badly injured? - A.
   No.

Q . You then went back.I think. and helped some more people? - A
    By the time you got the top of the pile out you then began to
    get the really injured people out who were unconscious.

q   .        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Could you help me. because the
        video does not shew this very closely. The people you were
        getting out first who you say were shocked but not badly
        injured, were they coming from behind where the people you
        eventually got out were, or were they clambering over people
        who were in a worse condition, or were they themselves right
        at the front, do you know? - a . They seemed to be just
        literally tumbling ever the people who were at the front.

G. They were really coming' front behind those who had been right
   at the front? - a . Yes.- I think so.

      I think you took a young man out who seemed to have some chest
      injuries? Is that rignt? - a. That is right.      I worked on
      him.   I can't recall hew long for anv of the people I actually
      wortcec. but he came round quite reasonaoly easily and quite
      well, and it was covicus he hac chest injuries.     I shcuteo t:
      him wner. he triec to struggle up, I said, "Lie down ana I ’ll
      fine a stretcner".. I then asked some Policemen around me wno
    . seemec rather cased. .1 noticed the only stretcher I couid see
      was by the penalty spot, and how I saw it was that it was a
      wire mesh one and tne wire stuck out, so I ran to the penalty
      spcz anc grabbed it.    On the way back I literally ordered
      tr.ree Police Officers to help me carry this fan away.    Thev
      ;-jst        crevec ?.e. ar.c we half ran across the pitch.

    , At: tr.is .time was anybocy taking control of what was happening
    ■""behind, the goal? - VA. I ::,a»:
                                      ■afraid not. M4ny individual-JPolice
      Officers., usea tneir initiative, ana they were-magnificent,
      l e t ’s have no coucts aoout that.     Some were in the pens and
      pulling people up.     There was even one trying to bend the
      grills back witr. his own bare hands-, ana there were others
      that were beginning to treat the injurea at the'said, but
      there were otr.ers who were just standing there.       There seemec
      tc be no overall control.        I would have expected some sort of
      clearing station to be set up arouna the goal area, people
      using their initiative from a managerial point of view.

. You did go I think with the stretcher you mentioned over to
  the St. John's Amb u l a n c e room, did you not? - A. In front of
  the gymnasium b e m n d the stand.

     What scene did you meet when you got there? - A. It was not
     too baa at that stage because a lot of people had not arrived.
                                                     ZJL gmggTOW
 Ambulance and then turned and ran back because I knew there
 were so many injured ccaing out to five some aore help. So I
 ran across the pitch.

 You then took part, I think, in the resuscitation of people
 who had been brought out of the pens? - A. That is right.

 And others were helping.,,, cf course, to do that, were they not?
 - A. Yes.  I cane across a surgeon. I tried to take over from
 him. so I actually tapped hia on the head and apologised.
 Then I moved on tc the next person. There were Police
 Officers giving mouth to mouth. There were St. John’s
 Ambulance peopie.   One of the people I worked on - it was a
 ludicrous situation. because I had to do mouth to mouth and
 chest massage on the same person, which you just cannot do,
 and then he started tc vomit.

Was there any _equipatent available at.. thax^siae2..-. A-
Absolutely 'nothin g '1 “turned~to the St. J o h n ’s Ambulance man
working alongside me and I said. "For G o d ’s sake, have you got
any swabs to clear this m a n ’s mouth?", and all he could hand
me was a dry sponge.

Can you say what time'this was, approximately? - A. Yes, it
must have been quarter-past, 20--past-3.

 were you conscious of amoulance and Firemen arriving at any
 stage? - a. An amoulance arrived, in my statement I thought it
 was naif-past-3. In fact from suosequent knowledge it was
 about quarter-past. but it was only a St. J o h n ’s Ambulance one
 whicn is not well equipped at ail. The Fire Brigade, I was
 becoming conscious tney were arouna. The fans at this time,
 they were magnificent.     They had used their initiative.   A lot
 of your.g men had decided - the aggression had gone from them -
 anc tr.ey wan tea tc help.   They'took the hoardings, they
■barriec ceccie. the-/ were doing mouth to mouth as they thought
■they'' ccuic     anc -r. all this chaos they, were trying so r.arc.

4J'££«..,you •get':.anysequipaent-,fro*. the ambulance or the Fire
 people? - a . '"No. : beiiev* there:.was ah e*y««n cylinder
af'ounc,'''',;but x cic not see anything' o f tfctt .at'all.

I think you then went, .aid not you, to .the. gymnasium where
peopie were, ceing taken? - A. That-is right.

were you working in the gymnasium? When aid you start working
in m e r e ? - A. It must have been well after half-past-3.   When
I got around the back by tne gymnasium it was again chaotic.
There were peopie lying dead on the floor. There were the
injurea by the St. John's Ambulance room door.     There were
Police Officers trying to keep control.     There was only a
smail doorway to the gymnasium that was being used, and the
deaa ana the living were trying to get through at the same
time as some stage.

were there any meaical staff working there in the gymnasium? -
                                       .               «K A /ions1v   nn

 the left outside the gymnasium, and when we got in the
 gymnasium it had been divided into two. I realised afterwards
 half was to receive the dead and half to receive the injured.
 On the injured side there appeared. I was aware there were
 three doctors eventually, and they were treating around about
 a dozen injured peopie. One of the doctors turned to me and
 said, "For God's sake, have we got any drugs?". There was no
 equipment whatsoever even in the gymnasium at that stage. ""

 Did you try to get some drugs? - A. Yes, I then ran out of the
 gymnasium and contacted some senior Police Officers who were
 in that no man’s land area outside, and they immediately
 must have gone and they did find something for us within
 five minutes. It was just three small boxes cf equipment.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Do you know where they came from?
- A. No. I d o n ’t, I am afraid.    There was no Health Authority
sign on it.

      MR. PHILLIPS:      Had you tried to get any from the St.
John's Ambulance room? - A. Yes. When the doctor asked for
drugs I went to the St. John’s Ambulance and they said. "I'm
s orry. we c o n ’t carry that sort of equipment. We are not
allowed to have any drugs of any sort” .

What cic you cc after you got back to the gymnasium? - A. I
then helped the doctors set up 10 intravenous lines.

where cic you get tne equipment from? - A. They were in the
boxes.

In the ccxes ycu hac received from the Police Officers? - A.
In tne coxes we naa received.       There were some forceps, some
scissors. some swaos. some spiirits and there was enough
equipment to set up 10 intravenous lines.       Then I went rcund
wit.n eacr. c;ct:r helping tries set up the lines.    We then co-
?ptec             ■=cli:s Officers to actually noid the bottles
;r tne pacKS up oecause       had-, no stands of any sort.

■How' long; were you in-there doing'this s©rt;.:#£■'"thing?' ~ A .
until aoout ;half-past’*-, and by 'then ;the:.|niur#d'-.:%faat w«jr*:
there nac actually -been, removed.   I was aware, .my '.-attention'
was era wn to the other..part of the gymnasium.'        I 'was shocked.
1 actually, not consciously, wancereo into- that area, and I
foune 1 recognised a young girl who we had been working on at
tne sice of the pitcn. and stayed with her husband who was
absolutely mortified, as you can imagine.       I could give some
consolation. I suppose, because she was the girl that the
surgeon was working o n . so at least she had had some good
attention from an individual point of view.

Can you cast your mind back now. if you will, to the
previous year and this year, and tell us some of the
differences you noticed between the two events, because you
went to both events.   You say you came later on the
previous year? - a . That is right.

 Was the journey to the turnstiles along Leppings Lane any
 different on the previous year? - A. Yes, the previous year,
 ay daughter and I had not been allowed to get to the
 turnstiles without the Police made sure we had a ticket.

 From which direction had you cone? - A. We had cone from the
 other direction the previous year, from down the Leppings
 Lafte....

 From the roundabout? - A. From the roundabout, that is right,
 because we came by ccach the previous year.

How did this happen that youwere checked for tickets on the
previous year? - A. The previous year there seemed to be a lo
more Police Officers around, and there was not the same crush
let us be quite honest and fair about this, there was nowhere
near the same crusn at iO-to-3 when I arrived the previous
year.
Were there simply groups or lines of Police Officers, or were
there metal barriers or- what? - a . There were lines of Police
Officers the previous year.

Across the, pavement or the whole road? - A. You had to go
down.   They channel lac you off, so you had to go past them,
anc ’’Have you get a ticket?", was requested of you before you
actually got anywnere near tne turnstiles.

Die you nave tb s n o w your ticket? - A. Yes, I had it in ray
nanc.

Had you seen anytning like that; ail in 1985, this year? - a.
NO .

       LCP.2 JUST I-1 TAYLOR:      Mr. Eccleston, about how far u?
      ~C 3 C frost tins ^ntirsnos, zrein ths DsriHtisiisr jfSwSJS. aocu'-

i9 6 S? * a. 1 think it was round about the perimeter gates.

Near tne gate?     Not'further up the road?’- A . ffpt■far -away
no.

     MR. PHILLIPS:          Had .you had a reasonable journey to
Sheffield on both occasions? - A. Both occasions, for some
reason cr another, the M62 had road-works. They were
opened just a week or ten days before either game.          This
tiae we had a c t u a l l y avoided them by going through the
country area and Glossop.          That is the reason why we were
late on both occasions, in fact, because we like to be at
the ground a good hour before.

So although you arrived at 25-past-2. that was later than you
had hoped? - A. Yes. most definitely.

You nave already told us in 1988 when you went through the
turnstiles you were pointed away from the tunnel? - A. Yes,
                                                                         F.     J.     ECCLESTON


                                 Cross-examined by MR. HVTNER:
,        M r.Ecclestori, before you even think about people, the
         situation at the L e p p i n ® Lane turnstiles is of a funnel,
         is it not?    A.   Yes.
, Which funnels people who both come down Leppings Lane and,
  of cours e* over the bridge from the other side?  A. Yes.
        It is a bottleneck?                   A.       Precisely.
        By the time you got into the area between the railings
        and the turnstiles, there was no way that anybody could
        form an orderly queue because there were too many people
        already in the area.   A.   That is correct.
        So t h a t if y o u w e r e l o o k i n g for o r d e r l y q u e u e s , you

               Q.         MR. HYTNER:   There could not be any doubt at all,
                     could there, that as you reached the railings, which would
                     be 2.25 - is that fair?   A. Yes.
         Q. No doubt whatever that there was a dangerous situation
            developing?   A.   Of all the matches I have been to this
     it]    season, that was the worst situation I had come to - tried
            to get to a turnstile.
             Q. That is not quite an answer to the question because, of
                course, it may be tne worst situation but it may not have
                been dangerous.    What I am asking you is, was it not as
                plain as a pikestaff to anyone looking that seeing this
                crusn within the   area and then seeing the hordes coming
                towards the area   down Leppings Lane, that a dangerous
                situation was clearly developing?    A.    If there were
                a lot more spectators to join that crush then, yes, I
                would totally agree with you because it was bad enough
                just in that little area from the perimeter gate to the
                turnstile.   To add to that with hordes of people would
                be — well, it would be- terrible.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:                  Going off?            A.       Going off,

           MR. HYTNER:       I am asking you about a little earlier
 than that when the first people began to climb the fences.
 It was fairly obvious when they were climbing the fences
 and getting over the fences that they were not up to
 mischief-, they were t r y i n g , t o get out of some difficulty.
 A.     They were indeed.         I can appreciate, though, that
 n n |e s s  yo u — t h e r e could be hesitancy “in un de r sFffrrtfrng
 that from .the' point of view, of authority.           That I have
 got to, you k n o w --                You could question,                  "Why were they
 coming over" first ---

 Mr. E c c l e s t o n , I t h i n k e v e r y o n e is g o i n g to be f a i r a b o u t

At any time from the time that you started watching the
pere behind the goalmouth to the time that you decided
to leave your position and go down to the pitch to assist,
did you see any bodies, wnether unconscious or conscious,
horizontal or being carried, being passed up the terraces
through the tunnel?    A.   No, the few that were being
moved that way were going down towards the front.
                                                 23
                                                              F.J. SCCIESTON


  Q. Froo your vantage point, Mr. Eccleston, is there any way
     that anyone who was injured or passing out could have made
     their way up against the crush of the people that you have
     described in the pens behind the goal? - A. No way at all.

  Q. Equally when you got on to the pitch and you went behind
     the goal nets to assist in pulling people out fron behind
     the fence and the gate which was now open, could you have
     seen if any bodies were being' passed up the terrace,again,
     to go out through the tunnel and out the other side? - A.
     To be fair I could not because I was concentrating on the
     gate and the people that were cascading down on to that
     gate.

 Q. You have described the people that were costing out first,
    using your word "cascading" over the bodies that were in
    front.* Do you think it is likely that anybody coulc have
    been taken from the front of that pen, up through that
    crowd ana out through the tunnel? - A. There was no chance
    at all.

                         MR. KALLIP-TIS:   Thank you very much.

 Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Well you say that. You are
        talking, as I understand it, about the stage when you anc
        ethers,* Police Officers were frantically getting people
        out.

             As I understand it fron the evidence there was a
       gradual thinning out from the pens of people v/ho were able
       to leave. Is that right? Some being hauled up on to the
     . seating area anc so on? - A. When I actually started to
       work with the Police Officers I was only conscious of people
       immediately around that gate and then they were being
       pulled out by.me and others and then I was beginning to
      work cn then at the sice of the pitch. After that I am
      not conscious cf. -<r.a: v/as going cn ir. the pens.

§ k r - 1 i h s t t 'I
                  «as.-: really asking i s ' this: are. you 'able to say one

     ;':'ia' e::treais,.'-w«s brought :but only in the" pitch dirfctioa
         or ffJiy some have been taken--'"out another''wav? * A* So. .
         ohvicus.ly._fres w h a t .I gleaned afterwards I realised _that
         some had~gone back cut of the tunnel.

Q. Some of the injured and dead? - A. Some of the injured and
   ce.ad_.had.-Sg.ne.back out of the tunnel, sir, yes.

            MR. KALLIPSTIS: Sir, perhaps it is my fault for
      not making it clear.  I wanted to establish a particular poin
      ana it is up till about 20-past-3.

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Up to about 20-past-3, though,
      you were not aware of anybody going out that way? - A.
      That is correct, sir, yes.

                    Cross"Examined bv HR. WOODWARD:

 Q. Mr. Eccleston, may I ask you about 1988 please, in 1938
    you arrived at the ground at somewhat later than this
    year? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

 Q. And on that occasion you were able to make your way in
    considerable freedom along Leppings Lane? - A. Yes, that
    is*-.:txue.
 Q. There were hardly any people about, comparatively speaking?
    - A. well there was not any crush. It was a normal sort
    of football crowd going to a game on that occasion. Of
    course remember everybody was hurrying at iO-to-3. I was
    amongst the late comers on that day.
Q. And you became aware cf the Police near the gates, v/as it?
   - A. That is right, as far as I can remember.
Q. when those cates are opened obviously there are fence, gate,
   fence, gate,* one can see it on the pictures? - A. That is
   right, yes.
Q. You say you were askec-whether you had got a ticket? - A.
   That is right, yes.

Q.   Whereabouts was the Officer that asked you? - A. I think,
     as I say it is twelve months ago and I have been to a lot
     of football matches, cut I think it was the entrance to
     the perimeter gates. 'They consciously wanted to make sure
     we hac a ticket ana had a right tc be there to co through tc
     the turnstile.

Q. It,was somewhere by zhs perimeter gates? - A. Yes.

C. Mow..are you just conscious cf an Officer speaking to
   ycu at that point? - A. Yes..

■0. :tt' is not,.; you are not. suggesting there was a cordon of.
   C'llbi.icemen 'through which .every.-person had to. pass? - A. n o ,
               -not honestly sa

Q.;,'So: to be fair your recollection' is that 1938 when you'Cam#.'
    to the grounc you were asked by the Police Officer whether
    you had"got:a ticket? - A. That is right, yes.

C.LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          Can you help me as to what
    you meant by "lines of Police Officers channelling you
   off"? - A. As far as I can recall we were made to go in
   as a queue.

Q. What, before the perimeter gates or after? - A. Well I
   am conscious it v/as round about the perimeter gates.
   We were channelled into the turnstiles, whereas this
   year it was just a milling crowd. As I say I go to so
   nany football matches.

q   .         HR. WOODWARD: It Is difficult, isn't it. There is
        the experience; then there is the things you read and the
        film you see and the trauma through which you have been?
        - A. Yes. My daughter remembers this as well. She was
        very conscious that we were not allowed to approach withou
        making sure we had our tickets in our hands.

Q. Doing the best you can what you are saying is concerning
   1983 is that by the gate you were asked whether you had
   got a ticket? - A. That is correct.
Q. And you are not suggesting there was a line of Officers
   doing that to everybody? - A. so, but I think that every­
   body-that approached. I cannot say there v/as a complete
   line, you had to walk down a line of Officers, no.
Q. I suggest there was nothing formal like a c o r d o n set up
   there? - A. No.

Q. You would agree with that? - A. Yes.

Q. And then you say you made your way to the turnstile but
   you get into queues? - A. That is right, although at
    10-to-3 there v/as really no queue the previous year.

Q. You are not suggesting there were lines of Policemen from
   the perimeter cates between which people walked? - A. >*c.

Q. There were Police about .... A. Yes, but making sure
   we were coinc in ir. order towards the turnstiles.

Q. They were directing you to ....   A. Each individual turn­
   stile.  You had to go to one turnstile.

    Where was the Policeman that directed you,, was he by the
    turnstiles? - A. :;c, the previous year it was around the
    perimeter gates '..‘hers I was first directed towards.

 . So is., this the picture that, you have or the recollection
  'chat.-ybu have.-;- of a Policeman ...saying to-you: "Got your
   ticket?";- you.-showed him th§ ticket, and he then -^pointed- -
   you"-off to a particular place to go?: - A. Weil it wa s 'so
   obvious where the turnstiles were and there was not a
   crush then.

. Well that is     right, you see, this is the probitm. You
  did nor need     to be directed into queues at that time?
  - A. Mo, but     they had taken the trouble to provide
  the service,     if you like, to make sure you had a ticket
  and you were     going to the right place.

. You did not need to be directed into queues.     You could
  see where to co and there were Policemen about who, is
  this what you would have us understand, that those Police­
  men would direct you, and did direct you, because the
  turnstiles at that stage were obviously slowing people
       ..u_ usnt-Bri t0 get into the ground, and if there v/as

                  a knot of three or four at one you would jbe directed to
                  another turnstile? - A. Yes.
               Q. Ana is that the picture? - A. Yes.

              Q. Can I cone to when you cot into the ground in 1988. You
                 have a recollection of there being people at the access cr
          B      entrance to the tunnel area? - A. That is correct, yes.

              Q. Now those people included stewards? - A. Yes.

              Q. Can you say how   many? - A. No, I can't, but it was certainly
                 enough to make    sure you must not go down that tunnel,
                 because at that   stage I did not know Hillsborough at all
                 and that is the   place I would have gone.

              Q. That would be at what tine in 1958? - A. That is approximate 1
                 lC-minutes-to-3.

              Q. So there were people at the entrance to the tunnel. Were
                 they in a line or a croup? - A. A line or a group.  I cannot
                 really remember exactly.
     D
              Q. You would identify the., stewards by their tabards? - A. That
                 is right, yellow.

              C. You say there wers Policemen as well? - A. I am certain of
                 that, yes, there was a mixed croup.

                Now it may be difficult to recall, but are you sayinc that
    E:          there were more Policemen there than Stewards or really
                more Stewards than Policemen or what? - A. It is very much
                of,a recollection.  : think there were perhaps more Stewards,
                I think. That I would not like to be entirely certain
                a^put.

          .
          • "it-.", is.. very c i m c u - t cut vp.at you are saying is your
         \ ;:JSpre$.sion is cf tr.ere being more Stewards- and perhaps.one
    Fi -          '.t;/o 'Policemen- with them. -‘’IS' that the picture?;- A. Yes,
          : -I. think so.'

          , 2 • And it was Stewards really who were"stopping you going in?
                - A.' Yes, combined.
      i
 i            Q. They had the authority of a Policeman there but it was      the
„j               Stewards who were stopping you going in? - A. Yes.
j    if
           Q. That is your best recollection? - A. That is indeed, yes.

           Q. Nov/ may I ask you about 1989. The approach that you hac
              v/as over the bridge? - A. That is right.

           Q. You came from the south side and the approach over the
              bridge was a perfectly normal approach? - A. Yes.
H
           Q. in terms of crowd and volume? - A. Yes.

                                               F.J. ECCLESTON


    Q. Did you encounter any people asking for tickets? - A. No,
       I did not at all.

 Q. Is it your recollection not a single person asked you for
    a ticket? - A. X don't think they did no, but to be fair
    I know people turned up without tickets. I know that.

 Q. How do you know that?, - A. Because that is .... Liverpool
    are the most successful club in Europe and every away natch,
    whether it is an F.A. Cup or the League you have to have
    tickets. The only place you get tickets from are actually
    in Liverpool and a lot ofpeople turn up in the hope they
    will get spare tickets and also a lot of away games they
    actually open turnstiles when they have not sold enough”
    tickets, so there may have been a thought, you know, "if
    there is room in the ground I might be able to get in and
    pay cash".

q   . But quite a lot of publicity was given before the match,
      was it not, in the Anfield Review and in the local media?
      - A. Yes.

Q. "Not to come if you have not got tickets"? - A. But it still
    does not follow. I have been to grounds this season that
    they have still opened turnstiles.

Q.          LOUD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        For people to pay over the
      counter? - A. Yes.
2. Have you ever been to a match where they have opened the
   gates*and let people in without tickets or anything? - A.
   No never sir, no.

q   . So as far as you know there is no reason for non-ticket
      holders tc cc to a natch in the expectation cr hope that
      zhs cares might just be thrown open? - A. lie, no# they
     '.would 'expect rc pay if they could not get a. spare ticket,
     M; am absolutely certain cf that.

S."5""' V MR.-             These ’non- ticket, holders;- if 'they
  . can't get "a ticket, they have invested'' in.-thlv-'-jo&rjiey,
  /;,they will co their darnedest to get in? -' K l .That" is a
    fair comment but I have not witnessed any other method
    bar fair means of trying tc get in., put it that way.

Q. But coming along over the bridge you saw the crowd at the
   Leppings Lane entrance anc you noticed a considerable amount
   of*peopie coming along from Leppings Lane travelling in
   the opposite direction? - A. Yes, there v/as far more from
   that side than there was from the side I had come from.

Q. Did you see any people carrying drink? Did you see a single
   can of beer? - A. Yes, I am sure I did. Unfortunately it
   is something you get used to going to football matches.
   It is not something I condone but yes, I am afraid there
   must have been and I am sure there v/ere, and of course
                                              1^3.   Z C C L T S jn H



 they have the cans until the very last absent before going
 into the ground and then they leave them outside the ground
 on the floor cr anywhere•

 They drink it? - A. They drink it or justdon't finish it
 and drop it on the ground I am afraid.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: If it is any help to you, those
of us that went to the ground the day afterwards sax** beer
cans on the ground, on the ground side of theturnstiles.

       MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you sir.

When you came to the crowd outside the gate v/as it, as you
have been asked by Hr. Kytr.er, quite obvious to you there
v/as a great crush inside? - A. Inside the ground?

Insics the gate? - A. Oh insice the gates, yes, I was
surprised. I knew I had tc join in but I was not anticipati
the enjoyment cf having to join that throng.

So you could see it as Z suppose could everybody else that
was approaching it? - A. Oh yes, there was no doubt about
that.

Well did anybody hole back? - A. Well at 25-past-2, half -
past.-2 it v/as still quite a jovial crowd. You could \/ith
seme reasonable assumption think you could get intc the
ground a.z chat stage with your ticket.

         q.   And get in through that crowd with reasonable safety and
              with reasonable convenience? - A. That is right.

         G. Given that it's a football match.        -    A. Yes.

j»l o. So it would be wrong to have the impression from your
       evidence that at the -trims that yo?r came to 4 W sai#*- ymi.-. •
       shouldn't have joined the crowd? - A. Well, I mean I had
       a tic<et and I wanted to get in the game -so I would join
       that crowd because I .cnew that was the only way to get in.

              Hut you «ee it has oeen out to you it was plain as a

              This was pressure from behind?              -   A. It must have been
              pressure from behind, yes.

                   MR. WOODWARD:               I'a not sure, sir, how full one's bath
              is at the end:
    B
              There was a lot oc ptoole came- in-behind you?               -   a.   Yes.,
              Oh undoubtedly must have done.

              And you had not bean expecting that. - A. No.    I have
              never experienced being actually catapulted through the ten
              yards.

             Did you sas people barging into the crowd, getting in the
             side, thrusting themselves in? - A. I wasn't awara of
             people barging in.     It was very much a jostling crowd.
             There was no torn of order at all, some people getting
             auite irate, but there was still, as I pointed out in my
             own experience, there was still a little bit of humour
             around at that sta 3 a .

             Did you see Police'ten. about? - A. There were three
             mounted Officers -who actually we knew by face because they
             are from Liverpool and experienced in handling ac
             L i v e r o o d . There were also some Officers on foot too at
             che cide ov the river.

             They     were making valiant efforts were they?           -   A. Yet.
E;            To control the crowd?     - A. Because if it became worse
             ■ tr.e rivet "must have been a danger I presume, I don't know.

             So having got to the crowd a t two t h i r t y , you g o t through

             was some chanting behind us in the Lappings Lane end, but
             you concentrated on your efforts to get through those

 Q. If there was a message at that time it didn't appear to
    have any effect? -    A. iio Iwas concentrating too much.

 Q. You went into the ground and decided to take up the
    position, and took up the position which you aimed for?            -
    A. That is right, which is the same as last year.
 Q. Thac would be about two forty five would it?         -   A. Yes.
 Q. Are you sura aoout that?    -     A. I am ye-s.

 n. Now what you told the Inquiry is that at two forty five the
    state of the nans 3 and 4 was jammed packed.  - A. Yes.

Q.   N'o room for anybody in there.         A. I wouldn't have
     tnought so.

     And you had a good view of it did you?      -    A. Yas.

Q. Would you have a loo* please at the composite bundle of
   photographs, slou-u 2. .Tha first photographs in that bundle
   ara timed, and the corrected tima for the first one is two
   forty six.  Do you have the photograph in front of you?
   A. Y3s .

   Now chat shows gata 4, pan 4, a little to the left of it
  'one can 1 2 2 the fence dividing pen 4 from pan 3. Do vou
   535 the Scottish flag in the foreground?    - A. Yes I'do.

    And t-.en one can see into pan 3, down at the front there
    behind the goal.      Would you look at those pictures.   You
    see one can see room round the fence, one can .see
    supporters standing and turning and looking in different
    directions.      There would appear to be quits a lot of crea-
    dorr. down at the front there, certainly in that ares at that
  Tjtime, would you agree.      - A. Tnare is .-some space, yes, r
.•■.■'■wauls agree.'

3v- tz 'is not jam packed there is it?        A. .It would'appear
    not.'

0. And anybody looking at tht night have the impression that
   there was room to ccme into the terrace.  - A. If you were
   standing in front of it as the photographer was, yes.

Q. Of course it depends on your viewpoint.        -    A. That is
   right.

Q. And it depends what you are looking at, but looking at the
   first, the second and the third photographs in that bundle
   showing that area - it doesn’t show the whole area, but it
   shows the area down by the corner of the goal oetween pens
   4 and 3 and that foreground, so the photographs are

     Q.    Wall you sae*n to have some reservations. What are they? «
           A. To get to there you couldn’t get from the behind to*
           there. It is wall packed behind.    I would never attempt to
           get anybody else into that situation just because there's a
           little bit of room at the front. It is well packed in my
 B         opinion,,.,,.

     Q. IE you look at the next photograph, DB1630, that is a view
        taken, you can see at the to? of the back there the
        entrance to the tunnel and then a further view along the
        front of those people facing the perimeter fence.   - A.
        Ana that is 31 is it?

           That? 231530.      -   A. 30 yes.

     Q. And then D31631, all taken at about the same time,                two
        forty six.  - A. There is enough people in there,                 bearing
        in mind that as soon ai the gate starts the crush,                people
        push to the front, foe people's comfort to last an                hour and
        a half.
D                LORD jjsrics TAYiCR:    Presumably, looking at 31, the
          man whose head you can't see, and whosa hands are cn the
          underside of the seating stands, is standing on the
          dividing fence at the sntrancs to the tunnel, or the exit

          tr.era air.

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  And the man to the left we can
          see cn ths other photograph as well must be sitting on
          some thine.

          cotr.e but   either ~ide of the tunnel, and one can. see those
          in 31 on     the right, either side. I thin', they remain a
          constant     feature cn most of the pictures.

G!          THE WITNESS:   From wh3t the previous gentleman said I
       would axpeot on 23 that a seaward would ancourage people to
       move into chat space.

           iX'R. WOODWARD:   Ye >:, you would expect stewards to be

      Q. So the impression on those photographs, that sort of
         situation that you sea on those photographs, is one which
         if it's going to be interfered with or directed by anybody,
         would be by saying to the people at the back, "Come down a
         bit, come forward." - A. Yes but more likely, the
B        easiest to communicate with ara the people in the front.
         If they fill the front in properly those automatically will
         come from the bacic. You won't get communications through
         to those at the back.

      Q. Sc the packing wculd be dona by saying to the people at the
         front, "Com® c n , pack up a bit closer, there's more room.”

     Q. "Let those at the back have more room”.         -     A. That is
        correct: yes.

     Q. And we know that snortly aftsr this the cry ran up "So
        back. Go oac k ” because tha situation changed. You, in
        your statement, describe surprise at. seeing the lack of
        occupation at the wings.   - A. Yes.
D
        Did you knew there ware gates at the back of the terrace,
        at the to? of the tar race, to give access to the wings?
        A. Yas. Weil I gleaned that information later, after the
        event.

        You didn't know then?       -   A. I didn’t know at the time, no.
E!
        According to your statement if one rsads it through, would
        it be right to say that on 0 2 you were in the ground and in
        your position you really observed no problems or difficulty
        until the gams had been in progress for .aoout five minutes?
        •v       Ths cam's stopped at *:x minutes past three. One
        car a.r.3 aware at approximately tour minutes oast three that

        was happening .... ■-"•'■ft. Thats correct.

        ....was not really upon the state of tha terraces until
        about five minutes, four minutes past three? - A. That
        is right yes.

        When people started to come over.       -   A. Yes.

       And you in fairness said that at that time the perception
       that this wasn't a pitch invasion might take some time to
       dawn on people.  - A. Oh yes.

     Q. And it would be understandable that some might construe it

          as that. - h . Yas, but having said that, why should I ba
          tha first, to dawn on me when ....

    Q. No reason at all. Tha evidence that you gave relates your
       attention to the problems in ths terrace to a surge and
B      something happening on the pitch. - A . That is right.

    Q. That was the time that the goal was nearly scored.             -   A.
          Y es   .



    q   , can I as* you now about the gates? Is it your impression
          that whilst thera were thasa crowds in the pans that tha
          real disastar, tha substantial problem, occurred raally
          around about and close to the gates? - A. Yes, but Shis
          is, if I may express a personal opinion ....

    n.   yes.   - A. Ithin* if there is a way tha crowd could have
         spread to the left and to the right - in other words, it is
         the side partitions that causa the trouble. They ma<e them
         into pens.  If you hasta got a fencing in front of you you
         can live with that, and I can understand thac, but I don't
D        understand why we have- to be penned in from the side
         oacause when tha crush   caiue you couldhave moved to the
         left or right.  That would-have saved life.

    2. It was your impression of where thers wera people trapped
       and caught as opposed to people baing squashed, if I can
       aia<s thatdistinction, down by the gates ---   - 4. That
       is r i gh t.

         .... there were people    who wera all entangledand then
         meshed.  - A. That is     correct, yes.

          And is really your impression this: that that enmeshing,
         .that antangling, tnat confusion, was in and around the area
         ?of the cates?

          - A. I think it was spread out all the way along, but then I
          would think the place people would try to go to is the sates.
          If they could find any room, it is the place we all try to go
          through a door, is it not, to get out? So. yes, there may
          have been more than there was in the outer parts away from
          the gates.

    q.
     „,   if i can put it this way, the concentration of disaster seemed
          to get greater-towards the gate? - a . I think that is correct.,
          yes.
<3. And the gates were so narrow? -       a   . That is correct, yes.

0. And there were steps up to them? - A. Yes, so I gather.

Q. The Police, you had paid tribute to many of the Officers. You
   described their conduct and quick thinking and presence cf
   mind as magnificent? - A. That is right, certain individuals,
   they.used their common sense and initiative.

0. Would it be right also to note that as with spectators and
   others there were people who were dumbstruck? - a . Yes.

G. They were perplexed and bewildered? - A. Yes.

G. Anc really did not know what tc do? - A. It was as though it
   haa r.ct come into their book of ruies. They reaily had never
   seen anything like this.

0.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Who are you talking about now? -
        A. : am talking aoout Police Officers.   I think, quite
        honestly, some did not know. They had not been orders about
        this sort of situation, whereas others they seemed to over­
        ride tneir orders ana use their caring humanity side to
        realise what was happening.

v.       ,    MR. WOOCWAEC:   Sc ths picture is not really one of
        Policemen just standing around wilfully not doing things, but
        many officers perplexea? - a . Yes.- I have made the statement.
        -Just lacked leadership in ay'person opinion. .

0. Lacked direction, something-to galvanise them and go? - a .
   Yes.   we. needed the old Sergeant with his stick walking up anc
   down to as you say galvanise people    into some sort of order.

q   .    when they got it there werethose who responded? - A.     Yes.
        Well, some responded without it.

q.      oh, yes.  But there was a time, was there not. when there were
        Police Officers along the perimeter fence trying to help
        people come over? - A. Some were.

Q. Which because of their presence just could not let any more
   Officers up. so numerous were they? -A. Yes.

0. And there were Officers who went inside to try and help? - A.
                                 37




 O. They entered into it? - A. Yes.

 0. Almost regardless of the risk to themselves? - A. Yes. that is
    a fair comment.

 0. Did you see any Officers come in from the back, from the
    tunnel? - A. No, I did not.

Q. Mould it be right, just as there may have been people looking
   from the front who did not appreciate what was happening,
   there were numbers in the terrace itself further back who
   plainly did not appreciate what was happening? - a . That is
   quite possible, but I think the crush was such everybody in
   those two pens knew. But that is a general observation.

Q. Did you see any response - whether it could have been
   responded to may be a matter to be looked at - did you see any
   response to those Officers' cries on the fence to get back,
   to get back? - a. No, I was too engrossed in whatI was trying
   to do with individuals to note that.

Q. Thank you.

                     Cross-Examined bv HR. GLASGOW:

q    _ Mr . Eccleston, could you just help us as to timing. When you
       came into the ground the first thing you did was to go to the
       toilet. I think? - A. That is correct.

0. Ana as you came out and turned round you could see the
   gate behind you just being opened? - A. That is right.
   My son remarked on this and he drew my attention to it.

0. And anticipating wnat would happen when that gate was opened,
   you aaae your wav quickly back towards it, in fact? - A. No.

     :-siell, just turn round to get this accurately. I know you did
      hot intend to go towards it but"you'would have had to go.... -
              is that.-gap'we case thropgh,",:'

<3.' So' you have had" to ;take a number'of steps 'towards the -gate?'-
 ■ .A. I suppose so.

0. Before going through the wall? -    a   ; Yes.

0.    But you were concentrating on making your way as quickly as
      you could to a place of safety in what we know as pens 5 and
      6? - A. Yes.

0. Did you see for yourself what did happen when the gates
   opened? - A. No, I did not.  I didn’t hang around.

G. You simply saw them being opened? - A. Yes.

0.    By the time you got round and up into the high area where you
      have indicated it was obvious to you that the people who were
                                                    E._I. SCCLgSTON


      cooing in through the gate as you turned the corner would have
      been in the ground by then? - A. Y e s . because they would go
      straight down the tunnel.

 Q.   It was just your help with this, Mr. Eccleston. When you
      first caae out on to the high terrace and got your bearings
      and looked down into pens 3 and 4 in the centre» the scene you
      saw there had already been joined by whoever had come down the
      tunnel from the opening gate? - A. Yes, I would, imagine so.

0. I wonder if we could look....

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   The first wave?

          MR. GLASGOW:    For the first time, my Lord:

Q. I didn’t want to criticise you at all, Mr. Eccleston. because
   you are doing admirably well, but I think I could fairly tell
   you we know probably as a certainty that the gate was
   actually opened at 2 .4 7 . If I were to xell you that I am
   sure you would accept therefore you must have in fact been
   making your way on to the terraces probably at 2.48 or 2.49?
   - a . Yes.
0. Ana that was not a criticism. Perhaps you could help us with
   the photographs. The bundle 2 you were looking at, could we
   look at the timing cf those. You have been perfectly properly
   and helpfully asKed about the scene tnat is shown in the
   first three photographs. Could we look at the second
   together, which we know was taken at 2.46. Just to help
   you. that is taken prooably very shortly before you are
   coming out of the toilet, because it is taken not less
   than 60 seconds before the gate is opened. - A. Right.

G.  And it would be fair to say, would it npt, despite the
   discing on.the wails at the back there is room at thefront
 ; quite evidently .for people to be turning round and freespace
   t! oov«? - a . Yes.

G. There is notning you couid properly call a crush against the
;'f"r leWcihg?.. - ;A. ■No.:' -

G. Ana indeed, these first three photographs, all taken at ,
   approximately the same time, if we go back to photograph No. i
   there is the young man with the Scottish flag with really
   quite a lot of space all round him by gate 4? - A. That is
   correct.
0. That is the situation at 2.46. Would you go on to the fourth
   photograph, just 4 minutes later. It is DB 17/14. Again, you
   can take it from me that is taken at IS.00. In other words,
   precisely 3 o'clock. It is right to say, is it not, that we
   there do see the solid density, the mass of people crushed
   together at the front, which is what you were describing as
   the solid, unmoving, with no bobbing heads? - A. That is
   correct.
                                             39

                                                                  l,J ,   ECCLESTQW


         q    . And the situation as you first saw it oust hav« been, although
                from a different angle, that which is illustrated in this
                photograph which is taken at 3 o ’clock? - A . I imagine so.

         Q.     Or within     a minute or so of that? - A. Yes.

    g    Q.     And it is also fair to say that by 3 o'clock, whether or not
               you were conscious of the precise time, at least one fan was
               climbing over the front fence.- we see him in the picture -
               and the gate is open, and 1 accept wholly docilely and
               properly fans are being allowed out. and as we see on
               the video are being filtered along the front to be taken into
               the pens l and 2 at the far end. But what I wanted your help
               with. Mr. Eccleston, is, were you conscious of that scene
               going on at about 3 o'clock? - A. No, I would be concentrating
               very hard on the game at that stage.

         0.     You were not aware of it until some moments later? -        a   . It was
               moments later, yes. undoubtedly.

        0.      But it is now clear you never had a sight     of pens 3 and 4
               before they had been hit by the impact of the first opening of
D              the gate? - a . I suppose I had not, no, if your....

        0. Assume, please, ay timing is right. - A. Yes. I will, indeed.

        0. Thank you.

        Ci.             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   By the tiae you got to your seat
              were      the teams out? - A. No, they were nor, sir.

        0. Can you give any idea how soon after you got to your seat they
           came out? - A. I thought I reached my standing position at
           quarter-to-3.  Obviously it was a couple of minutes later than
           that.  The Liverpool side must have come at about 7-minutes-
         ■■ t O - 3 .

        G . You had been in .'position at any rate for'a minute'or two? - a.


        O. ''Before the teams' came"out? > A..Yes', that i*,:
                                                            .               sir.

        o.           MR. GLASGOW:The other matter. Mr. Eccleston. I would
              like, your help on please, is the question of the presence of
              stewards.   Did you see the yellow tops you have described down
              on the pitch perimeter mingled with the Police? - A. I think I
              saw some, yes.

        G. I simply wanted to know this.  Did you - perfectly fairly -
           assume because you saw the yellow jackets, that they were
           stewards? - A. Yes.

        Q. Just to clarify the point, if we look together at any of the
           later pnotograpns, if you like, in the last section, flip
H          through at your liberty, but PR 112/A, PR 21 is perhaps the
           clearest, do you see that situation? - A. Yes.

 Q. Those are the sort of men you saw wearing those yellow
    jerkins? - A. That is right, yes.

Q. Did you or do you now appreciate they are in fact press men? -
   A. I do now, yes.

Q. And not stewards? -   a   . That is right.

Q. And you would have fairly got the impression those particular
   men wearing yellow jerkins did not do anything to help because
   they were too busy taking photographs of people? - A. Y e s , I
   could easily have mistaken that, yes, but 1 must admit I was
   not aware both sets were wearing yellow jerkins, no.

0. The only other matter about the stewards I would like your
   help on, Mr. Eccleston. is you told us about the line of
   stewards and Police whom you had seen on the previous year
   across the tunnel entrance.  I remind you of the way in which
   you wrote your own statement. The statement we have been very
   helpfully given now. did you in fact write this for yourself?
   Are those your own words? - A. It is. I wrote it on the
   Tuesday after the event as much to help myself as weil as to
   put down the facts and my observations.

Q. But it is actually    your own work rather     than somebody else’s?
   - a . It is entirely my own work.   My secretary typed it up
   the     same day fcr me, in fact.

Q. If I nay say so. with respect, it just shows lawyers ought to
   leave people to write their own statements, it is so good.   If
   we look at your personal observations, in your own words you
   had said as your third personal observation:

        ’’When we came through the turnstiles for the if88 game          we
        were met by, a line of stewards and Police Officers'*.

   "You were askea by my learned friend, Mr.       Woodward, on my left,
   whether or not what you meant to     say was    you saw a lineof
   -stewards withCtwo or three Policemen?      Is that-in -fact what
  -.you meant to'.say when ydu wrdte'the- words,.             stewards
   Ina Police Officers”?        If you were' to p u t - t h e line I
   would -say there were more stewards than Police Officers. 'That
   is as much a% I could honestly say.

Q. You have very fairly said you have some difficulty in
   recollecting precisely what the situation was, but you are
   certain, are you. that the tunnel was closed? - A. Absolutely
   certain, because I would have been down that tunnel, because
   that is the nearest approach to getting on to the terracing.

Q. I should make clear. Mr. Eccleston, I am accepting that as
   being both accurate and truthful, of course. The only
   criticism I have, if ’’criticism" is not too strong a word is
   that in fact it was substantially Policemen. Almost the
   entire line was Policemen.   But with that difference between
   my friend on my left and myself, can you help the Inquiry as
                - *“    e»Wf          ava vrml ejAVinP it iS TCSlly jUSt a

matter of impression? - A. It is a matter of impression,
because perhaps the yellow sticks sore in my mind. I could
not really, hand on heart, say there was more of one group
than the other.

I won't press you in that case.   Thank you for your patience
with me.

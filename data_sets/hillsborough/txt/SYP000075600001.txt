               I am a single man and               I live at the above address with my parents.                           I

              m a i n l y Liverpool        fans.    There was        one group of abcmt 30 outside                 the

        see a lot of them urinatin g                  into the garden              of a big house          on the

O       opposite\c:orner^Xl               d o n ’t know    if the house           is occupied          because    there

        was    some       building work          taking    place there.           There       seemed to be       constant

        flow    of s upporters            doing    this t hroughout          the afternoon.              They

        were    doing       this       quite openly making          no attempt           to    conceal    their

        actions.          Also    some    of them were going          down an a lley way at the side

        of houses          near    to the shop,       and    I presumed           that    they were also

        u r in at i n g    in there.          About 2pm,    I was     standing         in the     doorway of the

        shop to keep an eye on the display of                                                    that was       outside

        w he n a group of about                 4 or 5 Liverpool           s upporters were w al k in g pa s t           the

        shop and one of them said,                   “The y w o n ’t be there w hen we get back"

        indicating           to the      display at       the front        of the shop.          He seemed to mean

        what    he said he d i d n ’t say            it as a joke.           I d i d n ’t say anythin g           to him

        in reply.            I just      remained    in the d o o p * s f T l ‘he group of 50 that were

        outside       the     ’Beer O f f ’ , were        dr^fiking    cans       of   lager     or beer to start

        with,     but as         the    day    continued    I saw them drinking                 spirits    from

        bottles.          The m a jo ri ty x^ f    the other      fans      that were walking about were

        also    drinking.          As    I was    talking    to    local     people       in the area they were

        t elling me         that       they had seen some         fans who were so drunk                  that    they

        were    being        carried by their mates.               1 only saw one              bloke    being    carried

        in this way betw ee n 2. 3 0 p m 2.45pm,                  he was      being       carried       in the

        d i r e c t io n of the ground.            1 can't recall           the    time when the m a j o ri t y of

        them started             to leave the area because                 they were          constantly milling

        about,      I saw hundreds              in the area.       I do recall           though that there were

        still     some      fans,       just    dribs and drabs        in the area at 3pm and a f t e r . At

        about 3 . 3 0 p m        I put    the    radio on and       I heard that              something    had

        h ap pe ne d at the            ground and    I could hear sirens                 sounding.       I deci de d to

        close     the shop and            I had finished          closing      the shop by 4pm,            before     3pm

        I d i d n ’t have any            regular    customers       in the shop because                 of the fans        in

        the area.          I had a few          in after 3pm.       All     the    time that       the fans were           in

             the area       I felt, intimi d a te d a lt ho u gh they were   b as ically good humoured.

             I felt     that    their moo d   could change at any time        because   of the amount

             of alcohol        that   they were   consuming.

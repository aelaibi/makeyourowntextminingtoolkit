               to take a meal             break as      requested to do.                      However     upon entering          the

               gym I together with other officers                             was

               I positi one d myself              on the          running     track       between the goal & the

               g y m n as iu m    &   tried to take           in what was           ha ppening & what was               going on as

               the      crowd     in the S p i on Kop were a n gr y                 &   throwing        things     like    coins at

           then that       so mething        serious       was happ en in g at that              end.



           S h o r t l y after    the a mb ula nc e         came onto       the    pitch fans       &    police     started

           to bring       injured       &   what a p p e a r e d d e a d fans       down to the S pi on Kop area

           on the ho arding           boards.



           I went over       to a man who was                on the hoardi ng            board who was       lying on

           I then       called a nearby Doctor                over     to me,      who    then ex am i n ed CH AP MA N      &
           state d to me that            he was       dead.      In view of this            I did not give

           res us ci t at io n    &   covered him over with an                    Inspector's       jacket     &    together

           with                         moved him off the              pitch area to where               the hoarding

           boards       had stood       prior     to being       removed.          I took him off          the hoarding

           board w hi ch was          then taken by other                fans     back, to the Le pp in gs Lane end,



           I then       returned onto          the    pitch    &    went    up to a person that was                 just

           lying       outside    the    penalty area this               person was        obvi ou sly dead &

           together with anoth er               officer       I have       no    idea who     it was      though we

           picked this       person up          &    m ov ed him next           to CHAPMAN.        I have    seen

           photographs & can identify the                      person ma rk e d number 42 as                being     the

After    placing H EW IT SO N       next    to CH AP MA N       I again went onto       the   pitch        &
a p p r o a c h e d another male who was           lying near       to where HE W I T S O N had been

just    outside      the   penalty area.           This man was       ob viously dead & was            not

lying    on a hoarding.         To gether with anothe r              police officer        I don't

know    if   it was    the same one         I mo ve d this man to besides HE W I T S O N &

CHAPMAN.       I now know this ma n to be Eric H U G H E S & can identify him on

Up on   placing H U G H E S down      I decided to contact             the    control     room via my

personal      radio    &   informed them of the 3 dead                people by me.

picked up C HA PM AN whilst other officers picked up H U G H E S & H E W I T S O N &

together with                          we    carried all          3 bodies    to the gymnasium.                I

then    placed C HA P M A N on the         floor    of the gym not far from the door                   &
left him there         together with

The Right Honourable Lord Justice Taylor,
Inquiry on the Hillborough Stadium Disaster,
Town Hall,
Sheffield,
Yorks.


Dear Lord Justice Taylor,

                        DISASTER AT HILLSBOROUGH.

       Further to previous correspondence and in particular to
my letter of the 12th June, I enclose a copy of a letter received
in reply to my letter to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire.
I also enclose a copy of a further letter I have written to
Mr Wright for your information.

       I think it is deplorable that the police have been pilloried
for what occurred. They were placed in an impossible position
over the decision to hold the match which was clearly that of
the Club. Had the recommendations of the Popplewell Report been
followed and the Green Guide which was subsequently issued been
adhered to there would have been no tragedy.

       Would you please consider uniform minimum requirements
in Safety Certificates. I think no football ground should be
open unless, or until, the local authority where the ground is
situated can be pronounced safe including fire and immediate
access to the pitch from perimeter fencing as a place of safety
in an emergency.

Yours sincerely,

    Dear Mr Edey

    May I reply to your letter of 12 June on behalf of the Chief Constable.

    As you know the tragic events which unfolded at the Hillsborough
    Football Stadium on 15 April 1989 are being considered in the most
    intimate detail by Lord Justic Taylor's Inquiry.  An independent enquiry
    team from the West Midlands Police have conducted exhaustive enquiries
    and furnished the Inquiry with all the relevant available information.

    'f it had been felt at any time during the    gathering of information that
    criminal offences had been  committed then    the appropriate investigations
    would have been commenced.    At this stage   there is no     evidence to
    suggest that an offence of   the nature you   suggest has     been committed and
    accordingly no criminal charges have been     brought.

    Yours sincerely
6th July 1989.


P. Wright Esq.,
South Yorkshire Police,
Snig Hill,
Sheffield/
S3 8LY.


Dear Sir,

        I have the reply to my   letter of the 12th June from
Mr. T. Watson on your behalf.     It is said that there is no evidence
to suggest that the management   board of Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club have committed a criminal   offence and accordingly no criminal
charges have been brought.

        Before seeking judicial review in the High Court I thought
you should have the opportunity to reconsider the facts of the
matter. It is in my opinion only too clear that there is overwhelming
and abundant evidence of gross criminal negligence on the part
of the football club. It clearly constitutes a prima facie case
of manslaughter to put before judge and jury for determination.

        In the first place the match should not have been held
at Hillsborough Stadium. Evidence was given to the Taylor Inquiry
that representations had been made by Liverpool and the Football
Association which had been put forward to the police by Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club that the Liverpool spectators could not
be properly accommodated in the Leppings Lane terraces. Superintendent
Mole made it clear that the match would only be policed with Liverpool
being allocated the much smaller Leppings Lane terraces. The decision
to hold the match was entirely that of the Club.

        It meant that Liverpool were allocated accommodation for
less than 25% of their average gate whereas Nottingham Forest received
room for over 50% of their average gate at the Kop end of the ground.
It was a recipe for disaster. At the Kop end there were 42 turnstiles
to admit 21,000 spectators and the Leppings Lane terraces only
had 7 turnstiles for the capacity of i0,100 people on those terraces.

        Evidence was given by the chief steward for that part of
the ground that the Leppings Lane terraces had never been stewarded
and that he had never seen the Government's Green Guide and it
had never been brought to his attention and that he did not even
know of its existence. This was obviously known, or should have
been known, to the Club and was in direct contravention of the
Popplewell report and the detailed procedures laid down for stewarding
in the Green Guide.
2




        Popplewell and Paragraph 215 of the Green Guide make it
abundantly clear that if there is perimeter fencing there must
be immediate access to the pitch as a place of safety in the event
of an emergency. This was completely ignored by the Club. Evidence
was given to the Taylor Inquiry that the fire brigade had to be
contacted for bolt cutters. The Club doctor said the likely period
of survival in the crush was only four minutes. Those crushed
died of traumatic asphyxia. They had no chance of escape. In
this connection, I would particularly refer you to the sixth paragraph
of my letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions dated the 18th
May, a copy of which was enclosed with my last letter.

        For all these reasons I think it is your clear duty to
prepare and submit a case to the Crown Prosecution Service of manslaughter
against the Directoe£of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and,
if thought appropriate, against the Club itself - bearing in mind
the recent P & O decision - in respect of the incident which occurred
at Hillsborough Stadium on the 15th April 1989. Would you please
let me have your decision in the light of this letter as soon as
possible.

Yours faithfully,




R. Edey (Mr).

Dear Lord Justice Taylor,

                            DISASTER AT HILLSBOROUGH.

       Thank you for the letter of the 8 June acknowledging my letter
of the 31st May.

       Having just received a letter from the Senior Crown Prosecutor
I have, as a result, written today to the Chief Constable of South
Yorkshire and enclose a copy of my letter to him for your information.
I think it right that you should see such correspondence and be aware
of what I am endeavouring to do in this matter.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Wright,

                        DISASTER AT HILLSBOROUGH

       I enclose a copy of my letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions
dated the 18th May together with a copy of the reply I have just
received from the Senior Crown Prosecutor, Mr. E.C.S. Williams.

       Since I wrote my letter evidence has been given to the Taylor
Inquiry by Chief Superintendent Mole that the Football Association
and Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday Football Clubs had made approaches
in an attempt to change police plans so that Liverpool supporters
could be properly accommodated. They were told by Chief Superintendent
Mole that he was only prepared to police the match under the plans
laid down by the police. By their representations Sheffield Wednesday
must have known that that method of policing put the Liverpool supporters
at risk.

       The fact that the match was held with that basic disagreement
over safety of the spectators from Liverpool at the Lepping Lane
terraces reinforces my belief that the Directors of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club were criminally negligent in allowing the match to
be held at all let alone the perimeter fencing situation referred
to in my copy letter sent herewith. On these two grounds there must
be a prima facie case of manslaughter for the Directors to face before
judge and jury.

       Unless you assure me within the next seven days that you agree
with my contention and will carry out an investigation referring
it to the Senior Crown Prosecutor for consideration for proceedings
to be instituted, I intend to apply to the High Court for a Writ
of mandamus requiring this to be done.

       I have sent a copy of this letter to the Right Honourable
Lord Justice Taylor for his information.

Yours sincerely,




R. Edey (Me)

        Lord Justice Taylor,

        Yorkshire.


        Dear Lord Justice Taylor/

                              DISASTER AT HILLSBOROUGH

              I think it right that I should let you know that on 3rd May I applied
        to Mr Crompton the Stipendiary Magistrate at Sheffield for a summons to
        be issued against the Directors of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and
        Mr Peter Wright the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire that they killed
        Victoria Hicks and Sarah Hicks at Hillsborough Stadium on 15th April/ 1989.
        The Magistrate refused the application on the grounds that I had no direct
        interest and could not bring direct evidence before the court.

              I enclose herewith a copy of a letter I have written to the Director
        of Public Prosecutions. I think you should see this as a matter of courtesy.
        Had the 95 deaths occurred to animals the RSPCA would have been down on
        those responsible like a ton of bricks. Football management has to be made
        to face up to its responsibilities.

              I am struck by the fact that after the disaster at Bolton in 1946
        Mr Moelwyn Hughes KC laid dovha blueprint for such a disaster not happening
        again and yet similar disasters have occurred in 1971 at Ibrox Park and
        at Hillsborough resulting in a further 165 people losing their lives.

               Even today grounds are not safe and you could have had to take on
        board a further tragedy at Port Vale five short weeks after the disaster
        in respect of which you are at present hearing evidence. I enclose a newspaper
        cutting of the incident to which I refer. I hope you will recommend that
        the Home Secretary issues regulations laying down minimum standards of safety
        at sports grounds as recommended by Mr Moelwyn Hughes 43 years ago and as
        he is empowered to do by Section 6 (2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
        1975.

        Yours faithfully/

Dear Sir,

Disaster at Hillsborough.

     Would you please let me know as soon as possible whether you intend
to institute proceedings against the Directors of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club for manslaughter of those who died in Hillsborough stadium
on 15th April 1989.

     Mr. Justice Taylor went on record at a preliminary hearing, before
taking any evidence, that he would not be looking at a crime having been
committed or apportioning blame for what occurred.

     The terrible fire at Bradford four years ago made it clear beyond
all reasonable doubt that there must be immediate access to the pitch
in an emergency. The government guidelines published in 1986 lays this
down as a requirement for safety at football grounds. I would hardly
have thought that anybody with a grain of common sense could have looked
at it in any other way. Had there been fencing not allowing access to
the pitch at Bradford, instead of 56 deaths, the death toll would almost
certainly have been numbered in hundreds.

     Yesterday, Mr. Trevor Hicks testified to the Taylor Enquiry that
he saw one of his daughters being manhandled over the fencing. It had
unfortunately been too late and both his daughters died in the crush.
Mr Hicks tells me he is willing to testify at a trial for manslaughter.

     It is in the public interest that the gross criminal negligence which
has occurred is brought home to football management. If the sanction
of the criminal law is not invoked, further tragedies are much more
likely. The deaths which occurred at Hillsborough were wholly avoidable.

     Had access to the pitch been available whatever the circumstances
outside the ground those penned behind the fencing could have been allowed
on to the pitch before the police felt obliged to open the gate. The
police outside could have informed the Security Officer inside that they
had an emergency on their hands and to relieve pressure they needed to
open the gate. He could then have ordered the opening of the fencing
allowing access to the pitch before the gate was opened and no deaths
would have ensued.
2.




     I have to tell you, sir, that if you inform me that you do not intend
to prosecute in this matter I will, in the public interest, be seeking
judicial review of the decision of the Stipendiary Magistrate at Sheffield
given on the 3rd May, refusing me consent for a private prosecution.

Yours faithfully,

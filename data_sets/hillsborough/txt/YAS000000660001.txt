        - CONTROL OFFICER


Date:   18.4.89

Time:   1525-1610


About 1515 I got a call at home to return to work - there had been a major
incident at Hillsborough. I returned to work arriving at approximately
1600 almost simultaneously with Control Assistant        ] and Control
Officer

I assisted the domestic emergency Control Officer         [ who was also
monitoring calls from the scene of the incident. We acted as a relay for
messages, sending vehicles from Herries Road Bus Garage to Main Entrance on
Penistone Road. This information was relayed by hand to the Incident Room.

Radio communications were breaking but generally messages were received.

All the messages were clear and concise. I never had need to contact
Hospitals this was being done by Control Assistants.

I finished duty at approximately 2000 enabling me to return to duty at 0600
the next day.

My impression of the atmosphere was of calm, with no hint of panic or
disorder.

DISASTERS AND THE LAW : INQUIRIES INTO MAJOR ACCIDENTS
                                                                                         - -   54/6335
You kindly copied to members of EDH your letter of 26 July to the Lord Chancellor
and the accompanying report by an interdepartmental working group.

I have noted the report and am content with your proposed package approach to
publication.

Paragraph 46 of the report mentions the possibility of legislation to enable a death
to be registered at a different time from that at which it is currently registered. I
am advised that the Registrar General is content, in principle, with the idea of
extending the provisions of section 16 of the Coroners Act 1988 to include those
instances where the Coroner is informed by the Lord Chancellor that a public
enquiry has been established. As is now the case where an inquest is adjourned
under section 16, this would enable the Coroner to issue a form to the registrar of
the sub-district where the death occurred. In turn the registrar would register the
death and make certificates available.

However, as you know, only the medical cause of death is recorded In such
instances; no reference is made to the circumstances surrounding the death. This
may be resented by bereaved relatives. Nevertheless a separate report on the
incident leading to the death is passed to OPCS (via the registrar) for statistical
purposes. The Registrar General would wish this arrangement to continue together
with that where the Coroner is currently required to inform the registrar of the
result of criminal proceedings and, where the inquest was resumed, whether the
original findings as to the cause of death were revised at the resumed proceedings.

Copies of this letter go to the Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor, the Chairman
and other Members of EDH and to Sir Robin Butler.

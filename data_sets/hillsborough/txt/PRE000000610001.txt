                        The most modest of sums, but that’s all you need to
                   drive away a brand new Nova.
                        That's because, at present, we've a somewhat special
                   package of low-cost finance schemes on offer.
                        For example, with just a £99 deposit and repayments
                   spread over four years (15.2% APR) you could soon be sitting
                   comfortably in a new driving position.

   The constant need
   for vigilance
 AFTER any great disaster, we are all
  naturally inclined to demand that
  measures be taken to see that it never
  happens again. Yet, unless we estab­
  lish the means for ensuring that the
  proper preventive measures are indeed
  being taken, calamity may recur.

  shows that many of the lessons spelt
  out by the inquiry into the terrible
  King’s Cross underground fire have
  still to a great extent not been learned..
  They have found inflammable mater­                                                                                                Lawson (left): Missing the chance of new Euro-prosperity for Britain?

                                                Haswell’s departing advice to policyholders is:

                                                fellow policyholders.
                                                 • Moving home without telling your insurer first will mean

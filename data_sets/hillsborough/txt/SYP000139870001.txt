          Hillsborough - Association between time of entry to the ground,

                            aee. and alcohol consumption




Summary

This note discusses the evidence for associations between time of entry to Hillsborough
football ground, age, and alcohol consumption amongst spectators who died. There is
some statistical evidence that those victims who entered late were more likely to have
raised blood alcohol levels than those who entered early. This association is in part due
to the fact that the women and youths who died had little blood alcohol and also tended
to have entered the ground early. However, the association between time of entry and
alcohol levels persisted in men aged 18 or more.

The D ata

D ata was provided by HM Coroner on the probable time of entry to the ground and
route of entry, the place of death, blood alcohol level, and the age and sex of each of the
95 victims of the Hillsborough football disaster.




Results

1. Time of entry

The time of entry and route of entry were classified as shown in table 1, which also
shows the age, sex, and blood alcohol levels of those spectators who died. Nothing was
known about the entry times of 13 spectators. For a further 22 spectators the time of
entry was assessed as being after 2.30 pm. but it was not known whether they entered via
gate "C", and hence after 2.48 when the gate was opened, or via a turnstile.           The
remaining victims have been divided into two groups according to whether or not they
entered before 2.48 (via a turnstile), of at or after 2.48 (when gate C was opened).
There are associations between both the age and sex of the victims and when they
entered the ground.    More than half (53%) of the victims who are known to have
entered before 2.48 were under 20, whilst less than a third (31%) of those known to
have entered after 2.48 were youths (table 2). Similarly, all 5 of the women whose entry
times were certainly known entered before 2.30 (table 3). One woman was known to
have entered either through gate "C" or after 2.30, and nothing was known about the
entrance of the other woman who died.

The age distribution of those who were known only to have entered either through gate
"C" or through a turnstile after 2.30 was the same as the age distribution of those known
to have entered after 2.48; and quite different from that of those known to have entered
before 2.48 (table 2). Furthermore, of the 7 victims known to have died in pen 4, three
were known to have entered after 2.48 (via gate "C") and the other four were assessed as
having either entered through gate C or through a turnstile after 2.30. This evidence
suggests that those victims who were known only to have entered via gate C or after 2.30
may form part of the group who entered after 2.48; and they have been combined with
this group in the main analysis below to form a group of 48 victims termed "later
entrants". The remainder are termed "earlier entrants" (34 victims), or "not known" (13
victims).




Blood alcohol levels

The blood alcohol levels have been divided into three categories: no blood alcohol or
negligible traces (<10 mg/dl); between 10 and 70 mg/dl, and 80 mg/dl or more. The
latter value is the legal limit for drinking and driving and merely provides a convenient,
though arbitrary, divide. It certainly does not imply that persons over this value were
inebriated.

Over half (54%) of the 95 victims had no blood alcohol or negligible traces (< lOmg/dl).
Only 15 (16%) had more than 80 m g/dl (the legal limit for drinking and driving). Blood
alcohol was also associated with age and sex. Nearly three quarters (71%) of the victims
under 20 years old had negligible blood alcohol, compared to under a half (42%) of
those 20 or over (table 4). None of the women had any blood alcohol recorded (table
5).




Time of entry and blood alcohol level

Approximately one-third (35%) of the "earlier entrants" had raised blood alcohol levels
(> lOmg/dl), compared to nearly two-thirds (63%) of the "later entrants". The odds of
having a raised blood alcohol level for "later entrants" were 3»1 (95% Confidence
Interval: 1 • 2, 7*6) times as great as the odds for "earlier entrants". Thus there is strong
statistical evidence that "later entrants" were more likely to have raised blood alcohol
levels than "earlier entrants".

This association could have arisen merely because the young victims and the women
tended both to be earlier entrants and to have negative or negligible blood alcohol
levels. However, after excluding both women and young men from the analysis, the
association between alcohol and entry time persisted. For men over 18, 45% of "earlier
entrants" had blood alcohols in excess of 10 mg/dl (and 15% in excess of 80mg/dl),
whilst 71% of the "later entrants" had blood alcohol in excess of 10 m g/dl (and 29% in
excess of 80mg/dl) (table 7). Amongst men over 18, the odds of having a raised blood
alcohol level for "later entrants" were 3*0 (95% Cl: 1*0, 9*3) times as great as for
"earlier entrants", exactly as before.

This analysis is complicated by the fact that there were 13 victims whose entrance to the
ground is unrecorded, and a further 22 who can be assessed only to have entered either
through gate C (after 2.48 pm.) or through a turnstile after 2.3Q. The latter group have
been included with the "later entrants" after 2.48 on the basis of the similarity of their
age distribution and the disposition of their places of death. This may be wrong. If,
instead, the victims are split into two groups according to whether or not they entered
before or after 2.30 pm, then these 22 victims certainly form part of the group of later
entrants defined in this way.

The association between blood alcohol and entrance before or after 2.30 is shown in
table 8, and, again, there is some evidence that later entrants after 2.30 were more likely
to have raised alcohol levels than earlier entrants before 2.30. The odds of having
raised alcohol levels for these later entrants were 2 • 9 (95% Cl: 1 • 0, 8 • 6) times as great
as those for earlier entrants defined in this way.




Discussion

Whether the alcohol levels and times of entrance of these 95 victims bear any relation to
those in the general body of spectators is difficult to assess. However, if the alcohol
levels of the victims were related to their deaths, in the sense of having increased their
chances of dying, then plainly their alcohol levels might bear no relation to those in the
rest of the spectators who entered at the same time. If, on the other hand, the alcohol
levels in these victims played no part in their deaths and were not a factor in the chance
that they died, then it is at least possible that the victims’ alcohol levels reflect those that
were generally prevalent amongst the spectators who entered at the same times via the
same routes.

Since these are generally small levels of alcohol, it is perhaps unlikely that the level of
alcohol was a contributing factor in the deaths of any individual spectator. That is to
say, it is unlikely that the reason why one spectator died rather than another can be
explained to any extent at all by the victim’s blood alcohol level. (However, this does
not, of course, preclude the possibility that alcohol played some part in the deaths. It
would still be possible, to argue, for example, that the general level of alcohol
consumption amongst the spectators raised the general chance of there being some
victims without being relevant to the deaths of any individuals).

If the level of alcohol was not a contributory factor in the death of any individual then it
is possible that the alcohol levels in the victims entering at different times is a
representative sample of the alcohol levels in the spectators as a whole entering at the
same times. If this is the case, then there is some statistical evidence that amongst
spectators who entered later there was a greater proportion who had been drinking
before the game than amongst spectators who entered earlier..

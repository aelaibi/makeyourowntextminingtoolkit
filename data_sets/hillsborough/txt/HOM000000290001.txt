The      turnstiles              opened      before noon and                  s upporters           began           to

by       the p o l i c e and we chose the r i g h t h a n d cor n e r                             because           the
co u n t e r f o i l       was a t t a c h e d to the left h a n d side of                          the        ticket

the r e f o r e        a        d e l i b e r a t e action.       We adopted            the        practice          of
tearing           of f the c o r n e r of the t i c k e t as                     s u pporters          sometimes

know     where        people w h o ha d c l i m b e d o v e r          the     turnstiles             were

A t a r o u n d 2.50 we n o t i c e d two surges of s u p p o r t e r s towards                           our
gate.      I d i d n o t see C gate open.                    I s i m p l y n o t i c e d two        surges
b u t do n o t kno w w h e r e the c rowd came from.                       P e o p l e w e r e rushing
everywhere           and      s p e c i f i c a l l y towards o u r gate.         We      could           not
cope     with        this.        Some people ha d g e n u i n e             tickets       and        wer e
a l l o w e d through.         Others     just ha d t i c k e t stubs an d this                     caused
confusion.           There w e r e also peo p l e w i t h no tickets at all.                               We
still h a d the left han d side of the gate o p e n an d the crowd was
pushing       upstairs.           I was p u s h e d b a c k a g a i n s t the side              of        the

was     n o t r e a l l y injured.         A t that time I n o t i c e d that the                     fans
were     becoming            agitated,      although not especially                     abusive.            I
                                                                         (roo^i

managed       to ge t the gat e closed.                  In retros p e c t ,       I     think        that

first time.               A f t e r this the crowd q u i e t e n e d down an d we                       op ened
one side of the gate a g a i n to a l l o w those w i t h c o r r e c t                             tickets
to      enter           the stand.           A f t e r a s h o r t p e r i o d of time           there       was
another,            b i g g e r surge.          I b e l i e v e this m u s t have b e e n           when       C

o verwhelmed.                 However,       w e m a n a g e d to ge t the gat e closed again.
By      this        time         our     police       o f f icers        had    returned          and     were
assisting               us.      I am n o t re a l l y sure w h e t h e r t h e y had              r e t urned
in       time for the f irst surge b u t I think they m i g h t have.                                        The
police         stood            in f ront of our gate.               I     recall         that     somebody
came       an d         t old t h e m t h a t there w e r e pe o p l e           dying          inside       the
tunnel b u t t hey did no t r e a l l y take v e r y m u c h notice.                               However,
I     m u s t a d m i t that w e di d no t take m u c h no t i c e of this                             comment

P eople        di d s e e m to be d i s t r a u g h t however.                  I e s t i m a t e that        it
m u s t have b e e n a b o u t 3.00 p m or s l i g h t l y later b y this time.                                I

2.00       pm.           I     s e e m to recall that one                 Liverpool         steward          was

S o m etime         after          the f i r s t surge I s e e m to recall                  hear i n g       hi m
shout        "don't            o p e n the gate".          He m a y have m e n t C gate                 as    he

As      soon as it b e c a m e a p p a r a n t that s o m e t h i n g wa s g o i n g on                      the

w h a t was happening.                 The L i v e r p o o l   s t e w a r d and I then w e n t                  our

I     walked           along       to gate 2 in the f r o n t           perimeter                fence.             I
started              helping       a p o l i c e m a n to pull p e o p l e         thro u g h         gate        2.
People           w e r e coming out of the gat e r e l a t i v e l y                 easily.                   T here
were        some        injured pe o p l e and the p o l i c e m a n a n d                 I     wer e          just
grabbing              arms and legs and p u l l i n g peo p l e              clear.            Gate        2     was
certainly              clea r e r than gates          3 a n d 4.      I continued                to        assist
for a p e r i o d of time b u t I cannot r e m e m b e r ho w long.                               I        simply
lost t r a c k of time.                I was still w e a r i n g m y steward's bi b                             and,
in fact,             I did not take it off u ntil                I a r r i v e d home.            I carried
on a s s i s t i n g at gate 2 until                there w e r e no m o r e people to                          pull
through.               I then w e n t to c o m f o r t p e o p l e and             remember            helping
one y o u n g b o y to the p o l i c e room.                   He tol d me that he h a d                        lost
his uncle             in the crowd.


I     was        si m p l y     trying      to     assist       at    this         time.          I        recall
specifically                  help i n g to c a r r y one m a n w h o ha d d ied across                          the
pitch           to     the gym on a s t r e t c h e r m a d e ou t            of      an        advertising
board.               When      we got to the edge of the p i t c h we had                             to . stop
because              an ambulance w a s coming through.                      I t h e refore put                  the
s t r e t c h e r dow n and w e n t b a c k on to the p i t c h to see w h a t n e e d e d
doing           next.         I stayed until        it s e e m e d t hat there was                    no        more
tha t       I        could      do.    I go t home at           about        5.20      and        therefore
estimate              that      I m u s t have     left the g r o u n d at            about           4.45         to
4.55.            A t that time e v e r y o n e s e e m e d to be g o i n g t heir ow n                           way
and I was n o t a c t u a l l y tol d to go home.


I     did       JWtiC       go b a c k r o u n d to the s t a n d       to     report            to        Stuart

behind            the       s tand in o r d e r to r e p o r t t hat I              was         alright.             I

                               People s e e m e d to be u s i n g t heir ow n initiative at
this         stage.            I do no t k n o w w h e n the c r o w d b e g a n to               leave           the

s p e c i f i c a b o u t w h e r e t h e y will          a l l o w fans to go w i t h i n the w e s t

w e s t stands although,                 since the b e g i n n i n g of this season,                       they
do    j n O B B n             m a n the K o p end.         W e are always a d v i s e d to             leave

sp e c i f i c       about       where    t h e y will a l l o w the fans             to       go.         Even
though the w e s t s tand an d terraces are n o w for a w a y                                  supporters
only          the       police      g e n e r a l l y k e e p the fans in          the        south     west
corner.              The po l i c e do o f t e n control            the flo w of fans.                 There
is a w o o d e n gate to the tunnel                       an d a lso c r o w d control           barriers
and       in        the p a s t the p o l i c e have u s e d            these.        However          crowd
d i r e c t i o n an d flow is e n t i r e l y at the d i s c r e t i o n of the                      police
and       is n o t up to us.              A t the time of the two surges the                           gates
to       the tunnel w ere o p e n and there w e r e no p o l i c e                         standing          at

opened.


In       the p a s t I have o c c a s i o n a l l y n o t i c e d the p o l i c e              tactic        of
opening             the exi t gates         to a d m i t fans s h o r t l y b e f o r e kic k              off.
T his         once      occurred         at N e wcastle,           At    approximately               2.55     a
c r o w d h a d b u i l t up o u t s i d e the gate a n d there was no chance                                of
t he m        entering          the g r o u n d thro u g h the turn s t i l e s            before          kick
off.                Th e d e c i s i o n wa s   then m a d e b y the p o l i c e           to ope n         the
gate.          A fr i e n d of m i n e was        i n j u r e d in that crowd.                Apparantly
it is n o t u n c o m m o n for the po l i c e to do this                       oV" c.-VV\<a.r

I emphasize               that the p o l i c e w e r e         in total control of crowds                    in
a n d o u t of' t h e ground.             It       is t h e y w h o dec i d e w h e r e people               do
and       do n o t go.           I do n o t k n o w if t h e y liase w i t h the                 club        at

especially               if     an o r d e r comes        from a senior           officer.            It     is

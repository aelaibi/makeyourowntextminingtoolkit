                 Dear Mr. Whalley,

                              HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

                 Thank you very much for your letter dated 23rd May, 1989> which
                 was considered by my Management Committee at a meeting today,
                 and I would confirm that my Management Committee is not in
                 possession of the relevant information with regard to the
                 disaster, and therefore, does not feel it would be of
                 assistance to give any written submission in this respect.

                 My Management Committee will be extremely pleased to co-operate
                 in any way thought desirable by The Rt. Hon. Lord Justice
                 Taylor in the pursuit of the Inquiry, and remains at his
                 disposal.

                                         Yours sincerely,




                                                Secretary

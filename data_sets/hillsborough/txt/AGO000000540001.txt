          HILLSBOROUGH

          I attended a meeting at the Home Office earlier this week at which Peter
          Pearson was present. All aspects of the Hillsborough issue were discussed.

          I have since reported to the Attorney General. His present position is that
          none of the material put forward following the ITV drama documentary touches
          on the issues based in the applications which he has already considered under
          Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988. He has received no further such
          applications but. should he do so. they would be carefully considered in the
          usual way.
          It was clear from what Peter Pearson said that the CPS consider it unlikely that
          their consideration of the further material will lead to the conclusion that there
          should be any further criminal investigation along the lines suggested by the
          Hillsborough Families Support Group. The purpose of this letter is to point up
          the interest of the Attorney General in that issue also and ask that he be
          informed once the CPS has reached a considered view so that he has an
          opportunity to comment before any announcement is made.

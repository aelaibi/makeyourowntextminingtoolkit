FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL:   APPEALS AGAINST FLA REQUIREMENTS

This is to confirm my telephone call of 19 October about amending
the Football Spectators Bill (the Bill) in order to clarify the
appeal position under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
(Parliamentary Counsel's letter of 21 September refers.)

2.    Amendments to the Bill should be made so as to preclude
rights of appeal under section 5 of the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act 1975 against terms and conditions contained in a safety
certificate where they are included as a result of a requirement
of the Football Licensing Authority under clause 13(2) of the
Bill.

3.   I am sorry that you should receive these instructions so
late in the day.

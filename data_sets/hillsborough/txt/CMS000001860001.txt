Mr Sweet



In preparing the estimate for expenditure for the Inquiry we have
operated on the basis of providing for invoices from Lancashire
Police Authority and Newcastle University for quarters ending
3 0 June, 30 September, 30 December and so on.

2.    I should be grateful if you would write to these two
organisations to ask that they invoice us for these periods of
time.   If they were to operate, differently this might affect the
way in which expenditure falls^this, and the next financial year.

3.   In writing to them I should be grateful if you would mention
that VAT should be applied to their invoice.  If an invoice is
received to which VAT is not applied I should be grateful if you
would make arrangements to provide for the invoice to be amended.

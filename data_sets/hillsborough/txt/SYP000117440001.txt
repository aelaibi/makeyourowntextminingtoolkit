            I reported on duty at R a w m a r s h P olice S t a t i o n at Sam on S a t u r d a y                                15th

           April      1989,       At that       time       1 was      in full Police              uniform,      consisting         of

            a Tunic as o p p os ed to the P o l i c e                   issue anorak.

            I was     part     of Serial        56 under           the? command of           Inspector N e w e y and we

            tra v e l l e d   from R a w m a r s h Police S t a t i o n           to the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football

            Ground      by f o r c e       coach.

            The    briefing       took       place    seated        in the N o r t h S t a n d and the              e vacuation

            procedure         explained,.           The    individual         duties were            explained       by

            I n s p e c t o r N e w ey ,

           ye were       d e p l o y e d as a serial             at Raws on Spring Road at                   11. 15am that

            date?.      1 took      up my      position          to direct        the N e t t i n g f orest         contingent

            t»o sui t a b i © parking          places on the              Industrial        estate.

           The    fans that         I saw were            good    natured,        a large         propo r t i o n   of w hich

           a p p e a r e d to have         been drinking.,

           We were       to have        t aken a meal            on comm e n c e m e n t    of the m a t c h at 3pm and

           at that       time     our      serial     were       standing at         the    corner       of Perti stone Road

           and Harries R o a d outside                    the Char l i e Browns            Shop.,      At   that     time

            Inspector N e w e y was            monitoring           the    police      radio and told us of some

           form of trouble              in the       ground.

           At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 0 5 pm that          date a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t a p p r o a c h e d    our
serial         and we were         orde r e d       into     the ground.

As we entered the                gro u n d     through the           entrance        between the N o r t h Stand

and      the      spiori kop       I was       unaware        of what was happening,             but     saw to my

left     the N o t t i n g h a m       Fo r e s t   players n u m b e r e d 6 and 3 leaving              the     pitch

and others            going     down the tunnel.

On    looking         to the L e p p in gs          Lane     end of the ground              I saw a large        crowd

of    s pec tators        on the       pitch.         I thought at            that    time that        there had

been a         pitch      invasion.

We    had      w a l k ed onto      the f ield w hi c h then became a trot and                          then we       ran

as a serial              to the     crowd.

It was         only      on reaching           the goal a r e a that I realised                   that a serious

incident         had t aken        place,           I saw a        large man ob v i o u s l y     dead    crushed

a g ai n s t    the    perimeter         fence.        I saw that            fans were all        crushed

together         and    people were asking                   for    help.

The      actual        s e q uence of e vents              that f o l l o w e d are    not clear       in my     mind

but      my     r ec ol le ct io n is as follows.

I stood on the                 fencing       shouting         to fans       to move    back?      it did not have

any effect,              in fact a group of about                    four    fans were        swearing        back at

me and g es ti cu l a t i n g wit h their                    hands     the    *V*    sign.      1 was    shouting

to them and tell i n g              them that          people were            getting       hurt at the        front.

It had         no effect.           I remember             pulling at least           two    people?    over the

fence       but these were             not     really        injured        ones.     They had     obviously

cl a mbered        over    the     trapped          people at        the     front.

I went         to Gate 3 and wit h other                    officers         pulled bodies        through.        1

remained at that                gate     for    some       time.      The     gateway was        small    and    it

was    dif ficult         to    pull     people       through.          I thought at that              time   that

the    pitch s u r r o u n d and the                entrance        t h r o u g h the gate were         on the    same

level.          It was     only after           some       time    that      I realised that           in fact we

several          o f f i c e r s to     pull    h irn o u t ,

At    some       stage       I reac h e d      through the          gate as    I could see a boy face

down     but wit h no one                on top of him.              The    boy as     I recall      had jeans

a n d a belt an d was                 light     coloured hair.              I took     hold of the        lads    belt

a n d was able            to    lift     him myself with             one    hand and pass him backwards.

I do     not       recall       how or why but            I remember walking w ith a body on a

s tr e t c h e r      to the m a k es hi f t        are a b e t w e e n the N o r t h S t a n d .     The      body

was    of a male.               I also a s s is te d w i t h taking            the body of a w o m a n           in

jeans who was                face     down,     to that area.

At    several          points       during      that    period       1 felt unable         to br e a t h myself

and    had to stop w h a t               I was      doing.         At some    point     1 did      remove my

             know.

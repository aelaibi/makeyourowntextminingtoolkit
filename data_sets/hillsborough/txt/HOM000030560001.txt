       Dear Mr Pyne

       Hillsborouoh Documents

       [ refer to recent correspondence and telephone calls between us on the above subject I
       have now had the opportunity of discussing matters further with my legal advisor. I am able
       to tell you that we will resume the release of the amended statements of police officers.

       It may take a little while for the process to be completed because a lot of material was
       handed to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s staff and returned to us in bulk, it has not yet been
       possible to file it all in proper order. However, we should be able to send some more
       statements almost straight away.

       If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

        Dear sir,

       It has just been announced that Sheffield United Football Club
       have made a planning application to Sheffield City Council to
       convert their Bramall Lane ground to an all seater stadium as
       recommended by the Lord Justice Taylor report. The plan

       ^ season     1 9 9 1 /9 2 ? nVert ^   K° P   t0 311 Seated area hy   the   s ta rt

       I wondered if you could inform us of the Governments intention
       regarding all seater stadia and as to whether your own views on
       this issue differed from your predecessor Mr Colin Moynihan.

       We are members of the National Federation of Football
       Supporters Club who are at present involved in discussions at
       committee level m the House of Commons regarding all seater
       stadia and their implications to the football supporter
       regarding c o s t ,safety,removal of options to stand or not etc.

       Could you please inform me of the present position at your
       earliest convenience.

      Thanking you in anticipation


      Yours faithfullyr


      Mr P.Whitney

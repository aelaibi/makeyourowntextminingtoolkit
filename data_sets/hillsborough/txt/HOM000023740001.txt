REPORTS OF THE HSE INVESTIGATION INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER                                 ^   1

Herewith the premised set of reports of our work on the investigation. As you
can see, the coirpendium consists of seven reports and four annexes. Not all
the reports have received final vetting and therefore should still be regarded
as being in draft form.

The report on the collapse load calculations of the barrier is completed but we
are currently testing a horizontal wrought iron tube from one of the barriers
which will provide actual, rather than estimated, mechanical properties which
may slightly alter the figures in the report. I do not expect any significant
change to the calculations but feel that test data from a tube will provide
closer validation than data from a tensile test piece.

I have been able to provide two full copies of the reports which I hope will be
of interest and use to lord Justice Taylor and also to Professor Maunder. You
will note from the distribution list that copies, when finally vetted, will
also be circulated to ACC Jones.

Please let me know of any comments which emanate from the Inquiry, and I will
do iny best to incorporate them into the final versions.

With best wishes for Christmas and the New Year.

Yours sincerely

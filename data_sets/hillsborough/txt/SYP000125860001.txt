CONT..ALTHOUGH PEOPLE ARE BLAMING THE POLICE I THOUGHT THAT MOST OF THE
PROBLEM WAS THE LACK OF SIGNS AND STEWARDS.EVEN AFTER THE DISASTER HAD STRUCK
THERE WAS NO INFORMATION BROADCASTED OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM.THE CRUSH WAS
TERRIBLE.I MANAGED TO ESCAPE OVER THE SIDE FENCING,MY LEGS WERE SLIGHTLY
BRUISED.
I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH THREE FRIENDS,I DO NOT KNOW THEIR FULL DETAILS.THEY

INSIDE THE GROUND I COULD SEE FROM ABOVE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE CENTER
TERRACE BUT THE POLICE ON THE PITCH COULD NOT AND THEY HAD NOT BEEN TOLD FROM
OUTSIDE. THE POLICE SEEMED TO TREAT IT AS A SITUATION OF VIOLENCE AND FANS
DID MORE FOR THE CASUALTIES THAN THE POLICE EXCEPT FOR A FEW OFFICERS WHO DID
GET STUCK IN. I SAW OFFICERS ON THE HALFWAY LINE DRINKING TEA WHILE THIS WAS
  )ING ON WHICH I FOUND OBSCENE.

n9            I ARRIVED AT THE LEPPINGS LANE AT ABOUT 2.15PM THERE WAS A HUGE
              CROWD O/S AND THERE WAS A BIT OF CRUSHING TAKING PLACE. IN AN AREA
              AT THE SIDE OF THE TURNSTILES WERE THERE WERE 3 POLICEMAN ON
              HORSE BACK.THERE WAS A LARGE RAILING GATE AT THE SIDE AND A
              TEMPORARY BARRIER PREVENTED FANS GOING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE
              GROUND. THERE WERE SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS AT THAT BARRIER.

THIS WAS AWAY FROM THE MAIN CRUSH.WHILST I WAS AT THE TURNSTILE A BIG MAIN
RAILING GATE WAS OPENED BY THE POLICE/STEWARD AT ABOUT 2.20PM TO EJECT A
SUPPORTER.THEN I SAW A YOUNG BOY BEING CARRIED OVER THE WALL HE WAS VERY
DISTRESSED.I WAS DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH THAT BOY AND IT WAS QUITE CLEARLY SHOWN
ON THE T.V THAT NIGHT HOWEVER THEY BROADCASTED THE WRONG TIMES ON THE
PROGRAMMES.THREE POLICEMAN ON HORSE BACK WERE TRYING TO CONTROL THE CROWD BY
PUSHING THEM TOWARDS THE GATEWAY AT THE TURNSTILES THERE WAS OBVIOUS ANGER ON
K H PARTS OF THE FANS/POLICE DUE TO THE MAYHEM.THE 3 ON HORSE BACK IN MY
OPINION COULD DO NO MORE THAN WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND I CANNOT CRITISIS
THOSE OFFICERS. I MADE MY WAY BACK AROUND THE REAR OF THE CROWD TOWARDS THE
TURNSTILES OF THE SEATING AREA WHERE THERE WAS SOME ASSEMBLANCE OF QUEUES BUT
THERE WAS STILL SOME CRUSHING. I THEN SAW 2 POLICE OFFICERS ONE FEMALE ONE
MALE BOTH OF THEM WERE IN DANGER THEMSELVES AS THEY WERE PINNED AGAINST THE
WALL THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT TICKETS.THE FEMALE
OFFICER REMOVED 3 PEOPLE FROM THE TURNSTILE AND I WAS ABLE TO GO INTO THE
GROUND WITH SOME DISCOMFORT.IN MY OPINION THERE WAS SERIOUS DANGER TO PEOPLE
O/S THE GROUND AT 2.15PM THAT DAY. ONCE SEATED I COULD SEE BELOW THE SEVERE
CRUSHING IN THAT CENTRAL PEN. I SAW A YOUNG WOMAN BEING CARRIED ABOVE THE
CROWD AND SEEMED TO BE CONVULSING.THE PEOPLE AT THE FRONT OF THE PEN SEEMED
TO BE IN OBVIOUS DISTRESS .SOMETHING WAS BEING POINTED OUT TO OFFICERS BUT
APPEARED NOT TO RESPOND.PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO CLIMB OUT OF THE PEN BOTH ONTO
THE PITCH AND ONTO THE SIDES.PEOPLE AT THE FRONT WERE PUSHED BACK BY THE
POLICE.I LEFT THE GROUND BUT COULD SEE THAT PEOPLE HAD DIED, AND I SAW
SEVERAL OF THEM ON BOARDS.I DIDN'T SEE ANY SIGNS OF DRUNKENESS BEFORE THE
GAME.I BELIEVE IT WAS A LACK OF STEWARDING INSIDE THE TURNSTILES BEFORE THE
POLICE OPENED THE GATES.I DO NOT ENTIRELY BLAME THE POLICE FOR THIS DISASTER.
I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH MY FATHER IN LAW

FOR HELP, AT FIRST I THOUGHT HE WAS OVER REACTING A BIT BUT THEN I REALISED
SOMETHING WAS VERY WRONG. THE CRUSH GOT WORSE AND I COULDNT MOVE. ITHOUGHT
THAT I WAS GOING TO PASS OUT. WHEN I LOOKED TO THE FRONT AND NOTICED PEOPLE
ALL CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE TO GET OUT I KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS VERY VERY
WRONG. WITH THE PEOPLE ALL GOING OVER THE FRONT FENCE THE CONGESTION EASED
SLIGHTLY AND POLICE OFFICERS CAME IN VIA THE REAR OF THE PEN TO HELP THE
INJURED PEOPLE INSIDE THE PEN. I SAW SOME PEOPLE WHO LOOKED TO ME AS IF THEY
HAD BEEN CRUSHED TO DEATH. SOME WERE OBVIOUSLY DEAD, AND SOME INJURED AND
DEAD PEOPLE WERE BEING DRAGGED PAST ME.

THAT PEN 3 AND 4 WERE ALREADY FULL,BUT MORE PEOPLE WERE STILL ENTERING THE
PEN FROM THEBACK. I THINK THE TROUBLE WAS THAT THERE WERE NO STEWARDS INSIDE
THE LEPPINGS LANE END AND PEOPLE WERE CONFUSED AND DIDNT KNOW HOW TO GET TO
THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE OF THE TERRACE       TO EASE THECONGESTION   SO THEY ALL
MADE FOR THE TUNNEL AND PENS 3 AND 4

ACCOMPANIED BY SON. DOCTOR             OF
                   SHEFFIELD TEL.             A DR. AT DONCASTER HOSPITAL HE
ATTENDED THE INJURED AT THE MATCH. AT 2.30PM THERE WAS NO CONGESTION IN THE
GROUND, BUT I DID SEE ONE THING OUTSIDE THE GROUND PEOPLE WERE HANGING AROUND
GETTING TANKED UP SO TO SPEAK AND AT ONE POINT A MOUNTED BRANCH OFFICER
ALMOST PLEADED WITH THE SUPPORTERS TO GET INSIDE THE GROUND BUT IT WAS
OBVIOUS THEY WERE NOT TAKING ANY NOTICE. ALSO AT ABOUT 2.45PM I RETURNED FROM
THE TOILET AND THE OUTSIDE CROWD APPEARED UNCONTROLLABLE.

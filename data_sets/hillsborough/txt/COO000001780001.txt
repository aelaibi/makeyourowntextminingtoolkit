        To:         H.M. Chief Inspector of Constabulary
        Subj ect;   INTERIM RECOMMENDATIONS BY LORD JUSTICE TftYLOR

        Further to our telephone conversation of 23rd August, 1989 1
        caused enquiry to be made of all forces, England and Wales
        with regard to the extent to which, in broad terms, the
        recommendations of the Taylor Report have been implemented
        and any areas of difficulty which may have been highlighted.
        Consequent upon the publication of the Interim      Report and
        Home Office Circular 68/1989, police forces and football
        clubs have accepted the recommendations and responded with
        speed, enthusiasm and commitment in their undertaking to
        implement same. Nonetheless a number of the recommendations
        continue to promote discussion and/or reservation and I shall
        confine my remarks to those which have elicited most comment.
        Recommendation 4 deals with the need for "         a written
        agreement between the police and the club setting out their
        respective responsibilities for crowd safety and control.,.
        It is fair to say that there has been a divergence of opinion
        on the content of the written agreement and the form it
        should take.   Many clubs however have exchanged agreements
        with the forces concerned and the remainder have set out
        mutually agreed parameters outlining essential areas of
        responsibility which will be the basis for immediate use and
        be subject of further scrutiny by the appropriate legal
        offices.    It is not anticipated that such scrutiny and
        eventual agreement will be resolved immediately and further
        liaison will be arranged, as necessary. At this stage there
        has been no intimation that agreement will not             be
        forthcoming.
        Recommendations 8 and 9 which deal with the requirements for
        all gates (in perimeter fences) opening onto the pitch, to be
        fully opened and manned during the course of the match, have
        resource and public disorder implications that       have been
        highlighted by a significant number of forces. Indeed there
        has been a decision at two grounds (Bolton and Millvall) that
        much flexibility will be deployed in this regard.Both these
        recommendations and that at 28 (which deals           with the
        provision of police reserves for immediate deployment) pose
        potentially large increases in charges for police presence at
        the club concerned and significant and continued resistance
        has been experienced by ground commanders in         some force
        areas.
        Recommendations 21, 31 and 32 deal with the Installation of
        close circuit television, enhanced radio communication and
        operators to handle same and the provision ofa separate
        system of land line, have again, cost implications for the
        clubs which have been resisted.
                                                      continued/
FROM                                  CTI JE > 0 8 . 2 9 .   0813552040   2   P RGE   3




       Nevertheless it is fair, to report that the focussing of minds
       engendered   by    the    implications   of    these   interim
       recommendations has not impaired, as I indicated earlier,
       relationships between the Police Service and the football
       clubs . Suggestions have continued to be made by forces and
       are being collated by the A.C.P.O.           General Purposes
       Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events, on such
       matters as colour-coding for exit gates, national training
       videos and a national system of hand signals should radio
       communications be rendered ineffective.
       1 have no doubt that you will continue to be apprised of
       developments with regard to these recommendations after the
       next meeting of the A.C.P.O. Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at
       Sporting Events. A meeting has been speedily arranged for
       Friday, 8th September, 1989 at Greater Manchester Police
       Force Headquarters.

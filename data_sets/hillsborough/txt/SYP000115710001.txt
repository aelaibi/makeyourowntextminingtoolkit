    Upon my.arrival               I saw at             least 20            plus    bodies a p p a r e n t l y dead on the,

    others       that were          injured            but     breathing.               I    shouted        to the         police

    o f f icers       inside      the       gate       on the        terracing              to    leave    the dead and

    I then 'Cook hold               of an         Inspector           and o r g a n i s e d a chain of                   policemen

    the     injured were            out we            then    co n t i n u e d to move              the dead         out     of the

    West     stand and          onto the              pitch.                   ,

    I recall          removing        both men,              w o m e n and        children who were a pp a r e n t l y

    about      the     pitch who were                  seriously           injured.

    It was a b s o l u t e        m a y h e m at this            time wit h many                  police      officers

    standing          around apparently                  not knowing              what       to do.

    I recall          being     given a y oung y o u t h at the                         gate        to the west            stand, 1

              dazed state.

             On r e a c h i n g the West Stand I saw polic e offi c e s throwing
             back       persons into            the crowd who were a p p a r e n t l y trying
             to get on the              pitch.         I b e l i e v e d t h a t t h i s w a s to q u e l l

             I    saw a white female's                    face p r e s s e d again st the         wire,
             her face         w a s b l u e . .1 f e l t          at t h a t    time I knew she was
             dead.        Rround        her     there were peoplescreaming,                     crying,
             sh o u t i n g pleas far           help.

             I joined the South                 Yorks pcs       on th e f e n c e a n d s h o u t e d at
             t h e c r o w d to        get back and began m o t i o n i n g            with my arm.
             D i s t r a u g h t p e o p l e i n t h e c r o w d w e r e c r y i n g , r e p l y i n g , "I
             can't move."                                                                    -----------
                                                                                                         A   /v-j
 I saw that         persons       were     Peing      Lifted      out    into     the     seats
 above ,

 I r e a l i s e d th at my e f f o r t s to        get        the    crowd back was
 futile, I then            walked along           the fence c o n v e r s i n g    with
 f o l k t r y i n g to c o m f o r t t h e m a n d a s k i n g t h e m to m o v e a w a y
 if t h e y p o s s i b l y c o u l d .

 I then        n o t i c e d a f t e r a s h o r t t i m e t h a t o n e of th e g a t e s
 had been opened.                   I   approached this gate             where         a few
 other       officers          stood.           F r o m inside the      crowd I was
 handed a youth wearing                     a Liverpool         shirt.         He w a s no
 o l d e r t h a n IB y e a r s , if t h a t .          I carried him a few yards
 onto the p itch and laid him down.                           His pulse was beating
 frantically             but     he    was not b r e a t h i n g .      I c a r r i e d out
 mouth-to-mouth.               He b e g a n to         breathe.     I to o k h o l d of a
 supporter           and     told him          to m o n i t o r  his b r e a t h i n g etc.
 A r o u n d me more b odie s            had been laid           out    so I m o v e d to
 another young white                  male      and together with a doctor                 I
 carried         out r e s u s c i t a t i o n     for    what    seemed       to     be   a
 considerable time                 in    tandem         before the      doctor        said,
 "It's no use, he's gone."

R person        Cnot     known)      said,      "I'LL     take     over."

I     s t o o d up an d        w a l k e d a r o u n d a n d it w a s t h e n I s a w t h e
e x t e n t of t h e c a t a s t r o p h y .         There were      numerous bodies
on       the    ground         in t h e p e n a l t y      area,    people who       were
injured         sat      or      lay about           virtually      being tended        by
t el I o w s u p p o r t e r s .

I went   to t h e a s s i s t a n c e of a st    John's Rmbulance              man
who  wa s t e n d i n g a m a n on the       ground     a n d a t t e m p t e d to
revive   him for        some time;         he   d i d no t r e s p o n d to m y
efforts.

I saw that per s o n s were                 standing around, doing nothing,
and more  bodie s/persons                   were being  c a r r i e d out of the
ground.

I approached            a     g r o u p of         obviously stunned             youths and
asked them            to a s s i s t      me       to c a r r y p e r s o n s to t h e S p i o n
Kop end.             Together with these tads                     1 carried 3 persons
across        the p i t c h on a d v e r t i s i n g b o a r d s and left s o m e o n e

I r e t u r n e d to    the   West Stand end               to      try and find      my
colleagues.             I   saw    5gt      BRRZENER          who       was    carrying
b o d i e s /persons      from the c rowd from a d i f f e r e n t gate              to
t h e o n e I. w a s   at a n d w e n t      to   his assistance.                Rlmost
immediately we were passed                  a young lad,              we carried him
onto the         pitch and      gave      him     m o u t h - t o - m o u t h and heart
massage.         R fter a w h i l e he b e g a n b r e a t h i n g again and         we
w e r e then r e l i e v e d by R m b u L a n c e sta f f but I'm not sure.

             Distraught          persons (relatives/friends)                    walked      about     the
             p i t c h in an     unconsotable state.

                      we      could       see police officers                 on    the  fence and a few

                      On r e a c h i n g the W e s t S t a n d I saw m a n y p o l i c e m e n t h r o w i n g
                      back persons               into      the crowd who were a p p a r e n t l y trying

                      directly behind               the goal       mouth I could see            that       many
                      people were being crushed and some were obviously dead.

                      1 i m m e d i a t e l y c l i m b e d onto the f e nce and         s h o u t e d to the

                      the west stand.
 I saw that the gates                   leading out          onto      the     Ditch were
 shut.          I c l i m b e d off the fence and r e q u e s t e d             to  match
 c o n t r o l v i a r a d i o to h a v e t h e g a t e s        opened and informed
 t h e m t h a t a s e r i o u s s i t u a t i o n was' d e v e l o p i n g .   The reply
 was, "res,           y e s . 11 T h e r e d i d n ' t a p p e a r   to      be any o t h e r
 t r a f f i c on the r a d i o        during this time.              Until the gates
 were opened            I     assisted fans           on     the    pitch       that were
 injured.

 Once the            gates       w e r e o p e n e d I a s s i s t e d in c a r r y i n g  out
 either         p e r s o n s w h o w e r e a p p a r e n t l y d e a d or i n j u r e d   and
 re nde red first aid where possible,                            oil,   those I carried
 from the t e r r a c i n g onto the p i tch I felt for a pulse and
 e i t h e r p l a c e d t h e m in t h e r e c o v e r y p o s i t i o n / g a v e     mouth-
 t o - m o u t h or h e a r t m a s s a g e .

Those that were alive I made                       s u r e w e r e Left      with  either
5t J o h n ' s A m b u l a n c e s t a f f or      another police            officer.

Once all          the b o d i e s were         removed  from the               g a t e to the
left  of        t h e g o a l at   the         West Stand I went               to t h e g a t e
directly        b e h i n d the goat.

Upon my arrival             I saw        at. l e a s t         20+    bodies apparently
dead on the          terracing and polic emen struggling                              to m o v e
them.        Behind        them were Liverpool supporters screaming
at       the  police stating                there         were      others        that     were
injured but breathing.                    I s h o u t e d to t h e p o l i c e o f f i c e r s
i n s i d e the g a t e on the           terracing               to l e a v e t h e d e a d a n d
concern       ourselves           with        those         that      were        alive     but
seriously injured.                 I then took             h o l d of an I n s p e c t o r a n d
organised a chain                of p o l i c e m e n      at t h i s g a t e in o r d e r to
c a r r y out t h e . i n j u r e d s u p p o r t e r s .      Once       all the injur ed
were out we         t h e n c o n t i n u e d to          m o v e the d e a d out of the
West S t a n d and onto the pitch.

I recall removing              both     men,    women      and      children       who    were
apparently dead.

There were         m a n y b o d i e s on the p i t c h       in t h e p e n a l t y area
and others         about the pitch who were                   seriously injured.

It w a s a b s o l u t e m a y h e m at     this         time with      many police
officers standing around                a p p a r e n t l y not k n o w i n g w h a t to
do.

I     recall being           given a young        y o u t h at t h e g a t e to t h e
West Stand, I carried him with pc                       w r l t o n onto the pitch
and       gave him mouth -to-mouth and                heart massage, shortly
after         he    began     breathing.          I      then      shouted   to   an
a m b u l a n c e m a n w h o r e l i e v e d us.

Once        all     the bodies were              out of   the       West      S t a n d I,
together with other                officers and         supporters, organised
carrying the dead              and i n j u r e d on a d v e r t i s i n g b o a r d s and
s t r e t c h e r s to t h e g y m n a s i u m .
Rt s o m e t i m e d u r i n g the c a t a s t r o p h y I r e c a l l the           Forest
fans     c h a n t i n g to th e L i v e r p o o l f a n s , w h i c h r e s u l t e d     in
the    Liverpool fans running                   towards        the     Spion Kop,           1
honestly believed             that s e r i o u s d i s o r d e r w o u l d arise and
I,   together           with   o t h e r o f f i c e r s , t r i e d f r a n t i c a l l y to
stop the L i v e r p o o l fans and L u c k i l y s u c c e e d e d .

This then resulted            in a      Line      of p o l i c e o f f i c e r s b e i n g
deployed         at  the    halfway         Line      to      prevent          further
confrontation.          I r e c a l l s e e i n g a n u m b e r of     d o g s on the
p i t c h n e a r to the S p i o n Kop.

□nee  order had              been established                I,       together with Pcs
HDRD and WRLTON,             t r i e d to c o n s o l e     many      of the d i s t r a u g h t
Liverpool fans.

S o m e time l a t e r an a n n o u n c e m e n t       W 3 5 m a d e to      the effect
the       match was        a b a n d o n e d an d s h o r t l y the c r o w d w o u l d be
asked        to  leave the             ground.          Rs     the r e s u l t of      this
m e s s a g e I, t o g e t h e r w i t h P c s H O R D a n d      WRLTON, went onto
the        Penniston Road            outside the Kop and              monitored         the
F o r e s t fans as they left.

There      were a  number             of s m a l l sporadic                   fights       between
rival     fans which were             quickly dealt with.

We Later     r e t u r n e d to th e         gymnasium           to     offer       assistance
but we w e r e not r e q u i r e d .

nil p o lic e o f f i c e s not c u r r e n t l y         deployed were then                  told
to      r e t u r n to Hillsborough into                   the  North  Stand                   for
d e b r i e f ing .

O n c o m p l e t i o n of t h e d e b r i e f I w a s i n s t r u c t e d to w r i t e a
full r e s u m e of           the above incid ent and s p e c i f i c a l l y what
part        we       played,-..          I  submitted        this          sheet     to a
S u p e r i n t e n d e n t a n d t h e n r e t u r n e d to N o t t i n g h a m HQ.

During.this incident I would estimate                               that     we    carried
a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 0 to 30       e i t h e r d e a d or s e r i o u s l y i n j u r e d
persons           from the West S t and onto the pitch and r e nde red
h e a r t m a s s a g e a n d m o u t h - t o - m o u t h to m a n y of t h e m .

I had no  idea            of     time  and        to the         best       of m y k n o w l e d g e
the  incidents             at    the West         Stand          are        chronoLogicaLly
correct .

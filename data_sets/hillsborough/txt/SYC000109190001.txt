            SEVENTY-THIRD DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                TUESDAY, 19th MARCH, 1991


     THE CORONER:   Good morning.   What I think I will
do is I will read Mr. Maxwell's submission.   Then we
will turn to Mr. Payne.

      This is then the submission submitted to me under a
covering letter by Keeble Hawson, and it is signed by Mr.
Maxwell on the 15th March, 1991.    It is headed,
"Inquests into the Deaths of the Victims of the
Hillsborough Football Stadium Disaster on the 15th April,
1989.    Submissions on behalf of Sheffield City Council."

"INTRODUCTION

1.   These submissions relate only to the possibility of
the Jury being directed to consider a verdict of unlawful
killing.   The submissions below are developed both
generally in order to make relevant submissions of law
and specifically with a view to showing that Sheffield
City Council and the Council's employees could not
possibly be regarded as persons who unlawfully killed any
of the deceased.   Sheffield City Council do not presume
to enter the debate that will no doubt arise as to
whether any other person, whether corporation or natural
human being, might, or might not, possibly be regarded as
one who unlawfully killed the deceased, and so far as
that issue goes Sheffield city Council take up a neutral
position.

POSSIBLE   BASIS FOR VERDICT OFUNLAWFUL KILLING

2.   For   the purpose of these Inquests a verdict of
unlawful killing would be justified if the Jury were
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that some person or
persons (whom the Jury must under no account name or
identify) had brought about the death of the deceased, or
some or any of them, as a result of committing the
offence of manslaughter.   It would be improper to direct
the Jury to consider the possibility of a verdict of
unlawful killing based upon the offence of murder having
been committed, as there is no evidence at all to show
that anyperson caused the death of the deceased through
some unlawful act or that any person intended to kill or
to cause grievous bodily harm.    Neither the actus reus
nor the mens rea of murder is established on the evidence
before this Jury.

3.   If the Jury are to be directed to consider a verdict
of unlawful killing on the basis that any or some or all
                                               MR. MAXWELL


of the deceased died as a consequence of manslaughter
then the Jury must be warned in terms that they are being
directed to consider whether a criminal offence of
manslaughter has been committed.   They must be given the
appropriate direction as to the standard of proof for
manslaughter, and the appropriate direction is the simple
one that they should be satisfied beyond all reasonable
doubt or, as sometimes said, satisfied so that they are
sure that all the necessary elements of the offence are
proved;  and that the verdict of unlawful killing must
not be returned unless they are satisfied beyond all
reasonable doubt that such elements are proved.    When
directions are given as to any other verdict that may be
brought in, eg accident/misadventure or open, it should
be stressed that a different standard of proof applies
viz, proof on a balance of probabilities, with an
appropriate explanation of what that means and how that
differs from the criminal standard of proof.

4.   So far as the offence of manslaughter goes there is
no question of any of the deceased having been killed as
a result of an unlawful act.   For these purposes an
unlawful act is one which is unlawful for souie reason
other than the negligent manner of its performance.    The
Jury should not, therefore, be directed to consider the
possibility of any person having killed the deceased or
any of them as a result of an unlawful act.    Involuntary
manslaughter of that form could not possibly form the
basis for a verdict of unlawful killing.

5.   The question is whether the Jury should be directed
to consider a verdict of unlawful killing based upon
reckless manslaughter, that is to say, to consider
whether the Jury are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that some person or persons (whom they must under no
account name) has brought about the death of any or some
or all of the deceased as a result of recklessness.   It
is not necessary, and it will be unhelpful and confusing,
to direct the Jury to consider 'gross negligence
manslaughter'.

FIRST ELEMENT OF RECKLESS MANSLAUGHTER - CAUSATIVE
CONDUCT

6.   If the Jury are to consider whether some specific
individual committed the offence of reckless manslaughter
then the Jury have to consider firstly whether that
person by his conduct, ie, some act or omission to act
(where there was a duty to act), was a substantial cause
of the death of any or some of all of the deceased.    In
order to prove causation the following matters must be
established:
                                               MR. MAXWELL


     (i)    that but for the conduct of the person under
            consideration the death of the deceased would
            not have occurred.

     (ii)   that although the conduct of the person under
            consideration need not be the sole or the main
            cause of death it must be a substantial cause.

     (iii) that where the conduct of the person under
           consideration was performed prior to the 15th
           April 1989 then a subsequent and intervening
           act which causes death breaks the chain of
           causation if that intervening act is not
           foreseeable; and that this means that such
           prior conduct is not, in law, to be regarded
           as a substantial cause of such subsequent
           event.    This is consistent with the Jury's
           function of establishing how the deceased came
           by his death since the Jury are there
           concerned to find out what circumstances are
           directly responsible for the death of the
           deceased.    Such an intervening and
           unforeseeable act prevents any prior
           circumstances, by way of earlier acts or
           omissions, from being directly responsible for
           subsequent death.

(b)  It is submitted on behalf of Sheffield City Council
that no reasonable Jury properly directed could possibly
conclude:

     (i)    that but for the conduct of the Sheffield City
            Council, or any of its employees, the deaths
            would not have occurred.

     (ii)   That any conduct of the Sheffield City Council
            or any of its employees was a substantial
            cause of death.

     (iii) That the events occurring at the ground on the
           15th April 1989 from 2.30 pm onwards were
           foreseeable.   The events referred to are the
           sudden introduction of a large number of fans
           en masse into an area of the terraces which
           was already crowded and full.   On the
           contrary, no reasonable Jury properly directed
           could find that such events were foreseeable
           by Sheffield City Council or any of its
           employees or that any chain of causation which
           might otherwise have been established by any
           prior conduct on the part of Sheffield City
           Council was other than broken.
                                                           4

                                               MR. MAXWELL


(c) Accordingly as a matter of law the Jury should not be
directed to consider the conduct of Sheffield City Council
or any of its employees in the context of any verdict of
unlawful killing based upon involuntary reckless
manslaughter.

(d) If the submission at (c) is rejected, then the Jury
must be properly directed to consider the issue of
causation in the specific context of the conduct of
Sheffield City Council and be given full instructions to
the relevant criteria to be applied i.e. as per (b) above,
but amplified as necessary.

SECOND ELEMENT OF RECKLESS MANSLAUGHTER - MENTAL ELEMENT

7.   The second matter to be considered is the mental
element involved in reckless manslaughter.  So far as this
mental element is concerned the appropriate direction is
that known as the Lawrence Direction which is to be found
in the following passage of the speech of lord Diplock in
R.-v-Lawrence 1982 A.C. 510 at 526E to 527B as follows:

    'Recklessness on the part of the doer of an act does
    presuppose that there is something in the
    circumstances that would have drawn the attention of
    an ordinary prudent individual to the possibility
    that his act was capable of causing the kind of
    serious harmful consequences that the section which
    creates the offence was intended to prevent, and that
    the risk of those harmful consequences occurring was
    not so slight that an ordinary prudent individual
    would feel justified in treating them as negligible.
    It is only when this is so that the doer of the act
    is acting 'recklessly' if before doing the act, he
    either fails to give any thought to the possibility
    of there being any such risk or, having recognised
    that there was such risk, he nevertheless goes on to
    do it.

    In my view, an appropriate instruction to the Jury of
    what is meant by driving recklessly would be that
    they must be satisfied of two things:

    First, that the defendant was in fact driving the
    vehicle in such a manner as to create an obvious and
    serious risk of causing physical injury to some other
    person who might happen to be using the road or of
    doing substantial damage to property; and

    Second, that in driving in that manner the defendant
    did so without having given any thought to the
    possibility of there being any such risk or, having
    recognised that there was some risk involved, had
    nonetheless gone on to take it.
                                                       MR. MAXWELL


     It is for the Jury to decide whether the risk created
     by the manner in which the vehicle was being driven
     was both obvious and serious and, in deciding that,
     they might apply the standard of the ordinary prudent
     motorist as represented by themselves.

     If satisfied that an obvious and serious risk was
     created by the manner of the defendant's driving, the
     Jury are entitled to infer that he was in one or
     other of the states of mind required to constitute
     the offence and will probably do so; but regard must
     be given to any explanation he gives as to his state
     of mind which may displace the inference.'

A practical application of the Lawrence Direction can be
seen in action in R.-v-Seymour 1983 2 A.C. 4 9 3 . The
importance of t h i s d e c i s i o n is that Lord Diplock was a
member of the Court and he (and all their Lordships)
agreed with the speech of Lord Roskill.            In the speech of
Lord Roskill at page 504C to 504G appears the following:

     'The learned judge rejected the submission and gave
     the 'Lawrence Direction' subject only to the omission
     of any reference to the 'obvious and serious risk ...
     of doing substantial damage to property' see R.-v-
     Lawrence (Stephen) [1982] A.C. 510, 526.   In my view,
     he was entirely right not to refer to damage to
     property, a reference to which was irrelevant in this
     case and might well have confused the Jury.   His
     admirably clear direction not only properly reflected
     the decision of this House in Lawrence but also Lord
     Atkin's speech in Andrews [1937] A.C. 576.   I quote
     the relevant passages:

     'The second question you have to decide; was the
     driving that caused those injuries reckless?  If so,
     then it is manslaughter.  If you are not satisfied
     that it was reckless, then the verdict is not guilty.
     To amount to reckless driving mere negligence is not
     enough.  His conduct must go beyond the question of
     compensation between citizens and amount to, in your
     view, criminal conduct requiring punishment.  You
     have to be satisfied upon the question of
     recklessness that he drove in such a manner as to
     create an obvious and serious risk of causing
     physical harm to some other person who might happen
     to be using the road at the time ....  Once you are
     satisfied that the manner of his driving was such as
     to create an obvious and serious risk of causing
     physical harm to a person using the road at the time,
     you also have to be satisfied that driving in that
     manner he did so without having given any thought to
     the possibility of there being any such risk, or
     alternatively, having recognised that there was some
                                               MR. MAXWELL


     risk involved, nonetheless went on to take it; in
     other words, he was reckless.  He reckoned not of the
     consequences.

     In determining the quality of his driving, you apply
     the standards of the ordinary reasonable motorist.
     You, of course, take into account all the evidence
     including his explanation ...."'

A suggested direction?

The passage last quoted can be adapted as appropriate to
the context of any specific person, whether corporation or
natural human being, whose conduct the Jury are directed
to consider for the purposes of deciding whether that
person committed reckless manslaughter.  The passage
quoted from Lord Roskill's speech presupposes that the
Jury have concluded that the issue of causation is proved.
The adaptation of this passage of speech might be on the
following lines:

     'if you are satisfied so as to be sure that the first
    question is proved that is to say that the act of X
    was a substantial cause of the death of any of the
    deceased then the second question you have to decide
    is was the act that caused those deaths reckless?   If
    so then it is manslaughter.   If you are not satisfied
    that it was reckless then a verdict of unlawful
    killing is not open to you.   To amount to a reckless
    act mere negligence is not enough.   His conduct must
    go beyond the question of compensation between
    citizens and amount to, in your view, criminal
    conduct requiring punishment.   You have to be
    satisfied upon the question of recklessness that he
    acted in such a manner as to create an obvious and
    serious risk of causing physical harm to some other
    person who might happen to be using the terraces at
    the time.   Once you are satisfied that his act was
    such as to create an obvious and serious risk of
    causing physical harm to a person using the terraces
    at the time you also have to be satisfied that acting
    in that manner he did so without having given any
    thought to the possibility of there being any such
    risk, or alternatively having recognised that there
    was some risk involved nonetheless went on to take
    it; in other words he was reckless.   He reckoned not
    of the consequences. In determining the quality of
    his act you apply the standards of the ordinary
    reasonable person who happened to be in the same
    circumstances as X. You of course take into account
    all the evidence including his explanation ....'
Lord Roskill added at 508C that it is appropriate also to
point out that in order to constitute the offence of
manslaughter the risk of death being caused must be very
high, and such a remark should be made to the Jury here.
Lord Roskill said:

      'I would therefore answer the certified question as
      follows: 'Where manslaughter is charged and the
      circumstances are that the victim was killed as a
      result of the reckless driving of the defendant on a
      public highway, the trial judge should give the Jury
      the direction suggested in R. -v- Lawrence but it is
      appropriate also to point out that in order to
      constitute the offence of manslaughter the risk of
      death being caused by the manner of the defendant's
      driving must be very high.'

In deciding whether or not a risk was obvious the Jury should
have regard to whether the risk would have been obvious to an
ordinary prudent individual in the relevant circumstances.
The Jury should be told that they may take account of what
any witness has told them was obvious or not to that witness
as a risk. The witnesses' perception of the risk can provide
an indication of whether or not the risk was obvious to an
ordinary prudent person, and especially so if the Jury
conclude that the witness in question was such an ordinary
prudent person. For this purpose 'witness' includes a person
whose conduct has been called into question at the Inquest
and Lord Roskill made it clear that a Jury can take into
account an explanation given by such a person.

It is important to stress to the Jury that a failure to
appreciate that there was such a risk would not by itself be
sufficient to amount to recklessness see Rea -v- West London
Coroner ex parte Gray 1988 1 Queen's Bench page 477B per Lord
Justice Watkins:

      'He deliberately chose to run the risk by doing nothing
      about it. It should be emphasised, however, that a
      failure to appreciate that there was such a risk would
      not by itself be sufficient to amount to recklessness.'
FURTHER RELEVANT MATTERS;

(1)      PRIMA FACIE CASE

8.     The Jury should only be directed to consider a verdict
of unlawful killing based upon reckless manslaughter if the
Coroner concludes as a matter of law that there is a |>rima
facie, that is to say, a case fit to be left to the Jury
where the Coroner concludes, as a matter of law, that a
reasonable Jury properly directed might bring in such a
verdict. If the Coroner concludes, as a matter of law, that
                                                    MR. MAXWRT.T.


there is no such case fit to be left to the Jury then the
Coroner must direct the Jury not to consider that verdict,
that is, he must withdraw the verdict from them.

(ii)    INDIVIDUAL CONSIDERATION - THE DECEASED

9.     The death of each deceased must be considered
individually. Before the Jury may be invited to consider a
verdict of unlawful killing in respect of any of the deceased
the Coroner must direct himself as to whether or not there is
a prima facie case so far as that individual deceased is
concerned.

A verdict in the case of each deceased is required and if
unlawful killing is to be left to the Jury it must be
considered by the Jury in relation to each of the deceased.
The Jury should be directed that if, having considered the
circumstances of death affecting each of the individual
deceased, they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that
some or all of them may be considered as a group of persons
whose death was caused as a result of reckless manslaughter
committed by some specific individual or individuals (who
must under no account be named or identified), then similar
verdicts may be returned in the case of each member of such
group. There will, therefore, be 95 verdicts but some or all
may be in similar terms.

However, the Jury must be directed that it is improper to
consider unlawful killing in relation to the 95 deceased as •
whole or to any group of the deceased without first
considering the individual circumstances of the death of each
particular deceased. The Jury must be warned that no short
cut is available to them permitting them to proceed on the
presumption that they are entitled to consider the
circumstances of death of the 95 deceased as a whole, or of
any group of the deceased as a group, unless some cause is
shown why they should not do so. That would reverse the
order in which relevant consideration should be dealt with.
They are concerned with the Inquests, relating to the death£
of the victims of the Hillsborough Football Stadium disaster.
There is no presumption that a verdict in common form is
applicable to the 95 deceased persons. Only after a careful
consideration of each individual case can the Jury establish
what verdict is appropriate.

(iii)   NO AGGREGATION

10.    The Jury must be directed that they can return a
verdict of unlawful killing only if they can attribute the
ingredients of the relevant offence, reckless manslaughter,
to some individual person or persons whom they should on no
account name or otherwise identify:
                                                    MR. MAXWBT.T.


Regina -v- West London Coroner ex parte Gray 1988 1 Queen's
Bench page 477B. In this context the Jury should consider
the position of each single person who may be a candidate
taking each such person in turn and coming to a conclusion.

In this context the Jury must be warned that whatever person
is being considered (and be that person a corporation or a
natural human being) the ingredients of manslaughter must be
established by proving the necessary mens rea (mental
element) and actus reus (criminal conduct) of manslaughter
against it or him by evidence properly to be relied on
against it or him and a case against any person cannot be
fortified by evidence against another person. No aggregation
of criminal culpability is permitted.

(iv)   ORDER OF PRIORITY IN CONSIDERING VERDICT

11.    If unlawful killing is to be left to the Jury as a
possible verdict then the Coroner should indicate to the Jury
that they must deal with that issue first; and that they
should approach, therefore, initially the question whether or
not they are satisfied so that they are sure beyond a
reasonable doubt that the verdict of unlawful killing may be
returned in respect of any or some or all of the deceased.
If they conclude that unlawful killing is not an appropriate
verdict, or are not sure that it is an appropriate verdict,
in the case of any or some or all of the deceased then they
should go on to consider other possible verdicts, ie
accident/misadventure or open verdict. Support for this is
to be found in Regina -v- Wolverhampton Coroner ex parte
McCurbin 1990 1 Weekly Law Reports page 728B-D:

  'It is true that, in many cases where it is open to a
  Coroner's Jury to find a verdict of unlawful killing,
  they may also have to consider the question of death by
  misadventure. However, in my view, this does not and
  should not give rise to problems. The Coroner should
  indicate to the Jury that they should approach,
  initially, the question as to whether or not they are
  satisfied so that they are sure that this is unlawful
  killing. If they come to the conclusion that it is not
  unlawful killing, they are not satisfied so that they
  are sure that the verdict is appropriate, then they
  will consider the question of misadventure and, in so
  doing, they do not need to bear in mind the heavy
  standard of proof which is required for unlawful
  killing. They can approach the matter on the basis of
  the balance of probabilities. The situation is that,
  just as it is important that a jury should not bring in
  a verdict of suicide unless they are sure, likewise
  they should not bring in a verdict of unlawful killing
  unless they are sure.'

SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL

12. The Jury have heard a variety of criticisms of
different persons and such criticisms have been voiced
wholly or mainly in cross-examination. Representation
of certain persons whose conduct was likely to be called
into question has been permitted.   One of those persons,
legal persons, is the Sheffield City Council.

In the case of any such person whose conduct has been
called into question then, unless a reasonable Jury
properly directed could conclude that such person committed
the offence of manslaughter against any or all or some of
the deceased, the Jury must be directed in terms either
(1) to exclude that person from their consideration of
the issue whether or not they are satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that the verdict of unlawful killing
is appropriate or (2) to consider such a verdict only
in the case of some other person or persons (who should
be named in the direction but not of course in the verdict)
and not to consider such a verdict in the case of any other
person.
The reasons for discriminating in this way are:-

(a) For reasons of justice and humanity there should be
no question of any risk arising that a verdict of unlawful
killing, where the Jury are forbidden to'aame any culprit,
might be understood in the context of the evidence to
refer to one or more of those persons whose conduct was
called into question at the Inquest, but in respect of whoa
no reasonable Jury properly directed could conclude that
such person had committed the offence of manslaughter.
Such a risk does arise where there have been criticism
of and suggestions, express or implied, of negligence
against a variety of persons; and all the more so where
the verdict of unlawful killing involves a finding of
recklessness which the Jury and the public may be at risk
of confusing with negligence. There must be no risk of
those who are innocent of criminal culpability being
caught up with any whom the Jury may regard as criminally
responsible.

(b) The converse to (a) is also true, namely that, in the
case of a person whose conduct the Jury are rightly scruti­
nising to see whether they are satisfied so as to be sure
that such conduct is criminal, any allegations against
or criticism of any other person might give rise to
prejudice. Such a risk does arise where the Jury may be
tempted to aggregate fault.
(c) Without discrimination and exclusion of persons who
ought not to be regarded as candidates in terms of
criminal culpability there is a risk that the Jury may be
confused by an unnecessarily and erroneously wide choice
of candidates.
                                        MR. MAXWELL



13. No reasonable Jury properly directed could find
that Sheffield City Council, or any employee or agent
of Sheffield City Council whether it be Mr. Butler or
Mr. Bownes or anyone else employed by Sheffield City
Council, has or have committed any offence of
manslaughter. The Jury should be directed accordingly,
with an instruction that as a matter of law there is no
evidence on which the Jury could find that any of those
persons committed any such offence. The Jury should
be told in terms that quite apart from the difficulties
relating to the issue of causation (as Paragraph 6 above):

(i) There is no evidence on which any reasonable Jury
could find that any of such persons acted in a manner
so as to create an obvious and serious risk of causing
physical injury to any football fan or fans.

(ii) There is no evidence on which any reasonable
Jury could find that any of such persons acted recklessly,
having regard to the definition of such term as above.

(iii) Specifically in the case of Sheffield City Council
no verdict of corporate manslaughter could possibly be
established here; and any verdict that Sheffield City
Council committed the offence of manslaughter would be
unreasonable and improper. No further direction is needed
but if it was thought desirable to amplify such direction
then the appropriate indication would be that for a
corporation to be criminally liable for manslaughter then
it is required that the mens rea (alternatively the
mental element of recklessness) and the actus reus
(alternatively the conduct complained of) comprised in
the alleged offence of manslaughter should be established
not against those who acted for or in the name of the
corporation but against those who were to be identified
as the embodiment of the corporation itself. Neither
Mr. Bownes nor Mr. Butler nor anyone else referred to at
the Inquest could properly be regarded as the embodiment
of the Council. No sustainable case in manslaughter
arises here against Sheffield City Council.

      I have also had a letter which I will read out from
Reynolds, Quarter, Chamberlain who are the solicitors rep­
resenting Eastwood and Partners and I will read this letter
as well because it fits in at this stage. It is dated the
18th of March and after the usual headings and so on it
says:
      "Dear Sir,
      Hillsborough Resumed Inquests
      You will recall that we are instructed on behalf
of Eastwood and Partners.
      We have been considering with our clients whether
it is necessary for submissions to be made on their behalf
to you prior to your summing-up of the evidence to the
jury.
      We have had the opportunity of considering the
written submissions to be made on behalf of Sheffield
City Council.
      The submissions which we would seek to make on our
client's behalf to you are the same as those made on behalf
of Sheffield City Council.
      Therefore, in order   to save the time and costs of
the Court from what would   amount to repetition, we adopt
on behalf of our client's   the submissions made on behalf
of Sheffield City Council   insofar as they apply to our
clients.
      We trust that you have no objection to this but if
you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact
us."
      I have not contacted them, but I have no objection
either.
                                        MR. PAYNE



      I have a letter from Mr. Hale. I think I will read
that later when I have had a moment to read it properly.
Mr. Payne?

      MR. PAYNE: Sir, I have already submitted a written
version of the submissions which I am hoping to be able
to make and I said when I put it in that I would be
grateful for the opportunity to amplify it and moderate
it and that is what I hope to be able to do.

      I have distributed copies to some people but those
who have not got a copy there is one here available now.

      Now sir I have addressed first of all the question
how and it appears that the meaning of the word "how" in
this context directs the Coroner to consider what acts
and omissions are directly responsible for the deaths.

      I have referred at various points in this note
to the text book Jervis and I have given the reference
there which I am sure you are very familiar with. If
you would like me to look at it? Yes. That paragraph
comes from paragraph 15.19. This is in the chapter dealing
with "Witnesses" and at 15.19 at the bottom of the page
the Editors say:

      "In exercising the right to examine a witness
      regard must be had to the inquisitorial nature
      of the proceedings. An Inquest is not a trial."

Then there is a quotation from a judgment of Mr. Justice
Griffiths in the Hammersmith Coroner case and then the
narrative goes on:

      "Indeed it should be noted that the Coroner has
      a positive duty to disallow any question which
      he considers to be not relevant or otherwise
      not a proper question."

I am just reading this to get the context.

     "As for relevance the proceedings in evidence
     must be directed solely to ascertaining who
     the deceased was, how, when and where the
     deceased came by his death and the registration
     particulars."
Of course that is an extract from the Coroners' Rules,
1984 Rule 36. Then the narrative goes on:

      “Neither the Coroner nor the jury must express
      any opinion on any other matters. How the
      deceased came by his death is of course wider
      than merely finding the medical cause of death
                                        MR. PAYNE



      and it is therefore right and proper that the
      Coroner should enquire into acts and omissions
      which are directly responsible for the death."

And then it goes on with the familiar injunction:

      "Although no verdict may be framed so as to
      appear to determine any question of criminal
      liability by named person or civil liability
      generally, the fact that there may be
      subsequent proceedings, criminal or civil,
      should not deter the Coroner from making an
      adequate investigation into the facts so far
      as they are material to the Inquest."

Sir, out of that passage the material words to define the
"how" appear halfway down the paragraph:

      "The Coroner should enquire into acts and
      omissions which are directly responsible for
      the death."




                       Then I go on to deal with
                                                MR. PAYNE


     Then I go on to deal with verdict.    Now I have
taken the liberty of identifying what appear to be the
only three available candidates for verdicts and I do not
intend to address ray submissions to any other possible
verdict, unless anyone says anything to the contrary.
It appears to us that the available verdicts which fall
for consideration are three in number, namely, number
one, misadventure, also described as accident.    In the
Portsmouth Coroner case, of which the reference is there,
it is said that there is no practical distinction between
those two words, as you know.    It does not matter
whether it is called misadventure or accident.

     The second possible category is unlawful killing and
the only aspect of that which I have addressed is
involuntary manslaughter.   That will come later in this
submission.

     The third option, if neither of those is proved, is
an open verdict.   Open verdict is dealt with in Jervis
at 16.19.   That paragraph helpfully says:

     "If there is insufficient evidence to record any of
     the other suggested verdicts, an open verdict may be
     recorded.    It should be noted than an open verdict
     is thus only to be used in the last resort if there
     is insufficient evidence to enable the Coroner or
     the Jury to reach one of the other verdicts.
     Furthermore, the fact that there may be uncertainty
     as to other parts of the inquisition, for example,
     as to the precise cause, time or place of death,
     does not authorise recording an open verdict if
     there is sufficient evidence to record how the
     deceased came by his death.    In other words, the
     Coroner or Jury should not fail to reach a positive
     verdict merely because there is some doubt on some
     minor point.    It is therefore wrong if there is
     evidence that the deceased committed suicide to
     return an open verdict on the mere ground that it is
     uncertain whether the balance of his mind was
     disturbed."

I am sorry for reading that last sentence.   However, the
rest of it is quite helpful in indicating that an open
verdict is a last resort.

     Paragraph 3 in my submissions, I have entitled it
"Burden of Proof."    That ought to be changed to
"Standard of Proof," and the standard is set out there.
It is different for the different verdicts.    For
misadventure, or accident, the standard is the balance of
probabilities and that is to be found in the Gray case at
that reference.    For unlawful killing the standard is
beyond reasonable doubt and that is to be found in the
                                                 MR. PAYNE


Wolverhampton Coroner case and it is also to be found in
Gray.

     Finally, an open verdict.   Now that is quite an
interesting comment, which I have just read in Jervis
about that:

     "An open verdict would be appropriate if neither of
     those was proved and that would include, for
     example, if unlawful killing were to be proved on a
     balance of probabilities, but not beyond reasonable
     doubt."

     Paragraph 4 - 1 turn to what has to be proved.    For-
misadventure on the balance of probabilities, what has to
be proved is that there was some deliberate, lawful,
human act, which has unexpectedly taken a turn which
leads to death, or an unintended act, and probably an
unintended act does not apply, so for misadventure the
definition seems to be, in our submission, that first
sentence under my sub-heading.   That comes from Jervis
at paragraph 16.15.  At 16.15, under the sub-heading
"Accident/Misadventure", the editors say this:

     "No distinction is drawn between accident and
     misadventure in the verdict.    It is sometimes
     suggested that accident connotes something over
     which there is no human control, or an unintended
     act; while misadventure indicates some deliberate
     but lawful human act which has unexpectedly taken a
     turn that leads to death.    Even if this distinction
     exists in logic it is clear that Coroners have not
     observed it in practice and accordingly for
     statistical purposes the verdicts are treated as
     being the same.

So the editor here is looking at the distinction between
accident and misadventure, but helpfully in that context
he gives a definition, which we adopt, of what is meant
by accident or misadventure, and for the purpose of this
case it boils down to that phrase in the middle of that
paragraph, "...misadventure indicates some deliberate but
lawful human act which has unexpectedly taken a turn that
leads to death."

     Sir, that being the definition of misadventure, one
can perhaps hear echoes right through the case which
reflect the phrase that I have just read.

     I go on under 4.2, "What has to be proved", and I
now turn to what has to be proved for unlawful killing,
remembering that it has to be beyond reasonable doubt.
Now these sub-headings are a digest of what appears in
the authorities, so I am going to turn in a moment to
                                                 MR. PAYNE


actually look at the authorities, but what follows is
extracted from them.  These are the points which it
appears to us have to be proved:   (a) a particular
individual had the duty of regarding the health and
welfare of the deceased;  (b) that individual failed to
do in the circumstances what he ought to have done for
the health and welfare of the deceased;   (c) that the
failure was a substantial cause of the deceased's death
and (d) that in acting or failing to act for the benefit
of the deceased's health and welfare, that individual
acted recklessly, where recklessly means an obvious and
serious risk to the health and welfare of the deceased to
which the particular individual, having regard to his
duty, was indifferent or that recognising that risk to be
present he deliberately chose to run the risk by doing
nothing about it, and further where failure to appreciate
that there was such a risk would not by itself be
sufficient to amount to recklessness.

     Now there is a tremendous concentration of concepts
in those words, but it appears to us that the words that
are central and have to be addressed are the word
"reckless," the word, "obvious," and the word,
"indifferent," reckless being the main word and obvious
and indifference being aspects of recklessness.

     Now, sir, to see how one gets to that position, can
I ask you to go briefly through the folder which we have
submitted earlier, to trace how this situation has
arisen?   May I preface this short exercise by saying
that at the conclusion of my submission I am going to ask
you, sir, to look at the directions of Mr. Justice Turner
in the Zeebrugge case in which, as will be seen, he
refers to aspects of these authorities that I am now
going to ask you to look at so that the purpose of the
present exercise is just to lay out the field on which
Mr. Justice Turner then marched for his Judgment.

     Sir, if you have the blue folder.    The first
authority is at blue divider card number 2.    This is the
case of Andrews and the Director of Public Prosecutions.
Sir, you will of course know already that a number of
these references have already been touched on by
Mr. Maxwell in his submissions, so I apologise for
repetition.   I intend to keep it brief and to the point.
Andrews, a very early dangerous driving case in 1937, but
the relevant passages which are then echoed down the
years are in the Judgment of Lord Atkin which begins for
this purpose at page 45, and sir, perhaps you will find
at the top of page 45, April 22nd, Lord Atkin", and the
relevant passage is about half way down the page:

     "Of all crimes manslaughter appears to afford most
     difficulties of definition, for it concerns homicide
                                                 MR. PAYNE


     in so many and so varying conditions.   From the
     early days, when any homicide involved penalty, the
     law has gradually evolved 'through successive
     differentiations and integrations' until it
     recognises murder on the one hand, based mainly,
     through no exclusively, on an intention to kill, and
     manslaughter on the other hand, based mainly, though
     no exclusively, on the absence of intention to kill
     but with the presence of an element of
     'unlawfulness which is the elusive factor.    In the
     present case it is only necessary to consider
     manslaughter from the point of view of an
     unintentional killing caused by negligence, that is,
     the omission of a duty to take care.

     I do not propose to discuss the development of this
     branch of the subject as treated in the successive
     treatises of Coke, Hale, Foster and East, and in the
     judgments of the Courts to be found either in
     directions to juries by individual Judges, or in the
     more considered pronouncements of the body of Judges
     which preceded the formal Court of Crow Cases
     Reserved."

I am going to skip a big passage here, directing my
submissions to what appears to be material, and go to the
bottom of page 47, where he having said what he is not
going to refer to, and then referring to authority he
reaches these conclusions:

     "The principle to be observed is that cases of
     manslaughter in driving motor-cars are but instances
     of a general rule applicable to all charges of
     homicide by negligence.    Simple lack of care such
     as will constitute civil liability is not enough.
     For purposes of the criminal law there are degrees
     of negligence, and a very high degree of negligence
     is required to be proved before the felony is
     established.   Probably of all the epithets that can
     be applied 'reckless' most nearly covers the case.
     It is difficult to visualise a case of death caused
     by 'reckless' driving in the connotation of that
     term in ordinary speech which would not justify a
     conviction of manslaughter.    But it is probably not
     all-embracing, for 'reckless' suggests an
     indifference to risk, whereas the accused may have
     appreciated the risk and intended to avoid it and
     yet shown such a high degree of negligence in the
     means adopted to avoid the risk as would justify a
     conviction."

Now that is a passage which has subsequently found its
way into Lawrence, or largely found its way into
Lawrence, and may I ask you to go on now to divider card
                                                  MR. PAYNE


number 3 - Caldwell - just to touch briefly, and this is
a precursor, of course, to Lawrence, to touch briefly on
what Lord Diplock said at page 967.   At "a" he says:

     "In my opinion, a person charged with an offence
     under S 1(1) of the 1971 Act is 'reckless as to
     whether or not any property would be destroyed or
     damaged' if (1) he does an act which in fact creates
     an obvious risk that property will be destroyed or
     damaged and (2) when he does the act he either has
     not given any thought to the possibility of there
     being any such risk or has recognised that there was
     some risk involved and has nonetheless gone on to do
     it.   That would be a proper direction to the
     jury;..

Now with that passage, which is of historical interest
only now, I go on to Lawrence, which is the next divider
card, number 4, and straight to the direction which has
subsequently been said is to be the one which is to be
used in cases of manslaughter, which is at the last page
of the Judgment which is the fifth A.4 page in the
Lawrence photocopy, in which the other Lords of Appeal
say they agree with the Judgment.   On the left hand page
he says:

     "I turn now to the mens r e a ..." Now this is a
passage which Mr. Maxwell has copied out in the course of
his submission, so I enquire, sir, whether you would like
me to read it out?   The relevant passage goes from e
down to j.




         THE CORONER:   No, it is not necessary
                                                  MR. PAYNE


     THE CORONER:   No, it is not necessary.

     MR. PAYNE:   You will appreciate, perhaps I can just
pick out the salient points.  He talks about the ordinary
prudent individual, that is the character we have got to
have in mind, and we have got to have the ordinary prudent
individual in mind, in the circumstances and at the time
of the person whose conduct is being "called into
question".

     Sir, I go on then, without taking time on that
direction, to ask you then to look briefly at Seymour,
which is only interesting for the point that Mr. Maxwell,
I think, has already made, although he called it an
illustration, I think, that in Seymour the House of Lords
held that the Lawrence Direction should be given where the
charge is manslaughter, and that appears at page 501D, for
what it is worth - I should not, of course, say that about
the House of Lords.  It is in the course of the judgment
of Lord Fraser, where he rejects a submission that was
made by Counsel that the direction in Lawrence should not
be given in its entirety where the charge is one of
manslaughter, and he says that that submission is not well
founded.  He goes on to say:

     "If any modification of the 'Lawrence direction' is
     appropriate in a case where manslaughter alone is
     charged, it would be to add a warning to the jury
     that before convicting of manslaughter they must be
     satisfied that the risk of death being caused by the
     manner of the accused's driving was very high.   Such
     a direction will, of course, always be necessary
     where the common law crime and statutory offence are
     charged alternatively, but where ... the common law
     crime is charged alone, it may be unnecessary and
     inappropriate".

So what the House of Lords was saying in Seymour, as you
know, sir, is that the Lawrence direction should be given
in its entirety, possibly plus that further phrase at page
501E in the judgment of Lord Fraser.  Sir, is that
helpful?

     I go on now to Kong Cheuk Kwan which is at divider 6,
and this is just another illustration that the model
direction in Lawrence should be given in cases of
involuntary manslaughter.  Sir, I say no more about it, it
is in the folder, and I now go on to the case of Gray
which has got particular application to this case, and is
a modern illustration of the way in which the Lawrence
Direction works and this is towards the back of the bundle
at divider card number 9.
                                                  MR. PAYNE


     Sir, you will be familiar with the facts of thiscase
which are set out in the headnote.   It is a case where a
man died at a Police Station.  The Jury Foreman, in
returning the verdict of unlawful killing, added the
words, "... as a result of the degree of care given to him
after he was overpowered". There was a mix up about
whether those words were said or not because they were not
recorded.  There was an application for a Judicial Review
and the Divisional Court, having heard the case, in the
course of the judgment of Lord Justice Watkins gave
directions which are of general application and which are
quite helpful in this case, so  I turn to those directions
which are at the sixth page of  the A4 copying - I am sorry
that the numbering has not come out.   The reference for
the note is at page 467G-477B, and the paragraph G begins:

     "Other criticisms have also been voiced

and I read this paragraph and then a little way down the
next page:

     "... have also been voiced as to this all important
     direction but I have, I think, said enough to
     indicate that the jury were gravely misdirected and
     cannot have been otherwise than confused by what they
     were told about this branch of the law and, of
     course, by what they had read from the notes which
     were handed n to them."

Now, here come the directions which he frames:

     "This by itself must it seems to me inevitably cause
     the jury's verdict to be quashed.  What the jury
     should have been told was that when considering
     manslaughter by neglect they would have to be
     satisfied upon the evidence of these four ingredients
     of the offence."

I just dwell for a moment, "... satisfied upon the
evidence of these four ingredients       because this is
something which is very substantially echoed by Mr.
Justice Turner in his Zeebrugge directions.  The first
ingredient:

    "(1) a Police Officer had the duty of regarding the
    health and welfare of Mikkelsen. (2) He failed to do
    what in the circumstances he ought to have done for
    the health and welfare of Mikkelsen. (3) That his
    failure was a substantial cause of Mikkelsen's
    death.(4) That in failing to act for the benefit of
    Mikkelsen's health and welfare he acted recklessly.
    It should be explained that to act recklessly means
    that there was an obvious and serious risk to the
    health and welfare of Mikkelsen to which that police
                                                   MR. PAYNE


      officer having regard to his duty was indifferent or,
      recognising that risk to be present, he deliberately
      chose to run the risk by doing nothing about it.   It
      should be emphasised, however, that a failure to
      appreciate that there was such a risk would not by
      itself be sufficient to amount to recklessness.

       Further, the jury should have been directed that
      they could return a verdict of unlawful killing only
      if they could attribute those ingredients to a single
      Police officer whom they should on no account name or
      otherwise identify.  In this context the jury should
      consider the position of each officer in turn
      following Mikkelsen's arrest, as to his duty, if any,
      to care for Mikkelsen's health and welfare, and the
      opportunity given to him, having regard to the length
      of time he was with Mikkelsen and other relevant
      circumstances, to discharge it."

I think really I accept that there could be added to the
definition of the person who the Jury must have under
consideration, which is there being identified as the
Police Officer, I think based on Lawrence one could add an
ordinary prudent individual in the position, at the time,
in the circumstances of that Police Officer.

     So that is Gray and I am happy to say that unless
there is any other authority particularly that you would
like me to refer to in the course of this brief review
leading up to the digest of these authorities in the
Spooner and Stanley cases that is all I am going to say
about it, and I go back to my written opening.

     Sir, I am on page 2 and the topics I am dealing with
are what has to be proved for these verdicts.  We have
dealt with misadventure; we have dealt with unlawful
killing, and we come to (iii):

     For an open verdict what has to be proved is either
that misadventure has not been proved on the balance of
probabilities, or that unlawful killing has not been
proved beyond reasonable doubt, so that if the evidence
falls short of the standard of proof in those cases then
one gets to the stage of open verdict.

      THE CORONER:   You have lost me.   Which page are we
on?

     MR. PAYNE:   Sir, I am on   page 2, which I hope is
numbered at the top, and about   one third of the way down.

      THE CORONER:   Yes, I have got it, (iii).
                                                   MR. PAYNE


     MR. PAYNE:   For an open verdict either misadventure
has not been proved on the balance of probabilities, or
unlawful killing has not been proved beyond reasonable
doubt.  Sir, that is a point I have made already and it
does not help to repeat it, and there is an extract from
Jarvis but I think it is self explanatory so it is not
very helpful to spend any more time on it.

     I now go on to what really is the main burden of this
submission to you, having looked at the authorities and
the background and I hope set out what are the relevant
criteria.  What follows in the subsequent passages amounts
to a submission to you that there is no case to answer on
unlawful killing against anyone, and accordingly that that
verdict ought not to be left to the Jury.

     THE CORONER:   I think that is an appropriate time to
pause for quarter of an hour for a cup of coffee, and then
we will get onto that.

                     (Short Adjournment)

     MR. PAYNE:   Sir, I had got to the stage, half-way
down page 2, to the paragraph which is headed number 5,
 Questions for the Jury".  Actually, as a matter of
accuracy I would be grateful if the word "Jury" could be
changed to "Court".  Sir, just before the adjournment I
mentioned that this paragraph and the next paragraphs, 6
and 7, are all, taken together, a submission of no case to
answer on unlawful killing, and that is to say no case
against anyone, including the Police, and accordingly that
the appropriate direction at this stage to be given to the
Jury is that the Jury should not consider returning such a
verdict.

     In order to address this it is necessary to see what
the criteria are for such a submission and our respectful
submission is that they are to be found in the case of the
Queen and Galbraith which is reported in the Criminal
Appeal Reports and the Weekly Law Reports.  I hope you
have a copy?

     THE CORONER:     I have.

     MR. PAYNE:     Do you have it in the Weekly Law
Reports?

     THE CORONER:   In fact, you supplied it.  I think it
must the the Weekly Law Reports, July 10th, 1981, Court of
Appeal.

     MR. PAYNE:   Thank you very much.  Now, this is a
decision of the Court of Appeal in which the judgment was
given by the Lord Chief Justice.  It is the judgment of
                                                  MR. PAYNE


the Court, the Court consisting of the Lord Chief Justice
and Mr. Justice Pain and Mr. Justice Stuart-Smith.   This
is the authority which is cited in Archbold as being the
authority in which the previous decisions are wrapped up,
and so we take it that this does lay down the guidelines
upon which such a submission should be made, and the
guidelines appear at page 1042B.  I don't think the facts
of the case are of great assistance, but the Lord Chief
Justice addresses the question here at B as follows:

     "How then should the judge approach a submission of
     'no case'?  (1) If there is no evidence that the
     crime alleged has been committed by the defendant,
     there is no difficulty.  The judge will of course
     stop the case.  (2) The difficulty arises where there
     is some evidence but it is of a tenuous character,
     for example because of inherent weakness or vagueness
     or because it is inconsistent with other evidence.
     (a) Where the judge comes to the conclusion that the
     prosecution evidence, taken at its highest, is such
     that a jury properly directed could not properly
     convict upon it, it is his duty, upon a submission
     being made, to stop the case,  (b) Where however the
     prosecution case is such that its strength or
     weakness depends on the view to be taken of a
     witness's reliability, or other matters which are
     generally speaking within the province of the jury
     and where on one possible view of the facts there is
     evidence upon which a jury could properly       come to the
     conclusion that the defendant   is guilty, then the
     judge should allow the matter   to be tried     by the
     jury.  It follows that we think the second of the two
     schools of thought is to be preferred.

     There will of course, as always in this branch of the
     law, be borderline cases.  They can safely be left to
     the discretion of the judge."

With those guidelines in mind we have attempted to address
the question of the possibility of an unlawful killing
verdict being returned, and we have addressed it in the
context of the case as a whole and then particularly in
the context, of course, of the Police.   That exercise is
certainly not made any easier by the fact that because of
the nature of this jurisdiction there is no indictment and
no pleadings and no charge, so that in a sense one has to
identify one's own charge in order   to say that     there isno
case to answer on it.  Doing that,   in order to     get into
that, our submission is that the starting point of the
case has to be causation.  One has to look to see what
aspects of the case are capable of being causative and
then under that umbrella one can then start to approach
the question of whether any individual could be found to
                                                 MR. PAYNE


be guilty of unlawful killing within the definition set
out in the authorities that I referred to earlier on.

     Approaching it in that way we submit that the first
question for the Court is to set out a list of things
which are capable of being causative and then, and this
will be, we submit, an exercise for the Coroner to address
to the Jury, a list of things which are capable of being
causative, with the direction that the Jury should decide
on the balance of probabilities which out of those things
in fact were a direct cause, and then having thus narrowed
the field the Court then goes on to enquire under such
causes into whether the criteria are met for unlawful
killing.  We hope we have grasped the nettle firmly there
by addressing it in that way.  That certainly seems to be
appropriate.

     In that context then, at page 4 in these submissions,
we have set out a list of the things which we suggest are
capable of being causes.  We don't say that this list is
exhaustive but these are things which are capable of being
causes which come to mind, and in determining whether each
of these is in fact capable of being causes, we suggest
that it would be appropriate for the Court, that is first
the Coroner and subsequently if it goes to the Jury, the
Jury, to apply the "but for test to each of these things,
and to see how it works, and also to ask themselves in
relation to each of these suggested causes whether it
amounts to a direct cause under the "how" test.

     Now, in looking at this list of things which are
capable of being causes we are mindful, sir, of the Rule
40 which prohibits addresses to the Coroner on questions
of fact, and we are also mindful of your indication
yesterday that you would not allow reference to the
schedules, which are listed in this list of items which
are capable of being causes.  I may say, all that the
schedules do is to give a list of the witnesses and a
reference to the day and the page and the part of their
evidence where the relevant piece of evidence can be
found.  That is all the schedules consist of, there is no
argument in them but merely a reference to the witness, so
all one then does is go to the evidence to find out how it
bears upon the suggested cause, but I bear in mind your
indication given yesterday and it won't be troublesome
until one comes to deal directly with the question of the
Police, and then I will address further argument to you.

    THE CORONER:   Yes.




                           MR. PAYNE:    I now intend ....
I now intend running down this list of things which, in my
submission, are capable of being causes and therefore
appropriate to be left to the Jury whether they in fact were
causes applying in each case the 'but for' test.

1.     Fans arriving 'late' in unprecedented numbers.

Late is in inverted commas because the use of the word 'late'
sounds pejorative but it is not intended to be because there
cannot be a criticism of people arriving at a ground at a
particular time before the kick-off. It is a statement of
fact that fans in unprecedented numbers did arrive shortly
before the kick-off. It is not blaming anybody for that but
it is merely stating as a fact that it occurred and that
fact, in our submission, is capable of being a cause of the
disaster. We adopt here respectfully what is reported
recently to have been said by Lord Justice Taylor in the
extract from the Times newspaper which, sir, you were handed
at one point during the Inquest when Lord Justice Taylor was
having given an interview to the Times newspaper in which he
particularly referred, using the word 'late', to the late
arrival of large numbers of fans as being a how of the
disaster. Of course, it does not matter what he said but we
adopt that point as certainly being relevant and capable of
being a cause.

2.     Fans drinking exceptional amounts of   alcohol.

I cannot address you on the facts.   The evidence is there and
I say no more about that.

3.     Fans refusing to co-operate with Police or Stewards.

We refer to the evidence and may I say if I were permitted to
refer to these schedules, Schedule 1 has a list of 27
witnesses. Schedule 2 has a list of 25 witnesses. Schedule
3 has 25 witnesses.

4.     Fans pushing and shoving.

In each case I have omitted to apply the 'but for' test and
so I go back to do that. Apply 'but for' fans arriving
'late' in unprecedented numbers the disaster would not have
occurred. We submit that the test works. If that had not
happened then the disaster would not have happened. Item 2,
fans drinking exceptional amounts of alcohol, we submit that
if you apply the 'but for' test on the balance of
probabilities that works as well, but for that the disaster
would not have happened. Item 3, fans refusing to co-operate
with Police or Stewards, but for that the disaster would not
have happened and we are referring there both to the refusal
to co-operate both outside the turnstiles and inside when the
signals were being given. I recognise there that I am
drifting into fact which I am not   allowed to do. Fans
pushing and shoving, but for fans   pushing and shoving both
outside and inside the ground the   disaster would not have
occurred. There are 37 witnesses    in that schedule.
5.    Fans arriving without tickets.

A question mark about that when one applies the 'but for'
test. We put that forward as something which is capable of
being a cause but it is probably not as strong as the ones
that have gone before it.

6.    Club providing inadequate information on tickets.

Apply the 'but for' test and that is probably not a strong
causative item.

7.     Club failing to provide adequate signposting outside
       and inside.

Apply the 'but for' test and one can see that that could be a
cause. I am not going to give the particular numbers but
each one of these schedules has got a significant number of
witnesses.

8.     Club failing to provide adequate turnstile approaches
       and adequate numbers of turnstiles.

It may be unfair to attribute this to the Club because this
is a matter of the historical development of the site in a
built up urban area and on that point we adopt again the
recent comments by Lord Justice Taylor as our own submission,
namely that this is how, or one of the hows that the disaster
occurred, because of the location of the stadium and but for
that Lord Justice Taylor seems to think that that is a
significant how the disaster occurred. That is not anybody's
fault but it is a cause.

9.     Club, Officer Working Party, City Council or Engineers
       failing to work out and certify capacity of pens.

Now but for that failure our submission is that the disaster
would not have occurred, if there had been a certified
capacity for each pen, because it follows.

10.    Club, Officer Working Party, City Council or Engineer
       failing to provide system to count or control numbers.

I say without going into the facts that this is something
that was explored in evidence, that once you have got a
certified capacity of individual pens then you must have a
system to count and control the numbers and thereby to keep
those in charge aware of what the numbers are and had there
been such a system then the disaster would not have occurred.
But for the absence of an updated certificate and but for the
absence of a system of counting and controlling numbers in
the new pens the disaster would not have occurred. Those
omissions are capable of being causes.

12.   Ferns causing need for Police to open Gate C.

This is capable of being put in various ways. The way it is
put here is fans causing need for Police to open Gate C. It
could equally be put, Police opening Gate C, depending on how
one looks at the circumstances and the facts but the opening
of Gate C is capable of being a cause of the disaster. What,
of course, caused the need to open Gate C in the first place
is also a direct cause of the disaster and so that is another
way of putting it but it is certainly a cause.

13.    Police leaving tunnel doors open and/or        failing to
       block the tunnel.

That is capable of being a cause.

14.   Police being slow to recognise overcrowding.

That is capable of being a cause. That one is       doubtful.I
have said several are doubtful. It may be that that came too
late and by the time that one has to address the question of
recognition of overcrowding it would not have made any
difference. It may be that that is not a cause but it
certainly requires consideration.

15.   Club and Engineer failing to ensure that barrier 124A
       was of adequate strength.

That is capable of being a cause. That relates to the
evidence of Dr. Nicholson and the tests that were performed
and the examination, you will remember, of the adequacy or
otherwise of the testing and whether it conformed with the
guidance in the Green Guide. If there are two ways of
interpreting the Green Guide then the one which is most in
favour of safety ought to be adopted which it was not. So
that is capable of being a cause.

16.   Club, Officer Working Party and Engineer removing
       barrier 144.

That is capable of being a cause.

17.   Club, Officer Working Party and Engineer failing to
      provide a safe means of escape.

One could perhaps put Fire Service in there as well and that
clearly is capable of being a cause. Apply the 'but for'
test to that and it certainly works. Apply the 'but for'
test to all the foregoing and our submission is that they all
work. But for any of these matters the disaster would not
have occurred.

18.    Fear of Stewards to try to impede crowd through
       Gate C.

I think it is arguable. That is not one of the stronger
causes. It is a factor which has to be noticed but probably
that does not qualify as a cause.

I am reminded that I have missed 11 on the way down.

11.    Club, Police, Officer Working Party and Engineer
       adopting system of 'finding your own level'.

That is capable of being a cause.

This list then which I have now run down is a digest of four
months of work of the Inquest and just because it is taken
shortly we hope it is not treated lightly because each of
these items with the slight reservation which I have
introduced in the case of a few of them, each is capable of
being a cause. We are not allowed to address arguments to
you and it will be for the Jury to decide whether any of them
in fact is a cause but our submission is that it is not
difficult to see that a significant number of these items are
likely to attract the interest of the Jury as in fact being
causes. One remembers then - and I hope this is not a
comment on fact as it is not really - that one remembers the
evidence of Or. Nicholson who at one point, I think when he
was being examined by Mrs. McBrien, said that it is when one
has a whole succession of accidents which come together on an
occasion like this that one has the disaster. Exactly right
we would submit and on analysis of these causes without which
the disaster would not have happened it can be seen that tvat
is how the disaster occurred.

In fact if one runs down this list again, and I am not going
to be tedious about it but I invite you to consider it, sir,
if one runs down the list again and applies the 'but for' and
takes out most of these items then the disaster would not
have occurred. For example, if one takes out No. 1, fans
arriving 'late' in unprecedented numbers, and say that that
did not happen, let us look at it another way and say that
they had arrived as they did in 1988, for example, no
disaster. That makes Item No. l a direct cause and one can
apply that test to each of these items of causation and if
one takes it out then the disaster will not happen. That is
another way in fact of examining whether these are causes
although I agree I am trespassing here into argument and so I
stop at that point.
Having done that exercise, the purpose of which is to
concentrate one's mind if possible on what questions have to
be answered by the Jury, and starting then from the point of
causation, I then go on page two of these written submissions
to suggest some tests which can be applied to each of these
causes to see whether unlawful killing will work for any of
them. My suggestion here is that the test should be applied
to each of the causes and not picking out any one in
particular but to each of the ones that one does in fact find
was a cause. The suggested tests are drawn from the
authorities which we looked at.

First of all, beyond reasonable doubt at the time and in the
particular circumstances was there a serious risk of injury,
which risk would be obvious to an ordinary prudent individual
in the position of the person concerned, and one can apply
that to any one of the causes to see whether such a risk
would be obvious to the person concerned, to an ordinary
prudent individual in the position of the person concerned.
Secondly, if the answer to that is yes, then you have to
asked, beyond reasonable doubt, was that individual
indifferent to the risk? and thirdly, if yes, beyond
reasonable doubt was the act or omission of that individual a
substantial cause of the disaster. If you get a yes to all
those questions then you will get a verdict of unlawful
killing.

If you get a yes to any of them on the balance of
probabilities you will get an open verdict because unlawful
killing will not have been proved and if you get no to any of
them then the verdict will be accidental death or open
verdict; accident being that some deliberate human act has
unexpectedly taken a turn which leads to death. Finally then
one asks that question which I have put down there just at
the beginning of page three, on the balance of probabilities
was there an expected turn of events which did lead to the
disaster? If the answer to that is yes, then the verdict is
accident.

The next two paragraphs, 6 and 7, are particular topics which
have to be addressed which we submit are very important not
to lose sight of in addressing each of the causes and
applying the unlawful killing test to each cause. They seem
to be essential to what the Jury have to consider. Item 6 is
relevant time and circumstances and it is very important not
to lose sight when addressing each cause of that aspect and
we submit that appropriate directions under that head include
these four points. Firstly, as to whether hindsight should
be excluded and one has to constantly remind oneself of that.
Secondly, that the emergency outside the turnstile - and this
is an argument restricted to the interests of the Police -
should be taken into account in deciding whether anyone was
                                                     MR. PAYNE


at fault as a result of trying to deal with it. So that is a
context case submission, that one cannot judge actions in
relation to inside the ground without bearing in the
forefront of one's mind that what was taking place inside the
ground was immediately following - in fact it was concurrent
with an emergency which was being dealt with outside the
ground - and so that time and circumstances have got to be
kept firmly in mind.
                                       MR. PAYNE



       (c) on the question of whether anyone were in­
different, relevant circumstances include that there was
a potential disaster outside the turnstiles which occupied
the attention of the Police, and our submission about that
speaks for itself. Perhaps I might just amplify it for a
moment.

        One must not lose sight of the fact that although
everyone knows now and the whole Inquest has concentrated
of course on the disaster which took place in the pens,
to those involved at the time, their minds as is quite
plain on the evidence which I have touched briefly upon,
their minds were concentrated on what undoubtedly was
perceived to be a potential disaster and death outside
the ground, so that one has to constantly remind oneself
of the circumstances that the people were actually
dealing with at the time, excluding the hindsight of what
one knows happened, and lastly that the time for decisions
was very short, so if one in fact is considering the
question of unlawful killing during the course of the
operation at the ground, then one is looking at the space
of not more than ten minutes within which the crime, if
that is the case, was committed, and one must not lose
sight of the circumstances which existed at the time as
well as the brevity of time available for decision.

      Those are our submissions as to appropriate
directions under "RELEVANT TIME AND CIRCUMSTANCES".

      Turning to the question of "WHAT IS OBVIOUS?"
our submission is that there are four particular matters
which must be kept in mind in dealing with the word
"obvious" and the directions include first of all that
hindsight should be excluded again? secondly that obvious
means obvious in the circumstances and at the time to a
particular and I add to the written words a particular
relevant individual, relevant meaning a person, an
ordinary prudent individual in the position of the person
whose conduct is being criticised, so that is what one
has to address oneself to. That is to say when asking:
"What is the evidence about obvious?" which I am going
to spend some time on in a moment, it is not helpful to
ask what was   obvious, for example, to people in the pen
because thatmisses the point of what one is addressing
here, i.e. whether the potential disaster were obvious
to the ordinary prudent individual in the position of
the person whose conduct is called into question, so that
is what one must look at, the position and his situation.

      One remembers early on in the case Mr. King was
asking the question of a number of witnesses who were
in the pen: "Suppose someone had tapped you on the
shoulder and said a lot more people are about to come
in" or words to that effect "what would you have said?"
                                        MR. PAYNE



and the person in the pen answered: "Well I would have
been unhappy about it" and at one point since that became
a repetitive question I wanted to embark on what in our
submission is a much more relevant and realistic question,
which is to put into the mind of the individual not just
his circumstances at the time in the pen but to put into
his mind the circumstances which were in fact being
dealt with by the person whose conduct is called into
question and here one means the people in the Police Box.

      Then one has to put into the person who is being
used as a test bed, one has to put into his mind that you
are dealing with a major crisis in which people's lives
are threatened outside the ground and that one's whole
concentration is upon the need to relieve that threat and
that the only way one can do it is by breaking all the
rules which have been laid over several years, many years
in the development of the Operational Order and the plan
for policing of the ground, one has to break those rules
and one has a very short time in which to do it and one
has to make that decision and indoing so one thinks that
one has then relieved the threat to people's lives outside
the turnstiles, so one has to build into the question all
those points before one can then start addressing whether it
is obvious. Therefore it is unhelpful and not relevant
to the question of whether it was obvious to the person
whose conduct is called into question to ask only part
of the question of a person who is only involved in part
of it in the pen, so that is our submission about that.
      The third point under what is obvious, which we
submit is relevant, is that the evidence of fans, ball-boys
and B.B.C. staff is relevant to whether the crushing was
in fact obvious to the people whose conduct is called
into question, fans meaning fans outside Pens 3 and 4,
so you will have in mind the witnesses and I can't refer
to the facts, but there is a big body of evidence of fans
who were outside those pens so that that is relevant
because they are looking into the pens from the outside»
likewise the ball—boys, likewise B.B.C. commentators, so
that their viewpoint as to what in fact was obvious is
relevant and appropriate to be taken into account and
there is a body of evidence on that point.
      The fourth point on what is obvious is that there
is no evidence before the Court - and I am now approaching
the nub of the no case submission - there is no evidence
before the Court in our submission that the risk of
crushing was obvious to anyone in authority, i.e. in
the position of the people whose conduct is called into
question, before it was too late, and most of the
evidence is to the contrary.
                                                           34


                                        MR. PAYNE



      Now this of course is at the centre of the case
and it is at this point that our submission is that
in order to determine whether there is a case to answer
it is necessary to look at the evidence and I submit
it is appropriate that I should be permitted to refer
to one of the schedules restricted to this question of
whether there is evidence that it was obvious to a person
in question that there was a serious risk of injury and
the question of whether that individual were indifferent
to the serious risk, so unless I am stopped or you
indicate that it is improper for me to do so, I intend
to refer to Schedule 17. I have not at the moment put
any of the schedules in. Perhaps I can extract it from
this bundle and distribute copies of Schedule 17.

      THE CORONER: I may say I have not seen it, it
is very difficult to comment on it, but I do accept that
you have to make some reference to the facts otherwise
you can't develop your argument.
      MR. PAYNE: May I ask you sir to add to this
schedule a further in manuscript, please, some further
names which ought to have appeared but don't, with
the reference to the places where their evidence appeared.

      The names are: Creaser, Day 13, 62C - 63D;
Sykes, Day 14, 7E-F; Horsfield, Day 14, 92E;
Purdy, Day 14, 43D - 44C; Marshall, Day 29, 41G - 42E.

       I am going to ask you to look briefly at the
evidence just to remind oneself certainly unless you
indicate sir that you have all this evidence firmly
in mind, there are 17 witnesses here who deal with this
topic, and in order to make it clear what I am doing may
I just read out the last paragraph I have got on this
written submission under 7B. What this is leading to
is this:
      "The evidence that the risk of overcrowding
      was 'obvious' is tenuous ...."
I would submit absent. If it can be found then it is
tenuous but our submission is that it is missing.

          . and is inconsistent with most of the
      evidence ...."
which is collected here in Schedule 17. Our submission
therefore is that the jury could not properly find
'unlawful killing' because the obvious and indifference
ingredients are missing from the evidence and accordingly
that verdict should be excluded from the jury's
consideration.
                                                             35

                                           MR. PAYNE



      Sir, I don't know whether you have the transcripts
to hand?
      THE CORONER:     I have not got them with me, no.

      MR. PAYNE:     Perhaps I can summarise the effect of
this evidence.
      MR. KING: Sir, could you perhaps give a little
guidance. I don't object to my learned friend seeking
to do this from his point of view, but if it is to be
the procedure to be adopted I am bound to give notice,
and I do, that I have a number of schedules under various
headings which I would regard are important to the
assessment of risk and I would want to draw your attention
to them and I would go through each of the witnesses
which have been identified and identify their evidence.
That will take a long time sir.




                      THE CORONER:   I don't want
                                                  MR. PAYNE


     THE CORONER:    I do not want to do that and I do not
think that would be appropriate and that is the one thing
I want to avoid, because I think it is a breach of
rule 40.    I think the way to do it is not to refer
specifically to the evidence in the transcripts because
that is, in a sense, my task when it comes to the
summing-up.    I am not saying I will do it in your form,
or yours, or anybody else's, I will do it my way, but I
think it probably is right if you look at
R. .v. Galbraith, the case which you referred me to, if
you were to say to me that taken at its highest, and
give, if you like, one "for instance" at its highest, "I
submit X, Y, Z," or whatever it might be, and in that way
I think you would be    able to express your submission with
a little bit of meat, but without...

     MR. PAYNE:  May I try to do it, and I understand the
point about not referring to evidence...

     THE CORONER:    Mr. Catchpole just wants to say
something.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   To be of some assistance to my
learned friend, Mr. Payne.      I cannot actually see the
vice of my learned friend referring you to the basis on
which he makes his submission.      I do not think it would
be appropriate for him to go through it in detail, but
actually saying, "This is the evidence on which I base
this submission.    Iam not going to    take you through it
but if you choose to    look at it when you are going
through your mind, all well and good, just to help you
when you are formulating, whether you agree with the
submission that is being made in your overall review of
the evidence."

     The vice in going through the evidence as listed is
that it then becomes possibly an argument as to what
evidence is to be preferred, but it must be of some
assistance to you to know at least the passages which are
in the mind of Counsel, otherwise you are left, sir,
trying to divine the basis on which the submission is
made without - and maybe unnecessarily lengthening the
task you have - there may well be passages that when you
go through the evidence in toto, as you may already have
done, that makes any of these submissions wholly
inappropriate, but as long as you know the basis on which
the barristers are making their submissions, it can only
be of assistance to you.

     I must say in reference to my own position I had
intended - I must say not in this sort of detail - but
there are, for example, questions which may be raised as
to whether the club could have the appropriate mens rea
for this offence.   I would certainly intend to say in
                                                MR. PAYNE


respect of certain matters that there is no evidence that
X, or that this is unchallenged evidence, but not to go
through the evidence as such, though state a proposition,
and then leave it up to you, sir, to see whether you
agree with it, but not actually enter into any debate and
to give such references that may be helpful to you in
finding how one arrives at that proposition.

     MR. KING:  Sir, I don't mind what is adopted, the
procedures, just so that I know.   If I might submit,
sir, what would be proper would be for any of us to
identify what we regarded as a relevant issue, and a
relevant fact which the Jury would have to conclude
existed in order to be lawful for them to return certain
verdicts.   To submit for those who wished that there is
no evidence on that fact, if they wish to submit that,
and for those of us who say to the contrary, to say there
is evidence of that and to identify the names of the
witnesses who we would say gave rise to that fact.

     If we can go that far I can simply, orally, give the
heading of the issue and give the list of the witnesses,
without...

     THE CORONER:   In other words, what you are saying
is you certainly do not object to the schedule because
that does not do anything other than list the names and
with an indicator where Mr. Payne feels the matter is
dealt with.   I must say that having seen the schedule
that is my inclination, that the schedule is drawn, I
could not see how I can really object to that.

     MR. KING:   For example, sir, an issue of fact in
the first instance would be whether the pens had a lot of
people in them, just as broadly as that for the moment.
If it were said that there is no evidence there were a
lot of people in it, certainly at a given time I am in a
position and would, when I address you, just list the
witnesses who go to that issue and that would be a matter
for you, sir, on the submission of no case.   To that
extent I would submit we have to take a middle line.

     THE CORONER:   I think we have got to be very
careful because it is a difficult problem.   I can see
the dilemma for everybody, including myself, in the rule.
The rule - I don't know why it is there, presumably there
is a reason, but it does not make life any easier.

     MR. PAYNE:  On the particular point mentioned by
Mr. King I would not have dreamt of addressing you on the
question of how many people were in the pens at a
particular time.   That is clearly a question of fact.
I am confining my submissions - I have accepted your
ruling of yesterday about not putting in the other
                                                 MR. PAYNE


schedules and not referring to them, but this question of
what is obvious, and in particular what is the evidence
as to what was obvious and whether anyone were
indifferent, that is at the centre of the case.   It is
the basis on which the Zeebrugge decision was made and
our submission is that it is relevant to at least have in
mind the passages of evidence where the witnesses deal
with it.

     May I then proceed on this basis, that this schedule
which I have put in identifies the places where we have
recorded through the evidence that relevant witnesses
have particularly had their mind directed to this
question of what was obvious and these are the passages
where they deal with it.   Now you will see that the
witnesses concerned come from - if one runs one's eye
down the list - the club, the Police, the Fire Service,
the engineer and the local authority.   All those
witnesses at these places recorded have had their minds
particularly directed to the question of whether before
the disaster they ever expected that overcrowding of this
nature could occur in pens 3 and 4, and whether it were
obvious to them at any time, that there was a risk that
such overcrowding would take place.

     There are two stages at which one can look at it.
First of all, historically, as to which the Fire Service,
the club, the engineer and the Police in the planning
stage all gave evidence.    You will remember the body of
evidence.   They were all asked questions along the same
lines and the united body of evidence was to the effect
that they all thought that the system of "find your own
level" was safe.    They did not expect that any such
disaster could occur in any circumstances.    They thought
that the pens could safely be evacuated in an emergency.
It was not obvious to them that a disaster of this nature
could happen.    Now they are absolutely unanimous about
that, so that in the planning and contemplation stage, in
my submission that completely rules out any question of a
verdict of unlawful killing because there is no evidence
that it was obvious to anyone at any stage of the
planning that such a thing could take place.    That is
the historical perspective.

     Now if that is right, then on the question of
unlawful killing one comes down only to consideration of
the operation itself and then one is looking at the space
of, at the most, half an hour, and probably about ten
minutes.   One is asking the question whether beyond
reasonable doubt any individual is proved to have been
indifferent to an obvious risk of injury within that very
short time, in the circumstances, at the time, dealing
with the crisis as he was.
                                                 MR. PAYNE


      That, in my submission, is probably the correct
analysis.    Therefore, the evidence as to what was
obvious deals with (a) the historical perspective, ruling
out "obvious";   and (b) the crisis at the time, also from
the point of view of all those involved ruling out
"obvious", and certainly ruling out "indifference".
That is what this evidence before you on schedule 17
does.

     Then one asks the question:  where is the evidence
to prove beyond reasonable doubt, so that the Jury can
return the verdict in fact that some individual was
indifferent to an obvious risk, when this whole body of
evidence is to the contrary and there is nothing in
support of the potential verdict?   That is our
submission.

     Our submission is that it is a very strong case,
that there is no evidence upon which the Jury could
properly return a verdict of unlawful killing.   Sir,
that is the purpose of this schedule and I hope that is
helpful.

     What we intend to do is to go on to give an
illustration by reference to the Spooner and Stanley
cases of how this has recently been seen to work in
practice.   I do not know whether you would treat the
rulings of Mr. Justice Turner in those cases as
authorities, but we would submit that they are
authorities and at the very least they do provide strong
guidance as to how this court should approach the
situation if the situation is comparable and if the
considerations are seen to be comparable.   Our
submission is that they are and it provides most
persuasive guidance as to the course which should be
taken here.

     Sir, I intend now to refer to those reports.   There
are three reports altogether.   There is the report of
the Divisional Court decision, which came part way
through the Inquest, and then there are two parts of the
report of the decision of Mr. Justice Turner, first where
he gave his decision in the absence of the Jury,
following argument, and secondly, the direction which he
gave to the Jury to dismiss the case.

     I start by asking you to look at the report of the
Divisional Court case which is called the Queen against
Spooner, 1989, 88 Criminal Appeal Reports, and I am going
to ask you to look at page 13.   This is at the front of
the folder.   This is the Zeebrugge case, of course.    I
only ask you to look at the Criminal Appeal report, just
to remind oneself of the circumstances in which that case
was proceeding and they are quite usefully set out at
                                                   MR. PAYNE


page 13 in the report, which is about the fourth page of
the A.4 photocopies.   Perhaps I might be permitted to
read that out.   Starting at the top of the page:

     The report then goes into very considerable
     detail..."

This is part of the Judgment which was being given by
Lord Justice Bingham and he is referring to the Sheen
Report of the Inquiry which had previously taken place,
so that the history of the case as is known, is not
dissimilar from what happened here:

     "The report then goes into very considerable detail
     and in the course of the present hearing three
     points are relied on as being particularly relevant.
     First, it is pointed out that the company and its
     representatives failed to give serious consideration
     to a proposal that lights should be fitted on the
     bridge of the vessel which would inform the Master
     whether the bow doors and, for that matter, the
     stern doors were closed or not.   Such a warning
     system, if duly heeded by the Master, would have
     prevented this disaster.   This was a suggestion
     which was made but seems unhappily to have been the
     subject of facetious comment.

May I just pause there and say that in considering
whether this case in fact provides any useful guidance as
to what ought to happen here in the Hillsborough case,
our submission is that it is not fanciful to say there is
an element of analogy between the warning light and
closing the tunnel doors and the analogy is that in each
case if it had been done it would have prevented the
disaster.   The difference is that in Zeebrugge the
warning system had actually been suggested and had been
drawn to the attention of the management and had been the
subject of fecetious comment, whereas as we know here,
although there is some evidence - it is contradictory and
ephemeral - but there is some evidence about closing the
door, the evidence is that it was never drawn to the
attention of the management.   It was done on the
individual initiative of a few Police Officers who gave
contradictory evidence about it.   Sir, you have that
point in mind, and the difference and the similarity
between the two cases.




      In order to make
                                                  MR. PAYNE


     In order to make Zeebrugge the same as Hillsborough,
it would be necessary that the warning system, although it
had been thought of, had never been mentioned to the
management, but actually in Zeebrugge it was mentioned to
management.  Then he goes on:

     "Secondly, attention is drawn to the failure of the
     company and its representatives to report and collate
     information relating to previous incidents, when
     vessels had sailed with their doors open.   It appears
     that there were five or six such incidents between
     October 1983 and February 1987.  Had knowledge of
     these repeated incidents been appreciated it should
     have alerted the officers of the company to the risk
        disaster, but it appears that there was no person
     within the company who ever knew of all the
     incidents."

     Now, just considering whether Zeebrugge is helpful to
Hillsborough, what one has got in Zeebrugge is previous
incidents, five or six of them over the four year period
prior to the disaster, when apparently identical
circumstances had in fact occurred.  Compare that with
Hillsborough, where on all sides it is agreed that this
was an unprecedented event which has certainly happened,
or anything like it, before, never been in contemplation,
whereas in Zeebrugge apparently the same thing had, in
fact, happened before.

     Then the report goes on:

     "Thirdly, attention is drawn to the lack of any
     proper system within the company to ensure that the
     vessels were operated in accordance with the highest
     standards of safety.  It is rightly urged upon us
     that where the result of an unsafe system is liable
     to be so grave, the onus on a company to ensure safe
     operation is correspondingly high.

     At the very end of his report, Sheen J. answered the
     questions posed for the investigation by the
     Secretary of State.  Question 3 was in these terms:
      Was the capsize of the 'Herald of Free Enterprise'
     caused or contributed to by the fault of any person
     or persons and, if so, whom and in what respect?'
     The answer given to that question was:  'Yes, by the
     faults of the following', and three individuals are
     listed."

Then this is the fourth category of person who was at
fault, and he says:

     "Then: '4. Townsend Car Ferries Limited at all
     levels from the Board of Directors through the
                                                 MR. PAYNE


     managers of the Marine Department down to the Junior
     Superintendents [were at fault].  As to the respects
     in which each of the above-named was guilty of
     causative fault, see Report.'"

So that is the finding of the Tribunal of Inquiry,
causative fault against three directors and the company,
says Tribunal of Inquiry.   That is the only purpose for
which I refer to Spooner, just to give one a flavour of
the background of the case.

     Now I come on to the criminal proceedings, and two
parts of the decision of Mr. Justice Turner which in my
submission are helpful.  This case is called the Queen
against Stanley and Others.  Sir, I hope you have a
transcript of the report and I hope I will be forgiven for
reading out quite a large wadge of these reports because
in my submission it is self evident that they are helpful
in deciding what is the appropriate thing here.  The first
wadge appears at page 14G of the transcript of Day 20:

     "Out of respect to the judgment of the Court of
     Appeal in Seymour, and the persuasive effect of the
     opinion of the Privy Council in Kong Cheuk Kwat, it
     is my judgment that the concept of gross negligence
     in cases of manslaughter is no longer apposite.   I
     think I should rephrase that.  That the use of the
     words 'gross negligence' in cases of manslaughter is
     no longer apposite.  I am minded therefore not to
     leave the jury with gross negligence as an
     alternative basis for their verdict in this case.

     This leaves for present consideration the application
     of the first limb in the Caldwell/Lawrence direction,
     that any one of the defendants, of the three to seven
     on this indictment ..."

- and here is the indictment -

     "'Gave no thought to the possibility of there being
     an obvious and serious risk that in consequence of
     the failures respectively alleged against them, the
     Herald of Free Enterprise would sail with open
     doors'.  It is to be accepted, for present purposes
     only, that such a sailing had or was likely to have
     the consequences alleged in the indictment."

So causation was taken for granted.   May I just pause
there to observe that there was no problem about causation
in the Herald of Free Enterprise.   There was no argument
about it at alls  the ship sailed with the doors open.
Compare that with Hillsborough where you have, we submit,
and I hope seeing the list and having it already in mind
as I know you have, there are a large collection of causes
                                                   MR. PAYNE

which^came together per Dr. Nicholson to cause, we say,
the disaster, so in that sense Zeebrugge is a much
stronger case than Hillsborough - there is no problem
about causation, I mean.  Going on at D:

      That is to   say, that at this stage, I have heard no
     argument on   the issue of causation, although
     indications   have been given that such indeed will be
     raised at a   more appropriate moment.

     The prosecution contend that it should have been
     apparent to ordinary prudent people in the several
     positions of the third to seventh defendants, that
     there was a risk of an open door sailing in the
     absence of precautions having been taken as have been
     variously alleged against them.

     What each defendant ought to have known follows the
     test of negligence.  Insofar as Captains Lewry and
     Kirby were concerned, it was said that if they had
     not been enured to the system, if that be the correct
     way to describe it, they would, as reasonably prudent
     masters, have perceived the obviousness of the risk.
     The obvious risk, it was said, comprehends their
     failure reasonably to foresee what may happen.

     It is at this stage relevant to consider what is the
     evidence already led and that which is available to
     the prosecution on the question of the obviousness of
     the risk.  Captains Hartwell, Lodge and Rutherford
     have all testified that unless and until evidence of
     any individual failure of what they had supposed was
     an adequate system came to their attention, it had
     not occurred to them that any risk existed, let alone
     that it was an obvious one."

Just considering the help that one gets in Hillsborough
from that, Schedule 17, we submit, is helpful because this
is very much parallel to what is being said here.

    "All three readily conceded that once there was
    evidence of failure, there were a number of
    precautions, some one or more of which appear in the
    particulars in the indictment, that could and should
    have been taken to obviate that risk.

    There are, in addition, other ships masters whose
    evidence is yet to be led, notably Captains Blower,
    de Ste. Croix and Martin, all of whom were or are
    employed by Townsend Car Ferries and now the eighth
    defendants.  Neither the statements nor depositions
    from these witnesses will advance the prosecution
    case on this issue.
                                                 MR. PAYNE


     There are, in addition, witnesses from other shipping
     lines; masters who may speak as to the practice
     adopted on various of their ships. I do not
     understand that the statements of any of these
     witnesses condescend to criticism of the system
     employed by the defendants in this case as one which
     created an obvious and serious risk, except to the
     extent that any legitimate deduction may be made from
     the fact that they took precautions other than those
     employed by any of these defendants."

Sir, you have in mind as I am reading this out that what
the Judge is directing his mind to is the no evidence to
criticise what was done, no evidence, inferences, yes, but
not evidence, that is what he has got in mind, and
inferences not applicable to the ordinary prudent
individual in the circumstances of the person whose
conduct is called into question.  A person standing
outside it, with hindsight might say this, that, and they
might draw their own inferences, but that is not the test,
and I have said enough to indicate and I am sure you have
in mind that we are looking at the time, the circumstances
and the person concerned.  Sorry to have digressed like
that.  I am at G on page 16:

    "Mr. Solley has given early notice that he will
    object to the admissibility of such evidence.
    Without pre-judging the result of that objection, it
    would be inappropriate for me to suppose that that
    objection would necessarily be successful.  So that,
    if the evidence is admitted, I will consider it as I
    have read it, but say that I am quite unable to see
    how it can advance the prosecution case as to
    obviousness of the risk.  It would be evidence merely
    of different practices adopted by others, and so
    would leave the point for consideration up in the
    air.

    Mr. Kentridge helpfully provided me with written
    submissions which he supported with oral argument.
    At the outset he addressed himself to the meaning of
     obvious . In so doing, he was following the lead
    given by Lord Diplock in Lawrence and Caldwell to the
    effect that we should all be wary of applying terms
    of art to English words, the meanings of which are
    well-known.^ Although Lord Diplock would disavow the
    use of terminology like 'objective' and 'subjective',
    counsel and judge alike in the criminal courts are
    familiar with those terms.  The first part of the
    Lawrence/Caldwell test is readily identifiable as
    being an objective one, and hence the existence of
     obvious and serious risk' must initially be judged
    on direct evidence, or upon evidence from which an
    inference to that effect may properly be drawn.
                                                 MR. PAYNE


     The mere fact that in the indictment the prosecution
     have identified a number of ways in which the risk of
     an open door sailing may be reduced or eliminated,
     can, in my judgment, be no substitute for evidence of
     what the hypothetically prudent master or mariner ...

- bracket, superintendent or policeman -

     "or howsoever would have perceived as obvious and
     serious.  I have used the word 'initially' above
     advisedly because if there were to be evidence that
     any of the individual defendants, three to seven,
     knew or knew of matters from which the inference
     should properly be drawn that the relevant risk was
     obvious and serious, then other considerations would
     arguably apply.  The word 'obvious', said Mr.
     Kentridge, was not the same as 'reasonably
     foreseeable' and connotes [no] more than a risk which
     was reasonably foreseeable.  The meanings suggested
     were 'perfectly evident', 'stares one in the face',
     'immediately apparent'.

     As Mr. Carman developed the submission later, the
     words 'serious' and obvious' he said, goes to the
     level of what is foreseeable.  He argued that the
     proper test was whether or not the risk, and I say of
     (The Herald of Free Enterprise) sailing with her bow
     doors open with the existing system would be
     'immediately apparent', and of 'such high degree'
     that it was likely to occur.

    Lord Atkin clearly had in mind both elements in Lord
    Diplock's definition of recklessness ...."

Now here he deals with Andrews, and I have asked you to
read Andrews, so with your leave I intend to just skip
this part of the judgment.

    THE CORONER:    Yes.

     MR. PAYNE:   He deals with Andrews.  He quotes
extensively from Lord Atkin.  Over the page at page 19, in
the middle of part of the judgment of Lord Atkin, the
relevant words beginning at the top line:

     "For the purposes of the criminal law, there are
     degrees of negligence and a very high degree of
     negligence is required ... before the felony is
     established."

- that is the passage that I asked you to look at earlier,
and he goes on to quote from the judgment of Lord Atkin,
then on page 19 he moves on to Lawrence and Caldwell,
                                                  MR. PAYNE


quotes from Lord Diplock, which I have asked you to look
at.

     THE CORONER:   You mean page 20?

     MR. PAYNE:   Sorry I meant 20, yes, and then at the
bottom of page 20, having looked at the authorities, which
20H°Pe 1 may bS forgiven for not trflversing again, page

    "From this excursion into the authorities, I now seek
    to encapsulate my reasons for the indicative ruling
    which I have already announced.  Thus while
    Lawrence/Caldwell have resulted in a re-definition of
    the ingredients of the common law offence of
    manslaughter and I can find no warrant in those cases
    or in Seymour, Kong Cheuk Kwan for the proposition
    inherent, if not expressed in Mr. Jeffreys   ....

- he was for the Prosecution -

    "... submission that this re-definition has in any
    way diminished the fundamental ingredients of the
    common law offence of manslaughter.  Emphatically it
    should be reaffirmed that simple negligence at common
    law is not and never has been sufficient to support a
    charge of manslaughter.  I have come to this
    conclusion, despite Mr. Jeffreys' argument to the
    contrary, which was that, as the consequence of the
    decisions in Caldwell, Lawrence, Seymour and Kong
    Cheuk Kwat, Lord Atkin's description of what was
    comprehended by the word 'reckless' was what most
    nearly covered 'the very high degree of negligence
    ...  required to be proved before (manslaughter) is
    established, was what Lord Roskill had achieved in
    his speech and opinion in the last two mentioned
    cases.  Mr. Jeffreys went on to propound that it is
    the nature of the breach in any given case that
    differentiates the fault element in manslaughter from
    that involved in simple negligence.  Of course, if
    Mr. Jeffreys' submission is correct, first Parliament
    and then the judges have modified the test of
    manslaughter identified by Lord Atkin in that well-
    known passage of his speech in Andrews that I have
    already quoted."

                      will have had clearly in mind the principles
                      encompassed by the tort of negligence at common
                      laws, since Andrews was
                      decided...after...Donoghue and Stevenson..."

                  I am going to miss out the next passage because he is
                  still discussing the arguments that have gone on and at
                  the bottom of the next page 22-F:

                      "Thus, it is that in my judgment, before a risk
                      can properly be said to be obvious and serious,
                      there must be some evidence upon which the
                      jury, being properly directed, can find that
                      the particular defendant failed to observe that
                      which was 'obvious and serious', which words
                      themselves convey a meaning that the
                      defendant's perception of risk was seriously
                      deficient when compared to that of a reasonably
                      prudent person engaged in the same mind of
                      activity as that of the defendant whose conduct
                      is being called into question."

                  May I interpose there that for the purpose of
                  Hillsborough you need to add, the same kind of activity
                  in the circumstances at the time dealing with a
                  threatened disaster outside the turnstiles. When you
                  are talking about a reasonably prudent person you have
                  got to put him in the context in which his conduct is
                  being criticised. He goes on at the bottom of page 22:

                      "It is for these reasons that I have already
                      given an indicative ruling that the evidence
                      which has already been adduced and that which
                      may yet be given by Captains Martibn, Blowers
                      and de Ste Croix, and by witnesses outside the
                      eighth defendant's organisation, assuming
                      always that this category should fall short of
                      proving that the risk of an open door sailing
                      was or should have been obvious to the person
                      in a position of a master mariner   "

                  Up to this point he has been   dealing with the position
                  of the captain of the ship.    The rest of this page is
                  dealing with the shore staff   and the planning stage and
                  I am just going to read this   briefly down to H:




        H
    "— but it is necessary for me to go further
    and indicate what is the position in regard to
    Messrs. Alcindor, Develin and Ayers.

    So far as the first and last of these three are
    concerned, the case against them in its crudest
    form is that they were guilty in the
    circumstances as affecting them of failing to
    have regard to an obvious and serious risk by
    not specifying or having installed bridge
    indicator lights as to the state of the doors."

- (per Hillsborough, a system written into the
Operational Order of closing the blue doors):

    "It should be remembered, however, that the
    Prosecution seeks to establish direct knowledge
    of the risk as against Mr. Alcindor, and I do
    not seek to cover taht eventuality; but just as
    in the case of the masters, so too with these
    three defendants who are identified as the
    shore side of the eighth defendant's
    operations. There is no evidence that
    reasonably prudent marine superintendents,
    chief superintendents or naval architects,
    would or should have recognised that the system
    gave rise to an obvious and serious risk of
    open door sailing.”

That completes the passages from the indicative ruling
that was given following legal argument and may I ask
you finally - and this is bringing my submission to an
end -to look at the direction which the Judge gave on
the return of the Jury which fortunately is quite brief
and to the point but, in my submission, quite helpful
in considering what the appropriate decision should be
here. I do not know whether you have a copy of that.

     THE CORONER:   No,   not yet.

     MR. PAYNE:    May I distribute copies now? If
anybody else has not got a copy there are some there
which Sergeant Griffiths has. In reading this
direction of Mr. Justice Turner to the Jury may I take
it, without repeating it, that we adopt the reasoning
which is used here and apply it to the circumstancesof
this case particularly in the light of    Schedule 17?At
page 1 under Ruling:

   "Members of the jury, out of respect to you,
   and the very close attention with which you
   have been following this case, I will repeat to
   you the substance of the rulings to which I
referred a few moments ago which have led to
the present situation.

I am about to direct you that, as a matter of
law, there is no evidence upon which could
properly convict any of the defendants, Captain
Lewry, Captain Kirby, Mr. Alcindor, Mr. Devlin
or Mr. Ayers.

Let me please - because of the interest and
assiduity with which you have followed the
evidence in this case - just recap for your
benefit what it was I said to Mr. Jeffreys
yesterday and some of what I said to him as
long ago as the 10th October.

Earlier this year, I heard lengthy submissions
both from Mr. Jeffreys and Mr. Kentridge on
behalf of the corporation, which led to my
making a ruling which was to the effect that,
in certain narrowly defined circumstances, a
corporation could be convicted of the offence
of manslaughter.  Those circumstances, I ruled,
were that if a personal defendant - being one
of the defendants 3 to 7, as I am sure you
follow - was convicted of manslaughter arising
out of a casualty, and, in respect of the
conduct which led to his conviction, he could
properly be said to have been acting as the
embodiment of the company, then the company
itself might be convicted.  Indeed, I reminded
you of some such words only the day before
yesterday.

What I ruled - and what, as I understand it,
the prosecution have quite properly accepted -
is that there is no question of a coproration
being rendered liable to convictions for
manslaughter by aggregating the faults of a
number of different individuals, whether before
the court or not - because, you follow, there
may have been others in the company who were at
fault in some respects - but whose separate
faults would be insufficient to constitute the
offence of manslaughter; and then going on to
say that, in their totality, they amounted to
such a high degree of fault that the
corporation should be convicted.

As a matter of law, any such argument would of
course have run directly counter to all the
cases that have recently been decided in the
House of Lords.
  We have examined the basis upon which any one
  of the individually named defendants 3 to 7
  might be convicted on the facts of this case of
  the offence of manslaughter.

  This is an exercise   which had been   concerning
  me, as the judge in   charge of this   case, for a
  number of days; and   so it was that   I invited
  all counsel to make   submissions on   law on this
  issue.

 Before any of these defendants, numbered 3 to
 7, could be convicted on the indictment framed
 by the prosecution, it was necessary for the
 prosectuion to prove as against each such
 defendant not just one or more of the failures
 alleged against them in the indictment, but
 that - and this is the nub of the present
 situation - such failures were the result of
 recklessness in each defendant, and in the now
 legally approved sense that they either gave no
 thought to an obvious and serious risk that the
 vessel would sail with her bow doors open, when
 trimmed by the head, and capsize, in
 circumstances unknown to shipboard management,
 or, alternatively, that if thought or
 consideration to that risk was given, each
 defendant, nevertheless, went on to run it.

 The prosecution made it clear, in the course of
 their arguments before me, that their case is
 that none of these defendants gave any thought
 to this risk which the prosecution contended
 was both obvious and serious.

 The prosecution had been made aware of my
 concern about this.  Nevertheless, they led
 evidence from a number of Masters and Senior
 Masters employed at the relevant time by the
 company   "

(Police Officers, Schedule 17):

 " — and their predecessors, who have, for a
 number of years, operated the very system which
 the prosecution now criticise.  But one or two
 of those Masters, who happen to have
 experienced open-door sailings in very
 particular circumstances, the possibility of
 improvements to this sytem did occur, but, for
 reasons which have emerged in evidence, for one
 reason or another, those concerns were never
    exported from the particular vessel in which
    those incidents occurred..."

- (were never exported by eg Sergeant Higgins to those
responsible for the Operational Order):

    "...I am of course referring you to the Pride
    of Free Enterprise, and our documents 110 to
    114..."

- this is previous open-door sailings:

    "...So those incidents were never exported
    either to the company, viewed as an aggregate,
    or - and importantly - to other vessels
    operating in the fleet.

    Consequently, to Masters other than those to
    whom I have just been referring the risk that
    has been talked about in this case simply did
    not occ ur ..."

- (Schedule 17):

   " — Specifically, in evidence in this court, to
   none of the Masters - even those who had been
   privy to previous open-door incidents - did the
   possibility of an open-door sailing present
   itself as something which was remotely possible
   in real life   "

- (compare evidence in Hillsborough unanimous to the
same effec t):

   " — I can readily appreciate that that evidence
   need not be decisive; and while it is the fact
   that there are other officers whose evidence
   could have been given, in addition to those who
   already have given evidence, the evidence that
   such other officers might yet have given did
   not indicate that to any of them had it
   occurred that an open-door sailing was a
   possibility which nobody on the vessel might
   know about.

   Again, I appreciate, members of the jury, that
   that evidence need not have been decisive, but,
   nevertheless, was obviously a factor which you
   would have had to consider.

   There were, yet to be called, other Chief
   Officers who would have described the problems
   of supervising the bow doors and then
  proceeding to their Harbour Station on the
  bridge.  But in no case, either has or would
  the evidence yet to come have spoken to any
  perception of risk, in the sense that I have
  been discussing with you now for some little
  while.

  Yet again, that need not have been decisive.
  But, on the other hand, when you look at the
  balance of the evidence in taht direction,
  there is no direct evidence available to the
  prosecution - or, indeed, that has been led in
  evidence - that any one of the defendants,
  whose cases I am now talking to you about,
  would themselves, or should themselves, have
  perceived that the risk of an open-door sailing
  was either obvious and/or serious.  Nor yet, in
  my judgment, was there any evidence from which
  such an inference might safely be drawn.

  The mere assertion, the mere putting forward of
  allegations of fault - which are more familiar
  in the field of civil litigation which is
  concerned with matters of compensation between
  parties than in the criminal courts - does
  nothing to overcome the lack of evidence which
  I have now been discussing.

  Let me tell you two more things.   Some fifty
  years or more ago, one of the most
  distinguished judges ever to have sat in an
  English court considered this whole question of
  manslaughter and negligence.  What he had to
  say was t h i s "

this is Lord Atkin in A nd rew :

    Simple lack of care, such as will constitute
  civil liability, is not enough.       For the
  purposes of the criminal law, there are degrees
  of negligence, and a very high degree of
  negligence is required to be proved before the
  felony is established.       Probably, of all the
  epithets that can be applied, recklessness most
  nearly covers the c a s e .'

  He then went on to discuss other aspects of the
  case which he was considering.

  I am not going to weary you with the full legal
  ruling which I gave, but we considered all the
  important cases together;  and what I ruled on
  the 10th October was that, before a risk can
    properly said to be obvious and serious, there
    must be some evidence upon which the jury,
    being properly directed, can find that the
    particular defendant failed to observe that it
    was obvious and serious - which words,
    themselves, convey the meaning that the
    defendant's perception of risk was seriously
    deficient, when compared to that of a
    reasonably prudent person engaged in the same
    kind of activity as that of the defendant whose
    conduct is being called into question.

    So it was that I concluded what I had to say to
    Mr. Jeffreys yesterday in these words:
    'Accordingly, it is my judgment that if the
    case were to proceed' - and has now, inded,
    proceeded - 'to the close of the evidence for
    the prosecution, I can see no possibility that,
    as a matter of law, I could do other than
    withdraw it from the jury' - on the well
    established, legally correct, basis that the
    evidence already called is such that you, this
    jury, being properly directed by me as to the
    law, could not properly convict any of the
    defendants whose names I have specifically
    referred to at the outset on that evidence."

Then he goes on to direct the Jury to return a verdict
of not guilty and there is some legal discussion which
does not take it any further.

A comment, we submit, is superfluous in the analogy
with this case.  We submit that the Zeebrugge case, if
anything, is much stronger than the present case before
you in that there was evidence of previous incidents
which could be said to have given some warning that
such a disaster could occur whereas here there is no
such evidence and indeed it is ruled out by all the
witnesses on Schedule 17, none of whom ever
contemplated there was a risk of such an event taking
place.  I cannot amplify the submission further.
Unless there is any particular matter I can help you
those are our submissions on the basis of which we
respectfully ask you to withdraw the verdict of
unlawful killing at this stage and to leave them to
consider the alternatives of accident or open verdict,
if it makes any difference.  Our submission is that the
appropriate verdict would be accident because of the
coming together of the causes on this occasion as
spotted and correctly stated by Dr. Nicholson.

     THE CORONER:  I do not think I will ask you
anything further now but we will rise now, Mr. Isaacs.
It is five to one and I do not think it is wise to
start.  It may well be that when I have others I might
well come back if I think it appropriate.   Shall we
then pause at this stage and resume at two o'clock?
May I just ask, at the rate we are going, we are not
going to finish today I think?   I am not complaining
about that.   All I am asking is, what time do we aim to
finish today?

     MR. ISAACS:  Sir, may I try and assist? Having
regard to the submissions in writing that you have
already dealt with, having regard to the very full
submissions made by my learned friend, I have in fact
very little to say. A good deal of the thunder, if it
is thunder, has already been stolen and I can be
relatively brief.  I do not know how long my learned
friends will be but if I said ten or fifteen minutes
that is all I shall probably be in the circumstnaces.

     THE CORONER:  I am not trying to rush anybody.   At
the moment I am really trying to find out hwo
inconvenient it is for you if we go on until say 4.30
this afternoon.

     MR. ISAACS:  I think, speaking on behalf of all of
us, that if we stopped at four o'clock that that would
give more than adequate time tomorow morning.  I
understand you have asked for the Jury to come back at
one o'clock.

     THE CORONER:  Yes, it depends what time we finish
tomorrow.  If need be I shall start on Thursday but you
are quite right about that.  We will stop at four
o'clock.

     MR. ISAACS:  I think there is ample time because
nbow the law has been gone into in great detail and it
is unnecessary for me and my learned friends to recite
it again.

     THE CORONER:    Very well, two o'clock.

                    LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENT
                                        MR. ISAACS



      MR. ISAACS:  Sir, nothing in writing but I hope,
as I have said earlier, to be brief.

      First of all I adopt the submissions on the law
made by Counsel on behalf of Sheffield City Council
at paragraphs 1— 11 of his written submissions and those
made in relation to unlawful killing by my learned
friend Mr. Payne.   Indeed as I said earlier, to a very
large extent Mr. Payne covered the ground which I would
wish to cover on behalf of Mr. Duckenfield.

      I do however say this in relation to the law and
I say this in the context of the written submissions
made by my learned friend Mr. Maxwell and if I could
make these comments by reference to his submissions.

      As to paragraph 6, and that is at page 3,
paragraph 6, sub-paragraph (iii) where he deals with
the question of causation and foreseeability.

      Sir, you will recall that he suggests in sub-
paragraph (iii) that where there is a break in the chain
of causation then the causal relationship comes to an
end and he says in sub-paragraph (iii) that that would
apply where the conduct of the person under consideration
was performed prior to the 15th April 1989.

      My submission is this:  that foreseeability test
as applied to any act or omission which can break the
chain of causation is as relevant to conduct which takes
place on the15th April 1989 as to that which took place
prior to the 15th April 1989.

      I make   that submission  now and    asto how it affects
Mr. Duckenfield I shall deal with in      just a moment, so
that is a gloss, if I may put it that way, on Mr. Maxwell's
submission.
      Secondly, I submit, it is a matter that has been
touched upon by Mr. Payne, that it is necessary, not just
appropriate but indeed essential to stress that when
considering the actus reus of recklessness that one has
to have regard to the circumstances which existed at the
relevant time when considering when the jury have to
consider whether there was created the obvious risk which
is referred to in the authorities, and in those circum­
stances it is vitally important and I stress as firmly
as I can what has been said by Mr. Payne, hindsight has
no part to   play in this at all.

      Sir,   I am leaving the examples which have already
been touched upon.   I appreciate that it would be wearisome
to this Court for me to go over ad nauseam those matters
which have   already been dealt with with skill by my
learned friend.
                                                         56


                                        MR. ISAACS



      I do however ask you sir to add this to what is
set out at page 9 of Mr. Maxwell's submissions when he
deals with, if I could say so advisedly, his model
direction, and that is when he says some eight lines up:

     "You have to be satisfied upon the question
     of recklessness that he acted in such a manner
     as to create an obvious and serious risk of
     causing physical harm to some other person
     who might happen to be using the terraces at
     the time."

Sir in my submission, and this is said with support from
the Crown against Seymour, that the obvious risk is not
merely of causing some physical harm to those on the
terraces or perhaps more specifically in Pens 3 and 4,
but the risk of causing death, and I say so by reference
not only to the passage in the speech of Lord Fraser at
page 501 in the Crown against Seymour to which my learned
friend Mr. Payne has already referred, but more particularly
to what is said by Lord Roskill in his speech at page 508
letters C to D.  Sir, I remind you that it was with
Lord Roskill's speech that the other Law Lords agreed,
not with Lord Fraser's, so insofar as Lord Roskill made
a statement of his view as to the appropriate direction
then it is his view which represents, in my respectful
submission the law, and he said this at letter C:

      "I would therefore answer the certified question
      as follows:

      'Where manslaughter is charged and the circum­
      stances are that the victim was killed as a
      result of the reckless driving of the defendant
      on a public highway, the trial Judge should
      give the jury the direction suggested in the
      Crown against Lawrence, but it is appropriate
      also to point out that in order to constitute
      the offence of manslaughter the risk of death
      being caused by the manner of the defendant's
      driving must be very high.'"

One can understand, if I may say so with respect, the
reason for that.

      Originally Caldwell and Lawrence dealt with the
question of recklessness, the concept of recklessness
insofar as it affectedstatutory offences, first of all
of causing criminal damage and then of effectively
reckless driving, there the risk that would have to be
obvious would be a risk that would be necessary to be
proved so far as the statutory offence was concerned,
damage on the one hand and damage or personal injury on
the other in relation to reckless driving, but here
                                         MR. ISAACS



one is concerned with involuntary manslaughter so that
the act which is complained of or the omission that is
complained of by the person whose conduct is called into
question is not in its beginning unlawful and so when one
has to have regard to manslaughter it is essential that
one looks to the obvious risk of causing that which the
offence itself prohibits, in other words the causing of
death.

      So using the speech of Lord Roskill as support for that
submission it is my submission that the obvious and
serious risk which has to be found to have been apparent
to the person whose conduct is called into question is
that of death as opposed to merely some physical harm.

      My third submission is this and this deals with
a matter which is set out at page 10 of Mr. Maxwell's
submission, this is in the first paragraph, three lines
down:

      "In determining the quality of his act you
      apply the standards of the ordinary reasonable
      person who happened to be in the same circum­
      stances as X.  You of course take into account
      all the evidence including his explanation     ...."

Then he   goes further to deal in the last paragraph on   that
page:

      "In deciding whether or not a risk was obvious
      the Jury should have regard to whether the
      risk would have been obvious to an ordinary
      prudent individual in the relevant circumstances."

Sir, in my submission the test must make clear that the
more unusual the circumstances the more difficult it is
for any   juror to reappraise the assessment made   by       those
who had   the decision to make at the time.

      Here, of course, without wishing to trespass on the
question of evidence, the evidence is that for
Mr. Duckenfield the circumstances were highly unusual
that there was a crisis, that events were so far as he
and indeed others in the Control Room were concerned
were unique and I leave it at that.

      My fourth point is this and this again deals with
pages 10 and 11 of Mr. Maxwell's submission.

      When considering the conduct of any Police Officer
and in particular of course Mr. Duckenfield, the jury
must consider such conduct from the standard of the
ordinary prudent individual in the circumstances in which
that individual, the one whose conduct was being called
                                                          58


                                        MR. ISAACS ,



into question, found himself at the time, and the question
must be: "Would the risk if it existed have been obvious
to him at that time?" and a jury is not, with respect,
in a position to make an assessment as to whether such
an obvious risk existed without the benefit of evidence
and for that submission I rely on the matters that have
already been adverted to by Mr. Payne in his analysis
of the ruling of Mr. Justice Turner in the Zeebrugge
case and I should say at this point, with respect, that
is a ruling which is binding of course on this Court.
There can be no doubt about that.

       The fact that a jury is not in a position to make
an assessment without the benefit of evidence is of
importance in this case because the standards that have
to be applied by a jury are quite different in this
case as they would have been in the Zeebrugge case from
applying the standards of a reasonable motorist of which
a juror can be deemed to have had some experience, so
the circumstances which have to be stressed in this
particular case and in relation to Mr. Duckenfield without
being exhaustive, are his personal circumstances, namely
that he was recently appointed; that he was reliant upon
the experience and expertise of senior Officers; that he
had been told that "find your own level" was the appro­
priate method of filling the terrace and one has in
addition to those personal circumstances if I could use
the inelegant phrase, the environmental circumstances to
which I have already referred, namely those of crisis,
wholly exceptional events, unique in everybody’s
experience where there is a threat to the lives of those
outside the ground unless immediate action is taken.




                   Sir, if I   may I would like to read
                                               MR. ISAACS


     Sir, if I may, I would like to read from the
submissions made by one of the Counsel in the Zeebrugge
case, my learned friend Mr. Kentridge QC, on behalf of
the ferry company, to Mr. Justice Turner, which in fact
deals with this very point.   I am afraid I don't have a
copy to give you but you will, I hope, get the flavour as
I read it out.   It is a relatively short passage dealing
with the way in which a Jury is to be directed as to the
position in which they must put themselves.

     MR. CATCHPOLE   I apologise for interrupting.   If
my learned friend indicates which Day, I actually have
bound copies of the...

     MR. ISAACS:   Sir, I am very grateful.   It is Day
19, at page 18.  Sir, as with my learned friend
Mr. Payne, I adopt these submissions as my own.
Mr. Justice Turner impliedly accepted the submissions
that were being made, albeit that he did not deal with
them expressly but it is clear from his ruling that he
did.   Mr. Kentridge said:

     "The prudent and reasonable person must be taken to
     have the knowledge which the particular defendant
     has, and no more.   The relevance of it in this case
     is that one of the named defendants had knowledge of
     open door incidents in the sense of sailing, putting
     out to sea, with open doors.   None of them had
     knowledge of that, so the test is that of a prudent
     and reasonable person with the experience and
     expertise of a Master who, however, has no knowledge
     of the ship putting to sea with open doors, and on
     the contrary has knowledge of thousands of sailings
     in which this system has worked perfectly well."

May I turn over the page:

     "My Lord, there is one other factor with regard to
     this objective part of the test.   I have said, and
     my learned friend seemed to accept, that the test is
     that of the prudent and reasonable Master
     mariner..."

As it is here, sir, the prudent and reasonable Police
Officer in the Control Room:

     "...as I say, having the knowledge that these
     defendants had..."

With the knowledge in this case that Mr. Duckenfield had,
the expertise that he had and the reliance hs was
entitled to place upon his colleagues:
                                                          60

                                                MR. ISAACS


     "...but what follows from that, my Lord, is that in
     considering that matter the jury themselves cannot
     play the part of the prudent and reasonable man as
     they can in other types of case.    In either
     Lawrence or Caldwell - I am afraid I cannot for the
     moment remember which - Lord Diplock said in
     relation to a motoring case that the jury themselves
     supply the test of what would be obvious to a
     reasonable and prudent motorist.    The juryman or
     jurywoman is the reasonable and prudent person.    My
     learned friend tells me it is in Lawrence's case at
     page 527 at the letter B:   'In deciding whether the
     risk was both obvious and serious they may apply the
     standard of the ordinary prudent motorist as
     represented by themselves.'

     My Lord, that cannot be the case here."

Sir, I say to you:  that cannot be the case in this
instance having regard to the circumstances wholly
unique, which take the consideration of whether there was
at the time an obvious risk out of the experience of the
juryman.   Mr. Justice Turner says:

     "I had in mind, and this was why I invited you to
     pause for a moment, that there was a citation from
     Sangha..."

Which is a case referred to eventually in his Judgment:

     "...which bears on this."

Then at the bottom of the page Mr. Kentridge:

     "'The ordinary prudent bystander is not deemed to be
     invested with expert knowledge relating to the
     construction of the property, nor to have the
     benefit of hindsight.'"

That is in fact a direct quote from the case of Sangha.

     Finally on page 20, at D:

     "All the evidence is that a large number of^
     competent and skilled Masters and Chief Officers
     throughout the fleet, numbering in all possibly more
     than 50 or 60 people, considered the system safe and
     did not regard it as a risky system.   They used it
     consistently in circumstances where their own safety
     was at risk as much as any other without reason to
     doubt it."

     Now my submission is that observations as to the
evidence that is required in relation to the safety or
                                                     . 61

                                               MR. ISAACS


otherwise of a system are just as cogent, ara just as
important and are just as effective when one has regard
to an event, as one has with regard to Mr. Duckenfield
the opening of the gates and the failure, as it is
suggested against him, to give any consequential order to
divert fans from the central tunnel.

     At the bottom of page 20 Mr. Kentridge says:

     "As it is not like a motoring case, my Lord, the
     jury must be guided by the evidence of those skilled
     in the relevant professional calling, and if it were
     left to a jury to find that a risk which was not
     obvious to 50 or 60 highly qualified officers
     concerned for their own safety as much as their
     passengers' safety, if they were to find in the face
     of that that the risk was an obvious one, I submit
     it would be a perverse finding.   It would be a
     finding which could not stand."

Now we do not have 50 or 60 Master mariners in this case,
nor do we have as many as 50 or 60 Police Officers in
this case, but of the Police Officers who have given
evidence who can speak as to their assessment of the risk
at the vital time in those vital circumstances, and I
shall return to it in a moment, in my submission the
evidence is all one way and that is no such obvious risk
existed in their minds.

     Sir, in the Crown against Stanley and others, the
submission was made by Counsel on behalf of the
Prosecution that notwithstanding there was no evidence,
that is, from any individual who was experienced in these
matters that the risk would be obvious to those with
decisions to make and that all the evidence was that the
risk would not be obvious, it was a matter which was
still one for the Jury to decide.

     The basis of that submission can be seen in the
Judgment.   That is Day 20, of which you have a copy
provided by my learned friend Mr. Payne, at page 2,
letters D to E, where Mr. Justice Turner dealing with the
submissions of Mr. Jeffreys, QC, on behalf of the Crown,
said - this is letters G to H, that what Mr. Jeffreys had
said was:

     "'One then moves on to consider as against other
     defendants, first of all, I agree in the objective
     sense, was there an obvious and serious risk that
     the ship would sail in that condition?   In the
     objective sense, our answer is yes, there was.
     Look at what happened.   Look at what seems to have
     been the cause of it.   Is there not, we say to the
     jury, with the other incidents such as they are of
                                                    MR. ISAACS


     open doors, and was there not on the 6th of March an
     obvious risk of the ship sailing in that
     condition.'"

What Mr. Jeffreys was saying was that despite the lack of
evidence a jury could still be invited to exercise their
judgment to determine whether there was an obvious risk.

     Sir, that submission was, as is quite clear, roundly
rejected.

     As I say, and this is a matter which I touch upon
only briefly, again because of what has been said by
Mr. Payne, there is no difference in principle between
evidence which is sufficient to go before a jury relating
to system and that relating to an event such as is the
subject of the criticism levelled at Mr. Duckenfield,
namely, the decision to give permission for the gates to
be opened and then the failure to give a consequential
order to divert fans from the central tunnel because of
the unique circumstances in which he found himself, in
which the whole of the Control Room found itself and the
highly unique circumstances which pertained to him as an
individual which would be quite outside the experience of
the ordinary juror.

     My next submission is this, dealing with again the
Judgment of Mr. Justice Turner, at page 6, because I have
mentioned Sangha and it is right I should now refer to
the passage in the   Crown against Stanley when
Mr. Justice Turner   refers to it. This is at C:

     "Mr. Jeffreys   referred to apassage in a case called
     Sangha which is reported in the All England Reports
     for 1988, volume two, at page 3 85 , and I q u o t e : T s
     it proved that an ordinary prudent bystander would
     have perceived an obvious risk that property would
     be damaged and that life would thereby be
     endangered?'"

The offence in Sangha being arson - reckless as to
whether life would be endangered:

     "'The ordinary prudent bystander is not deemed to be
     invested with expert knowledge relating to the
     construction of the property, nor to have the
     benefit of hindsight.   The time at which is
     material is the time when the fire started.'"

So the time which is material in our present case, with
present events, is the time at which the decision came to
be made.   It is vitally important, in my submission,^to
distinguish between the risk that would have been obvious
to the reasonably prudent individual - let us call him
                                               MR. ISAACS


the reasonably prudent Police Officer - and a risk that
should have been apparent because the latter is the test
in negligence as opposed to the appropriate test which is
that much higher in recklessness where the risk has to be
an obvious one.

     The fact there are ways in which the risk to fans in
pens 3 and 4 could have been reduced or eliminated is no
substitute for evidence of what the hypothetically
prudent Police Officer would have perceived as obvious
and serious.

     It is for that reason that I submit that the
approach that has been taken from time to time by learned
friend Mr. King, namely, the step by step approach, is
misconceived, one is concentrating there not on the risks
that would have been obvious at the time the decision was
made, in the circumstances in which the decision was
made, the crisis in which the decision was made, but what
any individual knew, in stages, prior to the moment of^
the decision, as if there was at the time of the decision
an opportunity for calm reflection when on the evidence
there was not.




          So what is being done
                                                MR. ISAACS

So what is being done is to remove the consideration of
the obvious risk away from the appropriate time and the
appropriate circumstances to a wholly different time, a
time when there is opportunity for calm reflection.

     Sir, I will not read again the passage already
referred to by my learned friend Mr. Payne, at pages 22
and 23, but I do adopt them as being an appropriate
statement of the law in a case such as this, and when one
does, and then one applies the law as set out in all the
submissions that you have heard to date, to Mr.
Duckenfield, one in my submission can come to these
conclusions, and I make this submission to echo that made
by my learned friend Mr. Payne, and of course I can only
make it so far as Mr. Duckenfield is concerned, though the
same does to a degree, I am quite sure, apply to Mr.
Murray and Mr. Goddard, who were in the Control Room at
the relevant time and who on the evidence quite clearly
would have perceived, some would say more than Mr.
Duckenfield having regard to their position within the
Control Room, and who had on their evidence, differing
between Mr. Murray and Mr. Goddard admittedly, but on
their evidence a role which would have involved them in
making a decision to divert fans from the central tunnel,
had they considered that there was an obvious risk to
those in Pens 3 and 4.

     My first point is this, and this relates to causation
and this is^why I made the submission relating to
foreseeability to extend that which is referred to by my
learned friend Mr. Maxwell at page 4 (iii), paragraph 6.
In my submission there is evidence before you which breaks
the chain of causation between Mr. Duckenfield's decision
to give permission for the gate to be opened, remembering
of course that the evidence is that the decision would
probably have been made anyway, even without his
permission, but there is in my submission a break in the
chain of causation linking that decision to the deaths,
and that is that on the evidence it was not foreseeable to
Mr. Duckenfield that if the risk did exist, that is the
risk to those in Pens 3 and 4, then having regard to the
expertise, the experience of Mr. Murray and Mr. Goddard,
then no consequential order would be given by either of
them to avert that risk.

     To echo what was said by Mr. Maxwell:

     "...  where ... a subsequent and intervening act
     which causes death breaks the chain of causation if
     that intervening act is not foreseeable ...."

then the original decision, that is Mr. Duckenfield's , is
no longer a direct and sufficient cause.  So my submission
is that having regard to the evidence of the chain of
                                                 MR. ISAACS


command, important decision by the overall commander, the
bomb evacuation, here the opening of the gate, and the
evidence given by Mr. Mole and by Mr. Murray indeed, in
relation to consequential decisions from other officers,
and other directions consequent upon the important
decision given by other officers, then the change of
causation is broken because it would not be foreseeable so
far as Mr. Duckenfield is concerned that in the event of
there being a risk to those in Pens 3 and 4 no
consequential order would be given.  We know that no order
was given.  That is my first point on causation.

     My second point relates to the obviousness of the
risk and what I say is really a repetition of what has
already been said by Mr. Payne, so I shall be short.    The
question must be asked, would it be obvious to a
reasonably prudent Police Officer in the position of Mr.
Duckenfield, in the circumstances in which he found
himself, so a man recently appointed, a man reliant upon
experienced advisers, a man facing a crisis, that if there
was such a risk as is being suggested then nothing would
be done by others in the Control Room? And indeed, in my
submission, the presence of others in the Control Room,
and their lack of action which I certainly do not
criticise, but their lack of action is an additional
important factor for, let us say, the Jury to consider
when considering whether the risk would have been obvious
to a person in Mr. Duckenfield's circumstances.   He is
entitled to say,  "If the obviousness of the risk which is
suggested was not apparent to Mr. Murray or to Mr.
Goddard, Officers with far more experience than I,
Officers who had perhaps a better view thanI did, then
how can it be said that it should have been obvious to
me?"

     Indeed, and this is my final point, there is no
evidence that the risk, the obvious risk was apparent to
anybody in that Control Room.  I rely on that evidence
which has already been referred to by Mr. Payne which is
on his last schedule, but particularly on the evidence of
Mr. Murray, Day 67, page 30; Mr. Goddard, Day 70, page
101; and Mr. Bichard, insofar as it deals with the
assessment of the link between the tunnel and Gate C; and
indeed Mr. Marshall; and finally Mr. Mole, though of
course Mr. Marshall and Mr. Mole were not in the position
of those in the Control Box, but Mr. Duckenfield is
entitled to say, "Where is the evidence upon which a Jury
can find that the obvious risk should have been apparent
to me?" He says, "There is no such evidence and indeed
far from the matter being neutral the evidence from Mr.
Murray and Mr. Goddard is to the contrary, that they, two
reasonable competent Police Officers, in perhaps a better
position than I was in, if the Jury is applying any test
then they should take the evidence from there, and the
                                                          66

                                                MR. ISAACS
                                               MR. MANNING

evidence there is positive to the effect that in those
circumstances, at that time, with their experience they
did not perceive the risk or any risk, never mind an
obvious risk."

     So, sir, I echo Mr. Payne, I ask you to make what may
be a decision which is unpopular with some, but I know
that has never troubled you, and to grasp the nettle and
to say that in this case there is no evidence upon which a
Jury properly directed could find that those who died at
Hillsborough were unlawfully killed so far as the conduct
of Mr. Duckenfield is concerned.

     MR. MANNING:   They say "Follow that".   It doesn't
get much easier as you go down the line to find new things
to say, and I am sure that there will be no forgiveness
needed from you if I am relatively short.   Indeed I am
minded of a situation which, albeit may not be binding may
at least be persuasive, namely of John Cleese talking down
to Ronnie Corbett and expounding, and Ronnie Corbett
talking to Ronnie Barker and expounding, and Ronnie Barker
saying, "I know my place".

     I say that because you have already heard from at
least one, and possibly, depending upon whose hand or
brain it was from the solicitor's letter, two of Her
Majesty's Counsel, you have heard from senior junior
Counsel, my learned friend Mr. Payne, you have heard from
not senior but a young junior but very learned Counsel, my
friend Mr. Isaacs, and I know my place.

     There is no new law that I seek to put before you
that has not been very ably put, if I may say so,
particularly in the verbal form, by my learned friends
that have spoken before me, and I say that respectfully
lest anybody should think, and indeed I am prepared to
fairly proudly show that I have in fact got almost all of
the authorities, which I had researched independently and
would have drawn to your attention, but knowing my place I
have adopted as my text the words of Mr. Justice Turner to
the Jury, because at the end of the day the lawyers have
capabilities of playing around with words, of looking at
individual words, and even letters in individual words as
to whether they are singular and plural, and making much
of them, and there comes a time when commonsense has to be
applied and it is easier sometimes to see that in the
rather more simple language that Judges, at least on some
occasions, welcome occasions, are prepared to apply.

     So, sir, I look at page 11 of the transcript of Mr.
Justice Turner, when he says to the Jury, as you no doubt
will say:
                                                 MR. MANNING


     "There have been occasions when you have been out of
     this Court and must have wondered what was going on
     when all these legal submissions were being made,
     which either gave you an extra coffee break or gave
     you an early night when everybody else was still
     here."

and this is the language of the learned Judge, which I
agree with  my learned friend Mr. Isaacs is binding upon
you, as to   the way in which he told the Jury that he had
reached the conclusion that there was no evidence upon
which a Jury properly directed could come to the
conclusion   that there could be unlawful killing:

     "... before a risk ...."

- says Mr. Justice Turner -

     "... can properly be said to be obvious and serious
     there must be some evidence ...."

- and that is what we are talking about now.  This is the
old scenario that we all know about, the respectful
submission that there is no evidence upon which the case
in this part can go forward, so it is as simple as that -

     "... there must be some evidence upon which the Jury,
     being properly directed, can find that the particular
     defendant ...

 -  the individual person, not everybody as a whole,
because we have already parts about aggregation and
whether the sum of the whole can make a bottom line which
then means something which the different parts did not,
but -

     "... the particular defendant failed to observe that
     it was obvious and serious - which words, themselves,
     convey the meaning that the defendant's perception
     • • • •



- "t" apostrophe "s" - in other words the perception of
that individual particular defendant, that his -

     "... perception of risk was seriously deficient ..."

- not compared with the man on the Clapham omnibus, as it
used to be when I was learning the law but -

    "... when compared to that of a reasonably prudent
    person engaged in the same kind of activity ...."


                                There can, of course ....
                                                             68

                                                    MR. MANNING




There can, of course, be absolutely nobody in the whole
of the United Kingdom and possibly in the world, but
certainly in the United Kingdom, who can talk about the
same kind of activity because it was an unprecedented
situation.  It was a situation in which Officers with
all of their training were totally unprepared for
because it had never happened before.  It was unique.
It was a threat to life and they were trained to deal
with that.

     If you look at those few lines and the simple words
of Mr. Justice Turner, sir, then I respectfully submit
to you that there is no evidence upon which you can say
that my client, Superintendent Murray, with his
perception of what was happening in those short moments
could possibly be considered in law with all the
definitions of recklessness that you have very properly
had drawn to your attention, be said to have gone to a
standard, a deficiency, which could possibly allow a
Jury, properly and reasonably directed, to come to the
conclusion of unlawful killing.

     That is the submission simply and humbly put before
you.   The best speeches in the law books when I was a
student were the ones which said "I concur" and in
respect of those submissions on the law most ably and
eloquently put by my learned friends I concur.   I adopt
their views.   I accept that without going through it
all again and I ask you to say here that the evidence
is lacking so that you, sir, addressing a Jury could
not leave unlawful killing by Superintendent Murray to
that J u r y .

      THE CORONER:    I just want to say to you and indeed
to anybody else, the length of the submission and the
fact that lots of things have been said makes no
difference.    The Jury are not here anyway.   What I am
trying to find out is what the legal points are and so
please do not think that merely because somebody has
spoken for X minutes as opposed to a shorter period
makes no difference.     What I am interested in are the
points.    I just want to say that to you.

     MR. MANNING:   I am very grateful to you, sir. I
was brought up on the principle that to say something
the second time did not make it any better and to say
something a third time probably made it worse because
people got bored.

     THE CORONER:  You are probably right.  Mr. King, I
am not going to want to sit through until four o'clock
                                                            69

                                                   MR. MANNING
                                                    MR. KING

without a break at all and it is also very warm in
here.  Shall we stop for just ten minutes and start at
three o'clock?  It seems a bit early to stop but it
seems a nice and convenient point.

                    (Short Adjournment)

     MR. KING: May I first indicate the extent to
which I disagree with the statements of law that have
been given so far?

     THE CORONER:   Yes.

     MR. KING:  Sir, in my submission, the test for
unlawful killing, which is the test of manslaughter, is
that which has been set out in the case of Lawrence as
adopted in Seymour subject to a question mark which
remains unresolved in law as to whether or not there is
a further category of manslaughter, the type of which
we are considering, namely gross negligence
manslaughter.  Sir, I raise this in order to say that
my own professional assessment is that if it ever went
to a higher court the higher court would be unlikely to
rule that gross negligence manslaughter survives in any
form other than that laid down in Lawrence and Sevmour.
I have to draw to your attention, sir, that there is no
ruling from a higher court to that effect and that is
why it remains in the text books as a question mark
clearly set out if you want the reference, sir, at page
345 of Smith and Hooan as to whether or not this
residual category of gross negligence survives.

    Sir, if I can just cite you one case for the moment
which remains as a set of facts, an example of where
one might have gross negligence manslaughter which
cannot fit into the Lawrence and Sevmour analysis you
will then have that problem.  I am going to do that
which I know Counsel should not do, I am going to leave
the problem with you because I do not concede on behalf
of my clients and cannot concede on the part of my
clients that gross negligence manslaughter does not
exist but I shall address you, having drawn your
attention to this one case, on the basis that we are
dealing with Lawrence and Caldwell. If that sounds
like having my cake and eating it, I apologise, sir,
but I have given careful thought as to what the law is
as it now stands, and I have no doubt as the law now
stands, that the question mark still exists.

    The case I want to refer you to, sir, was the case
of Lamb which was in 1967.    This is Lamh 1Q67 2 Queen's
Bench page 9 8 1 . Sir, this was a case first of all
                                                          70

                                                     MR. KING


before the decision in Lawrence and Caldwell. its
facts can be stated very simply.  It was a case in
which a defendant pointed a revolver in jest with no
intention of doing any harm at all to his friend.  He
believed, and it was accepted that he believed, that if
he fired the trigger there would be no explosion and
there would be no fire.  In fact, unknown to him, when
he pressed the trigger the revolving cylinder revolved
bringing a bullet into the appropriate place for it to
fire.  It was not a case in which he knew of the risk
of injury to his friend if he pulled the trigger
because so far as he was concerned there was no risk.
Nor could it be really said that he had not given any
thought to the possibility of the risk because his
defence was, "I did apply thought to what I was doing
and I believed" - and there was evidence to support him
- "that it would not fire".  It was not a case of his
ignoring the risk.

    He was convicted and his conviction was set aside
on appeal.  I need not concern you with the reasoning
in the judgment save to invite you to turn to the very
last page of the judgment and to the paragraph which
begins:

    "The general effect of the summing up was thus
    to withdraw from the jury the defence put
    forward on behalf of the appellant...”

Sir, do you find that?

     THE CORONER:   Yes, I have got it.

     MR. KING:  It reads as follows, and this is the
judgment of Lord Justice Sachs giving the judgment of
the Court of Appeal:

   "The general effect of the summing up was thus
   to withdraw from the jury the defence put
   forward on behalf of the appellant.  When the
   gravamen of a charge is criminal negligence,
   often referred to as recklessness, of an
   accused person the jury have to consider,
   amongst other matters, the state of his mind
   and that includes the question of whether or
   not he thought that that which he was doing was
   safe.  In the present case it would, of course,
   have been fully open to a jury, if properly
   directed, to find the accused guilty because
   they considered his view of there being no
   danger was formed in a criminally negligent way
   but he was entitled to a direction that the
   jury should take into account the fact that he
                                                            71

                                                      MR. KING


    had undisputedly formed this view and there was
    expert evidence of this being an understandable
    v i e w ."

Sir, that is   the citation which is relied on and is
relied on in   the text books you will see and it raises
the question   that criminal negligence, gross negligence
manslaughter   still exists.

    I know of the citation by Mr. Justice Turner that
he has decided otherwise and I say no more about it,
sir, but I do not on behalf of those I represent say
that I am conceding that that is gone.   Let me deal
with it, sir, on the basis of the recognised formula
set out in Lawrence and adopted in Sevmour. It has two
elements to it, this formula.  First of all, there has
to be an obvious and serious risk that the act or
omission of the person who is called into question may
cause personal injury to another - and I will address
you in a moment on the basis upon which you should
approach your task as to how that hurdle is
approached - and the second stage, which is quite
separate, is whether or not the person whose conduct is
called into question, whose omission is called into
question, knew of that risk or gave no thought to the
possibility of that risk and still went ahead.

    Sir, in Lawrence you will not find in the relevant
passages the words 'indifference to r i s k '. What you
will find, sir, if I can remind you of the crucial
passages is simply a reference to either knowing of the
risk or not giving thought to the possibility of the
risk.  Sir, if you can in your bundle (and I have not
duplicated the bundle of authorities because they are
all the same) go to the relevant passage in Lawrence.
In the Criminal Appeal report which I have it starts at
page 11.  It is the well known passage which begins:

   "In my view an appropriate instruction to the
   jury as to what is meant by driving recklessly
   would be, must be satisfied of two things...”

It is worth repeating this passage which is short and
to the point in our present Inquests:

   "In my view, an appropriate instruction to the
   jury on what is meant by driving recklessly
   would be that they must be satisfied of two
   things:  first, that the defendant was in fact
   driving the vehicle in such a manner as to
   create an obvious and serious risk of causing
   physical injury to some other person who might
   happen to be using the road or of doing
A
                                                              72

                                                        MR. KING


       substantial damage to property; and, second,
       that in driving in that manner the defendant
B      did so without having given any thought to the
       possibility of there being any such risk or,
       having recognised that there was some risk
       involved, had none the less gone on to take
       it."

    Sir, the fact that the word 'indifferent' do not appear
    there is, in my submission, significant.  Can I cite
    now one case which has not yet been put to you to show
C   how clinically in fact the Courts have applied that
    formula? That is the case of Elliott, sir.

                            /Sir, I did ask that.




H
                                        MR. KING



      Sir, I did ask that Mr. Griffiths hand to you
a copy of that decision.

       Sir, it is important in my submission for two
reasons this decision.    One, to go to show that issues
of the indifference of the particular defendant to the
risk is not the appropriate approach.    When we come to
the second stage of the test it is whether or not he
either knew or did not give any thought to the possibility
of there being any such risk, which may not be the same
as indifference, and secondly, it is important because
it emphasises the point that when assessing whether a
risk is obvious and serious, the test is not as that
which my learned friends appear to have been suggesting
to you, whether or not it was obvious to the particular
defendant, it is whether or not it was obvious to a
reasonable and prudent person in the position of the
particular defendant and when stress is put for example
on the inexperience or lack of knowledge or particular
extenuating circumstances of a particular individual who
might be pointed to as potentially one whose conduct can
be called into question on these tests, when we are
considering whether or not the risk was obvious that is
irrelevant and sir it strongly comes out in this case
of Elliott, if I may direct you to it.

      Sir, this was a case of a 14 year old girl who
set fire to a shed by pouring white spirit on to the
floor and throwing a match on to it.

      Sir, if I might direct your attention very quickly
to that which the learned Magistrates found as facts
because it shows how it had been argued that what was
relevant was whether or not the risk was obvious to the
particular defendant.

      Sir, at page 1007 at letter j sir you find these
passages:

      ".... the magistrates accepted that they were
      bound to follow the 'model direction' of
      Lord Diplock which I have read.  It was,
      however, argued before them, and again
      before us by counsel for the respondent
      ...." who I might say it was the defendant
      in the case ".... that when in the first
      part of his test. Lord Diplock referred to
      'an act which in fact creates an obvious risk
      that property will be destroyed or damaged',
      he meant a risk which was obvious to the
      particular defendant.  This argument was
      accepted by the magistrates and is set out
      by them in the following passages ...."
                                        MR. KING



which is set out in their reasoning.

      It is important perhaps to realise the factual
basis of this sir.  It is as follows:

      "That while the ___ " and I will call her
      the defendant ".... had realised that the
      contents of the bottle which contained white
      spirit were possibly inflammable, she had
      not handled it before and had not appreciated
      how explosively it would burn and immediately
      become out of her control, thereby destroying
      the shed and contents and also placing her
      own life at risk."

It was found as a fact by the Magistrates:

      "That the respondent had given no thought
      at the time that she started the fire to
      the possibility of there being a risk that
      the shed and contents would be destroyed
      by her actions.  That in the circumstances
      this risk would not have been obvious to
      her or been appreciated by her if she had
      given thought to the m a tter."

Paragraph K:

      "That in reaching our findings set out
      herein we had due regard to the age and
      understanding of the respondent, her lack
      of experience of dealing with inflammable
      spirit and the fact that she must have been
      tired and exhausted at the time.

      L. That we accepted the interpretation of
      the effect of the decision in the case of
      R v. Caldwell put forward on behalf of the
      defendant.

      M.  That in particular we found it implicit
      in the decision in that case that a
      defendant should only be held to have acted
      recklessly by virtue of his failure to give
      any thought to an obvious risk that property
      would be destroyed or damaged, where such
      risk would have been obvious to him if he
      had given any thought to the matter.

      N. Accordingly having regard to our findings
      set out above we found the respondent not
      guilty of the charge and dismissed the
      information."
                                                            75


                                        MR. KING




And the judgment continues:

      "Before us, counsel for the appellant ..." which
      of course is the prosecution ".... has argued
      forcefully that the magistrates were wrong to
      adopt that interpretation of the decision in
      Caldwell.  He submits that the phrase 'creates
      an obvious risk' means that the risk is one which
      must have been obvious to a reasonably prudent
      man, not necessarily to the particular defendant
      if he or she had given thought to it.   It follows,
      says counsel, that if the risk is one which would
      have been obvious to a reasonably prudent person,
      once it has also been proved that the particular
      defendant gave no thought to the possibility of
      there being such a risk, it is not a defence that
      because of limited intelligence or exhaustion she
      would not have appreciated the risk even if she
      had thought about it."

Then sir the learned Judge sets out passages of Lord Diplock
in the case of Caldwell which at first glance suggested
that the Court in Caldwell was using the phrase "creates
an obvious risk" as meaning a risk which was obvious to the
particular defendant and he sets out those passages, but
then sir at page 1009 at letter B he says:

      "That the submission of counsel for the appellant
      is correct is to my mind, however, put beyond
      a peradventure by two later decisions of the
      House of L o r d s ."

Then he sets out Lawrence in the passages sir which we have
looked at and I have already drawn your attention to it
and the case of M i l l e r . Sir, I don't have to read those
out to you, and he says at letter j:

      "In the light of these last two authorities,
      we are in my judgment bound to hold that the
      word reckless in S.l of the Criminal Damage
      Act 1971 has the meaning ascribed to it by
      counsel for the appellant."

Sir, Lord Justice Goff's judgment is of significance
because he deals with the argument, well because there
is no evidence here that she was indifferent to the risk
therefore she was entitled to be acquitted and he says
that is wrong.

      Sir, if I can take you to that judgment.  In the
first passages he is dealing with his own feelings that
he is bound by authority and precedent and although he
might want to come to a different conclusion if authority
says to the contrary then he is bound by it.
                                                            76

                                        MR. KING



He sets out the findings of the Magistrates and pinpoints
the   two findings as to risk at letter e-f which are of
significance, namely:

     ".... she gave no thought at the time when she
     started the fire to the possibility of there
     being a risk that the shed and its contents
     would be destroyed;

      (4) this risk would not have been obvious to
      her or have been appreciated by her if she had
      given thought to the matter.

      I add that these conclusions were reached by
      the magistrates, having regard to the age and
      understanding of the respondent, her lack of
      experience of dealing with inflammable spirit,
      and the fact that she must have been tired and
      exhausted at the time."

He then sets out that which had been said in Caldwell, which
you  have already been shown sir, and at 1011, letter b:

      "Now, if that test is applied literally in
      the present case, the conclusion appears
      inevitable that, on the facts found by the
      magistrates, the respondent was reckless
      whether the shed and contents would be
      destroyed; because first she did an act which
      created an obvious risk that the property
      would be destroyed, and second she had not
      given any thought to the possibility of there
      being any such risk.

      Yet, if I next pause (as I have done, in
      accordance with what I conceive to be my
      proper function) and ask myself the question:
      would I, having regard only to the ordinary
      meaning of the word, consider this girl to have
      been, on the facts found, reckless whether
      the shed and contents would be destroyed,
      my answer would, I confess, be in the negative.
      This is not a case where there was a deliberate
      disregard of a known risk of damage or injury
      of a certain type or degree; nor is it a case
      where there was mindless indifference to a risk
      of such damage or injury, as is expressed in
      common speech in the context of motoring
      offences (though not, I think, of arson) as
       'blazing on regardless'; nor is it even a
      case where failure to give thought to the
      possibility of the risk was due to some
      blameworthy cause ...."
                                                           77

                                       MR. KING



      So he then has to ask himself the question at
letter e on that same page sir:

     "I therefore next ask myself the question
     whether I can, consistently with the
     doctrine of precedent, sensibly interpreted,
     legitimately construe or qualify the
     principle stated by Lord Diplock in
     Caldwell so as to accommodate what I
     conceive to be the appropriate result
     on the facts of the present case ...."

He then sets out between letters f-j sir that there had
been much controversy as to what the meaning of the
statement of principle of Lord Diplock had been and at
letter g sir he says this:

      "I find it striking that the justices,
      in reaching their conclusion in the present
      case, have done so (no doubt in response
      to an argument advanced on the respondent's
      behalf) by imposing on Lord Diplock's
      statement of principle a qualification
      similar to one considered by Professor
      Glanville Williams in his article ....
      This is that a defendant should only be
      regarded as having acted recklessly by
      virtue of his failure to give any thought
      to an obvious risk that property would
      be destroyed or damaged, where such risk
      would have been obvious to him if he had
      given any thought to the matter.  However,
      having studied Lord Diplock's speech, I
      do not think it would be consistent with
      his reasoning to impose any such
      qualification."

Sir, I do not need to read any further on that page
save on the next page sir, 1012 there is a citation from
a case called Pigg which was dealing with rape and from
that citation you can see there had been an attempt to
introduce a test of whether or not for the purpose of
recklessness in rape the question of whether there
was indifference to the risk.

      Sir, at letters d-e on page 1012 you can see the
citation from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in
the case of Pigg to which the present Judge, Lord Justice
Goff is referring and you will see, sir, that the citation
is this:

      "But, in the end, it seems to us that in the
      light of that decision ...." reference to
      Caldwell and Lawrence ".... as far as rape
                                                         76


                                        MR. KING



      is concerned, a man is reckless if either he
      was indifferent and gave no thought to the
      possibility that the woman might not be
      consenting in circumstances where if any
      thought had been given to the matter it
      would have been obvious that there was a risk


or whether, of course, she knew.

      Now sir at letter e this is the vital sentence
of Lord Justice Goff:

      "Now it cannot be disguised that the addition
      of the words 'was indifferent? and constituted
      a gloss on the definition of recklessness
      proposed by Lord Diplock in Caldwell."

He continues:

      "Furthermore, if it were legitimate so
      to interpret Lord Diplock's speech in relation
      to a case arising not under S.l of the Sexual
      Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 but under S.l
      of the Criminal Damage Act 1971, the effect
      would be that the second question posed by
      the magistrates in the case now before this
      court would be answered in the affirmative
      and the appeal would be dismissed, because
      there is no finding of fact that the
      respondent in the case before us was
      indifferent to the risk of destruction by
      fire of the shed and its contents.   This
      is an approach which I would gladly adopt,
      if I felt that I was free to do so.
      However, I do not consider that it is open
      to this court, in a case arising under the
      very subsection to which Lord Diplock's
      speech was expressly directed, to impose
      this qualification, which I feel would in
      this context constitute too substantial a
      departure from the test proposed by him."

Sir, it is a very clear authority, this case, for the
fact that the question whether or not there was indifference
to the risk on behalf of the person to whom you were
directing attention is not the appropriate test and the
question is simply twofold:  whether or not he knew or
gave no thought to the possibility of the given risk,
that risk being one which would have been obvious to
not him but the reasonably prudent man.

      Sir, my other comment on the law as it has been
stated so far to you which flows from this, is that I
                                                         79

                                         MR. KING



am bound to say, sir, that it is difficult to see what
particular authority can be put on the statement in
Gray's case, that is the West London Coroner ex parte
Gray, and you will know it sir but if you perhaps turn
to it if you have it?

      THE CORONER:   I have got it.




                MR. KING:   Where it is said
                                                    MR. KING


     MR. KING:   Where it is said - I have it in the All
England Report, sir, and I am now looking at page 136, it
is the passage which my learned friend Mr. Payne has
already read out to you where he lists the four
ingredients of the offence.   The final sentences of that
paragraph reads:

     "It should be emphasised, however, that a failure to
     appreciate there was such a risk would not by itself
     be sufficient to amount to recklessness."

I am bound to say, sir, I do not know what that means in
the context of the law as is clearly set out by
Lord Diplock in Lawrence and Caldwell.   It does not add
anything to it and if it meant to depart from it then you
are bound, sir, by what is said in Lawrence and Caldwell.

     THE CORONER:   May I just ask you a question?
Would you agree with me that in Lawrence, Lord Diplock
was trying to distinguish between section 1 offences in
the Road Traffic Act, namely, reckless driving, from
section 3 offences which are driving without due care and
attention?

     MR. KING:      Certainly, sir.

     THE CORONER:      You would agree with that?

     MR. KING:   Certainly, sir, but it is then picked
up, if I can put it that way, and adapted to manslaughter
by the Court in Seymour.   In fact I am now coming
directly on to that and the suggestion by my learned
friend Mr. Isaacs that the effect of Seymour is that when
one is applying the Lawrence test to manslaughter it is
not a question of whether or not there was a risk of
causing personal injury, but that there has to be an
obvious and serious risk of causing death, which I do
take issue with.   I now direct you as to why I take
issue with that.   Can I say, sir, that there is, in law,
no such qualification and the test is simply whether or
not the act or omission creates an obvious and serious
risk of causing personal injury.   That is what I
contend, sir.

     It is in fact dealt with by the Privy Council, sir,
inthe case to which my learned friend Mr. Payne referred
you, the Hong Kong case.   Sir, I know not, the citation
you have it in. mine begins on page 19, which may not be
the same.

     THE CORONER:     No, mine doesn't, but I will find it.

     MR. KING:   Mine is two pages from the end of the
Judgment, a sentence beginning:
                                                            81

                                                     MR. KING


     "Finally, in Seymour, the House of Lords held that
     the appropriate direction in motor manslaughter case
     was the same as that which had been suggested in
     Lawrence..."

     THE CORONER:      Is it at the beginning of a
paragraph?

     MR. KING:   It is in my version, sir, yes.         There
has already been a citation of Lord Diplock from
Caldwell, sir.   Sir, perhaps if you work....

     THE CORONER:      I have found it.

     MR. KING:      The Privy Council says this, sir:

     "Finally, in Seymour, the House of Lords held that
     the appropriate direction in motor manslaughter
     cases was the same as that which had been suggested
     in Lawrence, in cases where only the statutory
     offence had been charged.   Their Lordships think it
     right to add that the words added at the end of the
     answer to the certified question regarding the very
     high degree of the risk of death were added not to
     alter the pre-existing law as to manslaughter by
     recklessness, but only to point to those cases in
     which it still might be thought appropriate to
     charge the common law rather than the statutory
     offence."

It continues:

     "It is plain, as often happens in English criminal
     and civil law, the law applicable to involuntary
     manslaughter has developed on a case by case basis;
     has indeed developed rapidly in recent years since
     the offence of causing death by reckless driving
     appeared in section 50 of the Criminal (inaudible)
     Act 1977."

This is the important passage, sir:

    "Their Lordships are of the view that the present
    state of the relevant law in England and Wales and
    thus in Hong Kong, is clear, the model direction
    suggested in Lawrence and held in Seymour equally
    applicable to cases of motor manslaughter requires
    first, proof that the vehicle was in fact being
    driven in such a manner as to create an obvious and
    serious risk of causing physical injury to another,
    and secondly, that the defendant so drove either
    without having given a thought to the possibility of
    there being such a risk, or having recognised there
    was such a risk and nevertheless took it.   Once
                                                 MR. KING


     that direction is given it is for the jury to decide
     whether or not on their view of the evidence the
     relevant charge has been proved."

Sir, in my submission that is clear authority for the
fact that all that is found in Seymour, talking about
foresight, or obviousness, of death, is simply giving an
indication in motor cases when the Prosecution should
choose to charge manslaughter as opposed to an available
statutory charge of causing death by reckless driving.
Certainly it does not alter the law that what the obvious
and serious risk has to be of is of physical injury.

     I am bound to say if it is of any worth in the
argument, sir, there is no textbook authority to support
the view that that has come about, that change in the
law.   Smith and Hogan, Archbold, all commentators,
accept that the test is one of the obvious and serious
risk of personal injury.

     Sir, that is my submission on that aspect of it.

     Therefore, the jury in the present case, and I agree
with my learned friends thus far, and indeed the
submissions to you, first of all have to ask what was the
immediate cause of the deaths, and I agree with that.

     I am bound to say that when they ask that question,
all they then have to do is work backwards to whether
they can identify an act or omission of a person - in the
case of omission, a person who had a duty to act - which
they can identify as having been a substantial cause of
that cause.

     Sir, without trespassing on the evidence, if the
jury - and it must be open to them - if the jury were to
conclude that the cause of the deaths was overcrowding in
pens 3 and 4, and if the jury - as must be open to them -
were to conclude that the reason and cause of the
overcrowding in pens 3 and 4, the immediate cause, was
the influx of a large group of spectators into those pens
following the opening of concertina gates at about 2.52
and thereafter, and I submit that it must be open to them
on the facts to reach that conclusion and I don't address
you on the evidence of that, sir, save to say if it has
been suggested there is no evidence to support that
conclusion I would address you at length to identify that
evidence.   Having reached that point, then the next
question in logic is:  can they identify a person who
caused the opening of the concertina gates and the influx
of those people into the ground?   Not now dealing for
the moment with the obvious risks of that conduct, but
just factually.   In my submission again there is
evidence beyond doubt, and again if it was challenged I
                                                        83

                                                   MR. KING


would address you on it, that you can pinpoint conduct
and omissions, taken together, of individuals who had a
duty to act, which brought about that statement of
affairs.

     Therefore, the jury have to look at, on the
evidence, that conduct and omission.

     Sir, again I submit there is no question about there
not being evidence.   There is clear evidence to the
effect that a decision was given to open the concertina
gates which led to the influx of a large number of people
into the stadium.

     Equally, the evidence is not in dispute that that
influx and that decision was not accompanied by any steps
to divert those spectators.   Therefore the jury, in my
submission are entitled - and it is a question of
evidence which they would consider - but they must be
entitled to have left to them the question whether or not
the decision of the given individual to order the opening
of the gates without taking any measures to divert the
fans was itself an immediate cause of the deaths;
because one goes to that logical chain to which I have
referred you, sir.

     In my submission there is no question but that the
evidence is there on which they are entitled to reach
that conclusion.

     Then one deals with the test of unlawful killing
having regard to that conduct and omission which they are
now directing their minds to.   It is not a case, sir, of
one being entitled to say that because there are so many
different causes, "I shall not invite the jury to apply
the Lawrence/Caldwell test to one cause, which on the
evidence clearly has to be left to them as an immediate,
substantial cause of the deaths."

     Sir, in my submission when one reaches, therefore,
the question which I submit is central to the facts which
should be left to the jury of the decision to open the
gates, to order the opening of the gates and then to
allow in the influx of persons without any steps to
divert them, the question which should be left to the
jury is this, and I have done my best to frame that
question as to the obvious and serious risk in the light
of the Caldwell and Lawrence directions:  Did the act
and/or omission of the person who they are considering as
regards the act or omission of opening the concertina
gates and allowing in a large influx of persons without
taking any steps to divert those fans from the centre
pens, did that create an obvious and serious risk of
overcrowding and crushing in the centre pens in the
                                                       84

                                                 MR. KING


Leppings Lane terraces, thereby giving rise to an obvious
and serious risk of physical harm to those already in the
pens and to those who would enter thereafter, unless
steps were taken before the opening of the gates to close
off the entrance to the centre pens, and to divert
spectators who were about to enter the ground through
those concertina gates?

     In my submission, that question has to be answered
by reference to what would have been obvious to the
reasonably prudent person in the position of those who
the jury are looking to at this stage in their reasoning
as being responsible for the decision to open the gates
and the omission to take any steps to divert the fans.

     Sir, in my submission it cannot be disputed and
should clearly be left to the jury that they should take
from the Control Box, on the evidence, first of all
Mr. Duckenfield, and apply the question to him, and a
person in his position.   Then to Mr. Murray, and a
person in his position and then to anybody else in the
Control Box who they consider on the evidence would be
party to the decision to open the gates and the omission
to take any steps to divert the fans.




          Sir, I do not
                                                              85



                                                   MR. KING


      Sir, I don't - I may say I don't have to - identify
any person in the Control Box, other than saying there
were at least those two who should be considered for the
purpose of this question.   Sir, if you having considered
the evidence consider that it can be left properly to the
Jury in relation to any other member of the Control Box as
being a party to the decision to open the concertina gates
and allow in this large influx of people without taking
steps to divert them, any other individual who had a duty
to act to divert if there was this obvious and serious
risk, then so be it, sir. For the purpose of leaving it
to the Jury, in my submission, it cannot be gainsaid on
the evidence that Mr. Duckenfield was the person who gave
the order to open the gates, and that Mr. Duckenfield was
in a position, if he so chose, to give orders to divert.
Equally on the evidence Mr. Murray was in a position
whereby he could, on his evidence, have given orders or
taken a decision or taken steps to divert.   That was his
evidence.

     But, sir, I need only concern myself, in my
submission, with saying as long as there is just one
person who one can identify as having been party to the
decision to open the gates and allow in a large influx of
people, without taking steps to divert them, and having a
duty to act in the circumstances of the obvious and
serious risk which I have sought to identify, then that is
sufficient, sir, for leaving that to the Jury, because
that is one person they can look to.   It would be quite
false reasoning to say, because there are a number of
other people who just might fit the same set of facts,
therefore I won't leave any facts to the Jury.   That would
be quite false logic, in my submission.

     Equally, when one is asking the question, what was
obvious to a reasonably prudent person in the position of
Mr. Duckenfield, I stress the fact that the Jury have to
apply that, not on the basis of the particular lack of
experience or the particular lack of knowledge, or the
particular inadequacies prayed in aid of Mr. Duckenfield,
they just have to have regard to the ordinary, reasonably
prudent person, in the position of Mr. Duckenfield, in
that Control Box.  Of course the Jury are entitled to take
into account the circumstances as they find them to be,
but that is a Jury question, sir, and is not a question
for us to preempt.

     I do venture to suggest that on the basis of factual
reasoning which I have put to you as one which is open to
the Jury on the evidence, that really it comes down to a
relatively simple issue of fact for the Jury in relation
to the first limb of the Lawrence/Caldwell test, that is,
whether or not there was an obvious and serious risk of
personal injury, because another way of approaching the
                                                                  86

A
                                                       MR. KING


    question which I have already posed to you, sir, whether
    there was an obvious and serious risk of overcrowding and
    crushing in the centre pens by virtue of the entry of the
B   influx of people through the concertina gates unless steps
    were taken to divert them, is the simple question for the
    Jury, whether or not it was obvious to a reasonably
    prudent person in the position of Mr. Duckenfield in the
    circumstances, that at the time he was considering the
    decision to order the opening of the gates, one, the
    centre pens were full, approaching fullness, it doesn't
    matter what words are used in my submission - it is simply
    the question whether or not the centre pens were in such a
C   state that they could not be expected to take a large
    number, substantially more people in them - secondly,
    whether it was obvious to a person in the position of Mr.
    Duckenfield that those who were about to enter might - and
    I say it only has to go as high as this - might enter,
    seek to enter, those centre pens.

         Sir, in approaching that question, whether or not it
    was obvious to a reasonably prudent person in the position
    of Mr. Duckenfield, at that time, one, whether the centre
D   pens were full in the sense of they could not take any
    more people or any substantial numbers, and secondly,
    whether or not those who were about to enter might seek to
    enter those pens, in my submission the Jury are entitled
    to look at the facts which they know are certain facts,
    and to draw such inferences as they consider to be
    appropriate.

          This is not a case of where we are dealing with an
E   act or an omission remote from the immediate events
    leading to the deaths, that is to say, in the Zeebrugge
    case, all the observations of Mr. Justice Turner.   We are
    dealing with an attempt to prosecute those responsible for
    the system which was being operated at the time on the
    ship.   They were not actually responsible, and no one has
    suggested they were responsible, for opening the bow doors
    on the day, or responsible for it leaving harbour with the
    bow doors open.   What was being argued about ....
F        THE CORONER:   I think you are wrong, with great
    respect, because Mr. Stanley and Mr. Sabel were not
    responsible for opening a gate, the exact opposite,
    responsible for closing it.

         MR. KING:    I agree, sir, but they were not the
    defendants, sir, who were caught by the rulings of Mr.
    Justice Turner.   They were left in the frame, if I can put
G   it that way.   His observations were directed to the
    attempt by the Prosecution to convict those who had been
    responsible for the system.   Poor Mr. Stanley, even after
    the rulings of Mr. Justice Turner, could have still had
    his fate decided by the Jury, but the Prosecution decided,




H
                                                              87



                                                   MR. KING


no doubt fairly, that they were not really out simply to
prosecute one little individual at the bottom of the pile,
and so they did not pursue them.

     But, sir, all the comments and observations of Mr.
Justice Turner are directed to an argument based on
system, but here at this stage of the Jury's reasoning in
the present Inquest, they are simply dealing with a
decision to open concertina gates to allow in a large
influx of fans.   In my submission therefore, in deciding
whether or not it would be obvious to somebody in the
position of Mr. Duckenfield, a reasonably prudent person,
they are entitled to look to the evidence which is
available to them - undoubtedly available to them - first
of all as to the state of the pens at that time, as a
matter of fact.   Obviously as a matter of fact, sir, if
the Jury were to conclude that the centre pens at that
relevant time were half empty, there would be no question
of my even continuing this submission but, sir, it is a
question for the Jury, not for us, for them to decide on
the evidence what the state of the pens actually was at
the relevant time and, sir, if necessary, and I won't do
it now at 5-to-4, but if necessary and if it were in
dispute I could and will give you the references to the
series of witnesses which tends to show that at that time
the centre pens were either full, over full, approaching
fullness, but certainly had no room in them for a large
number of people.   They are entitled to have regard to the
evidence which is available to them of the means by which
the state of those pens could be observed by those in the
position of Mr. Duckenfield.

     Again it is a question of evidence and it is not a
question of simply accepting the word of those whose
conduct is in question by saying, "Well we did not see it
and we could not see it".  That would not be a proper
approach by the Jury, or indeed a proper approach by you,
sir, to withdraw that issue from them merely by reference
to what is asserted by the very person whose conduct is
called into question.  The Jury themselves have visited
the Control Box.  They have seen photographs, they have
seen videos, they have heard all manner of evidence from
varying people in different parts of the Ground, and they
have to take it together and assess it for themselves, and
it would be wrong for us, you, sir, to withdraw the issue
from them merely because of a conclusion which one of us
might come to. That is not the test, the test is, is
there evidence to leave to the Jury, and I submit, sir,
that is clear evidence which they should take into account
in deciding what was obvious to a person in the position
of Mr. Duckenfield, a reasonably prudent person.

     They should take into account evidence as a matter of
fact as to where the gates were located which were about
                                                  MR. KING


to be opened, as a matter of fact the evidence as to where
those gates led onto the concourse.  Again I won't go
through it, sir, it is not my function at this stage.
They should take into account such evidence as they have,
and there is evidence, of course, to this effect, as to
what would meet anybody coming through any particular
concertina gate in relation to the tunnel, and they are
entitled to ask themselves the questions, what would a
reasonably prudent person ask himself at the time the
decision to open the gates is being made, as to where
those people are going to go, and the question which that
reasonably prudent person would ask himself as to where
the gates led.

     Those are all matters for the Jury to decide in
resolving the issue, which I say they have to resolve,
whether or not to a reasonably prudent person in the
position, firstly I am dealing with Mr. Duckenfield, that
it would be obvious at the relevant time we are talking
about that, one, the centre pens were full, could not take
too many more people, if any, and secondly, that there was
a risk that the large group of people going through the
particular gate might go towards and find their way on the
centre pens through the tunnel.

     Those are questions which the Jury are eminently in a
position to decide.  I accept, having regard to all the
circumstances which have been prayed in aid along the line
so far, as to why they should conclude one way or the
other, but that is the Jury function.  Sir, if it was
necessary for me to point to evidence, which could help
them directly, of someone in the position of Mr.
Duckenfield as a Police Officer in the Control Box, there
is in fact the evidence of Mr. Marshall, in answer to
questions to myself.  Of course, he wasn't there on the
day inside but he was on the outside, and he was able to
give his own expert opinion, help, as to what would be
obvious to somebody on the inside.

     I accept, sir, that is only one piece of evidence
which they have to put in the balance, but what we are
dealing with at the moment is a submission that there is
not evidence upon which they can even direct their minds
to this issue and, sir, if you want the reference to Mr.
Marshall, it is Volume 30 of the transcript, starting at
page 8, and going through for these purposes to page 15.
Sir, I am not seeking to usurp the function of the Jury in
making these submissions to you, what I am saying to you
is it would be wholly wrong to withdraw from the Jury the
essential issue which is what would be obvious to a
reasonably prudent person in the position of first Mr.
Duckenfield, then Mr. Murray in the Control Box, in the
circumstances, I accept, which the Jury find prevailed at
the time, but that is a question of the Jury, as to how
                                                               89



                                                    MR. KING


much time   is available, what opportunity was there, what
questions   would be asked, what they knew, what they did
not know,   what they could know, but those are not
questions   which I have to give the answer to, sir.

     What I do say, sir, is it would be wholly wrong to
say on the evidence we have that the Jury cannot conclude
that it would have been obvious to anybody in the position
of Mr. Duckenfield, to take him for the moment, that one,
the centre pens at that relevant time just before he gave
the order were full and could not take any more people,
and secondly that when the gates were opened, which he
knew were about to be opened, the result would be a large
influx of people who would make their way, or might make
their way, that is all there has to be in my submission
for saying there is a duty to act to divert it, might make
their way onto the centre pens down the tunnel.




                                           If the Jury
If the Jury were to conclude that it was obvious then,
in my submission, someone in the position of Mr.
Duckenfield could properly be held to be guilty of
unlawful killing, his conduct and omission amounting to
unlawful killing, either on the basis that he knew of
the risk, and that would be a matter for the Jury
whether they accepted the evidence on that.  Again just
because he says so does not mean they have to accept
what he said or alternatively and certainly on the
evidence there is overwhelming evidence that he did not
turn his mind to the possibility of that risk because
we are now at that stage in the test where we are not
dealing with whether or not it was obvious to him;
that has already been determined at the first part of
the stage whether or not it was obvious to a reasonably
prudent person.  All the second stage concerns is
whether or not he either knew of the risk but continued
none the less with his decision and failure to divert
the fans or simply paid no thought to the risk, to the
possibility of the risk.

    If the Jury conclude either of those then, in my
submission, it is open to them to reach the verdict of
unlawful killing but I do stress again it is not at
this stage a case of saying that they must reach that
decision or they must not reach that decision.  It is
one eminently within their province.  I will perhaps
finish on this point, sir, a number of times one of us
has put to the Jury, was it obvious that people would
push through, for example? You have.very properly
said, "Wait a minute, it is a matter for the Jury to
decide first what the facts are" and, of course, that
is right.  All I am seeking to say at this part of the
submission is that it is very much a Jury question what
would have been obvious to the reasonably prudent
person in the case of Mr. Duckenfield or Mr. Murray in
the Control Box and secondly whether or not they knew
of the risk or paid no thought to the risk.  That is
probably a convenient time for me to stop.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Payne.

      MR. PAYNE: Just on one point of fact before you
rise, sir, in his submissions Mr. King has referred to
the Zeebrugge case and to the directions and judgment
of Mr. Justice Turner.  He said that Mr. Justice Turner
was not directing his rulings to anyone concerned with
the management of the ship or anyone concerned with
the —

     MR. KING:  I am sorry, I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.  I was saying he was not dealing
with those individuals who had been identified as
positively opened the doors or positively - if that
does not sound wrong - failed to ensure they were shut.
In other words, the people in the one or two counts;
in the first count there was Mr. Stanley, who was the
Assistant Bosun, and his alleged breach of duty was his
failure to close the bow doors when leaving her berth.
The second count was against Mr. Sabel, who was the
Chief Officer, who it was said failed to ensure that
the bow doors were secured closed when leaving the
berth and port.  All the other defendants, including
even the third one, who was of course the Master of the
ship, they were being attacked, if I can put it that
way, by the Prosecution on the grounds that the system
was so awful that it was obvious to anybody in their
position that there was this risk of that which Nos. 1
and 2 had committed committing it.

     MR. PAYNE:  That is correct, what Mr. King says.
The point I wanted to make clear was that one of the
candidates being considered by Mr. Justice Turner was
in fact the Captain, Captain Lewry, who was on the
ship, of course, at the material time.

     MR. KING:  Yes, but the distinction I was drawing
was not so much whether he was on the ship but whether
or not, like Mr. Duckenfield, he had ordered the doors
to be opened which no one suggests the Captain did, or
whether he was dealing with somebody who, it is said,
was party to a system which gave rise to a risk that it
might happen which is a very different question.

     MR. ISAACS:   Sir, on that point it may be
worthwhile you looking at what is set out at page 14 of
the transcript that deals with Mr. Justice Turner's
remarks to the Jury when, in fact, the Jury have
finished and gone out.   There is then some
consideration of the position of Mr. Stanley, a short
submission being made by Mr. Coward on his behalf which
you may have read.

      THE CORONER:    I have not read it.

      MR. ISAACS:    That may well assist and it is page
14.

     THE CORONER:  Mr. King, give me an indication of
how much longer you sure going to be with your
submissions?  I just want to gauge my time, that is
all.

     MR. KING:  I do not expect to be much more than
about half an hour at the most.

     THE CORONER:    Mr. Catchpole about how long do you
say you will be?
     MR. CATCHPOLE:  It is very difficult to say at the
moment, sir.  It really depends on what may be said
tomorrow but I would not think longer than half an
hour, possibly slightly longer, but not very long.

     THE CORONER:  Mrs. McBrien, are you going to make
any legal submissions?

     MRS. McBRIEN:  Yes, I am.  I do not know how long
I will be.  I am going to work on all the information
that I have had.

     THE CORONER:   Will you remember what I have said
to you, Mrs. McBrien, that it has got to be legal
submissions? You have heard the sort of stuff we have
been talking about.   You are very welcome to do it but
I am not going to listen to you on the facts.   I am not
going to do it.

     MRS. McBRIEN: Would I be able to use Mr.
Maxwell's submission quite a lot to put my case over?

     THE CORONER:  Not to put your case over, Mrs.
McBrien, but to make legal submissions, as indeed Mr.
Isaacs did.  He said, "I adopt them" and then adjusted
the submission or amplified it might be the more
correct description but you cannot and I will not
permit you to address me on the facts.  It is not for
me to say but if the people sitting round you were just
to have a quick glance at one or two of the items that
you have in mind they may be able to tell you whether
they think it is likely I will listen to that or not.
It may be that you are going to make legal submissions
but it is a very difficult subject this and I have
spent hours and hours trying to understand it.   I have
got my concerns.

     MRS. McBRIEN:  What I did do last night was go
through the submission made by Mr. Maxwell and I picked
out the very relevant points that I could use.

     THE CORONER:  If there is a point then I am more
than happy to hear you.  Just because you are not a QC
like Mr. Maxwell, it makes no difference to me.  So
long as it is within the rules that is all I am
interested in.

     MRS. McBRIEN:  It will be in legal language
because I will use passages that have been used in that
if that is all right.  I know it is repetitive and you
said you do not want that.

     THE CORONER:  Obviously I do not want that.   That
makes sense, does it not?
     MRS. M cBRIEN: To develop my theme and to bring in
what I need to bring in I would need to be a little
repetitive actually.

     THE CORONER:  The bit that worries me is the
development of the theme, you see.  This is the bit
that worries me and I think we are going to come to a
sticky end over this but we will see.

     MRS. McBRIEN: Before I sit down, I was wondering
is it possible to apply a verdict to an individual
rather than to the whole 95?

     THE CORONER:  I will direct the Jury on that but I
can answer that question for you.  The Jury, as indeed
Mr. Maxwell has said in his submission to me quite
correctly, has a duty to consider each individual
individually.  They can group them but they start off
from the principle that each one is unique.  Each
individual is very special and individual to somebody
and so they deal with each individual.  They may come
back, of course, with a verdict which would be similar
for some or all, we do not know, because I do not know
what they are going to do yet.  None of us know.

     M R S . McBRIEN: The reason I said that is that my
case is actually different as you must know, as I think
everyone has realised.    There are certain differences
with the way I have been putting my points over.

     THE CORONER: Mrs. McBrien, you will not be able
to put differences of that nature to me, I am sorry.
It is a question of fact that.   Anyway, we will see
what we do tomorrow.   Can I just leave a few questions
with you because I do not see why you should have a
totally quiet evening? Mr. Russell, were you going to
say something?

     MR. RUSSELL:  My learned friend, Miss Addleman,
and I were just a little concerned that you were not
even interested as to whether we were going to make a
legal submission to you.

      THE CORONER: No, no.    The reason why I did not
turn to you is that I have already made an assessment
as to how much time you are going to take and I do not
think we are going to start with the summing up
tomorrow.    I have not forgotten you but it would not
have mattered if I had said one minute, half an hour or
an h o u r .

     MR. RUSSELL:   Yes, sir.

     THE CORONER: There are one or two aspects which
perhaps when you come back again you might like to
think about and assist me.  I look at you but I include
everybody, of course, in this.  The first point is that
Mr. Maxwell's paragraph 6.3, namely the break in the
link in causation, which I do not have to repeat, but I
am looking at you, Mr. Payne, in a way because I would
be interested to hear what you say in the light of what
you have put to me with regard to causation and the
various possible headings which you suggested to me.   I
say that, of course, because not only did Mr. Isaacs
adopt it but he extended it to a certain extent and I
shall be interested to see what further arguments, if
any, can be developed on that front.

    The second point which is a very trivial one is
that Mr. Isaacs said that Mr. Justice Turner's judgment
is binding on me.  You may well be right but I am not
quite sure on what basis you are saying that. If it
was the Divisional Court or the Court of Appeal then I
would agree and I am not suggesting the Crown Court is
a more superior Court to a Coroner's Court but I am not
sure whether they are not on slightly different
strands.  Anyway I shall be interested to hear what you
say on that.

    The third point is to do with the point which Mr.
King has raised in relation to Lawrence. Elliott and in
particular ex parte G r a y , which is in fact the most
recent case.   It is a case from the Divisional Court or
the Court of Appeal and it is a case which is
specifically directed at Coroners and specifically
directed as to the type of direction which Coroners
should give.  I think it is only fair to say that my
inclination is to base, assuming that I were to decide
to leave the option to the Jury, my direction on the
law on that case.   I say this because you might want to
think about it further and indeed other people might
want to come back.




                                    /The last point.

      Now the last point, well there are two other
points actually.  I noticed that those who submitted
that the case should be withdrawn, the one case that
nobody referred to was ex parte Higgins which is of
course another Coroners' case which deals to a slight
extent with the question of whether unlawful killing
should be withdrawn.

      There may have been a reason.  You may have felt
that the other cases were stronger.  I think in that
particular case, and this is really the point I am
driving at, you will remember it I am sure, this is
the case of the lorry which drove during one of the
strikes and somebody was knocked over, the Coroner
clearly did not feel this was reckless but did not
withdraw it.  He was overruled on various other matters,
I have forgotten who the Judge was, made some comment
about him being able to withdraw it.

      It looks to me as if that is an obiter rather
than a binding decision but it is another aspect of
where somebody has applied their mind to this issue
in a coronal context as opposed to a criminal context.

      MR. ISAACS:  Can I mention that sir.  The only
report I have got of that particular decision is one
in the'Justice of the Peace*. I don't know if you have
got a better report?

      THE CORONER:  It is in this book in full and you
have got it, I think?

      MR. ISAACS:  No, I have not.  I borrowed it from
Mr. Maxwell.    Do you think we could take a copy before
we go tonight?

      THE CORONER:   Yes, indeed.

      MR. CATCHPOLE:  Sir, on the point you last raised
perhaps you could just amplify.  It is probably my
ignorance.

      Is your concern that if you conclude whether in
respect of certain individuals or in totality that there
is no evidence on which a reasonable jury properly
directed could conclude that there was unlawful killing,
that you might not be able to withdraw that verdict,
that is ex parte Higgins, I was not quite sure what
your concern arising out of the case was?

      THE CORONER:  Basically my concern is if I read
this case correctly, and that is why I am drawing it
to your attention, my impression is that the Divisional
Court said that a Coroner was perfectly entitled to
withdraw a verdict from the jury if he did not think it
was appropriate, and indeed I think it has tended to
be interpreted as saying that the Coroner must withdraw
if he does not think it is appropriate but my reading
of the case is that that is not in fact what it says,
it merely says he may, if he wishes, and the question I
ask is that different to R. v. Galbraith for instance?

      MR. CATCHPOLE:   So in other words it is a question
of whether you have the discretion to withdraw   it or
whether it      is an obligation on you to withdraw it    basically

      THE CORONER:   That is basically what I am asking.

      Now the last point is this, and I suppose I am just
being inquisitive but I am interested in this.

      In the Privy Council case, the Hong Kong case,
there is one particular passage which interests me which
you may feel that you might want to consider. On my
version it      is on page 44.  You remember where you    drew
my attention to it where it says:   "Finally in SEYMOUR",
can you recollect?

      MR. KING:   Yes.

      THE CORONER: Well about two paragraphs above that
there is a sentence which reads:

      "Their Lordships emphasise that in this
      passage ...." and he is referring I think
      to Lawrence there ".... Lord Diplock was
      speaking of an obvious and serious risk
      of causing physical injury created by the
      defendant.  He was not there concerned to
      deal with cases where the conduct complained
      of was of a defendant's reaction or lack
      of reaction to such a risk created by another
      person."

Now I would be most interested to know whether this
particular passage has any particular relevance from a
legal point of view to the matters before us.  In fact it
reappears in a slightly different form right at the end,
about ten lines from the end of this judgment.  It is
in the middle of a paragraph I am afraid.  It says:

     "Their Lordships did not find it necessary
     to hear counsel for Kong on this issue and
     it would not be right for them to offer
     any detailed comments upon the facts beyond
     observing that the summing-up does not seem
     to have distinguished between an obvious risk
     created by those navigating each hydrofoil
     by their own navigation and the response by
     those on board one hydrofoil to any obvious
     risk created by the navigation of the other."
      It is the same point but put in a slightly different
way.  I would be just interested to hear whether you think
there is anything to be said on that.  It is not homework,
by the way.  It sbunds like it, but it is not.

      Tomorrow then at 10 o'clock if that is okay with
everybody.

              following morning at 10.00 a . m .)

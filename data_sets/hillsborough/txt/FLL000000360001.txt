                                   Hillsborough Inquiry


At its meeting on Wednesday, 24th May, 1989, the Anti-Hooliganism Committee
put forward the following recommendations:-


i)     We should move towards increased seating in grounds, but retain low-depth
       paddock areas for standing. Suggest th a t we stipulate a maximum number
       of rows for terraced areas.

       We would need to appoint qualified people (i.e. structural engineers) to
       inspect each ground and report back as soon as possible.

H)     Local plans should be extended to incorporate details of clubs' medical
       facilities.

iii)   It was fe lt th a t minimum requirements should be laid down for medical
       facilities at grounds in relation to ground capacities. League office to
       convene a meeting of 2 or 3 club doctors to compile such requirements
       as soon as possible.

iv)    Approaches to stadia - recommend th a t police adopt the 'filte r system'
       where possible for high-profile matches, i.e. tickets are checked away from
       ground and only people with valid tickets are allowed to proceed to the
       turnstiles. Obviously, this depends on the position and lay-out of each
       ground.

v)     In order to g e t people into grounds earlier, we feel th a t clubs should look
       at providing b e tte r facilities for refreshments and also pre-m atch entertainm ent
       such as the use of a video screen. The Government could assist by relaxing
       the rules on capital allowances for the purchase of video screens.

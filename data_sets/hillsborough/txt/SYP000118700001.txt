              the      patrol     van before      the briefing at 9.0 0 a. nr.



             At 9=00 a„m„           t o g ether with all      other     dog   handlers,       I attended       in the

              duties      that day.        I was    informed that        I w o u l d be working         in company

Tave rn to the Park Hotel                       public houses.



The    first        build up of Liverpool                      s upporters     I saw was d i r e c t l y across

M i d dl e w o o d R o a d from M i d d l ew oo d T a v e r n where                 there were a group of

a p p r o x i m a t e l y SO men,         all    of w hom were           drinking      pints of beer or                lager

and all were well                 behaved.



At    11.53 a.iTi. ;we a t t e n d e d           behind the B e e l e y Wood Public House where a

Special          C o ns ta bl e    had found a s u spicious                  car.     On checking            the     car

out    via FI Control               we found that               it was    stolen,.      We     remained with the

vehicle          until    we were         informed the owner                 could not       be    contacted.

R e s urne d pat r o 1 at          12. 03      p .m .     At    this t ime there was a ma r k e d

increase           in cars and           pedestrians            on M i d d l e w o o d Road.       There were a

large      number        of    people         seated on the wall              outside    the S h e f f i e l d

W e d ne sd ay      training        ground,        many of them having                cans     of beer and            lager

on the wall            beside       them,       some having           in excess       of 8 large             cans,

a l t h o ug h     I d i d n ’t see anyone               being     disorderly        in any way other                than a

bit of singing.                   The    crowds         in and a r o u n d M i d d l e w o o d Roa d         continued        to

increase          steadily         up to E.1Q            p.m.    when a call was         given       that       officers

w a n t ed a l it tl e, as s i s t a n c e         in clearing           the Horse and J o c k e y             public

house.           We f o l l ow ed anoth er              transit     to the     pub where upon our arrival

I saw a very             large      crowd       in the front           car    park of the          premises.

There was           broken glass              on the floor and            in the      road,       empty glasses

were     left on top of                 cars    parked         in front      of the    pub and hundreds                of

empty beer and                lager      cans were          strewn about.            People were             laying on a

grass     bank opposite                 the    pub with a full            pint glass         in each hand.                 Men

were laying,             stand i n g and sitting                 in the      car    park with a pint               c;>f beer

in each hand and anot h e r                     full      pint on the floor at               their feet.              1 saw

a man a p p r o x i m a t e l y 6*0" tall,                  white,     crew    cut hair,          beer   belly,

w e a r i n g a y e l l o w shirt and jeans                     carry 4 pints         of lager       into       the     car
                                                                                                                  "PAGE'
                       '                "                                                                          R231

      k and begin to drink                    them one        by one.        Officers         began to usher                  the

fans    off    towards         the ground and this man offered me his half full

fourth      pint       saying      “Here mate          I c a n ’t m a n a g e        this one".         I had

w a t c h e d him      consume      three and a half                 pints     in a p p r o x i m a t e l y    15 minute



As the      pub and         car    park       cleared at 2 r2S            p.m.       three women from the

premises       came out wit h black                   bin     liners and began to                 clear       up all          the

empty     cans and glasses.                       One white y o u t h wearing a white                   top was           so

drunk     h e .was      being      s u p ported by two             other men as they went                     down

W a d s l e y Lane,        anot h e r       lad was    stagg e r i n g      b a d l y , but the       others         did

not appear          too     bad.



As we had this              crowd under escort a call                       came over         that there was

trouble at the Park Hotel                          public     house.        On our arrival            there,         which

took     only one minute,                   everything was           in order.           Po l i c e Serge a n t

J o h n s o n ’s transit          was alre a d y at the              scene and          I was     informed        by that

o fficer      that all         was under            control.        T   then went          back up W a d s l e y Lane

to sear ch for any s tragglers                        from the Horse and Jockey.                        Whilst           in

the area       I made a check                 of the Beehive            public        house at       the      top of Far

Lane and there was a good number                              of fans making             their way down Far

Lane    towards         the ground.                A short      time    later        I heard S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

M a r s h a l l ’s voice       over         the    radio    saying      open the gates             because        there

was    still     a large          crowd       in Leppings          Lane     from C atch Bar Lane.                    I

could see S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall                  standing       on the wall           of the       bridge

near    the L e p pings           Lane       end    I then heard his voice                   come over         the       radio

to    ’open the        bloody g a t e ’ .            It was       obvious      from his voice              that      the

s i t u a t i o n at   the L e p pings Lane                t u r n s t i l e s was    very serious.             From

where we were we               could see that               the    crowd outside            the gates was so

large     that      it s pi l l e d across L e p pings Lane..                        We got, out of. our

vehicle and stop p e d any further                          s u p p o r t e r s making      their way towards
the ground tel Iing              them to take their             time as the           m atch was

delayed.          As we Were doing           this a call            came over for all           dog handlers

to" go im m e d i a t e l y to gate 0 and onto                the     pitch.        Once    back    in the

vehicle we made            our ,.«ay to gate '0 and             parked the van             in the    central

reserve        of P e n i s t o n s Road.



T og e th e r w ith other         dog handlers          I then made m y         way    into the ground

where we were            told    to wait     on the slip            ramp    leading down onto             the

playing area.              There was o b viously a lot of noise and at                          this time         I

was    under      the     impr e s s i o n that    it was     some sort of public order

situation.            I saw one        lad walk up the          ramp with an obvious                broken arm

but at that time            I saw no other           casualties.             After    been stood          there

for a short           time we were          told to return          to our vehicles           by -Police

Sergeant Hill             of the Dog Sect i o n and           await        further    instructions.



Once     back outside           inform a t i o n started to filter              out     (not over         the

radio)        as to what        had happened and a m b u l a n c e s and other Po l i c e

vehicles         started to arrive,



I a s si st e d    in traffic          duty outside       gate 0 for the ambulances.                       After

a while        I d o n ’t know how        long,    we were a gain told to take                     our dogs

into the ground.                This   time we went         onto      the    pitch and formed up in

front        of the N o t t i n g h a m Forest Fans         on the kop,             Inside the       ground       I

saw a cordon of Po l i c e across                 the    centre       of the    pitch and          some

supporters w a l k i n g         about    in a daze.          From where        I was       I c o u l d n ’t see

a n y o ne    lying     on the ground.         I saw two Liverpool                  fans ejec t e d from

the South S t a n d        near    the k o p end because              they were       seated with

N o t t i n g h a m fans and an argument was                taking         place.     The    fans    on the

kop.. obvi ously        r e a lised what had h a p p e n e d and the m a j o r i t y               of them

s tood       in silence.        On several        occ a s i o n s   it was asked over              the    radio
                                                                                                      PAGE          /
                                                                                                      R231      j


if the game was            going    to be called off and the                reply was,        that    it

was,    but we were         not to    inform s u pporters at this time because                        if

they    left the s ta d i u m it would           impede e m ergency services.                  We

r e m a i n e d in the gound        until    it was a n n o u n c e d that the m atch was

cancelled then as            fans started to          leave we went           outside.       Myself and

Police C on st a b l e B a k e r went on foot: to the                 roundabout at P e n i s t o n e

R o ad /L e p p i n g s Lane,     but all   fans    passing       that way were         subdued and

orderly.



A call     came over        the    radio of fighting            in H i l l s b o r o u g h Park,    but we

did not attend.             Once    the   crowd at our          location had star t e d to thin

out we made           our way      back to the van.         A few of the            crowd were abusive

but very upset,            one man saying          "You don't        need fucking        dogs you         need

stretchers,,"



B y the time we got             back to the van,         suppo r t e r s were        being    loaded onto

buses    to go back         to M id l a n d S t a t i o n and    so we made         our way over

S h i re cl if fe     and drop p e d down into        the Cit y Centre.             It took    so    long

to get     into       the Cit y Centre       that, fans that          had walked from the ground

were a lr e a d y w al k i n g     up Snig Hill-.        We e s c orted a g roup of them to

the M i d l a n d S t a t i o n where we      remained until           the football          PSVs

arrived.         A call     came    over the     radio    of fighting          in Pond Street             so we

made    our way onto P l a tf or m          ’B ’ where    there were          two    rival    groups       of

            Further       to my previous           report,.       As a result       of the    in s t r u c t i o n for

             and   parked my van             in the    central     reserve along with anot h e r              dog van

             driven by PC          1443       Ellis,     2 other    dog vans were          parked against         the

             kerb on P e ni st on e R o a d between Gate 0 and the gate that                          gives access

             to the gymnasium.                Police Transit        vans    that    started to arrive at, the

             scene as a result               of O p er at io n Supp o r t were also         parked    in front         of

             the ground on P e ni st on e Road City Centre                     side of Gate 0 leaving                 one

             lane of the         c ar ri a g e w a y clear.

            Wh i l s t   standing         on the   central     reserve       I saw that an am b u l a n c e       that

            had driven         into       the ground via Gate 0 was              having     difficulty        leaving

            the ground         because        he was     having    to   reverse     out.     Once    this ambulance

            had    left the        ground the next, a m b u l a n c e       to arrive was        d i r e c t e d by

            myself       to the       gate for     the g y m nasium      so that they could go             in one

            gate and then             come    out of Gate 0 all          subsequent        ambulances      that

            a rr i v e d whilst          1 was   standing     in P e n i s t o n e Road were d i r e c t e d    to do

            the    same»

            Once    em e r g e n c y v e h icles      came out of Gate O they turned                 left along

            Pen i s t o n e R o ad       towards   the    roundabout at L e p p i n g s Lane all           this       route

            was    kept     clear        by Police     officers doing         traffic duty.

A traffic mobile          was   doing duty       on P e nistone   Road opposite       the

bottom of Herries          Road dir e c t i n g vehicles     from City      up Herries

Road so as    to keep       the    stretch of P e nistone Road        in front       of the

ground    clear,    unfortunately       there were       so many vehicles          that

ambulances    approaching          the ground      from City were     getting       caught

up in the    traffic       tail back.

I do not know how long I was w a i t i n g             in Penistone    Road until all

Dog Handlers       were    ordered    into   the    ground but when I did go in,

there was    a traffic m o t o r c y c l i s t    showing ambulances        where    to

enter    the ground.

I do not    know details          of other   officers     at the location where I

was other    than PC       1443    Ellis who did not assist me because                there

was no need.        On the whole,       it appeared       that once    at    the    ground

ambulances    had a clear run into               and out of the pick up area.

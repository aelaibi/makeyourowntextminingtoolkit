                        born            and am 53 years old.             I am a

     qualified ambulance man with SYMAS stationed at Doncaster.

     I have worked for SYMAS since 1970.



2.   On Saturday 15th April        1989 my tour/)of duty was 0900 to

     1730.    I was working with                              It was about

     1510 when we were in the mess room at Doncaster that the

     telephone rang.       A Leading Ambulance man                      took the

     call.



3.   In consequence of the message he got we were told to go at

     once to Hillsborough football ground at Sheffield where

     there had been a major disaster.               We were told some were

     dead and others suffering crush injuries.



4.                  and I went to Sheffield and although I was not

     quite sure where Hillsborough was I drove and we arrived at

     about 1530.     I drove off Leppings Lane into the perimeter of

     the ground, I stopped and before we could get out the police

     opened   the    ambulance    door.       The    police    t ol d    us   the

     casualties from the tunnel were on the ground just outside

     the gates.      At the time there were           lots of police and

     spectators about and outside the ground police, fire service

     and other vehicles were parked.



5.   I went to a patient on the floor, to ascertain his medical

     condition.       My    colleague   did    the    s ame   with      another
     patient.     With assistance of the police we got stretchers

     off the ambulance, placed the patients on the stretchers and

     loaded    them into the ambulance.          We then drove         to the

     Northern General hospital, with police escort.                 It was a

     clear run,   as the police had made sure the roads were open

     for us.



6.   On arrival at the hospital the two patients were handed over

     to the hospital    staff.      One patient        was    examined     in

     casualty by a doctor and we were told to take him to ward

     50.   The porters took the other patien^srf



7.   After leaving the patient in the ward I returned to the

     ambulance.      The porters gave me         a s t re tch er,      bu t no

     beddi ng.    I obtained     some   sheets    and blankets          and we

     returned to Hillsborough.          I d r o v e from   Doncaster       to

     Sheffield, but from there on                            drove.      He is

     not fully qualified so I let him drive and I looked after

     the patients.



8.   We went back to the Leppings Lane end and over the radio we

     were directed to the gym.      We followed another ambulance

     round the perimeter road of the ground to the gym.               We were
                                  omcfcfi-
     directed by an ambulance            to   park    behind          another

     ambulance in Penistone Road; that order was straight away

     overruled and we were directed inside to the gym.

     reversed the ambulance into the ground.               Inside Mr
      from Rotherham told us both to get a stretcher and I went

      through the gym, walked past where bodies were laid to the

      end where live patients were.



      There was a patient being treated by a paramedic and he

      helped me put the patient on the                str e t c h e r .     Another

      ambulance     man    helped     me carry the patient back                to my

      ambulance.                           had already put his patient on

      the ambulance,       and I loaded mine.         Again with the police

      escort we went to Northern General.                Again we travelled

      without difficulty.           On arrival a member of the hospital

      staff came and put plastic wrist bands on the patients.                         We

      carried the patients into casualty and put them on waiting

      trolleys.     We replaced the stretchers and signalled that we

      were   "green" over the radio to Rotherham control.                          Radio

      reception was good.         We were told to stand by.



10.   About ten minutes later, by radio from Rotherham control we

      were   told   to go     to    Royal    Hallamshire        and       contact      a

                                    There was at this time no indication

      of any urgency.         We began the journey until                  we got to

      Pitsmoor Road, where we were held up by a car on fire.                        The

      fire   service      we re    attending    and   after       the      fi re    was

      extinguished we continued.           Because of the delay I contacted

      control, told them what had happened and asked if we were to

      proceed with blue light on.           We were told to do this.



                                      15
      We arrived at the Royal Hallamshire.               I think it would be

      about 1715/1720.              I saw             who indicated that she

      wanted   two stretcher cases moving from ward F2 to King

      Edward hospital.              We took two patients, or&male, one female

      to King Edward hospital and again reported "green".             Control

      told us to return to Doncaster which we did,               arriving at

      about 1725.



      During the entire incident I did not encounter any hassle or

      abuse.        There were lots of spectators about but no trouble

      from them.



13.   We had full co-operation from the police, and had no trouble

      at all with radio communications.                We stayed on channel 4

      during the entire incident.



Dated the       '                day of                  1989

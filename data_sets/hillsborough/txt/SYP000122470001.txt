                    SUBJECT:                  HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY.



                                           further to my previous correspondence relating to the
                        Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989 I wish to inform the enquiry
                        tea® a development regarding my particular experience with the two Liverpc
                        supporters/witnesses, the believed, half brothers |         [and___________
                                           It appears from my enquiries with the incident bureau
                        that the above mentioned persons say not have any missing close relatives
                        after all® Certainly they informed me that they had lost one brother in
                        the incident and that one younger brother was also missing, which they
                        believed to be dead also.
                                           At that time there was chaos and bewilderment and was
                        therefore at that time not condusive to in depth enquiry to ascertain the
                        extent*: of the truth behind the information given and as a result I took
                        what had been said to me to be the truth,continuing to search through the
                        corpses for a sixteen year old, which in the event proved to be a total
                        wasted exercise. It was also totally inconsiderate to involve personally
                        the brothers in the search and therefore no identification could be made.
                                           1 point all my actions out because if it is a.*ifa:et;
                        that they had no brothers deceased ti^ey must have had some other reason
                        perhaps of such a macabre nature as nay be to#extreme to contemplate.
                                           May I request that when the teas makes enquiries into
                        the above point that they consider the fact that there could be a mistake
                        or that the deceased could have diiferent names to the above mentioned
                        persons. Whatever the outcome I would like for my own peace ©f mind to
                        know the result of the enquiry. I can be contacted by telephone on

                                          Submitted for the information of West Midlands Police
                        who will be able to cross reference this correspondence with my previous
                        message. tneir reference number not known.

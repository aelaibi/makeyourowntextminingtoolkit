Dear Mr Pearce

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY:     IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERIM REPORT -
TWERTON PARK, BATH

This letter follows up recent enquiries by members of my staff
of your authority about the implementation of the urgent
recommendations contained in the Interim Report of the
Hillsborough Inquiry.

The former Home Secretary was concerned that all of the Interim
Report's recommendations should be complied with and wished to
be assured that those regarded by the Inquiry as urgent had been
implemented unless it could be shown that it was not practical
to do so, and that an equivalent degree of safety was being
secured in some other way.

I understand that in the case of Twerton Park your authority
decided not to seek a reduction of 15% in the standing capacity,
as in recommendation 2(b) of the interim report, because the
standing accommodation at the ground had been recently
re-assessed in line with the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(the Green Guide).     The Department's interpretation of this
recommendation was that the Inquiry was concerned that the
density limits recommended in the Guide might be too generous and
that until they could be verified, an additional margin for error
should be built into the assessed figures. This was intended as
a temporary measure which would, with others, help maintain
safety in the short term.
I realise that decisions relating to the safety certificate for
the Twerton Park ground are entirely a matter for your authority,
but I should point out that so far as can be seen, yours is the
only authority which has decided not to comply with this
recommendation. I am therefore asking that your authority should
reconsider its earlier decision and, together with Bath City
Football Club and Bristol Rovers Football Club, set a capacity
for the standing accommodation at Twerton Park which takes into
account recommendation 2(b) of the Interim Report.     I shall be
grateful if you would let me know the outcome.

                                         Yours sincerely




                                         P E BOLTON

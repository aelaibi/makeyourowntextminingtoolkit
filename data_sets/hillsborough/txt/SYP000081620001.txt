ABC.

Initially the flow of fans                 through this        turnstile was     slow and

orderly,     consisting        of ma in l y families       or singles or       pairs of

p red omi nan tly males        in their early twenties-                 The mood of these         fans

was    very good natured and from talking                  to a number       of these     fans      it

became apparen t        that    they had had not trouble                in travelling     to

Sh e f f i e l d or reaching the ground.               It was also apparent        that while a

number    of these      fans    had been drinking alcohol                none were drunk and

their    behaviour was         jovial,     but   socially acceptable.

However,     I was a p p r o a c h e d   numerous      times    by Not ti ng ha m Forrest       fans

who    had kno wingly      pur chased tickets           for the Leppipf^s Ln       ( L i v e r p o o l?

end of the ground.

Due to the      capacity       crowd expected all were ad v i s e d that              they wo ul d be

al lo we d entry to the secti on of the ground to w hi ch the tickets

applied.

At this time       I also      saw large      numbers of youths           gathering    beyond the

bounds    of the g r o u n d,    consuming drinks          f rom tins      prior to entering              the

g round.

At this     time most fans en tering             the    ground were searched for

prohibited articles.

At about 2 . QQpm       (14 Q Q ? the volume/of          fans    entering    the ground through

these turnstiles         increased d ranyat i ca 1 ly to a point at wh ich only small

numbers     of fans were        searched and at this             time    I noticed that a far

greater     proportion of these fans                had consumed alcohol        and that as a

result     some were ad vi se d          regarding     their behaviour.        On three        separate

occ asions    I heard abuse         s houted by fans at myself and other Of ficers

at times when searching was                 being    carried out.         On none of these

occasions was        I able to       identify the offender.               It was app arent        that

once at the turnstiles             the fans were         now    impatient    to enter the

ground.      The fans were also             by now more        vociferous,    a l t h o u g h their was
still a jo viality about                            the mood of most.

Due to the        large number                      of offenders an arrest was                                                                not the app rop ria te

I could see Police Of fic er s               scaling and at the top of the                    safety

fence.      Fans were       in a similar         position to the              rear*of     the fence.        I

could also        see bodies      lying      in all     places to a d&pth of about 7 ’

being    forced agains t        the fence a nd concrete                    barrier   by the    pressure         of

the supporters         behind,       some were       obviouslyysead.

Off ice rs were       trying    to    pull    fans over            tjre fence,    while   others were

encouraging        fans wh ic h      remained standi Jig to move                 back up the stand to

relieve     the    pressure     on those at Wswyf r o n t .

I mov ed    immediately to the gate                 o/ Pe n 3, wh ich          I could see to be

qpen.      Qff icers were       trying       to /pull the dead and               i/jured out t h r o u gh

this gate,        and a s si s te d a f a n / w hose         leg was trapped between the               crush

of bodies and the           concrete      gate step.               His ajnkle was o b vi ou sl y b r o k e .

I also     prevented fans w h i c h were             falling         throifcgh the upper      half     of

the gate     from falling         onto    him by kneeling acr os s                him and al lowing

them to     land on my back an d             roll    off.

After about 2 minut es            the    pressure       from the fans above was               eased and          I

pulled him from the gate and                  laid him on the               pitch.    He was- thus      in no

danger and        I returned to the           pen to a s s i s t .

Due   to a number        of bodies       having been cleared from the area                      of the

gate,    I climbed throu gh           the gate a nd where                 necessary by walking         on the

bodies,     I moved to the           rear of the        pen f rojrf there         I assisted     in the

removal     of a number        of bodies,        initially*^ to the            rear of the      pen,    and

finally,     when     clear enou gh to the gafre to pen 3 and a vent                           in the

fence    between the        pen and the         p i t cjn.

I can remember a number               of bodies w h i c h           I handled:

                                  A girl,       about        16 years        old,   who   I helped      carry to the gate.

                                  She was       clearly wearing               only a shirt          to her upper body,        but

                                   I heard no comments made                    to myself       or the other       officers

                                  regarding           this    fact.        I believe      she was      dead.

                                  I believe           him to have had a broken n e / k .                 As    I lifted     him

                                  another male              fan of the same age,              w^o was    standing     facing me

                                  I said something                 to the fan,        then    ignored him,       moving    the

    K        b                    body to the gate                 of pen 3.

                                  face.       This was            only very brief as           the otheiy officers          pulled

                                  the body off and                 clear,

                 Whi lst     in the pen and on the                   pitch     I can remember          that    I a ss is te d with

                 other bodies           but   I can remember               no details        of them.

                 During          the entire op er ati on              I was aware         of fans    to the rear of the           pen

                 and      in the stand above                shouting abuse          such as     "Fucking m u r d e re rs ."       At

                       % did as they were               told without           complaint       or    comment.

                 Sh or t l y after entering                 the    pen,    I had seen a small           group of y 6 u t h s ,

                 I did not see where                  the    barrier        landed and       I could s e V no     reason for

           At about 3 . 4 0 p m      <1540)    I lef%      the   pen to join a line formed by

           officers across           the    pitch/      As one we wal ke d first        towards the Notts

          Forest      supporters,          ingoing      so redirecting Liverpool          fans back      to the

           enclosures al lo ca te d          to them.       We encountej^ed no resistance           from fans

           on the     pitch.

          At about 4 ,Q0pm           (1600)    I was     fur the r/ di re ct ed   to assist    in the

           supervising         of a number         of b o d i e s y ^ hich had been   laid to the    rear of

           the   river.        I had not handled any of these bodies                  on the    pitch or    in

           the   pen.

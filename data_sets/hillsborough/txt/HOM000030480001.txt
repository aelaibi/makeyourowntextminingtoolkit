     Dear Mr Pyne

     Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989

     Thank you for your letter of 1 September 1998.

     I am arranging for Municipal Mutual Insurance to be contacted to determine their wishes in
     relation to the letters to which you refer. As soon as I hear from them, I will contact you
     again.

     In relation to the statements of police officers, I do see a difficulty. Ms Adlington initiated
     private prosecutions against two former police officers on 26 June 1998. The Director of
     Public Prosecutions (DPP) is reviewing the case to see whether she intends to take oyer
     the prosecutions. The advice of the Crown Prosecution Service was that the Chief
     Constable may wish to make no voluntary disclosure of material while that review is in
     progress. I have followed that advice. However, I am conscious of the Home Secretary’s
     position and I have asked for further legal advice. As soon as I receive it, I will write again.

     Yours sincerely




     Ian Daines
     Assistant Chief Constable

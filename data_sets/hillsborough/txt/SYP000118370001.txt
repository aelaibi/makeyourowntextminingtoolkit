                 At    8 » 4 5 a.m.        on S a t u r d a y ,          15th A p r i l ,        1989,        I was        on d u t y at

                 Doncaster           Police       Office            and was          on P o l i c e      Sergent           Moseley's          detail

                 whi ch      in c 1 u d e d    the       duty       of m a n n i n g       barriers           o n the       road       junctions          on

                 L e p p i ngs L a n e .         I took         up       position          on    the     barriers           at    Vere. R o a d /

                 Leppings          Lane       about       1 1 . 1 5 a.m.            after       briefing         and m e a l .

                 At    t his      time     there         was    a fair            number        of    supporters            about       who    appeared

                 to    be    generally           good      humoured.                 As    time went            on    from about             12 n o o n

                 this       d a t e , it w a s       evident             t ha t     a number          of L i v e r poo 1 s u p p o r t e r s        had

                 arrived          at H i l l s b o r o u g h w i t h o u t           tickets.            Being        at    this       location       the

                 supporters            who     h a d n ’t got            tickets          were       filing      past me          at    regular

                 intervals, asking                   both N o tt i ng h am                Forest       and Liverpoo 1 supporters                          if

                 they       had any        ' spare*        tickets.                 It a p p e a r e d     that       very       few    of    them were
                                                                     i
                 getting any             positive          resfdl t from their                       requests         as    the    same       faces

                 were       passing       over       a    lai^&e numT51F/r of               tim e s .

                 Crowds        were      growing         all        the       time       outside       the      Leppings          Lane       entrances

                 and     large       groups       of      supporters                were    stood        on     the    opposite          pavement          to

                 the     entrances            as w e l l       as    on       the    pavement          n ex t    to me.

                 Towards          2.00    p.m.       this       d a te at           my    particular            location          it w a s     obvious

                 th at      the    numbers        arriving               at    the       ground without               tickets          was    growing

                 quite       rapidly and             groups          of       these       were       spread      on    both       pavements         n e ar
to    the Le ppi ngs            Lane      entrance.              There        appeared             a    lot     of    confusion

with    both       sets       of    supporters             as    to w h i c h       entrance              they       should       be

going       in a n d      invariably,             I was         being       asked        to w h i c h          entrance       they

should       be    g oi n g .       As    the     t im e    for       the     kick       off       closed           in the    c row d s

outside       the L e p p i n g s           Lane       entrance         grew        rapidly and                from my location

I c o u l d see         jostling            a m o n g s t the     crowd       trying          to       gain entry            through

the    turnstiles.                 Many     older        people       were         p a s s i n g me         and      stating       that

they    had       no     intention          of    trying         to    get     in t h r o u g h           the L e p p i n g s      Lane

entrances          as     they were            being       pushed       and        jostled and made                    very

uncomfortable.                  All      these      persons           appeared           to    h ave        tickets         for    the

game.        I continued              to m a n      the     barrier           to    this       junction and                 this

particular             duty was          becoming          more       and     mo re d i f f i c u l t           due    to    the

volume       of    persons          running         from what           appeared              to       be o t h e r    entrances             to

the    ground          down Vere            Road       to the     Leppings           Lane         turnstiles.                None       of

these       persons          seemed         to   h ave the        slightest              knowledge             of w h e r e     t h ey

should       be    going        for      their      particular              entrance           s h o w n on          the    tickets.

Many were          approaching              me    placing         t he i r t i c k e t s           in m y       hand and asking

me w he re        they       should       be     gaining         e nt r y .        At    the       s am e      time    the    crowd

outside       the L e p p i ngs L a n e             turnstiles              had     swelled             d r a m a t i c a l l y and was

becoming          more       voiciferous           and      pushing           towards          the        large       gates

situated          at    this       end    of     the     ground.            The     supporters                 at    this    end

appeared          to    be    p r e d o m i n a n t l y L i v e r pool         supporters                who        in the    main

were    sporting             Liverpool           motifs.          Things           quietened              down       just    after

kick    off       time       and    the     crowds         which       had     been        pushing             appeared       to       get

smaller       but       there was           an atmosphere               of a g i t a t i o n            outside.

Just    after          3.10     p.m.      this     date         there       were        sti l l        a fai r n u m b e r        outside

the    ground          on L e p p i n g s      L a ne,     but    it w a s         evident             tha t    something          had

occurred          inside        the      g r o u n d as     there       was        a strange              silence.

Ten minutes             or    so    elapsed and             I could           see       emergency              vehicles       arriving

at    the    ground          (Fire       Service         and Ambulance).                      These         continued         to
arrive       for     the       next       twenty          to       thirty minutes                 and      in all          t h is      period            I

had    heard        no    communication                   at all           from         inside       the       g r o u n d as        to w h a t

had    occurred.               Only       the S e r g e a n t            on our          detail         h ad    been       issued w ith a

radio    and        because          of    the       a c t i v i t y at            my    location          during          the       busy

period       immediately              before             th e      start        of      the    g a m e , I was         unable             to

locate       hi m    to    find       out w h a t             ha d      happened.

About    3.50        p.m.       this       date,          supporters                 began      to      l eave       the    ground             by

the    Leppings           Lane       gates.              At     this       t im e       myself       and       other       officers

stood    nearby were                 subjected                to     numerous            verbal         retorts        of a b u s e            from

Liverpool           supporters             in       relation             to     being         responsible             fo r w h a t         had

occurred          inside        the       ground.               Torrents             of a b u s e       and     disparaging

remarks       were        d i r e c t e d at me               by L i v e r p o o l         supporters             walking            by rne.

Remarks       such        as    "I    hope          y o u ar e          proud        of y o u r s e l f ,       you    lot a r e           guilty

of m u r d e r      in t h e r e ."            As    well          as    the       u s u a l , "Black           bastards"              and

similar       abuse.            I did          not       have        any      knowledge           of w h a t         had    occurred                at

this    stage and              the    criticism and                      abuse          was    t h at    bit      mo re d i f f i c u l t            to

accept.

As    this    p o in t     I find          it       d i f fi cult          to      explain        how      I felt          as    I knew

nothing       about        what       had       happened.                  I surmised             something            drastic             had

occurred and accepted                          the       comments             as     earlier         described             as    comments

passed       on the        s p ur     of       the m o m e n t           by a n g u i s h e d        fans.           I made          no

comment       to a n y         of    the       persons             dishing           out      the a b u s e .         By    t his         time       a

number       of     supporters                 very       upset         at      not      being       able       to    1ocate

relatives           and    friends             they"d           gone       to      the     game w ith a p p r o a c h e d                 me    to

assist       them.         I then went                   into        the      football          ground          through          the

Leppings          Lane     gates          to    e n qui re for                them and          at      this      t ime     was        st ill

not    aware        of    the       extent          of    the        tragedy.              I was        directed           to    the

gymnasium where                 I had          just       a glimpse                of w h a t     h ad     occurred.             I could

see    numerous           bodies          on    the       floor         of      the      gymnasium             covered          in     plastic

sheeting,           most       of    whom were                obviously              deceased.             I stayed             f or      only       a
matter       of    seconds          as    it was        obvious         that    my attendance                 the re w o u l d

only    c a us e m o r e          problems       for     the       persons      performing              duties        with        the

deceased          and       injured.           I obtained           details         for    the     persons          who      h ad

r e qu e s t e d my         assistance          and whe n          I returned         to       them     they       ha d a l r e a d y

been    re-united             with       thei r r e l a t i v e s .        I then         returned           to m y     post.           I

only    caught          slight       glimpses           of    the    activity         inside           the    ground         at     the

Leppings          Lane       end    and     cannot       assist         regarding          these.            I did      not       take

any    part       in the          proceedings           in the       gymnasium.

I can    only          describe          the    whole        experience         t hat      d a y as       one      t ha t    I would

wish    I never             had    contact       w ith again.              I f e lt       as    a Poli ceman a sense

of    disappointment                in the       fa ct       that    I had      not       g one    into       the     ground         to

render       assistance.                 I am aware           of    the    f ac t    that       I had no k n o w l e d g e              of

the    nature          or    extent       of    the     disaster          but   that       is sma ll          consolation.

I was    only a mat te r                 of 5 0 y a r d s      from       where      the       crux     of    the     tragedy

occurred          and was          obivious        to    it un t i l       it w o u l d        appear        it w a s       too

late.        I concede             that     one P o l i c e m a n       might       not    h a ve m a d e       any

difference,             but       that    doesn't        alleviate          the      sense        of    emptiness            in m y

involvement             with       this -^vent.

I have       had       previous          experience           of    big    matches         at     the     Hillsborough

football          ground,          the    most     recent          being    the M a n c h e s t e r          United         game

when    no    problems             were     experienced.                I have       no k n o w l e d g e       of a n y

problems          at    the       ground       whilst        1 h av e     perfomed         duty        the r e .

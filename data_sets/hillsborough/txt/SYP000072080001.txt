             We     left L i v e r p o o l       at    10.30am       (1030)         approximately and                 expected          to     be

from Nottingham.

Unfortunately               due     to     builds          up of          traffic        from S t oc k p o rt         near       to     the

start      of    the        “S n a k e    Pass"          we    did        not a r r i v e    in S h e f f i e l d      until          about

2pm    (1400).

We    only      had    time       to m e e t        our       friends,           have     one     dr i n k ,    a bit       to       eat a n d

then     l e ave      for     the      g r o un d .

We    left      for    the     ground          by     car a^rdf a f t e r           finding        somewhere           to       park

arrived         at    the     ground          10 jjrtfnutes           p r ior      to    kick     off.         I had       i n my

possession            b o t h a ^ s j t ^ r ^ t i ck e t a n d a              terrace        ticket.            I decided             to

give     the     stand        ticket          to a f r i e n d a n d w a t c h              the    match        from       the

terraces         with 3        friends.

I expected            that     there          would       be a q u e u e           outside        the    ground        and       I

e x p e c t e d at     that       time        that       I would           not     get    into     the     ground          until       after

kick     off.

There     were        certainly           a    lot       of    people         pushing        and      josstling            to    get       into

the    g r o un d .        I d id      not     feel       the a m o u n t          of    pushing        remarkable              as    I have

on m a n y      occasions           seen       such       scenes           outside        big     matches        and       outside

Anfield and Goodison.                          A number             a /    people        were     anxious        to get          into       the

ground and            it w a s      obvious           tha|/it             would     be    necessary            for    the P o l i c e            to

control         the    crowd.

There     was        in m y    view       l e s / Police              than       one w o u l d     normally           f ind      outside

a big     game        in    co/mpari s d n          what       I am        used     to,     with      the M e r s e y s i d e         Police

at    home      games,        they/seemed                to    lack        organisation.

Police       Officers          on h o r s e b a c k           were        attempting         to    control           the    crowd          fay

shouting         to    them       to     keep       b ac k     but at         no    stage       did     I ever        hear       an

address         by m e g a p h o n e      or    other          amplifier.

The    crowd         did    not a p p e a r         to    be    particularly aggressive,                             and    they       did

not    give      the       impression            of      b e in g     predominantly               intoxicated.

After     a short           wait       I was        surprised when                  the     Police       horses        blocking             our

way    parted         to a l l o w       us    nearer          the        ground and         I wa s      even more              surprised

when       I was       ushered           towards           an    entrance             which       did      not a p p e a r      to      have

many       people        going         through         it.

I and my          friends           went        through          the       gate       a n d we w e r e          surprised          to

discover          that       we w e r e         at    the w r o n g         side       of      the     turnstiles            and     t ha t     it

was    not    therefore                necessary            for       us    to     present           our    tickets          (a p h o t o c o p y

of m y      complete             ticifet        is a t t a c h e d ) .

After      visiting              the/ g e n t l e m a n * s t o i l e t s             we    enter         the    ground        by w h a t       we

perceived           to      be ttfe o n l y           entrance             from       t ha t     vantage         point.         This         was

by w a y     of a t u n n e l            which       went        under          the    sta/id into              the    central          part

terraces.              The       crowd       in the         tunnel          was       qu/te       d e n s e and        I was       actually

at    that    point          quite        anxious           about          it b u t / a t        t h at    stage       I dismissed my                     *

thoughts          as     being         irrational.On                  reaching             the    terrace         the     force         of     the

crowd      behind           us    became         more       intense             a n d we w e r e          almost       immediately

pushed       to     the      front        of     the       crowd w i t h i n           yards         of    the    perimeter             fe n c e .

The    crush        from         behind         us w a s        at    t hi s     time       quite         severe       but     it was

perhaps       equal          to     that        which       I had          experienced               in the       east a n d         it w a s

possible          to     lift       one's        arms       from          one    side       and      to m o v e       slightly          both

forward and              back       to    the        side.           Within        minutes           tfye c r u s h     ha d    become          so

severe       that        one      c o u l d n ’t m o v e         one's arms                and    there         was    extreme

pressure          on     o n e' s      ribs.

It w a s     necessary              to m a k e        an    effort          to     breathe           and    I was       becoming             hot.

The    c r o w d w as        s t il l     being        pushed             slightly          forward         and       nowhere        for       it

to    go    the     crush          became        more       i n t en s e .         The man           next       to me w a s

complaining              about         the      c r u s h at         first       but       quickly         became       desparate              and

started       to a s k           for     help.         I indicated                    that       I could         not    assist          h im

because       I could             not     move.

I intially             thought           that        I would          eventually               be a b l e       to get       out at          the

small      g a te      in the          perimeter            fencing             onto       the    pitch         but m y      view       soon

changed when                I saw        the P o l i c e m e n            were     having         difficulty            in     pulling          the

people       out       of    the       g at e    because             of    the w e i g h t        of      the    people        b e hi n d .

I saw        that    those who             did       not    reach        the       gate      itself        but    the a r e a           either

side     were       b e in g    crushed against                    the w a l l .           The    Police         were       shouting             to

p e op l e    to    get    back       but       by    that       time        the     c r u s h h ad     reached            such

intensity           that       n o b o d y w as a b l e          to m o v e        in a n y      d i r e c t i o n and were

totally        helpless          and       our       fate w a s         totally           in the       hands      of       outside

parties.

I remained           crushed          for w h a t          seemed        to    be a n        incredibly           long       period and

the    man     next       to me w e n t           red a n d        then       blue an d          his    c r ies       became

steadily           fainter.           I did          not        look at           hi m a g a i n as      I        was       at    thatstage

trying        to    use all         my     resolve               to    stay        c a l m as    I knew           that       to       panic      wou

l e a d me     to h y p e r v e n t i l a t i n g          and     it w as         difficult           enough         to    b r e a t h as

it was.

To my        right     there        was     a     c r u s h jyarrier.               There        were      people          crushed

against        that       barrier          c r y i n g /out        in    pain.            There     wa s     a girl         level        with

me    but     her    leg       was    clear!y f behind                  the       barrier        and was brea ki ng                as a

result        of    the    pressure             of    the       crowd.

I was        quite     close         to    the       front       but     it w a s         obvious       to me         that       if a n y

room    did a pp ea r           I ought           to a t t e m p t       to    get        b a c k as    p e op l e     were       being

crushed        to    the       front       and       I could e a s i l y             be    c r u s h e d as      get       out.        At

this    stage        only       toes wer e            on        the     ground and              my body           w as      leaning

forward about              45       degrees          to    the     g r o un d .       Suddenly          t h e r e w as       a movement

in f r on t        of me       and    I felt           myself         fallingand             I managed           to    get       my      legs

in f r o n t       of me       to    prevent          me    going        u n de r      the      crowd      to w h a t      would         have

been almost            certain            suffocation.                  At    that        time w h e n       I was         falling

forward        I s aw      that       that        there         we re ^bod ij^ r^o n          the      floor.

I prevented myself                    falling             forward and              pushing        myself         back       using        my

legs,        placing       them       on a n o t h e r          person who            was     on the         ground.             This

s i c k e n e d me     but      I had        no      c h o ice.

Suddenly           and almost             i m m e d i a t e l y after,             the     pressure          behind         me    stopped

for    a second and                 I was       able       to    get     myself           some 5 yards            back       to       s a f et y .

After       a while           I was         able       to    push my way             back       to     the      entrance         tunnel

which was          virtually                empty apart             from a        couple          of P o l i c e       Officers*

I then went              back       into         the    courtyard             area    by the           turnstiles.

In the       courtyard area                      I sat       on a w a l l       talking           to      other       people         who       were

also    shocked and                 dazed.

At    that       time m a n y          people          were       upset       and were          shouting          at     individual

Police       Officers             to     the      effect          that     they were            responsible              for     the

disaster          which          occurred.

This,       at    that        time a n d          in t h os e       circumstances                 in m y        view was         a

justifiable              and      reasonable                response.           I only          saw       one    person attempt                  to

phys i c a l l y       grapple           with a Police                  Of f i ce r ,a n d      even       then       his    actions

out    by P o l i c e         O f f i ce rs a n d           those       who    felt ab le            to    he 1 p.

I could          not at          this       stage       assist          and    in a s h o c k e d          state       I left         the

g round      to wai t for m y                    f r iends        who    we r e , as       far as          I know        still        in the

ground.

I would          like       to    say       that       I was       not     impressed            by the P o l i c e           operation

of    controlling                the     crowd         outside          the    ground          or t h e i r      i n i ti a l    corporate

response          when        the      disaster             struck.

The    efforts           of      some       individual             officers          were       heroic          but    the a c t i o n

lacked       coherence              or      leadership.

Police       incompetence                   is    in m y      view       not    unusual           at      such events            and       I

have    always           taken         the       view       that    apart       from       the       Merseyside             and Greater

Manchester             Forces          who       in m y      view appear             to    understand             h ow      to   deal          with

large       crowds          {presumably               from       experience),              a f ew P o l i c e          Forces

have       any    p r op e r      idea.

I would          also        like     to    comment          on       the     pat^erity of          the     p u bl i c    address

system.

At    no    stage          were     any     coheren                                i v e n o ve r     the     public          address

system       to e i t h e r         emergencv/services                        or    the    crowd.           If t h o s e       orders

were       given       they w o u l d         W av e    b e e n at          the     height       of    the       panic        and    the

public a d d r e s s           system was              not       in m y       view     loud      enough          to    be a u d i b l e        in

such       situations,/

11    is    quite          c(]/ar     in my       view        that       the a c c i d e n t        was     caused        by the

decision          of       the P o l i c e       to    open       the       doors      to ail         and     sundry waiting                   at

the L e p p i n g s         Ln end         so as       to    enable           everybody          to    enter          only     one

portion          of    the     ground.            Quite          c l e ar l y ,     the    vast       majority           of    people

went       through          the     open gate           rather          than        through         the     turnstiles              and    they

were       left       in the        situation where                    the     only       obvious          way    to go        into       the

g r o u n d was        throught            the    tunnel           into       the     central         a r ea.

If    the    Officer           w ho    took       the       decision           to    open     that         gate was           aware       of

the    layout          of     the     ground          and    still          took      that    decision            knowing           that

there       were       be a       crush,         then       those a c t i o n s           would       be    criminal           in m y      view.

If he       did       not     know     the       layout          of    the     g r o u n d a n d w as         not      therefore           able

to m a k e       provisions            to     prevent            p e op l e    going       into       the     centre          part    only

and    provisions              to     ensure          that       the    people         also      went       into       the     side

areas,       it       is    in m y     view       negligent             policing           and      the     person who was                 in

the    position             to m a k e      such a decision                    should        have      ha d      the     experience

and    the       information               to m a k e       an     informed           decision         knowing           all    the

factors          involved.

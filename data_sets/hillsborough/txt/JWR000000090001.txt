                              There are two hospitals in Sheffield. It was a quiet
                              day. The switchboard operator was watching T.V. -
                              the local match. There seemed to be crowd trouble.
                              At 1520 a Policeman rings in and asks to speak to
                              A&E. He tells the Charge Nurse your on stand-by to
                              receive patients. The Operator listens in and
                              decides on his own initiative to alert his colleagues
                              and key hospital staff.


    City Map                  At the Northern General Hospital the television was
                               not switched on. The Police did not call and it was
                               only when staff began phoning in and asking for
        u                     directions that the hospital switchboard became
/   a       jC & M *   uAs,    alerted. By that time the Accident & Emergency
'                             Department one floor upstairs was already inundated.

                              Both switchboards fully in short time. Both blocked
                              almost immediately. Fran 1500 to 1700 each board
                              took over 3,000 incaning calls. By 2200 each board
                              had taken 8,000.




                              Staff are alerted fran our Department by using a pile
                              of ten pence coins. British Telecan Public Relations
                              Manager tells me additional pay phones and free calls
                              at the scene of disaster.

                              Later heavy local traffic blocks sane lines across
                              the City.

Red Phone         We have a direct line in telephone for use by the
                  Ambulance. A POTENTIAL LINK WHICH WAS NOT USED.
                  Although two very illpatients arrived at 1545 we had
                  no canmunication at any time fran Ambulance Service.
                  Only use of red phone was me answering bleep to
                  bypass switchboard.




Ambulance Radio   Throughout the afternoon the Ambulance radio, our
                  theoretical link in the event of a disaster, stood
                  where it has always stood, just under a desk in my
                  secretary's office where you stub your toes on it.

                  It never worked anyway.




Intercom System   We had other canmunication devices. The Department
                  has a newly installed intercan. No one thought to
                  use it and in the noise it would not be useful.
                  Floor contact was by line of sight and face to face
                  speech.




Control Point     My control point is in the middle of a Department
                  which is much smaller than a football ground. I
                  still had to emulate the example of the Police
                  Officers at Hillsborough in going to the scene of the
                  activity and seeing for myself what was up.

                  I WISHED I HAD CLOSED CIRCUIT T.V.

                                          The two Police in the control point arrived at 1530.
                                          They spent time on the phone. They had Police radios
                                          and they could not tell me what was going on. Local

Coffee Machine                            Police also brought a fax machine. I know this slide
                                          shows coffee machine but at least coffee machine got
                                          used.

Cell Phone                                British Telecan tell me they gave out 25 Cell phones

                                          who. No one phoned me anyway. We had one in
                                           hospital. None used.

The Lessons

Canmunication Fails Early   Although there is a Tie Line System between
                            hospitals with fifteen lines no canmunication was
                            possible by me to Jim until 1700.




Direct Canmunication A&E    I did not know Jim's external numbers. He did not

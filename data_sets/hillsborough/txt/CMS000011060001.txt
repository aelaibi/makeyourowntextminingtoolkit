                                                    Maghull,
                                                    Liverpool

                                                         April   3 991
 Dear Hr Major,
                                                            .


 I  write to you   as a  b e r e a v e d brother who . lost my bro th er at
 the Hi llsborough Football Disaster.          I write asking as to what
 is to be done now.

 The inquests   into the   95 deaths        finished on  the 28tl"’ M a r c h
 1991  with a   highly du bi o u s   dec is ion made  by the   jury.      it
 seemed from my point of v i e w      that the    whole proceed ing s were
 not  honest and   truthful,       but were' more biased     towards    the
 Police and in^ particular to the political side of things.

 The Coroner «fei.iihself sh owed no compass ion towards the      gr ie v i n g
 families,   many     who  had made    the  journey   to ‘‘the    inquests
 evetyday,    Hg seemed      more -interested  in the -welfare of         the
 jury and of* the Police barristers.        His interest seemed to lie
 m   making sure      ■•
                      the  - •
                          right    verdict  jf '-Accidental    death"     was
 brought in.

N o w that   this verdict has     occurred, the bereaved families ar°
supposed to lfet t M s    ma tter lie.     in the two years    since the
Disaster,     no-.improvements se e m  to have    been made   as towards
ground     safety.and ' the way    football    Supporters are   treated.
This can be     shown by the incident      in Leicester on- 23>'<d M a r c h
1991,^ when a^ crushing incident         developed, and several        fans
sustai ned    injury.    The     Police of    course aided  by    p u sh in q
esca pin g fans back into the crowd.

Thus, from         the above   example the proper authorities     have not
learnt         from past experience!    This I think, is due to the fact
that       they know a cov er -u p can    take place,   and the n e c e s s a r y
funds        required to    finance  their defence    can come   from       the
p u b l i c s 1 purse.   As   indeed it   was in  our case.     The Police
having their         own ba rristers  to defend   them paid    for~by       the
public, the         injured parties having    to fund   themselves.      Were
is the justice in this?

N o w that the case is over, I ask          what do you intend to do          to
ensure it doesn't happen again?                                ■"*'

The previous  Prime Minister promised us            there would  not be a
cover-up, but^there was!!         And n o w a l l those  responsible, the
Police, Council  and F o o t b a ll in g authorities    can do what  the y
like.  For it seems, in this country, MONEY TALKS.

I would         therefore ask   you, no,    implore you to     look at   this
case       again,    and make   the   public   aware    of   the dangers   of
a tt e n d i n g ANY  public venue.     Also,    to rev iew   the system   we
have in this country          as regards prosecu tio n and inquests.      For
I do       not believe that     aCoroners'    court is      not the  correct
place to         review evidence    of this kind.    Especially, when the
said     Coroner has    the   right- to omit     evidence    and wi t n e s s e s
wh i c h  are   important to    the '* case,  and    that   the wei gh t      of
evidence      available   was   en ou gh to  war ra nt  act ion  from       the
D.P.P. (was the decision made their for polit ica l reasons).

Car ry i n g on from this, I would  recomm end that    Dr. Po pp e r be
removed from his position    as I see hi m incapable of ma ki n g the
right decisions to show the true si t ua ti on to ?> sit ti ng jury.

From     this letter, you   may think  that I  am bitter!    Thi s is
true!      For over   the last two years,  I have  come^ to-hate the
Sys t e m (both'political and judicial)   in this country.     For in
our democratic      society, the ordinary  people like mys elf   have
no rights, they all belong to the people who have the money.

I   therefore ask    you to r e v i e w    this letter     carefully, and at
least   make some    effort to try         and change    the s y s t e m w h e r e b y
the   guilty    are   pr op e r ly     brought     to   justice      and       made
accountable for     their actions. . And          also, to   ensure that the
Police Complaints Co mmission          loo-ks into the     cases o f     the six
Officers involved,. in the         Hi ll sbo rou gh Disaster   properly, and
ensure   tfyexe is   no cove r- up       this.time.     Taking     note of the
fact that the    Police do lie u n q e r oath i.-e. The B i r m i n g h a m Six
case anf the Guildford Four.

Finally, I thank you     for taking the time to read    this letter,
and all I really     ask of you now    is for a reply,  or-s-hould      I
sa y it is youf duty to reply, telling me of what you . intend to
do.   For I believe-; - if not hi ng is,^cne, another  Dis-aster will
occur   similar to this one, as has      been shown over h i st or y and
through the   var ie ty of reports that    were drawn  up to p r ev en t
future Disasters but were IGNORED.

                                                      Yours   Sincerely,

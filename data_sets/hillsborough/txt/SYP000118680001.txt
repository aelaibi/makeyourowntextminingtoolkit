s u s p & nded     u n t i 1 t he         summer         break.

On S a t u r d a y      15 A p r i l        1989        I commenced                duty       at     10am a t t e n d i n g         at       the

police       r o o m at         Hillsborough,                  collecting                the       hand     held VHS            rad i o

which       I used          to m o n i t o r       transmissions                   v i a X.S.          (Operations              Room),,            On

this     particular              day      channel            1 had        been      designated              for     all     VHF

After       collecting              the     radio        I     made my way               to        the L e p p i n g s    Lane        terrace

where       I saw       that        Roger        Holdsworth                was     working            on c a m e r a      number         3

After       he    had       completed            the     work        the     picture           was       indeed          better       than         it

1.00pm and S .30pm                 there    was     concern          expressed             regarding           the L i v e r p o o l

During      this       same    period       problems           began arising                in v a r i o u s      public

heavily       out      on the       street,       urinating              in g a r d e n s a n d      being a          general

nuisance.           Some      time     between         1.30pm and S.00pm                    I began        to     notice            that

on the H o p        several         Liverpool          f ans    had       been       placed       in the        triangle

several       arrests         were     made      and    t hat       manpower          was    getting           low.        I

remembered          t h at    there       had    been       some     trouble          at    last y e a r ' s       match            in

the    same     1o c a t i o n a n d      I questioned S u p t . Murray                      re    the     number          of

officers        available           for    deployment           on    the       Kop.        S u p t . Murray          then

contacted        Inspector           Sewell       regarding           the m a n p o w e r         situa ti on and               he

confi r m e d    that 2        coaches          each    containing              40 men would              be    on s t a n d - b y

Around 2.00pm S u p t , Murray                    and Chief           S u p t . Duckenfield                went       to       speak

to    the m a t c h     referee. Through                th e    afternoon             complaints           had     been

expressed        regarding           the    quality          of PR        transmissions              to    the     contro1

staff.

Around 2.00pm               I overheard          on VHF        that      Liverpool           supporters            had     been

spoken     to   on a         coach whi ch         had di spl ay ed              a Nottingham Forest

supporters          parking         ticket.        The       coach and           supporters          were        spoken             to

by    traffic       officers         and advised.

About     the   same         time    there was          a    report        of    troublesome              Liverpool             f ans

a man     an the        Leppings         Lane       terrace        south       pen.    He    dropped           his    trousers

and     began     fooling       a b o u t . Hi s       behaviour          was    such       that     it w a s        believed

that     he w a s      drunk    and      the A C C      asked       for    something           to    be    done       about

him.       I set       the    camera       to m o n i t o r    his       behaviour.

About     2 . 1 3 p m all      the    control          room    staff       discussed           that       it w a s

apparent        the     Liverpool,         fans      had     not    begun       to a r r i v e      as    yet.        The

North     stand        had    vast    spaces        although         the       Leppings        Lane       terrace          was

Leppings        Lane     turnstiles.                I would        estimate        around 3,000                people        and

it wa s     apparent          that    the      n um b e r    was    increasing             by the        volume       of     foot

expected        for     such a football                match.

About     2 . 3 3 pm the       civilian         radio        repair       man    stated        that       he    could        not

fix     the P R     system      and      it w a s      necessary          to    resort       to     using       the     ra d i o s

apparently          more       hostile.               I also         remember        around       this     time     t h at       Sgt.

supporters          enter          the     ground.           I then       said words             like     " T h e y 've     broken

clown the       ga t e " .         At     the      same     time      I indicated           to    the     staff      in the

control       box       to w a t c h       the L a p p i n g s        Lane    monitor,            After      about        SO

seconds       I noticed             that        the    g a te    was     closed and          it     seemed       that       a

mounted       officer          alone         ha d     prevented         a big        r u s h of     people       through             the

open    gate.           I remember              seeing       mounted         officers        trying        to    clear          space

in the       crowd.

The    request          for    additional              officers         to    be     sent    to L e p p i n g s     Lane         was

made    to    Inspector             Sewell          and     I remember          him      offering         two    serials,             one

time    a PR       message         was       sent      regarding          the      climbers         and    an    officer-

replied       that       he    could         not      reach      them.

Around       2.45pm       I remember                a PR m e s s a g e       from Supt.           Marshall        to      the

effect       “We    must       open        the      gates       or    someone        is g o i n g    to    be    ki l l e d .

that       I would            contact          the     fire      servicewhich                   I did     via    XS.        I made            it

clear       that       we    required            cutting         equipment              for      the m e t a l        fences.            I

remember             someone        instructing             PC    Ryan          to     use      the    tannoy         telling        people

to    stay       calm.           I c an    remember           seeing            bodies          being m o v e d         towards       the

the      Hop     officers           managed          to    stop       the       charge          and    split       up      several

groups          of    fans       who    were      fighting.                A    line       of    officers          were       then

formed          across        the      pitch      just      the       Kop       side       of    the      centre        line,

running          onto       the     pitch.           I then       sent          a message             to O p e r a t i o n s      t h at      we

did      have        fatalities           at     the      ground, a l t h o u g h            when       I sent        this     message

Traffic          motorcycles              were       ordered          to       cover       the     routes        to     both      h o s p i tal

and      I made        a    request         for      the     senior            ambulance           officer         to a t t e n d        the

control          box.        He     did    not       arrive.           Th e      senior          fire      officer          attended           at

the      control           box    and     liaised with                senior           officers           and    he     too a s k e d         to

speak       to       the    senior        ambulance           officer.                 Another          request         was    made          for

that       officer          to      attend        the      control             box     via      XS.

About       3.35pm          I checked            the      video       tapes          and     discovered            that       one    had

stopped          and       the    second         had      been    switched              to      operate         in the        18 hr m o d e

This       I can o n l y          think        was     caught         by me          whilst        standing           at    the     rear       o-f

the      video        control          area.         The     videos            are     set at         knee      height        and    I

believe          that       as    I leant         forward         this          is     how      I altered          the      time     mode

I installed                two    new       tapes          and    set       them      r u n n i n g at       normal             spe ed.

Mr.     C l o u g h a n d Mr.              Dalgleish             entered          the    control            box a n d           offered

their       services             once       they       had       established             t hat       the m a t c h w a s              off.           Mr.

Dalgleish wanted                      to    speak          to    the      fans     and       he was         asked          to    use      the

tannoy          system        in t h e        DJs      control            box     below       the      police          control,

S u p t . Murray            then       later          asked       for       details          of    transport               so    that

preparations                could          be m a d e       for       emptying          the       ground.             I remember                s ome

time after                this    S u p t . Murray               saying         to PC R y a n          that       he w a n t e d          a

message          passing          over        t he     tannoy          telling          the L i v e r p o o 1 f a n s                to   stay

calm and             remain wh ere               they were             unt i l     the a m b u l a n c e s            had       left      the

stadium.              Sometime             l a ter     the       ground         was     emptied and a r o u n d 3 . 3 0 p m                          I

removed          the       video       tapes          and made            my way        to    the      gym       to    offer

assistance.                 I was          l at e r    s ent      to H Q w i t h         the        video        tapes          and       I there

saw Chief             S u p t . Duckenfield,                     S g t . Booth,          ACC       Jackson            and Chief               Supt.

Denton.              About       1 1 . 0 0 D e t . S up t .            McKay       atten de d and                he    instructed                me

to    return          to H a m m e r t o n R o ad ,              b oo k     the    video          t a pes    into          the       property

copies          of    the     video         tapes          could       be m a d e .

About       11.30pm S g t . Foster                         a r r i v e d at       Hammerton            Road Police                   Station

and     I explained               the       faults          on    the       video       tapes.           He a s k e d           if    I could

get     hold         of    the    video          recorder             used      with     the        18 hr m o d e           setting             so

went     back         to    the       ground and                removed         one     of    the      video          recorders               from

the     police            control          box    taking          it to E c c l e s f i e l d            Training               School          where

I handed             it    to S g t . F o s t e r .              My    immediate             supervisor               would          be S u p t .

Murray.              I had       no    contact             with       the    fans       before/during                  or a f t e r           the

incident.                 I cannot          relate          any       information             regarding               the       stewarding

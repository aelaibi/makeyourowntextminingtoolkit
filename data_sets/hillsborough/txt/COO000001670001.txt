TAYLOR REPORT: "FAST-TRACK" PUBLISHING
I copied to you my letter of 26 January to the Chief Executive of
HMSO about the time taken to print the final report of Lord
Justice Taylorâ€™s inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium disaster,
and the possibility of a fast-track arrangement for the printing
of such reports . I enclose a copy of the. reply which I have now
had from Dr Freeman on the basis of which I propose to advise the
Lord President.
Before I d o .so, I am sure it would be right to give the Home
Office the opportunity to comment in particular on the points
made by Dr Freeman in paragraphs 2 and 3 of his letter.       In
advising the Lord President I shall want to focus not on what
happened over the Taylor report, but on the proposals Dr Freeman
makes for a new fast-track arrangement for printing reports of
this type. Nevertheless you may welcome the chance to comment on
what he says about the handling of the Taylor report.
It would be helpful to have any comments by Friday 9 February if
that is possible.

         Further to our telephone conversation towards the latter part of
         last week, please find enclosed a copy of the Fire Brigades

P reamble.

The  Fir e B r i g ad es U n io n are obli ge d to the C o m m i t t e e of      Inquiry
into  the    H i l l s b o r o u g h Football Ground d is aster for g r a n t i n g    us
the  facility        to m a k e s u bm i s s i o n to the C o m m i t te e on this  m ost
tragic matter.

Th e S u b m i s s i o n we m a k e is intended to be c o n s t r u ct i ve in              c o nt en t
and to be of a s s i s t a n c e to the C o m m i t t e e in its d e l i b e r a t i o n s and
u l t i m a t e l y in m a k i n g r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s so that such a d i s a s t e r    can
never         again     occur.

We do not seek to a p p o r ti o n b l a me or r e s p o n s i b i l i t y to any   body,
g ro up or individual for the h a p p e n i n g s of 15th April 1989,                but,
seek to present a r a t i o n a l e of what appeared to have o c c u r r e d and
those   m ea su r es in our o p in io n n e c e s s ar y to prev en t such        a   re­
occurrence.

In our submission we shall d raw h e av il y upon the Final R e p o r t             of
the       C om m it t ee of Inqu ir y into C rowd S a f e ty and Control at S po r ts
G r o u n d s chaired by Mr J us t i c e Popp le we ll f ol l ow i ng the   disasters
at bot h B ir mi ng ha m C it y and B r a d fo r d C ity Football G r o u n d s on the
11th M a y 1985 and the v i ew s of our members.

We      als o feel it n e c e s s a r y to w id en the scope of our c o m m e n t s      to
o ther       ve n ue s w he re large n um be rs of the public m ay be p r es en t so
that the Co m m i t te e m a y g ive c o n s i d e r a t i o n to those a re as a lt ho ug h
we accept that they are p r i m a ri l y c h ar ge d with inq ui ri ng into the
m a t t e r s relating to the e v e n t s at H i ll sborough.

In      m a k i n g our s u b m i s s i o n we m ust of n e ce ss it y re la te to matters
c o n c e r n i n g H i l l s b o r o u g h which have been the subj ec t of r e p o r t s in
the media, which m a y have b een m a d e out of cont ex t to the overall
v i e w of the Inquiry.

Quite    clearly   the    e v e n t s at   Hillsborough        w er e     significantly
different    to  the e v en t s at B i r m i n g h a m City    and      Bradford    City
football grounds, however, it is felt that there are p a r a l l e l s of
principle    to  be    d rawn       and   that     matters     r e l at i ng  to   those
i n cidents   will     have         an   impact      upon   t hose        relating    to
Hillsborough.

1.    C R O W D M A N A G E M E N T SYSTEMS.

We      are       of the o p in io n that the p h i l o s o p h y of             crowd   m an ag e m e n t
syst e m s        is not as well u nd er st oo d in the UK as it a p pe a r s to                       be
in the USA.               Crowd m an ag em en t s y s t e m s are d e sc ri be d albeit fai rly
b r i e f l y in the S o c i e t y of Fire P r o t e c t i o n E n g i n e e r s book entitled
Fire        P r o t e c t i o n E n g i n e e r i n g in a c h ap t er w r it t en by an    American
expert in the m o v e m e n t of people, J ak e Pauls.

Mr     P a u ls    dedicates         a    whole s e ct i on of his  chap te r   to  Crowd
B e h aviour       and M a n a g e m e n t and r e fe r s to a number of    o ther  works
p a rt i cu l ar l y t hose by J.J. Fruin, an A me ri ca n who           has    published
works on these matters.

Fruin      d is c us s ed    in   his     paper     "Crowd       Disasters   - A  S y st em s
Ev al ua t i o n   of      Causes    and    C ou nt e rm e as u re s ", four  fundamental
el em en t s time,         space,    information and e ne rg y in r el at io n to the
f o ll ow in g a s p e c t s of s e ri ou s crowd incidents:

1.        R apid a c c u m u l a t i o n of queu in g     p er so ns as demand        for f ac il it y
o u t s t r i p s its capacity.

2.    Pedestrian           d e n s i t ie s w hich a p p r oa c h the critical d e ns it y of
about    8 p e r s o n s per square m e tr e leave no space b e tw e en              people.
Shock waves,         c a u s i n g i n di viduals to m ov e i n v o lu n ta r il y laterally
as   muc h     as 3 m e t r e s can be seen m o v i n g through c r o w d s         in   this
si tuat io n .

3.   C o m p e t i t i v e r u s h i ng by a crowd away fro m s o m e t h in g is termed
"panic" by F ruin and c o m p e t i t i ve r u sh i n g t o wa rd s some obj ec ti ve
(such as at H i l l s b o ro ug h) is termed a "craze".

Quite c l e a r l y the s e ri o us a s pe c ts of crowd i n ci de nt s listed a bove
were all present at H i l l s b o r o u g h and it should have b ee n p os si b le
to     successfully          plan    for them u s i n g     crowd    management  sys tem
p hi l o s o p h i e s and d es ig n c r i t e r i a if these w er e known or published
in     the       for m of a Cod e Of Practice.

The      UK   G ui d e to S a fe t y at S p o r ts G r o u n d s d e ta i l s crowd    control
measures,           but,       these       are      generally     measures      related      to
c on t a inment       once     in the venue.          It is also i n te re st in g to      note
that      the     p r e di ct ed crowd d e ns it y f ig u re for        terraces      in   good
order is set at 5'4 p e rs o ns per 10 s qu a re m e t r e s of s pace which is
a    true     f i g u re    of   5 . if, p e r s o ns  per   s qu ar e    metre,    a    figure
approa c h i n g the critical d en s it y set by Fruin.

Whilst crowd cont ro l m e a s u r e s m a y well form an integral                          part of      a
crowd m a n a g e m e n t s y s t e m the r e ve r se is not true.




                                                     3
Pauls         e x p l ai ns that a crowd m a n a g e m e n t system is to m ak e use          of
d es i gn       and o p e r a t in g f e a t u r e s b ased on the subtle and b en ef ic ia l
e x p l o i t a t i o n of p e o p l e ’s natural behaviour.        Thi s r e q u i r e s a good
understanding              of a c r o w d ’s r ea s on for b ei ng and    the       collective
m o t i v a t i o n of its members. '

A    crowd m an ag e me n t s y s t e m m a y u t i l i s e m any design f e a t u r e s   such
as     communication          systems,        cl os ed circuit     television,         central
control          suites,     crowd    a s s e m b l y a reas external   to     the       venue,
queing and entry control techniques,                       stewarding,   etc, and n eeds
to     be clea rl y e s t a b li s he d for not only the venue but the type of
e nt e r t a i n m e n t provided and the a n ti ci pa te d public response.

T he re    is quite c le a rl y a need for p r e- pl an ni ng by not            onl y  the
ve nu e m a n a g e m e n t 'but also the e m e r g e n c y services, local a u th or it y
and t r an sp or t services,         to e n s u r e   an integrated a p p r o a c h to the
p ro b le m envisaged.

It   s e em s    politic        that   a W o r k i n g Party should  be   set   up    to
in ve st ig at e     crowd      management       systems    in light  of    the  N o rt h
American       e x p er i en c e arid that a Cod e of P ra ct ic e sh ou ld   then    be
produced,        whet he r this n ee ds to be a c o mp le te ly new d o c u me n t    to
take     into account all v e n u es or an ext en si on to the H om e           Of fi ce
Saf et y    at Sp or ts G r ou n d s d oc um e nt may also need to for m part         of
the W o rk i n g Party d e li be ra ti on s.

2.     PITCH    I N V A S I O N / P E R I M E T E R FENCING.

Q ui t e     clea rl y one   of the m ai n p ro bl e ms which has            s p aw ne d   the
recommendations          for p er i me t er f e nc i n g is that of p itch          invasion
by fan s for a number of reasons. T his prob le m now no longer s eems
e n t i re l y     confined   to football only and is          a pp e ar i ng     at     other
s p o rt i ng venues a lt ho ug h not yet to the extent of football.

What      is of concern to the Fir e B r i g a d e s Union is that Mr J u s t i c e
P op pl e we l l a c kn o wl e dg e d in his Final Report that to deal with the
bas e prob le m of pitch invasion,             a c h a n ge in Engl is h law should be
m ad e    in     line with S c o t t i s h law to r e co gn is e pitch invasion as      a
breach       of the peace- offence.          We are not aware that thi s        ch an ge
has been made.

T h i s d oe s seem to give p ow er s to the police to deal w it h the root
ca us e    of   pitch invasion and a p p e a r s to operate s u c c e s s f u l l y  in
Scotland        where  the   inc id en ce of pitch invasion    and        thus      the
need for the p rovision of p er i me t er f en ci ng is much lower.

attention      to    the    practicality       of p r o d u c i n g a m or e    s u i t ab l e
p ersonal radio for the police. We w ould like to know w h et h e r this
s tu d y wa s ever u n de r t a k e n ?

Sho u l d       thi s m a t t e r be one that c an n ot for technical      r e as o n s     be
resolved,           then      c lose  examination     of the  need     for     e m e r g e nc y
t e l e p h o n e s linked direct to the c ro wd m a na g e m e n t ce nt re and sited
at s t r a t e g i c points wi th in a v e n ue n ee ds to be undertaken.

It      was       als o e x t e n s i v e l y r ep or te d in the m e d i a that    the    public
announcement                sys te m failed at a critical point in the e v en t s              at
H i ll s b o r o u g h .      As    such     a   s ys t em is a vital      part    of   a   crowd
management              system       it     is   of     great c o nc e rn  to   us    that   this
a p p a r e n t l y h ap pened and must reflect upon the m a i n t e n a n c e of such
e l e c t r o / m e c h a n i c a l safety features.

4.     STEWARDING

One of Mr J u s ti ce P o p p l e w e l l ’s c o m m e n t s in his Final re po rt                with
regard          to e v a c ua t io n p r oc e d u r e s was that the r e s p o n s i b i l i t y   for
this s h o u l d rest with the c lu b and its s t e wa r ds and sh ou ld be the
subject of a degree of pre-planning. The police should be trained
in       evacuation           p r o ce d ur e s   but,         on   the   b a si s of    p ro v id i ng
assistance             to    the     venue      m a na g e m e n t rather     than  as     a     legal
r e s p o n s i b i 1i t y .

T here is therefore, a v er y heavy r e s p o n s i b i l i t y upon the s te wa rd s
and       the       v en u e    m a n ag e me n t to e n s u r e their      tasks           relating   to
evacuation              in    an e m e r g e n c y are d i s c h a r g e d p ro perly and this         is
r e f lected          in       the Home O f f i ce Guide. T r a i n i n g         of        stewards   is
o b v i o u s l y c r i t i c a l l y important,        yet,       onc e again in the m e d i a it
was       r e p o r t e d that the Chief S t ew ar d             at H i l l s b o r o u g h   had  never
heard         of      the         "Green Guide", w hi ch mus t o bv i ou s ly                bring   into
q u e stion the level of t r a i n i n g provided.

It  mus t    also be asked that w hen the t r ag ed y                      o cc ur re d wh y    was
there   a    d elay in o pe n in g the p er i me t er f e n c i n g g ates to              rem ove
those p er s on s in o b vi ou s distress,            p a rt i c u l a r l y when Mr     J u st i ce
Popplewell*s       Interim R e po r t had r e co m m e n d e d that all exit                 gates
should    be c o n t i n u o u s l y m a n n e d and be c a p a b l e of b ei ng opened           in
an emergency.

5.      R O L E OF THE F IR E SERVICE.

Criticism        in     the       m e d i a of the d el ay in r es po ns e of  the      fire
s er v i c e to H i l l s b o r o u g h has been in c e rt a i n instances v i c i o u s and
most u n c a l l e d for.
The     base        p r ob l e m      is that whilst the p ol ic e                  p r e s en c e    at    such
ev en ts      is      seen        as e n t i r e l y n ec essary in             the     light       of    crowd
control needs,                a s t a t e m en t we       do not contest, the p r e s e n c e of a
senior        fire         o f f i c e r to advise on e v ac u at i on in an e m e r g e n c y
and     the       a v a i l a b i l t y of fire service fir e                  fighting          and     rescue
p rov i s i o n s     in      c o n s u l t a t i o n with police arid v e n u e m a n a g e m e n t          is
not     seen in a s i mi l ar light.                    This is d e s p i t e the fact                that    in
paragraph           4 .1 8      of      Mr      Just ic e   P o p p l e w e l l ’s   Final         Re po rt   he
recognised            the s ec o nd to none e x p er i en c e of the f ire s e r v i c e                      in
evacu at io n n eeds and techniques.

It  seems s tr a ng e that h av i ng been c o ns ul te d on the            p r e- p l a n n i n g
the  fire   s e rv i c e is e f f e c t i v e l y then d i v or c ed f rom   the      actual
event.

Another       are a w h ic h c o n c e r n s us deeply r e g a r d i n g this        matter   is
the     fact     that w h i l s t the fire s e r v i c e ’s a b il i t y with reg ar d        to
fi re fi g ht i ng is r e c o g n i s e d by other e m e r g e n c y s e r v i c e s arid public
b od i es and g r o u p s the rol e of as a rescue s e rv i c e is not.

The  base  p r ob l e m     here,  is one   of   rol e  p e rc e p t i o n                          due     to
legislative a n o m a l i e s and we shall expl ai n further.

The   British       f ire     s e rv i c e is set up and g o v e rn e d by       the    Fire
Serv ic e  Act 1947    w h ic h      lays down p a ra m e t e r s of     wha t       a  fire
service should do to e f f i c i e n t l y d i s c h a rg e the o b l i g a t i o n s placed
upon    it or m or e c o r r e c t l y the e mp l oy i ng fir e   authority.

It is c on s tr a in e d p r i m a r i l y by .Section             1(1) (c) of the 1947 Act to
d e al in g with c a l ls for           a ss is ta nc e in         cas e of f ir e       and   astrict
interpretation         of that          section would              p re cl u de its      use for rescue
purposes     e xc e pt   where             this     forms          part      of  a f ire     related
emergency.

However, S ec ti on 3 ( 1 ) (e) of the 1947 Act p er m it s f ir e a u t h o r i t i e s
to employ a fir e b r i g a d e m ai nt a in e d by them, or u se any e q ui pm en t
so   m ai nt a in e d for p u r p o s e s other than f ir e f i g h t i n g for w hich
it   appears s u i t a b l e and to charge for such s e r v i c e s as they        see
fit.    It     is fro m this sect io n that fire s e r v i c e s u t i l i s e  their
Skills to p ro vi de s e r v i c e s other than for f ir ef ig ht in g.

This    is  not g e n e r a l l y realised by other e m e r g e n c y    services   or
bo di es and there is a d i s t r e s s i n g tendency in an e m e r g e n c y rescue
situation    not      to      see k the immediated a s s i s t a n c e  of  the   fire
service    if s o m e t h i n g is not actually on     fire.         Fortunately   the
British    public labour u nd er no such m i s a p p r e h e n s i o n arid the role
of    the fire s e r v i c e as a rescue service       has g ro wn to the        point
where    it now f o rm s an integral part of the e v e r y d a y w o r k l o a d    of
firefighters.




                                                       7
S ome f ir e a u t h o r i t i e s have a l r e a d y g ra s pe d this part ic ul ar nettle
and      n amed   t he ms e lv e s fire and r e s c ue services.            It is our         firm
recommendation            that     the      role of the fir e       s er vi ce    as     prim ar y
rescue       service,        for    those s e r v i c e s w h er e no    other     r e c og n is e d
r escue      service       (e.g     coastguard/cliff            rescue,      m in es     rescue,
mountain        rescue) e xi s ts as a norm,             and what the Brit is h           public
has      long    recognised,          should be r e c og n is e d by parl ia me nt          by     a
redraft       of    S e c ti on    1 ( 1 ) (c)  of the F ir e S e r v i c e    Act     1947      to
e n cl u d e for the p ro vision of r es cu e services.

This   r e c o g n i t i o n must then e n su r e that there is no f ut ur e     delay
in   calling         upon the s er vi c es of the fire s e rv i ce to   c a r ry   out
rescue tasks, where, as p o te n t i a l l y e x is t ed at Hills bo ro ug h, they
can sav e lives by an immediate r e s p o n s e

That c o n c l u d e s the writ te n s u b m i s s i o n by Th e F ire B ri ga d es Union
at this time.          We do however, r e c o g n i s e that the written wor d can
never e n t i r e l y r e pl a ce that w hi ch is sp ok en and should it be           the
wish of the C o m m i t t e e of In quiry we are q uite prepared to present,
our v ie ws v e r b a l l y to them.

                                           THE END.

 Dear Mr Whalley

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry

I thank you for your letter of 23 May and note all that you write. When the
Popplewell Inquiry was taking place, Lord Justice Popplewell visited Murrayfield
and he requested and was given information.

It appears that Lord Justice Taylor will not be making such visits, but I shall
discuss your request on written submissions with members of my Committee and
write back to you as soon as possible.

 I would thank you for giving my Committee the opportunity to make submissions.

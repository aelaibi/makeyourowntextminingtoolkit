              PC BRADLEY. We got on the coach and travelled in convoy to Sheffield

              to commence duty at the semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham

              Forest.                                                                               '

              We arrived at Hillsborough and sat in the stand and we were

              given a brie fi ng , by the officer           in charge.

              We then left the ground And proceeded to the L e p & i ^ s               Ln end and were

Constable PEARSON.

We were in position on that road from about       11 ,30am <1130).

Supporters started arriving from Leppings Ln end and passing towards

the turnstiles from about    12 o'clock.     There were mainly young

children with their fathers,    etc.,    obviously going to the match early.

 There were a lot of supporters stood around in the road near where we

were on duty but I never saw any trouble with any of the supporters.

They were mainly well behaved and enjoying the sunshine.

There were a number of supporters turning up from about half past one

to 2 o ’clock <1330 to 1400), also waiting      in the roads,   going to the

fish and chip shop.     A lot of them were carrying cans of beer and

stopped to drink this beer anywhere they could sit down before they

went to the game.

There were also a lot of youths and men,       I couldn’t say how many,

asking people as they walked past if they had any spare tickets.

Obviously they h a d n ’t got one so they were asking people to see if

they had any spare ones.

From 2 o ’clock <1400), when the one and only train was supposed to

arrive at the Railway Station,       there seemed to be more supporters

arriving after 2 o'clock    (1400)    than there were before and a lot of

these, you could smell the beer and alcohol on them as they passed the

end of our road, although they were not causing any problems at this

t ime.

There was a continuous steady flow of supporters arriving in

Leppings Ln.     It seemed to get more intense as it got towards kick-off

time,    there seemed to be more supporters    coming late than there were

last year.     A lot of them because they were late,    or it was getting

near kick-off time, were    in a big hurry to get to the top of the road,

up towards Leppings Ln.

We were still on duty on Shenston Rd at about quarter to^ythree

 <1445).     There must have been two or, three thousand in a steady stream

 heading towards the turnstiles.            Jr did make a comment to a motorcycle

Sergeant about them climbing ujy onto the wall at Gate C.                I saw

 someone    in a dark uniform,    I/could not say if it was a Poli&e Officer

^or not,    pulling supporters/up onto the wall a nd obviously into the

 ground.     I also made \    cj/mment   to the Sergeant that I    could not see

any Police Officers up at that           end of the ground, near    the turnstiles,

 however,    there was two to three thousand people up there and it is

quite possible that they may have been intermingled in there somewhere.

There was a lot of noise coming from the Leppings Ln end, a lot of

noise and chanting by the supporters.             There was still a steady

 stream of supporters hurrying to the ground at 3 o'clock. (1500) .

At about 3.15pm (1515)       I was speaking to a civilian who had a car

 radio on and it came over on local           radio that there had been some

trouble,    or an incident, actually inside the ground.            We were not in

 possession of a Police      radio at that time and that is how we first got

the information that something           had happened.

At just after 3 . 15pm (1515) we         were rounded up by our    serial S e r g e a n t .

 Police Sergeant
   ---------         REYNOLDS
             i -------- ----  and we unblocked the roads which                had been

watching.      We walked up Leppings Ln towards the tunrstilQ/s.             By this

time people were coming out in a distressed state,            crying and calling

 us 'BASTARDS',    obviously we were not aware of what had gone off at

this time but the supporters who came out were in a very irate state

and just kept saying,        'THERE'S PEOPLE DEAD IN T H E R E ' , and blaming the

Police for what had hap p e n e d .

 Myself,    Police Sergeant R E F O L D S and Police Constable PEARSON e ntered

 the ground through Gate^A ^ a nd then went along round the back of the

 North Stand and onto the pitch in between the North Stand and the

Spi on Kop.     We we re separated f rp m Police Sergeant REYNOLDS and myself

 and Police Constable PEARSON       W rit    onto the football field and we just

                                                                                                 S222S

                    saw loads of people running about and people laid on the ground,

                    obviously with injuries and some being helped by First Aiders and

                    Ambulancemen.        There were people running all over the place,        getting

                    boards,     the advertising boards, and putting injured people onto them

                    and trying to get them out to where the ambulances were awaiting them.

                    It was obvious that the Forest supporters in the Spion Kop did not

                    know, at first, what had taken place.             I believe they must have

                    thought     it was a pitch invasion,       or something like that, as the Forest

                    fans were still taunting the Liverpool fans who were actually on the

                    football field.

                    I actually went up to the fence in the Spion Kop and told off one of

                    the supprters who was stood on the actual fencing shouting and

                    swearing towards the people who were on the field.              I told him to get

                    down and to behave himself.            I shouted to the Forest supporters that

                    were near me that           there were a lot of injured on the field and I       think

                    then they started           to realise that it was not a pitch invasion and

C   p   C   l   1   something had taken place which they w e r e n ’t aware of at the time.



            Vi J ^ b i q   f a j / lad, with    dark hair, who was beir^g given heart massage.       He

                    was Enlaced in the          back of an Ambulan^^/whi ch had come onto the

                    fool ba l1 field.          I think he was dead when he was taken from the field,

                    but I am not sure.           We took another   lad, a tall skinny lad with blonde

                    yai r .   Myself and Police Constable PEARSON and someone else carried

                    this lad off the field,          up to wherev the ambulances were waiting,

                    between thss North S t a nd and the Spion Kop."        He was sat down by the

                    Gymnasium/and we got him some First Aid assistance.
                               .“'N,
                    Then we returned to the ground to see if we could assist with any of

                    the other injured people.

                    By this time there were a lot of Liverpool            supporters walking, about in

                    a daze and obviously a lot in shock.            There was a 1 ine of Pyo 1 ice

                                                                                    S2228

         Officers across the field, I think this was more to keep the half of

         the field near the Spion Kop free,        so that Ambulances      could get in, as

         opposed to keeping the two sets of supporters apart.

         1 was talking to a lot of supporters during the next hour,             trying to

         keep them calm and reassuring them etc.             We then, after the ground was

         empty,    returned to the North S t a n d , where we started off the day with

         a briefing.     We were sat there for about 4-5 minutes, awaiting news of

         what had actually happened.        It was o b v i ous, from talking with other

         officers that there had been a lot of pushing in the West Stand and

         a barrier had collapsed,      but other thjtn that we still weren't fully

         sure of what had happened.

         We then walked up Penistone Rd towards Claywheels Ln, where we were

         given a meal and then stood drawn and returned on the transport to

         Doncaster, arriving back y t j n e r e at quarter    to g-lght.

                                                                   R Kerr PC 1169 SIGNED

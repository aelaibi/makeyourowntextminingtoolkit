                               THE H I LL SBOROUGH INQUIRY - UP-DATE II

        TO:       O f ficers of the S outh Yorkshire Police s u bmitting evidence
                  to the West M i dlands Police in conn ection w i t h the Public
                  I nquiry into the disaster at Ki-j-soorougn Stadj.ua


K a a a o n d Sudaards, Solicitors, are acting on behalf of the South Yorkshire
P o l i c e in the p r e p a r a ti o n and presentation of evidence to be submitted to the
Inquiry.

As part of this process the firm init ially requested that all officers
d i r e c t l y concerned should, as soon as possible, prepare a note of their
recollections, in the form of a statement, including matters of comment and
impression, whet h e r or net this amounted to evidence.

T h e s e accounts are of immense value to cur Counsel.

Subsequently, the South York s h i re Police were advised by the West Midlands
Poli c e that it w ould be a ppreciated if South Yorkshire Police officers, who
w e r e at Hillsborough, could effectively prepare their own factual statements
for s u bm i s s i o n to the Inquiry.   This was agreed and the obvious wa y of
p r o c e e d i n g was to look at the statements w h ic h had been i n itially prepared at
our request, on the basis that if matters of hearsay and comment could be
removed, these w o u l d be suitable as the factual statements requested by the
We st M i dlands Police.

Some officers have expr essed concern about alterations being made to their
o r i g i n a l stat ements prior to s ubmission to the West Midlands Police.

W h at must be kept in mind is that the statements for subm i s s io n to our own
C o u n s e l we re intended to have an entirely different purp ose to those submitted
to the West Mi dl a n d s Police.

The init i a l fceporns          submitted contained a mixture of fact, c o njecture and
opinion.          In editing them for use as a factual statement by the Inquiry it aas
b e e n n e c e s s a ry for the soli citors to remove conjecture and opin i o n and to leave
•only natt e r s of fact.

Al l s t atements w h ic h      are submitted to the Inquiry may be taken into account in
r e a c h i n g conclusions,     whether or not the officer making the statement is
c a l l e d as a witness.        It follows that the statements must contain only direct
f a c t u a l observations,      as opposed to matters of impression.

No a m en d e d statement -will be submitted to the West Midlands Police until it
has b e e n seen, approved and signed by/the officer making it.

At about 2 . 4 0                p.m.   I joined officers              under my        command who were                 engaged

on duties at                the    rear      of t                     -8 at     the Leppi n g s Lane               end

d e c i d e d to go and see what was                         happening.         I could see thro u g h                  the

 turns t i l e s a very,               very     large       crowd m a s s e d from the            turn s t i l e s      back

across            the    road     comp l e t e l y     covering      that area.            P e o p l e at the          front,

 before           they     could get         through        the    turnstiles,        were       being     pushed and

 crushed a g a i n s t            each other,          against       the wall        between the           turnstiles

an d agai n s t            gate    ’A ’ » a conce r t i n a gate.              As    I saw this          the      officers

 on duty there                  told me      of the        problem and       that     it had been going                   on for

 some        time.         As    people      entered t h r o u g h the         turnstiles           into     the ground

 they a p p r o a c h e d me,            nearly        everyone      shouting abuse about                  the

 situation              outside and          saying        that    if something        i s n ’t done         then people

will         be    crushed and killed outside.                        I told these            people       1 was. aware

of the            problem and          tried      to    reassure      them.         Some    replied w ith abusive

 remarks           such as,        "YOU B A S T A R D S C O U L D N ' T P O L I C E A P I S S .UP" and                 "YOU

C U N T S WILL K I L L S O M E O N E OUT T H E R E . "                Some     of the youn g e r males                  had

 been drinking,                  some worse          for    drink were       using obscene             language

towards me and other                      officers          such as       "BAST A R D S I S SIES" and             "BLACK

GETS."             I warned        several       about       their    conduct and           language.             They were

d r a g g e d away          by other youths                and    disappeared        .into the       crowd.          No

further            ac t i o n was      taken a ga i n s t         them,    it would have            caused more
problems        than     it w o u l d have           solved.

As the Liv e r p o o l          supporters           were      entering      I saw that         some     of the

w o m e n and     c h i ldren were           red     faced,     visibly       shaking and crying.

P o l i c e O f f icers       who    were on         t u rnstile      duty    outside      (F2 "D* Group

officers Police               C on s t a b l e s   43,   602,    3027)     had to      climb over         the

turnstiles         to a void         being         crushed themselves.             Those        officers were

also     visi b l y shak e n / s h o c k e d ,        white     faced a n d t h e y      said the s i tuation

outside was          u n b e a r a b l e and        people were        being    crushed.          X saw people

climbing        over     the wall          onto th» ^rnxSf of           the t u rnstiles          gaining access

to the      rear     of the West S t a nd/Le ppi ngs Lane                      terracing.         1 could hear

only     part     radio m e s s a g e s about            the    s i t u a t i o n and about a gate            to be

opened.         I heard gates              ’A ” and      *C'; m e ntioned.         Whe n the       radio was

free     I radioed         into      the     control      room telling          them what         the    si t u a t i o n

was    like as       I saw        it a n d a sked for           clarification          if any      gates      should

be opened.           The      reply was            broken an d     interrupted.            I a g a i n asked        for

c l a r i f i c a t i o n an d the       reply was        no gates       to be opened.             The     s i tuation1

con t i n u e d and      two      to three minutes              later     it a p p e a r e d    to be getting

worse and gate             *A ' was        being      pushed a g a i n s t     from outside         and     visibly

bowing      under      the      pressure.            1 heard over        the    radio      instructions           for

the gate        including           gate     "A*     to be opened..          Officers          at gate     'A*

opened      it and a Po l i c e            cordon was          placed at the side               of the gate         to

the    fencing       to funnel           people       into the        ground towards            the N orth

Stand.        No one was            a l l o w e d to enter       or attempt        to enter        the area to

the    rear of the West S t a n d / L e p p i n g s Lane                 terrace.         This     inf lux of

people      lasted       two      to three minutes              and    pressure      outside was

relieved.          As the         people       entered some were abusive,                      blaming    the

Police      for    the     problems          outside      (swearing and           cursing),         Tickets        as far

as    I ’m aware were             not    taken or        people       checked for        tickets.

As    the s i t u a t i o n     became       calm     I left     the area and          returned         to the

N o r t h Stand.

S h o r t l y after         kick    off        I entered          the N or t h S tand and saw a number of

people and Pol i c e O f f i c e r s                  on the       track and field              behind the goal and

in front         of    the West S t a n d / L e p p i n g s Lane             terrace.             I made my way down

a n d as    1 did          I could see           people        climbing      over       the      perimeter      fence       to

go onto        the     pitch.        At        first      I thought        fighting         had broken out but as

I arrived           behind         the       goal    by the       centre pen,         I could see           there     was       no

fight      but      people         trying       to escape           the   crush.         Ot h e r s were       scrambling

over     the     side fences                 to the side          pens and     others         climbing and being

lifted      into       the West S t a n d             by people a l r e a d y         in the        stand.      The

e m e r g e n c y gate was          open and              people were       e s c a p i n g , being         pulled

through        the     gate       by Police Officers.                     I could see           people       on the

ground      inside          the    centre           pen by the       e m e r g e n c y gate       being      trampled on

by people           trying        to escape.              Some     people were alive                but     trapped by

their      legs       under       other        people.         Police O f f icers were                pulling       people

through        the     gate and              helping      others     over    the fence.               I could see

people      crushed a g a i n s t              the fence,          they were         bl u e / p u r p l e   in colour,
                                                                                                                                 .   i
others were            s c reaming            for help.           Pe o p l e to the rear of the               pen     woul.dn

or     couldn't        move        back,       despite        numerous shouts and arm waving

requests         to move          back and out              through       the tunnel.             I saw      it was

necessary             t.o gain access               to the        pen tohelp     people and organise

things      so        I and asmall             group       of officers       m a n a g e d to gain            access       to

the    pen.

1 could see,               once    inside           the    pen,    the    bodies      of a large            number    of

people      piled on top of each other,                             one    of the       bodies was a child aged

a bout     10 years          and    no bigger             than my own son.                Their      faces were

b l ui$h/pur pie            in colour with                legs and arms         twisted,            tucked under           them

an d other            bodies.        They were             o b v i o u s l y dead.       I continued to shout at

people      in        the    pen to move             back and out through                  the    tunnel and waved

rny arms       to     this    effect.            They d i d n ’t move.               Some     of them shouted

a b u s e , I heard          someone          shout,        "MURDERING BASTARDS,"                  spat and some
coins and a g o b s t o p p e r            (sweet)       hit me as we tried             to help.          People

in the West S t a n d and side                   pens also        s h o u t e d abuse,       spat and

threw     some    objects.           The     t h r owing    of objects          and    coins     d i d n ’t last

long,     a few seconds,              but    the abuse and           spitting         c o n tinued from the

W est S t a n d and       pens.           Remarks    like,      " F U C K I N G B I S S I E S " were      used.

T here were a number                 of    people    in the       pen on the ground who were alive

and    I d i r e c t e d and a s s i s t e d      officers        to get     them out         t h r o u g h the

e m e r g e n c y gate    onto       the    pitch.        They were        passed to officers               on the

track.       As more and more                officers       gained access             to the     pen      people were

e v e n t u a l l y m o v e d back ami— out          thro u g h    the     tunnel.        B o l d i e s were

removed out onto               the    track      to wait i n g     officers.           I a ss i s t e d    in

removal      of the       bodies          from the       pen.     I do not know the              identity         of

the officers who               received the          bodies.         There were         such a large             number
                                                                                                                            t
of bodies        I don't        know       the exact       number       I assisted/directed                in moving.

I could see a crush barrier                       had given way and was                 bent almost             to the

g r o u n d on the       left    hand side          of    it as you        look    from the       track.          When !

all    the   bodies       had been          removed the         pen with        people       still     inside was

pre s e r v e d on S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    G r e e n w o o d ’s instructions and              left as        it

was    for the      time       being.        A short       time    later     two Scenes          of Crime

Officers       in civil i a n         clothes       entered       the    pen and started to take

photographs.             The    small       group of       people       still     in the      pen made          hostile

approaches        to them and              the*/ had to quic k l y          leave      the    pen a s s i s t e d      by

u n i f o rm 0 f f i e r s .

I saw     people,        including P o l i c e m e n and P o l i c e w o m e n          in various          stages

of shock,        they were walk i n g about                 in a daze,          others       crying and one

even    shouting at            other Police O f f i c e r s          for    no apparent          reason.          They

were all       d i r e c t e d to the Police Roo m                for    treatment.          Some,        including

some Police         Officers,             refused.        I then stood          by at     the L e p p i n g s Lane

end,    then stood         by    in the N orth Stand.                   I located my serial                S e rgeants

After a short                  b r i efing       by Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mole,       I s tood down,

going      off        duty at E c c l e s f i e l d Po l i c e S t a t i o n at 8.0 0             p.m.

I have       been           policing        football       matches        since    I joined the Police

S e r v i c e as a Po l i c e Con s t a b l e              in    1971,     at H i l l s b o r o u g h a nd outside

R a d i o .c o m m u n c a t i o n was           not good.        I found m e s sages           fading    or broken.

Maybe      it was my                radio,       I d o n ’t know,      I didn't        get     chance    to    change         it

alive.           A few         people were           found alive          but there were more             dead than

alive.           '

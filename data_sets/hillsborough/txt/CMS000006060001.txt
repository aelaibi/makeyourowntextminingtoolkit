SPORTS GROUND SAFETY: ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION AT SPORTS GROUNDS
OTHER THAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE GROUNDS

Following my meeting with Lord Ferrers on 20 November you wrote
to me to say that he was content with the course of action
recommended in my note of 5 November. You also added that he has
suggested the omission of the penultimate sentence to the
prepared answer to the arranged PQ. I can see no reason to seek
to dissuade Lord Ferrers.
A revised Annex C containing the draft question and reply is
attached.

DRAFT OF AN ARRANGED PQ




[                   MP]:   To ask the Secretary of State for the
                           Home Department if he has concluded his
                           consideration of the recommendation of
                           Lord Justice Taylor in his final report
                           on the Hillsborough disaster, to extend
                           mandatory all-seated accommodation to
                           sports grounds other than football
                           grounds designated under the Safety of
                           Sports Grounds Act 1975 as amended by
                           the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of
                           Sport Act 1987.




DRAFT REPLY



We have now completed our consultation at this stage and have

received the views of the Association of Chief Police Officers.



Designation of sports grounds under the 1975 Act is confined to

those used for association football, rugby union, rugby league

and cricket.   We still require football league clubs to move

towards all seater grounds as recommended by Lord Justice Taylor.

For the other grounds we see no reason to depart from a voluntary

approach and do not intend to introduce primary legislation.

However, we shall continue to keep this matter under review.

 HILLSBOROUGH


 Here are:

 (i)        A draft statement. I have amended the previous draft to take account of Mr
            Howarth’s comments. The Attorney General has asked for the opportunity to
            comment, so the draft should be sent across to his office on Monday.

 (ii)       A list of the documents and other evidence relevant to the Scrutiny, setting
            out what is already in the public domain, what we will be making public by
            putting in the Library of the House, and material which will not be publicly
            available - although most of that is available to the families. There are one or
            two items which I am still discussing with the owners of the documents. The
            most difficult issue concerns the original statements made by South Yorkshire
            police officers. Many of them were made by officers in the days immediately
            after the disaster and contain passages which are highly emotional or abusive
            (ie the sorts of comments which were removed on the advice of solicitors
            before the statements were provided to the inquiry.) They include offensive
           comments about Liverpool supporters: in the days after the disaster many
            police officers believed that the behaviour of the supporters was the main
            reason for what happened. Making these comments public nine years later
           could rub salt in open some old wounds. But, as Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
           concludes, there is nothing in the statements which would have affected the
           findings of fact of the inquiry, and not publishing might imply that there is
           something to conceal. The statements, like that of ex PC Frost in Appendix 6
           of the report, also bring out the horrific experiences of public officers on the
           day. One possibility would be to disclose them in anonymised form, so that
           the individual officers making the statements cannot be identified by the
           press. Perhaps we can discuss this at the meeting planned for 12.15pm on
           Monday.

                                                                                 ANNEX B


                                   HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER



With permission Madam Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster.


2.         On 30 June 1997 I announced to the House that the Attorney General, the
Director of Public Prosecutions and I had agreed that it was in the public interest to
establish an independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there was any new evidence
relating to the disaster which was not previously available. Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, was appointed to conduct that
scrutiny. His terms of reference were:


            To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the
           Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available:


           (a)       to the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


           (b)       to the Director of Public Prosecutions or Attorney General for the
                      purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities;
                      or


           (c)        to the Chief Officer o f South Yorkshire police in relation to police
                      disciplinary matters; and in relation to (a) to advise whether any
                      evidence not previously available is of such significance as to
                      justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
                      Department of a further public inquiry; and in relation to (b) and
                      (c) to draw to their attention any evidence not previously




f:\appu\hou\pq\ppOSS6pddoc
                        considered by them which may be relevant to their respective
                        duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which
                        should be taken in the public interest.


3.          Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has now submitted his report, which I am publishing
today.


4.          Few events in recent history have been subject to such lengthy and detailed
examination. The public inquiry led by the late Lord Justice Taylor considered fully
the causes of the disaster and made wide ranging recommendations about crowd
control and safety at sports events which have had a profound effect on safety at
football grounds and the policing of football matches.


5.          The deaths that occurred were also the subject of inquests conducted by the
Coroner for the Western District of South Yorkshire. The inquests, conducted in two
parts in April and May 1990 and between November 1990 and March 1991, involved
over 80 days of public hearing. A further investigation was conducted by the West
Midlands police, supervised by the Police Complaints Authority, to establish whether
there were any grounds for criminal or disciplinary proceedings. That investigation
involved the taking of more than 5000 statements. At a later stage in November
1993, there was a judicial review of the coroner’s proceedings, which upheld the
inquest verdict of accidental death and the conduct of those proceedings. We have
now had this further detailed scrutiny by a senior Lord Justice of Appeal.


6          The main causes of the disaster are clear.             They were identified by
Lord Taylor in his interim report in August 1989. He did not attribute all the blame to
a single cause or person, but in paragraph 278 he made it clear that “the main
reason for the disaster was the failure of police control”. The South Yorkshire police
have accepted the main share of responsibility for the disaster. They, together with
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the Local Authority, who were also
criticised by Lord Taylor, have paid many millions of pounds in compensation -




f:\oppu\hou\pq\pp0556pd.doc
 although money is little compensation for the loss which so many families have
 suffered.


 7.          Lord Justice Stuart-Smith had two essential tasks. The first was to advise me
 whether any evidence not previously available was of such significance as to justify
 a further public inquiry. The second task was to identify for the Attorney General,
 the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
 Police any evidence that might be relevant to their decisions which had not
 previously been considered.


 8.          With any major disaster, it is inevitable that over the course of time some new
 information may become available which was not known at the relevant time. There
 were many thousands of people present at Hillsborough on that awful day and
 millions more watched it on their television screens. There will always be some new
 shred of information which might be gleaned. But that does not necessarily mean
 that the previous outcomes would have been any different. We must be satisfied
that any re-opening of previous proceedings would be merited, and that any new
 information is not simply new, but also material to those proceedings.


9.          Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has considered in great detail all the evidence
which has been put to him. He has looked equally rigorously at all the information
presented to him, whether that information came from individuals or official bodies.
His clear conclusion is that there is no basis on which there should be a further
public inquiry, nor is there any basis for a renewed application to quash the verdict of
the inquest, nor is there any material which should be put before the Director of
Public Prosecutions or the disciplinary authorities which might cause them to re­
consider the decisions they have already taken. He concludes that none of the
evidence which he was asked to consider added anything significant to the evidence
which was available to Lord Taylor’s inquiry or to the inquests.


10.         I, the Attorney General and the DPP have considered Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith’s report very carefully. We have decided that his conclusions are right.


f:\oppu\hou\pq\pp0556ixLdoc
  11.         I fully understand why those who lost loved ones at Hillsborough should feel
  betrayed by those responsible for policing the Hillsborough football ground and for
  the state of the ground on that day. I hope and believe that the changes which
  resulted from the Taylor Inquiry should mean that such a disaster will never be
  repeated.


  12.        But there is another sense in which the system has failed the Hillsborough
 families. As Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says in chapter 7 of his report,


              I understand the dismay that they have that no individual has personally
             been held to account either in a criminal court, disciplinary proceedings, or
             even to the extent o f losing their jo b ”


 13.         There are serious shortcomings in the police disciplinary system. The Home
 Affairs Committee produced a report on 15 January which makes recommendations
 for change. I will be responding fully to that report soon. But what happened after
 Hillsborough is a prime example of why we have to improve the current
 arrangements.


 14.         Lord Justice Stuart-Smith also comments on the coroner’s proceedings after
 a major disaster, which has been subject to a public inquiry. He endorses the
 recommendation of a Home Office Working Group on Disasters and Inquests,
published in March 1997, that the role of the coroner after such a public inquiry
should be limited.


15.         Lord Justice Stuart-Smith highlights in his report the exceptionally difficult task
which the coroner had in conducting the main inquest. It placed an unreasonable
and, I think, unnecessary burden on him when the Taylor Report had covered
substantially the same ground. Certainly I am clear that Hillsborough proved that the
system in its present form is unsuitable as a means of dealing with disasters of this
kind. If no inquest had been necessary, the Taylor inquiry, which all have accepted


f.\oppu\hou\pq\pp0556pd.doc
 as an excellent report, would then have remained unchallenged as the last word on
 the causes of the disaster


 16.            I   therefore   agree   in   principle   with   Lord   Justice   Stuart-Smith’s
 recommendations that there should rarely be the need for an inquest following a
judicial inquiry into a major disaster.


 [17.       This report is substantial and detailed. I appreciate that Honourable Members
will not have had the opportunity to read it fully. With the agreement of my Right
 Honourable Friend the Leader of the House, I am able to indicate that the
Government would be willing to make time available for Honourable Members to
debate the report further, if that were the wish of the House.]


 18.        When I established the scrutiny I said that I would do my best to ensure that
the evidence considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was published. Most of the
 main material which he has considered is contained in the Appendices to his report.
 Much of the other evidence which he considered is already in the public domain,
consisting of transcripts of public hearings or material considered by the Taylor
Inquiry. I am arranging for other material considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to
be placed in the Library of the House.


19.         All Honourable Members will have the most profound sympathy with the
families and friends of those who died at Hillsborough. We can scarcely begin to
comprehend what they have suffered. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says in his report:


            “   I realise that my report and advice will come as a disappointment to them,
            especially since they have had their hopes raised that something more could
           be done. But I cannot allow compassion to cloud my judgement I have had
           to look dispassionately and objectively at what is said to be fresh evidence, in
           the light o f the evidence which had previously been considered”.




f:\oppu\hou\pq\pp0556pd.doc
  20.         I, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions must consider
  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report in the same light. I recognise that it will be difficult
  and painful for the families of those who died to accept the conclusions of this report.
  But we must at some point put an end to speculation about new evidence or about
  re-opening the previous inquiries or proceedings. I believe that we should do that
  now and accept the findings of this report.

Documents and other evidence which will not be placed in the Library

1.        Advice of Gareth Williams QC and Peter Birts QC to the Director of Public
           Prosecutions, August 1990. (The Home Secretary has agreed with the
          Attorney General that this legal advice should not be made public because it
          attracts legal professional privilege and it is the firm policy of the DPP not to
           publish such detailed documentation relating to the merits of individual cases
          which have not been before the courts.)

2.        Report of a review of the evidence by the CPS, May 1997. (Same reason
          applies).

3.        West Midlands Police reports to the DPP (23 volumes) (the same reason
          applies).

4.        Appendix 9 of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report. (This contains details of
          individual cases, and the relevant sections are being sent to the families
          concerned).

5.        Written statements made by Dr James Bums and Dr Ian West.                 (They
          concern the case of Kevin Williams only).




f:\oppu\hou\misc\ppOS91pddoc
 6.        Transcripts of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s private meetings with families and
            submissions made by individual families to him. (Each person has the
            transcript of his/her private meeting.)

 7.        “Body files" containing the detailed history of each individual victim. (Each
            family has, or request, been provided with the body file of their relative.)

 8.        Police tape VRM2. (This is a video of the mortuary.)

 9.        Photographic, documentary, video and other material held in the archive of
           the disaster held by South Yorkshire Police. (This consists of an entire room
           full of material. Much of it is held by the police on behalf of the coroner, and
           access to it is therefore governed by the Coroners’ Rules - that is, copies of
           relevant material is provided on request to those with a legitimate interest,
           including relatives of victims. Other sections of the archive contain copies of
           the material listed in other categories above. The remainder is miscellaneous
           material from many sources. Copies are provided on request by South
           Yorkshire Police, subject to them securing the agreement of the third party if
           the originator of the material is different from the person requesting a copy.)

 Documents whose position has yet to be resolved

 1.        Copies of all the original statements made by South Yorkshire Police officers
           following the disaster. (We are discussing this with South Yorkshire Police.
           They are concerned that because the statements are personal the
           recollections made immediately after the disaster contain emotive, abusive or
           other material which, if made public, would cause offence to the families - for
           example, abusive remarks about the behaviour of supporters. I have asked
           South Yorkshire Police to consider the possibility of making them available in
           anonymised form, so that individual officers would not be identified by name.)

2.         A report on the state of the ground prepared for Sheffield Wednesday
           Football Club by consulting engineers, Sir William Halcrow and Partners,
           August 1990. (This report was originally commissioned by solicitors for the
           Club in anticipation of contribution proceedings to determine the respective
           liabilities for compensation payments of the club, the council and the police.
           The solicitors acting for the club have indicated that in principle they do not
           see much difficulty in making this available, but they will not give firm
           agreement until they have seen the published report by Lord Justice Stuart-
           Smith.)

3.         Nine video tapes containing everything recorded by BBC tv cameras on the
           day of the disaster. (These tapes have been made available to all the official
           proceedings, including the Taylor Inquiry, the inquest and Lord Justice Stuart-
           Smith’s scrutiny, but the BBC are not prepared for them to be made generally
           available because much of it is an horrific record of the deaths of the victims.
           I have asked for their agreement that the tapes could, if requested, be viewed
           by legal representatives of the families.)

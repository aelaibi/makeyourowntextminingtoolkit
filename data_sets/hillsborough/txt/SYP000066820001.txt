              My name       is                                    and      I reside at the above a d d re ss w ith

              my b oy f ri e nd and        15 m o n t h old daughter



              On S a t u r d a y      15 Afi/11 1989     (150489)        I went      to the semi      cup final at

              Hi 11s b o r o u g h , Sheffield,         Liverpool       versus N o t t i n g h a m Forest.           I am a

              L iv e rp o ol     FC/s up porter .



                         my b e f r i e n d    bought    our    ticket       but    I d o n ’t know where         from and    I

              d o n ’t know how much they               cost.



              Me a n d                 travelled up together             in his      car.      We started         from home

              at a bout         1pm    (1300).      We t ra v el le d to S h e f f i e l d on a m o t o r w a y     I d o n ’t

to eat.             We d i d n ’t witn es s        the    c on su mp ti on of alcohol      on our

j o u r n e y up to Sheffield.



We a r r i v e d at S h e f f i e l d at about 2. 3 0 p m             (1430)     and          parked        the

car a bout          ten minutes walk away from the                      ground.        I d o n ’t know what

road we       parked       in.



Once we       parked the          car we       followed the g roup of supporters                  walk in g       to

the   ground.            We d i d n ’t receive any             police     dir ec ti on or escort.



I d i d n ’t wi tn ess any disorder,                      fighting    or drunkeness       from our arrival

point     to the ground.                     Nor    did    I see any supporters          drinking alcohol

in the      street.



It was a bout 2. 4 5 p m           (1445)          w hen me and                a r r iv ed outside    the

g round,            There were         no o r d er ly queue at          that    time just a mass        of

s u p p or t er s    trying      to push their way towards                 the turnstiles              We

f or ce d our way          into the turnstile area,                  we were       in the middle       of the

mass.         We     stayed together               just about     because we were         being      pushed and

sh ov ed a bout         by hundreds           of    people a ro u n d    us,    we were all    trying        to

get    to the        turnstiles         so that we          could be     in the ground for           kick    off.


                         -c
[ d i d n ’t see a ny stewards                 outside       the ground only two          police      officers

in horse       back.          These      officers were          s ho uting and screaming at             the

:rowd a nd hitting               the    fans w it h sticks           to get     them to move.          No one

nad a ny      room to move             in.



I d o n ’t know           what h ap p e n e d at that         time    but all     of a sudden there was

a great       push        from behind u s .               The n we were pushed quickly forwards,

I had to        run       w ith the      crowd       I had no choice it just took us w i t h                 it.

We h ea ded towards a gate                    but    I can't     tell    you w h ic h one       it was.        This

gate was       open but      I didn't           see    it opened and           I don't know who opened

it.



I then felt myself            being           pushed through the            gate.         I felt all      faint

a nd dizzy,      I don't know             if my feet were             on the ground or           if I was      just

so s qu a s h e d that      the     pressure          of   people a r o u n d me had         lifted me      of the

ground.



Just    inside    this gate,          in the          courtyard       I fell       over               was

trying    to    lift me up,          I couldn't move               or breathe,         it was    like my

chest was       being       crushed there was               no air      in rny chest.

My head was       really hurting and                   I couldnot        see      properly every th in g

was    bleary.



Due    to the    pressure         of people           behind us trying             to push to the       front of

the queue,                  was     forced on top of me.                    We just       lay there and          I

blac ke d out



The    next    thing    I knew was that               I was     standing       up      agai ns t a wall,     I

don't    know w h ic h       wall    but it was            probably     in the         courtyard are a as         we

saw h undreds         of supp or te rs          run past us towards                the entrance       to the

pitch.



I didn't       see an y      stewards or police               officers       in     this area.



I didn't       hand    in    my tickets, I think                it got     lost in the       crowd.



We    didn't    get near      to the           tunnel      where a p p a r e n t l y   the   crowd had      run

into,    therefore,      we didn't   take     up our m a tc h viewing       position.



We saw    people    coming   out of the ground a few minutes                later    saying,

'They're     getting     crushed*.      We just       left the ground,       I don't       know

what    time,   of our    own free will       but   it wa sn 't    long after we had been

pushed    in.




I can't     comment    on the way the       incident was         handled after      the m a t c h

was    st op ped because we w e r en 't     there.          We d i d n ’t realise   that    it was

so bad until       we drove home and the            radio    commentator    said    people    had

died    in the ground.



I   don't w i sh to add a ny th i n g   for    the Judges        notice.

    Dear Mr Pyne

    Hillsborough Scrutiny - Police Statements

    Further to my letter of 7 May 1998 enclosed please find the statements of Fish and
    Spencer as requested.

    With regard to your facsimile letter of 12 May 1998 enquiring about a number of police
    statements relating to the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 15 April 1989, some of those
    statements were used as part of the police discipline enquiry and have been retained within
    the archive although not back in their original files. The statements are available and are
    enclosed herewith, with the exception of R221 Fish, R533 A B Spencer and R566 D Brooke
    which will follow shortly.

    QOR59 Sanderson was also registered as R306 and is a duplicate document, the latter
    forming part of the material provided to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny, a copy of
    which should already have been placed in the House of Commons Library.

    QOR84 Wild - the statement provided to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny was the
    original which was subsequently amended, a copy of which is attached hereto.
                                        ■\   v,,;
    QOR93 and QOR96 - the authors of these statements are as named on the reports which
    are complete. There are no further pages to the reports.

    QOR95 Cropley and QOR145 Drabble - in both cases the original and amended copies are
    attached together and form part of the material forwarded to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
    scrutiny.

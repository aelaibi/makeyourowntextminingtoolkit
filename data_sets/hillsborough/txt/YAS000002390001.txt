                  arrangements.
       (c)        Details of any fire alarm system Installed.
       (<J>       Details as to what fire fighting equipment Is provided,
                  and where It Is situated.
        (®)       Details of any public address system Installed.
      .<0         Details of any closed circuit television system Installed
                  to assist in crowd control.
     ..(g)        Details of any communications system Installed at the
                  ground.

       (N.B. In respect of ltens4(b) to (g) Inclusive, the details requested
       are required in triplicate only).

It will be necessary for all crush barriers, railings and walls to be tested by
an approved method to simulate crowd pressure, and It will be required that all
or some of these tests should be carried out In the presence of the appropriate
officers of the building authority.

Evezy effort will be made to ensure that when it is necessary to inspect the
ground, following the submission of an application for a safety certificate,
arrangements are made for the Police, the Fire Service, and the Building
Control Officer of the appropriate District Council to carry out their Inspections
at the same time, in order to avoid undue inconvenience to applicants, although
it appears likely that testing of crush barriers will of necessity take place on a
separate occasion.

 Dear Sir

 T’i1' ../OFFICE CIRCULAR NO. 150/76

^ f s T i OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975:                                                            •
FIRST DESIGNATION OicDER AND ACCOMPANYING REGULATIONS

1* The intention was expressed in Horns Office Circular No. 1-5-0/1975       issuing, in
due course, further guidance on the procedure to be followed when a ground is designated
under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 as requiring a safety certificate. As
will be seen from the enclosed copy, an order has now been made (SI 1976 Ko. 126*0
des.ignating undo-.r the Act. \rith effect from 1 January 1977 1 the international association
and rugby union football grounds and those of the clubs in the first division of the
football league.

 P.a It is an offence under section 12(1) of the Act to admit spectators to a designated
 stadium after the date on which the designation oi*dcr relating to it cc;r,cs into
operation, unless an application for a general safety certificate h&c been usdc and not
subsequently withdrawn or deeded to hare been withdrawn.- In consequence, therefore,
of this order, the local authorities for the areas in which, the grounds arc situated
jot#    expect to receive by the date of operation applications for the grant of general
       ■■ty certificates under the Act, which will thereupon fall to be dealt with in
     '^rdance vdth the Acv and the regulations, also enclosed made w id e r section 6(1) of

«    ft Act (SI 1976 Ho. 12b3).

5* Guidance as to the procedure to bo followed, in conformity vdth the regulations,
ill dealing vdth applications for general safety certificates is set out in the annex
to this circular.

ho It is not proposed at this stage to issue guidance as to the procedure to be
followed in conncction with the grant of spccial safety certificates, since, under
section 3(2) of the Act, such certificates are not required until general safety
certificates are :iu operation. Further guidance for this purpose will accordingly be
dcJ'ei*red until nearer the date when a need for spccial safety certificates may ariss•
Tiiere is, however, one lac cor regarding the issue of such certificates which may have
a bearing on the date of the introduction of a general safety certificate; and to which
regard r.uould accordingly be paiJ. O:\cc a general safety certificate has been issued,
a person wishing to conduct an activity calling for the issue of a special safety
oeri.xfi.cAto r“Jot comply with all the requirements relating to such certificates laid
dowr in the regulations. Vfnere, therefore, such an event has already been arranged*
local‘authorities ray v.deh to consider, v.-'ne-x-o appropriate, the desirability of not
issuing a general certificate until after the event has taken ple.ee ••

5c The- regulations provide specific time limits for the detor minafcion. of rvpplicatioija
for spcf.ial safety certificate.-.:„ but this is not the case as regards general saiely
ce.rt:i u.^ateso Although local authorities and the- clubs .and other organisations op^rat ir:;^
stcdi-H will no dvwbt have dose as much pre-planning aa possible, it *t> assu.r.od 1’ha.c the
 joys euid consultations involved In determining suitable terms and conditions will,
 inny cases, .-still extend ever several weeks, so tliat it will not be practicable,
 •dally should appellate proceedings arise, to bring certificates into effect
. ificantly in advance of the end oi' the 197b/?7 season*, In these circumstances,
  ’./hers a club or stadium coiupony wishes to take advantage of the close season to
 ■y cut structural work which will have the effect of significantly altering the
 \o and conditions which wouJd otherwise have applied, local authorities may feel tliat,
 ■nding on the condition of th e etndiwn and having regard to the powers already
    able to deal with cases of cevr.ro risk, the maximum advantage is to be gained by
 erring the issue of a certificate     until the beginning of the 1977/78 season so as
 ■:)abJ.e as much v/ork as possible to be done „la this wav, it   is hoped that it will
 sally be possible for a sufficient measure of agreement to be reached between the
 ■rested parties to obviate the .need for appeals against the terms and conditions
SSC&s


 It is suggested in paragraph 5 of the annex that local authorities will wish to keep
 lind tne guidelines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds when framing the
litions which they consider should be included in the safety certificate® S o x o o f
■it recoCTenrijitions have been revised in the light of the experience gained in applying
 guideline.'; during the pest year or so« The Guide is being reprinted and should bo
 labile well before the first designation order becomes effective: a copy will bo sent
;ou. as soon as it becomes available- A list of the proposed amendments to the Guide
attached for reference in the lneantirnao

 Section 6(l)(b) of the Act enables the Secretary of State to make regulations
icrising loco], authorities to deto.TT.iine the foes which may be charged in respect of
i.ications for safety certificates,, In the discharge of this power, regulation I k
.'ides that sue!) char'??:* r.:e\- ba i/ado in respect of applications for the issue or
Khnent of safety o*H:ificai...-s, bub that they shall not exceed an amount commensurate
i the work actually and reasonably done• As regards the issue of a goncxml safety
iificato it is hoped that, by affording stadium authori.ties an opportunity to co-operate
the full, by eg preparing plana, checking crush barriers, etc, local authorities should,
l.ho nox'is^l course, not find it necessary to charge fees representing woro than 17
''days' work.

 The club.? cud stadium authorities './hose sports ground.s are named in the designation               *
:.r have boon advised about their position. A copy'of that letter is enclosed for
r information* The note appended to the letter and cc/ering the procedure regarding
Lication.<> fox- general aafsty certificates is in the same terms as the annex to this
:ulaj',

 A further copy of this circular is enclosed for the information of -the Chief *

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GEOUKDS ACT 1975

 PROCEDURE RJD3ARDIKG APPLICATIONS FOR GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES

 1.   The Regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate ehall bo
 made in tho form contained in the Schedule to tha Kegulationo or a form to the lilts'
 effects Copies of the form are being niade available- to potential applicants and they
 are bsing advised of the need to provide ouch information in support of their applica­
 tion cto will cnablo the local authority to discharge its functions undex’ tb.o Act. In.
 particular, tha application should bo accompanied by detailed information as to tho
 structure, capacity, etc of the ctadi^j, including plans of the stadiusi, certificates
 relating to the testing of crush barriers and evidence of the applicant's status.    It
 is, however, open to a local authority, under section $(**) of the Act, to require. by
 notice .in writing, such further information of this kind as it may consider neccssary
 to enable it to determine tha taram and conditions to be included in the certificate=

 2.      On receipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local authority
 Bust first determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely
 to be in a position to prevent contravention of the teres and conditions to be imposed
      the certificate,.   If it considers him to be such a person the authority is then
    dor a duty to issue a general safety certificate to kin. In the case of a general
 safety certificate, where considerations of time are not paramount, the regulations
 impose no specific tisae lirait for such a detox-aination. In any event, it nuemo rrin:a
 facie unlikely that an application for a general safety certificate would be saade by
 a n ’us.qixalifisd person. Shore is, however, a right of appeal against a determination
 by a local authority that an applicant is not. a qualified person (see paragraph 10).

  3„       The local authority is required, by section 3(3>) of the Act, to send a copy of
  any application for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate Chief
  Officer of Police and building authority, aud must consult them about the teres and
  conditions to be iiieludc-d in the certificate.       In franing euoh co>vi!tions, local
  authorities v;ill no doubt wish to keep in wind the principles or guide lines set out in
  the C r.ida to Safety at Sports Grounds.       In this connection local authorities are
  reminded that, as vas pointed out in paragraph 6 of tho Annex to Como O.ffico Circular
 .Ko»1 5 0 / 1 S7 5 , this non-statntcry document is not a set of requirements to be rigidly
  applied regardless of individual circumstances. The maximum flexibility should be
  Maintained to taba account of the different cireu&stancco at individual grounds de.riv~
  irg from differences in such matters as age, sisc and soda of construction.          In this
^regard, it should also be noted that the Act provides that tin tex-ms and condition?,
 g & o u l d be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety13 mid it would to
  |*nreasonable, even if it v?cre practicable, to seek the absolute safety of everyone
  attending tho sports stadiua.

        It ia envisaged that there will be a good doal of consultation between the local
 authority and the stadium representatives in tho process of drawing up the certificate
 conditions.    In this v/ay, if evidence is advanced tha I; a ground is rarely filled to
 capacity, the local authoricy may consider it proper to base its requirements on ectval
 levels of attendance over- a given period rather than on maximum capacity. On the i;:.ve
 occasions on which a capacity crowd could be expected, separate provision might bo isnde
 for this contingency on the linos indicated in paragraph 7 belov;. Again, if a stand
 were found to be structurally weak, the local authority wight, in consultation with the
 stadiu,*a repr^ssntati v c s , offer the choice of having a n y necessary reisodlni vjoi'ks
 carried out or of restricting adasission to the stand until, it had.been strengthened.

 %     As ’
          ./ill be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs, the form and content of a
 safety certificate is likely to vary according to the circuKistanceu of the individual
 case.   Accordingly, a standard fora of certificate would not be appropriate» It <;.vt
 bowover contain full details of the terms and conditions imposed ir.cludi.ng, in
 particular, the matters referred to in section 2(2) cf the Act and have aunorod to r.t
 a plan of the stadium by reference to which the torus and conditions will be fra^vd.
    certificate-* vhen first issued ciay contain restrictive conditions which con then bo
  uiiod ox’ doloiad fcy CJuendrueiit of tho certificate*    The local Authority m y fixsd it
  venient to H o t t in a covering letter to the certificate, cuch Rodifications aa
  1 bo subsequently permitted, ©g in tho form of a otateraont of toe iucreaced spectator
  ivitieo to bo allowed for tha caparato sections of tho ground whan the various
  goo are cc«plctsd, of any future works programme fox* tha ground which* hao boon
 •cod with tha stadius authorities.        This arroBgernenfc, by excluding from tho cert if-*
 .te itself proposed conditions which would apply only to future works, ohould serve
  obviate confusion.     At tha ssxue tirro, however, crra must be taken not to exclude
 ■13 the certificate any restriction gcraane to current conditions, aiaco section 5 (3 )
  the Act providoa for an interested party to appeal to the S e c rotary of State against
 f inclusion of anything iu, or the omission of anything froz, a safety certificate,
 I these rights must not bo prejudiced in any way in consequence of the form cf tha
 •tificato*

   Ae regards the scope of a general safety certificate,    section 2(5) of the Act
 fvides that different terms and conditions may bo included for different activities*
 :hough, therefore* a etadiua u-ay bo in regular use only as a football ground, in
 ;.q o where it is also used from time to tiao tostags other events it would be desir-
Le, and in many cases obviate the need for special safety certificates, if the terms
:1 conditions appropriate to those events were to be included in the general certif-
xto*     It is suggested that any such events for which it is considered desirable to            (
svide might convenient!}' be divided into 2 clejssess

   (1 )   those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose 0 f the
          stadium for the normal ter.aa and conditions to be equally applicable;

   (2)    Those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
          concerts, etc which .'say involve all or part of the playing area being
          given over te spectator a c c o m o d a t i o n and fox* which separate teriso and
          conditions will have to be dovisod*            It is not, of course, necessary to
          provide .for these contingencies in cases whore no clear need is forossen
          by the stadiusa authorities*

     There oay also be circurastcatceo in which the terms and conditions applicable to
e novral activity of the tstadiua may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a special
-mt, such, as a cup tie or a "local Derby’S is expected to attract signiil'icaatly raoro
  a the usual attendance.       In the cass especially of cup replays these special events
 r arise with only a fov? days* notice, within which it would net be possible to
 joriirctodato the whole* of the statutory procedure appropriate to the grant of a special
 ~ct,y certificate. In order to overcome this difficulty, it would seem desirable for            t
 :M»c.al authorities and stadiua authorities to oeok to work out in advance the
 iSieatione te the normal terms rad conditions which might be appropriate to such
casioa-:-., eg the admission of increased nunbsrs to certain areas on tho condition
a%s;extra stewards and police are employed, that notice is given to tho local
tMority, and so on, and to provide for their incorporation in the general safety
rtificate.

    Or.co a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determination of
iy appeal, 'the terms and conditions can bo varied only by formal amendment of the
irtificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder of the certificate or
C the local authority (see section k ( 2 ) of the Act) and will presumably reflect
mn gee in cir cus*.stance s occurring since the grant of the original certificate*  It
ill thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities and clubs/stadium autlioriti.es
>r a close liaison to be maintained after the is site of the certificate and certainly
iilo any further works of safvty measures are being carried out.      It is likely to bo
i the etaCiusa operators’ finanicr.l interest to get the safety certificate amended as
>on as possible after work has been ccrapl-ctod, and they should accordingly ensure that
io Io.;aX authority is k e p i informed of progress*  For its part the local authority
U l :i o doubt wish to co-cpsrata by arranging matters so that, following completion
r the work, tin certificate can be amended without delay*
: ;                                                  <3

   9»   After a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for the transfer
   of the certificate to another person.    Similar3.y, while a local authority is considering
   an application for a certificate find before the certificate hao boon granted, it may ba
   asked to substitute soae poroon other than tho original applicant as tha person to whom
   the certificate should ba granted. Those arc, however, lifcely to bo rare occurrences
   in the cans of general' safety certificates, where an application will no.rwa.lly bo r.ado
   on behalf ox a club or a otacliuui organisation by an authorised official of the club
   or representative of tho organisation.    However, if it does happen, tho local authority
   will be required in both car:os to determine whether the substituted nominee is a
   qualified parson.  Tharc-after, in the first case, the procedure laid down in tho
   regulations relating to giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will
   apply together with any necessary appeals procedure.     In tho cecond case, there is no
   reason why the local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a
   new application in the terra of the original one and process it from the point it had
   already reached.

      1 0 c In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety certificate
     againct tha determination that he ia not a qualified person (eae paragraph 2 above),
       rtiich, of course, applies also in the c a s e of a proposed transfer of a certificate, the
(' ' ^ c t provides a further right of appeal to any "interested party" (which t^rm includes
   ® L e holder of the safety certificate) againot the inclusion of anything in or the
      omission of anything from a c-ai’ety certificate or against a refusal to amend or rcplace
      a safety certificate.    Tho regulations provide that, in the caso of a general safety
      certificate, notice of any such appeal shall be given within 28 days following receipt
      of a notice of tha local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not
      notified, the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper
      circulating in the locality.

    11.   In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or amending
    a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain specified
    "int.created p a v c i c s " and elao to advert*   their action in tha press.  It is regretted
    that it ha/?. been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of advertising, but, since
    Section 5(5) of the Act is not specific in the definition which it provideo of
    "interested party"« no other means could be found of ensuring that all persons who i-.ight
    validly claim to bo "interested parties" within the meaning of the Act should be able
    to acquaint themselves with the local authority's decision, and failure to bring tho
    decision to thoir notice could result in a denial of their rights of appeal or of a
    hearing by the Secretary of State.          For the same reaeon a similar obligation has been
.'^Mmpoeod on an appellant (by Regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and
 ^ a person wishing to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under
    section 3 ( h ) of the Act is required to give notice within 28 days of such advertisement.

   12, Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to-give the local authority notice
   of appeal, accoapanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the appeal.   It will
   then be for the local authority, in accordance with Regulation 8(9)? to inform the
   Secretary of State in writing within 23 days whether it wishes to oppose the appeal.
   With any such notice, the local authority is required to submit its reasons and any
   relevant supporting documents and to /state whether it wishes a hearing under sectr.cn
   of the Act.   (Tha procedure governing the conduct of all such hearings is sot out in
   Regulation 10 c)

   15,  It is al.'so open to the Secretary of State, if ho considers it necessary, to order
   a public inquiry under section 5 (6 ) of the Act in relation to any appeal.  In such a
   cases the procedure to ba followed is laid down in Regulation 12.

THE GUIDE TO SAIETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

AKBMDIffiNTS TO 11IE GUIDE

The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1973 and is based on the •

technical Appendix to Lord Wheatley*s Report of the Inquiry into Ground Safety

at Sport3 Grounds.     Since its publication; its use on a voluntary basis has

brought to notice the need for some amendments to be made to the guidelines

when applied to football grounds.


2.   During consideration of the Safety of Sports Grounds Bill, Ministers mentioned

that if the provisions of the Act were applied to sports grounds other than

football grounds, separate guides would be compiled for the different classes of

sports grounds.      The existing Guide will accordingly be revised and re-printed

as the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football). ’ The amendments which will

be made for this purpose are, in the meantime, attached as an appendix to this

note.


3.   These amendments include a new chapter covering the recommendations of tho

Minister for Sport's Working Party on Crowd Behaviour which was established in

1974 to look into means of combating hooliganism at football grounds.      Matters

of crowd control inevitably have a bearing on safety at sports grounds and it

has accordingly been thought right to incorporate the Working Party’s

recommendations for the general convenience of clubs and other stadium authorities,


4*   The main amendments in the attached list are as follows:

     a.   Exits-from each area of spectator'accommodation should enable the

          spectators to leave that area in 8 minutes or less.


     b.   Every spectator on the terrace should be within 12 metres of a

          gangway or exit.


     c.   Railings arid fences dividing sections of the ground should be of

          the same strength as handrails.


     d.   Depending on the condition of the individual stand, the time

          specified for the evacuation may lie between the prescribed

          maximum and minimum.
                                              n




     e.   A recommended distance from terrace to touchline is now given

          only for a terrace gradient of 30° or more.


     f.   The recommended flowrate from all sections of the ground has

          been increased to 60 persons per minute per unit of exit

          width except in the case of stands (where it remains at /j0 ).


     g.   Recommended strengths are given for handrails in various

          situations.


     h.   Recommendations of the Working Party on Crowd Behaviour.


5.   It is again emphasised that the recommendations made in the Guide to Safety

at Sports Grounds are essentially•guidelines and should be applied to existing*




                                                                                ^e4*
football grounds with the necessary degree of flexibility to take account of

particular circumstances at individual grounds.      The aim of securing a •

reasonable degree of safety should be kept uppermost in mind ; 1 it would be£

unreasonable{ even if it .were practicable', to seek the absolute safety of

evavyor-.c; ;;>-tending a ground.   /

                   "Recent research has indicated that when it takes more
                   than 7 mi mites to vacate an area of spectator accommo­
                   dation the crowd flow tends to become turbulent.   In
                   these conditions individuals can lose control over their
                   ovai movement and the rate of flow may be reduced.  It is
                   therefore suggested that the exits from each area of
                   spectator accommodation should be designed so that if
                   desire'd or required the spectators can leave that area
                   in 8 minutes or less."

      6.13        Amend to .... ..
                  "Care should be taken in the planning of exit systems to
                  ensure that crowds have access in an emergency to alter­
                  native exit routes in the event of their normal exit
                  route being obstructed."

Recommendations of the Working Party on Crowd Pehavlour

Crowd movement on terraces should be severely limited in
order to give the Police the fullest opportunity for crowd
control. Less problems occur where the terraces are
divided as f n r as possible into sections by the use o f ’
railings or bnrrxers, both radial and lateral.    Ideally,
each section should be self-contained and should be
serviced by its own entrance/exits, refreshxaent facilities
and toilets, (see para. 7*7•)

"Home" and visiting supporters should be segregated.  It
should not be possible for spectators to transfer from one
end of the ground to the other.

Acces« to playing pitches must be made as difficult as
possible in normal circumstances while,' at the same time,
providing the Police with proper access to the terraces for
the purposes of crowd control said enabling the pitch to be
used in the event of serious emergency. One alternative
to fencing is the construction around the pitch of a wall
with a smooth surface which should be not less than 4 feet
in height on the terrace side*. This boundary wall should
have gates or access points to the pitch which could be
manned by the Police or stewards. A walkway between the
boundary wall and the terraces, which would be solely
occupied by Police, First Aid and official club personnel,
has been found to be effective as regards safety and
security. In order to achieve this, it might be necessary
to remove one or two rows of terracing and to protect the
walkway from the terrace by a continuous lino of barriers,
so designed as to discourage access to the walkway except
at authorised points. The access points from terrace to
walkway should be reasonably near the access points from
walkway to the pitch,   (see para 7 «1 0 ) • Y/here a walkway
system is in use, sliding gates may be installed at the
access points from the walkway to the pitch, ie where there
can be no crowd pressure against thorn, (see para 6 .1/j.2
regarding use of sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to
the pitch is unnecessary whore seating extends to the level
of the playing area.

Clubs should carefully consider their arrangements for the
sale of alcohol. In any cose all refreshments should be
served in plastic containers.

Home clubs should consider, in conjunction with the Police,
each of the matches and determine which should be all-tickot,
and the allocation of tickets to the visiting club. So far
as the terraces are concerned, any allocation should have
regard to the manner in which the terraces are divided so
that policing rrrangements can be effective.

•Die home club should, as a general rule, make it their
policy not to issue tickets for announced all-ticket matches
to away supporters on the day of the game. However, the
local Police will be best able to assess the situation end
their advice should be followed, but it is important where-
ever possible to discourage 'supporters from travelling to
all-ticket matches without tickets.

Major Accident, ' Other factors such as the type, of accident , the -c.
probable number of services which will be involved, and the time vdiich ..
will be taken up in rescuing the injured must all be included in the
assessment,:e.g.- an air crash on an airport .‘involving fifty injured,
■who with relative Lease can be removed to hospital, is-not necessarily a
Major Accident , .whereas a collision involving two trains with fifty
people buried under wreckage .could be teamed a Major Accident >because of
the length of time and the extensive operations which .would be involved
in releasing .trapped victims,;.t : ;        i           -rydr

    Authorities as a preface to all initial alert and call out messages.


    SECTION 5   ACTIVATION PROCEDURE

    When a major disaster occurs It is probable the Police will receive the
    firsrfc notification, and consequently act in accordance with their "Major
    Disaster" Scheme. This scheme is designed to instantly alert all
    essential services, i.e. Fire, Ambulance, Medical Authorities, Railway,
    Aerodrome authorities etc.

    The Police h a v e a responsibility on site to control and to co-ordinate
    aspects relating to the disaster so as to enable Energency. Services and
    other' bodies' to discharge their responsibilities. :                r

    The extent to which each of these services is involved will depend upon
    the nature of the disaster but, whatever form:the incident may take and
    notwithstanding the size of .the task fading each of these .services the.
    Senior' Police Officer on site will be responsible for the control and
    co-ordination of action at the scene so as to enablethe Emergency
    Services and other bodies to discharge their responsibilities.
    Exceptionally and whenever a large scale fire is considered to be a
    major disaster,' then the Senior Fire Officer on site will be in control
    of all activity to extinguish the fire; in 'these circumstances the
    Senior Police Officer on site will remain responsible for the control
    and co-ordination of all other related activity on site.


0   SECTION 6   COUNTY/DISTRICT CO-ORDINATION

    Whenever a major disaster occurs in South Yorkshire a "co-ordinating cell"
    will be set up in the Emergency Planning Section at County Hall and
    manned full time irrespective of the number of local government authorities
    actively involved. This cell will be manned as quickly as possible after
    the Police have notified the County Chief Executive of the disaster through
    the County Emergency Planning Officer and will commence to operate if and
    when the effects of the disaster escalate beyond.the resources available
    to the District Council*in which it has occurred. .This cell will be the
    channel of communications for all reports and all.enquiries of the County
    pertinent'to the disaster.                                  .


    SECTION 7   PROCEDURE FOR DESIGNATING "OPERATION CATASTROPHE"

    Where Police and/or Ambulance Services are already in attendance at an
    incident the Senior Fire Service Officer present shall not unilaterally
    designate the incident a "catastrophe".

    Consultation shall take place between all -three services, and in such
    situations the incident will be interpreted as a "catastrophe" by agreement
    of the Police and Ambulance Services.
                                                                                   ^    3

    It is important to note that an incident demanding major mobilising of :)
    Fire Service resources would not necessarily be designated a ’’catastrophe”
    unlese a similar scale ofinvolvemeirtis: required .from the other two
    services.
                                                                                       ■■ /C x Y .\ !            \l < ’      'is .)

(f)    the North and West Stands were m odem structures, but the main stand

        the Chief Executive to the Club before any formal progress could be made on
        the application.

At the invitation of the Club, the Working Party took the opportunity of carrying out
an informal inspection of the Stadium in company with the Club's representatives.

Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 197'?

Following the .joint meeting at the Sheffield W ednesday Football Club ground on
'Jednesday, 13th December, 1973, it was agreed that Dr. Eastwood would prepare
and submit a comprehensive survey report on matters relating to the above Act.

 You may consider it advisable that, before receipt of that report, members of my
 staff make a joint survey of the premises under consideration with representatives
 of the Fire Service and, possibly, the Police. If you agree with this suggestion
 I suggest that you make the necessary arrangements with the Fire Service and Police
 and advise me of such arrangements.

 Yours faithfully,

I thank you for your lettar dated 22nd Decemter, 1978, and the cooy
lattar of the Building Surveyor of tha Sheffield Metropolitan
District Council.

It would seem essential that the officers.of the County Council and
Metropolitan District Council involved in the production of the
general safety cartificate raauirad by tha Sheffield Li'adnascay
Football Club under ths above Act, undertake a comprehensive survey
of tha ground.  I feel sure that it would be beneficial to the Club
if, initially, eech department acted in uni3on in this respect
rather than separately and I mould make tha necessary arrangements
with my officers for this to be achieved.

/T espy of the report of each department'should‘be provided to each
involved department to enable problems to be discussed so that an
accepted approach might be determined and consolidated into a single
report which should be forwarded to the Club.

This report, together with that of Dr. Eastwood, would rarm tha
basis of a further meeting with officials of the Club as differences
cf opinion, if any, would have been identified.

It is my opinion that the necessary comprehensive survey could not
ba undertaken satisfactorily without plan drawings.  In this raspect
I rafer to paragraph 1.3 of the 'green code’:

"The problem of crowd ssfsty at football grounds is complex and
cannot ba solved simply by ensuring that each component of a ground,
such as stairs, passages or sections of terracing, id satisfactory
in itself.  Ths inter-relation cf components is essentials  they
should be compatible and combine tc form a balanced unit".

Following the receipt cf drawings I suggest that Officers msec to
agrse on identification prccedures.  In order that each decartmant
is able to identify parts of the ground in a uniforin manner, I
wculd prefer to have stands and terraces claarly idantifiad, exit
routes, passages, gangways, gateways, doors, etc., numbered in a
consecutive mannar-and stairways lettered.

Officers of the County Council and Metropolitan District Council
have visitad the ground and I bslieva th.~t further visits should
be part of tha ‘comprehensive survey. Findings from visits other


                                                          Cont'd.

than the survay referred to will be limited and if we involve
ourselves in consultation with tha Club following the submission
of Dr. Eastwood's report with limited information this could
prove unfortunate in the long term.

As previously mentioned I prefer to await the ynvision of the
plan drawings which havs already been requested and if any
action csn be taksn to expedite this matter it would ba
appreciated.

        Dear Sirs,
                                         Certificate of Safety - Interim Report
                         We have now progressed sufficiently far with our
        survey and assessment to be able to submit an interim report
        covering the probable ground capacity and the likely costs of
        improvements which will be required by the certifying authority.
                         The green guide has been used as a- basis for our cal-
lil    culations, although as with probably all existing grounds,                                                       it
       will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
       guide.                Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of
       the fire officer and the police.


       Standing Accommodation.
       (a)               Spioa Kop
                                    The general layout of Spioa Kop is good.                                       It
                         has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
                         well below the maximum laid down in the guide.                                          The
                         slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements for
                         good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                                    The only questions therefore are the adequacy
                         of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
                         permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of



                                                   Reginerwi       in   England -   No. 1134531

            the exits.
                     Where the barriers are adequate in strength
            and spacing,    the guide recommends that the number
                                                           2
            of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m         of plan
            area.     Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
                                         2
            Kop is approximately 3120m       which would provide
            accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                     Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
            standards.      Category A must be able to withstand a
            test load of 6kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
            and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot) .
            In 1973 you had tests made on all the barriers by
            Toft and Brocklebank Ltd.        Of the 101 barriers on
            Spion Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb
            and a further 15 carried the load but had some actual
            or incipient defect which needed attention.          Host of
            those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
            would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
            On the other hand,    it was sometimes only one part of
            a long barrier which was weak.        The general situation was
            satisfactory compared with most grounds.
                     Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
            barriers up to a uniform category A standard.          It
            should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
            the tests and there will have been some deterioration
            due to rusting.      Host of the barriers are made from
            2§" diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
            inches when new.      Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield’s^
            atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers axe subject
            to more rusting than others and we must expect some
            increase in the number needing attention.
                     PrfcvldieTJ'a barrier can withstand 6kN/m,the
            maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
            guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5         to 2.9m
                                                                                         /
                                                                                   i /

            for slopes of 30°.        These figures apply to 'peak
            viewing' areas.        Spion Kop has an average slope
            of about 17° for which the recommended spacing is
            3.6m.
                      In calculating spectator capacity each barrier
             is assumed to cater for an area of ground immediately
            behind it which is either 3.6m wide or up to the
            next barrier, whichever is the smaller.        We have
            surveyed the Kop, and our drawing 1610/1 attached
            shows the proportion of the Kop which will be
            admissible in the spectator calculation if all the
            barriers are brought up to category A standard.             It
            will be immediately apparent that the great majority
            of the available area will qualify.        Our calculation
            shows that the permitted number of spectators should
            be about 13,900 i.e. the number of places 'lost' will
            be almost 3,000.
                      If you wish to retain moetiof. these extra places
            (aiming for a ground capacity of at least 50,000
            say) then new barriers could be constructed at positions
            shown by the red lines on the second copy of drawing
            1610/1.        The capacity would then be 16,000.
                      In proposing the extra barriers we are mindful
            that in some cases they will possibly hinder the
            close packing of spectators.        Clearly, there is no
            point in spending money in order to achieve a large
            permitted.ground capacity,      if that~numberrcannot
            then be packed in.        However, we think that even with
            an uneven distribution of spectators it will still be
            possible to accommodate 16,000 spectators.
                      You may wish to consider whether the cost of
            these extra barriers will be justified by the additional
            income they might generate over the years.          It is
                                                                      SHEET

           likely that new barriers, which will require fairly
           massive foundation and anchor blocks will cost between
           £50 and £60 per metre run.      Thus the extra 235 metres
           of barrier will cost about £5.00 per extra standing
           place.
                    Spion Kop is not ideally catered for by exits.
           A very adequate gangway system feeds to only three
           exit points.     The total width of these three exits
           at their narrowest points is 12.5m.     The guide assumes
           a maximum flow rate through these exits of 60 persons
           per minute for each 550mm of width.      Thus the
           theoretical time to discharge 16,000 spectators from
           Spion Kop would be 11$minutes, compared with a maximum
           of 8 minutes indicated by the guide.
                    The exits at each end of the terrace are reasonably
           free from hazards,    except the one at the North end passes
           under a bridge with a headroom well below the recommended
           value of 8ft.      This defect could be removed by lowering
           the floor level,    but I would argue strongly that it is
           far from essential to have such a large headroom, and
           the cost of modification is not justified in an existing
           structure.
                    The exit at the back of Spion Kop is likely to
           raise most difficulty.      The ramp is steep and it has
           an appreciable cross-fall at the top where there is also
           a change of direction.      At one'side is a vertical drop,
           which has guard rails which appear to be reasonably
           strong, but this* can only be established by testing.
           We shall need some indulgence by the licensing authority,
           if no works are to be requested.      My feeling is that
           continuous handrails will be required,    splitting the
           ramp into say three separate lanes.
                    There may be considerable pressure to increase
                                                                                  SHEET   5.

                     the total exit capacity.        We can argue that the
                     eight minutes allowed for complete evacuation is only
                     really valid for stands where there night be a risk
                     due to fire, or explosion^ or structural failure.           in
                     the case of terracing it is only the impatience of
                     spectators which might create danger.        For an interim
                     period, at least, this should be acceptable.
                            Any changes or additions to the exit arrangements
                     should take account of a possible future decision to roof
                     over Spion Kop.        It would be possible to incorporate in
                     such a scheme a 'squaring off' at the top which could
                     increase the area available for spectators*           However,
                     this would probably mean that additional entrances would
                     be needed, possibly by tunnelling through the bank at
                     lower level.        This would certainly make it easier to
                     pack the crowd more uniformly. .      However, this is a
                     matter for the future and is unlikely to be part of the
                     present exercise.

                     The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North West Corner)
,«        < »
                            The west terrace is not quite so well endowed with
                     barriers as Spion Kop.        The present layout is shown on the
                     attached drawing 1610/2.        Our measurements show a total
                                     o
                     area of 1480m       but there are no gangways.    We feel that
                     some allowance should be made for circulation space as
                     spectators have to move quite considerable horizontal
     (2 \A^          distances to achieve good packing.        The full area would
     O           v
          vo ^
                     justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
                     probably be appropriate to allow 10% as          the equivalent
                     of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.           The
                     barriers should be designed to match this figure approximately.
                            The shaded area on drawing 1610/2 is that which
                     ma y be counted if the existing barriers are of class A.
                     About 15 of the existing barriers are likely to need


                                                                                               i/

            strengthening to achieve this standard.          Even with
            this strengthening only 4,300 spectators could be
            accommodated, representing -a loss of nearly half~
            We presume this would be unacceptable.
                      The extra barriers required to achieve
            approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
            second copy of drawing 1610/2.           You may feel that
            some of the proposed new barriers which are close
            to the entrances might restrict the passage of
            spectators undesirably.           In that case they could
            be omitted.
                      The three exits have a total width of about
            11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
            to leave the ground.        Thus the stand could empty
            in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                      The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
            should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.          There are
            no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an                        .■id.-1^

            exit.      But we feel this is of no consequence as
            movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
            and quick.

   (C )     The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                      This area is also illustrated in the drawing
            1610/2.        The gross area available (there are no gangways)
                               2
            18 about 565 m .        Thus if the crush barriers were
            adequate and the whole area is included the number of
            spectators could be about 3,050.
                      Unfortunately,   the crush barriers in this area
            were shown to be very inadequate when tested in 1973.
            Only one was tested .and the rail and posts were bending^
            at a load of only 270 lb/ft.          Because of this result
            none of the others was subjected to a test load.             We

                                                                                          y

                  have examined the drawings of these barriers and
                  in addition to the weakness of the rails and posts,
                  the holding down arrangements appear to be very
                  inadequate and might be treacherous.          A sudden
                  failure of a bolt, and they are very highly stressed,
                  could lead to a collapse without warning.          These
                  barriers need major strengthening as a matter of
                  urgency.
                             Assuming that the barriers are strengthened
                  it will be seen from the drawing 1610/2 that they
                  also need considerable supplementation.           The scheme
                  shown on the second copy of this drawing does not
                  quite justify the whole area being taken in the
                  calculations.       But it would be reasonable to count
                  say 2900.       This would bring the total standing at
                  the Leppings Lane end to 10,100..
                             The exits serving this part of the terrace are
                  very adequate, but there may be requests for central
                  handrailings to be provided.


        Seating Accommodation
         (a)      The North Stand
                             The fora of construction of this stand is such
                  that it presents a minimum fire hazard.           The exits
                  are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy the
                  recommendations of the guide.
                             Two matters might cause concern.       The first,
                  the fact that -the--exits-are marginally below ,t&e .          .
                  recommended minimum of 1.1a, is we think of very little
                  consequence.       However,   the second,   the narrow gangways
                  which are only about half the recommended minimum may
                  cause some* ^Iffieul^fey- X-t would be possible,.tQ Jsiden^
                  the gangways by taking one seat off the end of one of
                  the rows meeting at each gangway.           As the gangways

                                                                          SHEET


EASTW OOD ft PARTNERS




           are the same in the other stands the total number of
           seats lost would be 1,041.         This is almost unthinkable
           and must be resisted strongly.
                   Fortunately, the timing of spectators leaving              _
           the ground on 6 January     shoved that a peak of 80 per
           minute passed through one exit.           This is the figure
           quoted by the guide for a 1.1m gangway.           With 18 exits
           for 10,000 people the average would be 556 per unit.
           Thus the stand vould empty in about seven minutes,
           which is within the recommended limit of eight minutes.
                   Our observations on 6 January shoved that everyone
           had left this stand, apart from a fev people who vere
           in no hurry,in about six minutes, although we also counted
           about 40 per exit vho left before the final vhistle.
           The overall picture appears very satisfactory and
           encourages the hope that this stand vill be accepted
           as not needing any significant modification.
                                                 f
   (b)     The West Stand
                   This stand is very similar to the north stand
           in its construction.       We vere not able to accurately
           assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
           January because there vere many seats vhich vere unsold.
           Hovever,     there is every reason to believe that there
          vill be no difficulty in vacating this stand vithln
           eight minutes also.       There should be no need for
           significant modifications.

   (c)    The South Stand
               -        - The structure- has been surveyed and appended
           are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
           show the plans and cross-section.          Also attached is
          a sfeWting plran; drawing No. 1610/6.               -               --
                   The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
           has 5710 seats.       These are served by 10 exits (excluding
                                                                             SHEET   9

             those serving the directors box) so that an average
             of 570 people need to pass through each exit.           The
             count on 6 January shoved an average of just over 70
             per minute passing through one exit which corresponds
             to an emptying time of about eight minutes.           Indeed
             there vere very few people still trying to get out six
             minutes after the final whistle.           A few had no doubt
             left early and a few were still standing around, but
             the stand had substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                       Having left the top of the stand the spectators
             have to make their way from the first floor landing via
             one of three staircases.         Two of these are 3.6m wide
             and the other 2.4.         This is equivalent to 17$ 'lanes'
             of 550mm.        At 40 people per lane,    700 people pass per
             minute.         To discharge 5710 people (less those in the
             directors box) will therefore take almost exactly 8
             minutes as permitted by the guide.
                       The fire officers were clearly very interested
             in the first floor.         There is very little ’fire load'
             on this floor - the snack bars and the office/lounge.
             But quite a small fire might fill this area with smoke.
             We suspect that there might be a request for it to be compart
             mentalised by fire doors.
                       At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
             almost straight to the open air,, through a compartment
             which is separated from the main part of the building.
             The third staircase is not so well separated and some
             structural work may be needed.         Apparently the paint
             store is beside this staircase.           This may not be wise.
                       There may well be requests from the fire officer
             for CQnsiderable extra precautions and structural,
             alterations in this building.
                       The front, open-air part of the south stand is

          If all the new barriers which we have suggested
   are installed the capacity will become

           If it is required to increase this capacity at some
   time in the future Spion Kop could be 'squared off' at the
   back using a steel framed structure and perhaps a further
   4000 places could be provided.      The Kbp could also be
   roofed over, of course.

             This total should not at this stage be taken as
     more than a broad guess.     We may have pleasant surprises
     but there could be shocks.      The total does not contain
     any allowance for the local authority's charges in
     connection with the Issuing of the licence or for our
     professional fees.


     Future Action
             Subject to your approval we suggest that the next
     steps might be as follows :-

     1.     We   should pass copies of all drawings to the police,
             the fire brigade, the city Building Surveyor and the
             County Council.    In addition to drawings showing
             the results of our surveys of the Kop, the Leppings
             Lane terrace and the south stand, we are preparing
             suitable drawings of the north and west stands,
             measuring from the photo-copies of Husbands drawings.

     2.     We   should make firm proposals to the police and the
             fire brigade for the new crush barriers, together
             with our computation of the number of spectators, and
             invite comments including a n y suggestions of further
             measures which may be needed.

     3.     At   the same time we should make detailed drawings and
             specifications for the strengthening work on the
             barriers which are known to be weak, andfor the con­
             struction of the new barriers, and obtain tenders.

    4.      W e ’"Should request-a meeting with the police and the
             f ire~brigade~to-discuss the stands and to try to agree
             what may need to be done to bring them up to standard.

     5.     We should discuss in detail with the police their
             requirements for a police office, and prepare a detailed
             design.

            6.       We should discuss with the police and fire officer
                     what other services such as alarms, communications
                      etc. are needed, prepare an agreed scheme and
                      obtain tenders.    _


            A Meeting with The Club
*£                    You may feel that another meeting to discuss this
'           report and the suggestions for further action, should be
            held shortly.         Dr. Eastwood will be out of the country
            for three weeks from 22 January so that the week beginning
            15 January would be appropriate.

                                                     RETORT ON GROUND CAPACITY


                        This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
    which is attainable.
                        It deals in broad terms with the necessary strengthening
    and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
    calculations are made of the theoretical exit times.
                        Calculations of exit times are also made for each of
    the stands and reference is made to the observations which were
    made at the end of the third round cup-tie on 6 January,                                                     1979.
                        The green guide has been used as a basis for our cal­
    culations, although as with probably all existing grounds,                                                      it
    will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
    guide.                Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the
    fire officer and the police.

         Standing Accommodation
         (a)      Spion Kop
                           The general layout of Spion Sop is good.            It
                  has a very adequate number of gangways, vith spacings
                  well below the maximum laid down in the guide.             The
                  slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
                  for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                           The only questions therefore are the adequacy
                  of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
                  permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of
                  the exits.
                           Where the barriers are adequate in strength
                  and spacing,      the guide recommends that the number
                                                                    o
                  of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m            of plan
                  area.        Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
                                                 2
                  Kop is approximately 3120m         which would provide
                  accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                           Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
                  standards.        Category A must be able to withstand a
                  test load of 6kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
                  and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
                  In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
                  and Brocklebank Ltd.       Of the 101 barriers on Spion
                  Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb and
                  a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
                  incipient defect which needed attention.           Most of
                  those which failed the test,        failed so badly that- they
                  would- p r o b a b l y n o t satisfy category B standard either. --
                  On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of a
                  long barrier which was weak.         It should be emphasised
                  that the general'situation was satisfactory compared- .                      -
                  with most grounds.
                           Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the

            barriers up to a uniform category A standard.          It
            should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
            the tests and there may have been some deterioration
            due to rusting.       Most of the barriers are made from
            2§" diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
            inches when new.       Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield’s
            atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
            to more rusting than others and it is possible that
            there will be an increase in the number needing attention.
                     Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/m,     the
            maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
            guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5° to 2.9m
            for slopes of 30°.       These figures apply to 'peak viewing’
            areas.       Most of Spion Kop has a slope of about 17°
            for which the recommended spacing is 3.6m.        The slope of the
            upper part      changes to 25   for which the spacing is
            3. lm.
                     Whilst we believe it is arguable that parts of
           Spion Kop could be considered as not being 'peak
           viewing areas' we are prepared to accede to the police
           view and use peak viewing area standards for all barriers.
           This also applies to the stands at the west end of the
           ground.
                     We propose that the existing barriers should be
           supplemented by new ones as shown in red on the attached
           drawing 1610/1X.        The green shaded area behind each
           barrier shows the area which can then be assumed to be

           available for spectators.  This area is 2958m          which
                            2
           at 54 persons/lOm gives a capacity of 15,973.            It
           should'be kept- in mind that as many as 20,000 spectators
           have been admitted to the Kop in the past.

                      Spian Kop has three exits, one near each
                end and one at the top.               The total width of
                these three exits at their narrowest points is 12. 5m.
                The guide assumes a maximum flow rate through such
                exits of 60 persons per minute for each 550mm of
                width.      Thus the theoretical time to discharge
                16,000 spectators from Spion Kop would be Ilf minutes,
                compared with a maximum of 8 minutes indicated by the
                guide.      We do not consider this to be a serious
                matter.      Rapid evacuation (in say 8 minutes) is very
                desirable for stands where there may be a risk due to
                fire, or explosion, or structural failure.                 In the
                case of terracing it is only the impatience of spectators
                which might create danger.            We believe that for an
                interim period at least the evacuation time of Ilf
                minutes should be acceptable.
                          The exits at each end of the terrace are
                reasonably free from hazards, except the one at the North
                end passes under a bridge with a headroom below the
                recommended value of 8ft.             This defect could be
                removed by lowering the floor level, but we believe
                it is far from essential to have such a large headroom,
                and the cost of modification is not justified in an
                existing structure.
                          The exit at the back of Spion Kop would benefit
                from handrails dividing it into lanes.              Some remodelling
                of the approaches to the ramp may also be thought
                desirable.

             be made for circulation space as spectators have
             to move      quite considerable horizontal distances
             to achieve good packing.         The full area vould
             justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
             probably be appropriate to allow 10% as the equivalent
             of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.
             The barriers should be designed to match this figure
             approximately.       Those barriers which cannot withstand
             6kN/m should be appropriately strengthened, and extra
             ones provided where necessary.
                        The extra barriers required to achieve
             approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
             attached copy of drawing 1610/2X.
                        The three exits have a total width of about
             11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
             to leave the ground.      Thus the terrace could be
             emptied in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                        The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
             should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.             There are
            . no gangways and some spectators will be 25a from an
             exit.      But we feel this is of no consequence as
             movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
             and quick.

      (c)    The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                        This area is also illustrated in the drawing
             1610/2X.       The gross area available (there are no
                                         2
             gangways)     is about 565 m .          Thus if the crush barriers
             were adequate and the whole area is included the number
             of spectators could be about 3,050.

             brought up to standard and supplemented in red as

               shown in green.   This area is about 535m corresponding
           —   to about 2900 spectators.     This would bring the total
               standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                       The exits serving this part of the terraces
               are very adequate in width and there will be no
               difficulty in emptying in eight minutes.


     Seating Accommodation
     (a)       The North Stand
                        The form of construction of this stand is
               such that it presents a minimum fire hazard.      The
               exits are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy
               the recommendations of the guide.
                       The exits are very marginally below the
               recommended l*lm width,   but we do not consider this
               to be of great consequence.
                       Gangways are only 640mm wide for much of their
               length (they widen round the exit).     This is well
               below the green guide recommendation.      However,   it
               is clearly appropriate to take into account the
               general nature of the stand, the number as well as
               the width of the gangways, and above all the ease and
               speed   with which spectators can evacuate the stand.
                       On 6 January we counted the number of spectators
               leaving in successive minutes after the final whistle.
               The figures were 71, 72, 80 and 73.     Thereafter
               the number fell off as the spectators were in no hurry.
               This established that in an emergency the green guide
               figure of 80 per minute (relating to a l*lm gangway)
               can be achieved.     With 18 exits for 10,000 spectators
                                                                      SHEET   7.

           the average is 556 per exit.     Thus the stand vould
           empty in about seven minutes, which is within the
           recommended limit of eight minutes.
                  Our observations in company with the fire
           officer^ staff on 6 January showed that everyone
           had left this stand, apart from some people who were
           in no hurry,    in about six minutes, although we also
           counted about 40 per exit who left before the final
           whistle.     The overall picture appears very satisfactory
           and we suggest that this stand should be accepted
           as not needing any significant modification.

    (b)    The Vest Stand
                  This stand is very similar to the north stand
           in its construction.      We were not able to accurately
           assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
           January because there were many seats which were unsold.
           However,    there is every reason to believe that there
           will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
           eight minutes also.      There should be no need for
           significant modifications.

    (c)    The South Stand
                  The structure has been surveyed and appended
           are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
           show the plans and cross-section.        Also attached is
           a seating plan,    drawing No. 1610/6.
                  The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
           has 5710 seats.      These are served by 12 exits (excluding
           those serving the directors box) so that an average
           of 476 people need to pass through each exit.        The
           count by the fire officer's staff on 6 January showed
           an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
           exit which corresponds to an emptying time of about
           seven minutes.    Indeed there were very few people


                                                                                   i/
                                                                        SHEET   8.


EASTW O O D f t PARTNERS




              still trying to get out six minutes after the final
             whistle.      A few had no doubt left early and a few
             were still standing around, but the stand had
              substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                      Having left the top of the stand the spectators
              have to make their way from the first floor landing
              via one of three staircases.       Two of these are 3.6m
              wide and the other 2.4.       This is equivalent to 17$
              'lanes' of 550mm.     At 40 people per lane, 700 people
              pass per minute.     To discharge 5710 people (less
              those in the directors box) will therefore take almost
              exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.
                      At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
              almost straight to the open air,     through a compartment
              which is separated from the main part of the building.
              The third staircase passes through a wide lobby which
              will probably need three sets of self closing fire
              doors to separate it from the remainder of the building.
              The club intends to move the paint store from the
              space behind this staircase.
                      The front, open-air part of the south stand is
             well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
              one passage.     This passage has a theoretical capacity
              of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.
             This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.       Because
              the stand is open to the air and there is very
              rea,dy access to the pitch we do not think this rather.
              long emptying time is of any great consequence.


    General Requirements
             The police and. the fire officer, and possibly the...
    Building Surveyor, will no doubt wish to discuss a number of
    matters.      Prior to holding a further formal meeting they

       will probably wish to study the drawings and to pay a
       further visit.     We would like to be present when any
       further inspection is made and would appreciate contact
       being made with Dr. Wood during Dr. Eastwood's absence
       which will extend to 15 February.
               If the police would like to suggest the kind of police
       post they would like,    this can be considered by the club
       and   drawings prepared by us as a matter of urgency.
               A meeting to discuss all    aspects of the application
       might be held around say 16 February.
               In the meantime Eastwood & Partners    will be checking
       the   various electrical services so that we shall be in a
       position to discuss these at the meeting.


       Future Ground Capacity
               Following the upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
       out of such other works as may be required it is hoped the
       ground capacity will not fall below 50,000 made up as follows
               Seating approximately                 24.000
               Standing on Spion Kop                 16.000
               Standing at Leppings Lane end
               (total including N.W. corner)         10,100

                                                     50,100

              It will be recalled that in recent years agreement
       has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
       be admitted to the ground.-     This involved of the,-order, of
       19.000 - 20,000 spectators being -on Spion Kop.        Indeed., it   r
       is believed that in the days when crowds of approximately
       70.000 were accommodated in the ground, the figure on Spion
      Kop probably'approached 30,000.-                        -------
              It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
       excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

described in a Report.

the Architectural & Building Services Division, the plans supplied and finally
accepted by the Working Party could form the basis of the Certificate
Drawings.

3;_____Report

(a)    General

It w as recognised that the criteria set out in the Home Office "Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)" required new work or reconstruction
to be to a standard not lower than the standard set out in the Guide, and that
in existing situations the criterion was that of a reasonable degree of safety.
A s the Guide stated, it would be unreasonable, even if it were practicable,
to seek the absolute safety of everyone attending a ground.

With these factors in mind, both the Fire Service and the Police felt that
the flow of spectators was the most important criteria to be adopted.
Whilst not disagreeing with this viewpoint, the Building Authority suggested
it would be useful to know the reasoning behind the recommendation in the
Guide that gangways should not be le ss than 1.1 m etres wide. The County
Council AGREED to try to find this information out, and the Fire Service
AGREED they would contact their colleagues in other areas who had been
involved in the Certification process to ascertain how nearly the 1 .1 metre
gangway recommendation had been observed in existing situations in their
respective areas.

At the request of the Fire Service, the County Council also AGREED to try
and find out if there was any general recommendation on reduced
adm ission if a ground were used at a night time instead of during the day
time.

<b)    Front Cover

Whilst it was probably a typing m istake, it was AGREED that the wording
on the Front Cover should read "REPORT TO SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY
COUNCIL" and not "REPORT OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL”.
The Working Party agreed with the Club's view that, with the existing three
exits, there was nc way that the recommended discharge time of 8 minutes
could be met. Where they disagreed was that an evacuation time of I l f
minutes should be regarded as acceptable. If no more exits were to be
provided, the Working Party AGREED that a crowd limitation of 11,040
on the Spion Kop should be imposed.

The existing exit at the North end passed under a bridge with a headroom
below agreed by the Club to be le s s than the recommended value of 8ft.
A s this was in fact some 6' 6", the Working Party AGREED that the Club
be informed that in their view it is essential that the floor be lowered to
remove this danger to spectators.

The exit at the South side would also require widening, and possibly flow
b arriers would need installing.

The area at the back of the Kop would also require close attention.

If new exits were to be provided by the Club, it was AGREED that at least
TWO would be required. The m ost economical way of providing one would
be to use the gates in the existing barrier, provided these were lined up with
the gangways, with discharge onto the pitch surround, and the other would
require to be a completely new exit.

The Building Authority felt that the majority of the crush barriers would fail
the te sts, and consequently any necessary re-sitin g would probably not be
too much of a problem. Certainly the suggested additional barriers would
require careful consideration.

For the purposes of crowd control, the Police suggested there should be some
ftlrm of lateral separation. The Working Party AGREED, and it was suggested
that three metal fences sited centrally in the blocks (as opposed to adjacent     i,
to the gangways) should be provided, with a c c e s s between each limited to a ^
padlocked gateway under the control of the Police.

A s recent adverse weather conditions had proved, ice and snow on the Kop
could cause problem s, and it was AGREED that Paragraph 11 (4) of the draft      (r
Certificate should be amended so a s to require the Club to take steps to
clear the Kop of ice and snow before a game was played.

The Building Authority pointed out that information was still required from
the Club on profile and step dimensions and the slope of the Kop.
(d)    The West T errace     (pages 4&5)

In view of the lack of depth of this terrace, the Club's offer to reduce the    &U//
spectator lim it to 7 ,2 0 0 , and the discharge time of G. 6 minutes, the
Working Party AGREED that it would be unreasonable to in sist that
gangways or additional exits must be provided.

However, even if the existing crush barriers were to p ass the te sts, the
Working Party AGREED that the barriers would require special attention
In view of the apparant sharp edges, corrosion, etc.

(e)    The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 6)

The Working Part}' AGREED there were no real problems here, but the
Building Authority pointed out that a s w ell as the crush barriers, the
existing corrugated sheeting would require to p a ss the appropriate te s ts.

(f)    The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

Whilst the flow rates and discharge tim es were probably satisfactory (the
construction and width of the ramps being such that they could quite properly
be regarded as elevated roadways), the fact remained that the gangways in
the North Stand were only 640mm wide for much of their length, compared
with the recommended width of 1.1 m etres.

Additionally, observations had shown that two-thirds of the spectators used
the upper exit, whilst the remainder used the lower exit. An ideal would be
to provide additional exits at the top of the stand but, in view of Its cantilever
construction, the cost would be prohibitive.

As an alternative, the Working Party AGREED that consideration might be
given to removing a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangway
to the upper exits, with a physical barrier a c r o ss the stand below the upper
exits to ensure more equal use of both upper and lower exits by spectators.
If this would cause difficulties, a barrier in the gangways only below the upper
exits might be considered.

So far a s the Wire Mesh barriers under the stand w ere concerned, the
Working Party AGREED that these must either be removed or made of a
permanent construction.

(g)     The West Stand

Whilst the exits w ere adequate and well spaced and the discharge tim es
w ere acceptable in view of the type of stand, the Fire Service felt that
the means of escape were not adequate as the only means of earress was
by way of two sta ir ca se s. The Working Party AGREED that it was essential
that another staircase be provided, and one on the south-west corner was felt
to be the m ost acceptable.

(h)     The South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

So far a s the seating arrangements were concerned, the Working Party
felt that it was the front, open air part which caused the concern. Because
of the bad in g r e s s /e g r e s s , the Working Party AGREED that two additional
exits would be required. It was suggested that the most economical way of
doing this was by means of one discharging at the Spion Kop end and the
other by breaking through the wall by the Tea Bar.

Additionally, the penning arrangements of the seating would need to be
looked at closely.

A s the balustrades and handrails were constructed of timber, the Building
Authority considered they would be likely to fail the appropriate tests.
A lso, as the staircase was a 24 instead of the maximum 12 r ise r recommended
In the Guide it was probable that this would have to be reconstructed.

Contrary to their initial reaction, the Fire Service felt that, provided that the
n ecessary increased fire resistance m easures were carried out, the stand
would not be the problem from a combustability point of view that they had
anticipated.

The Building Authority expressed concern as to the corrosion of the steel
work of the stand, and considered that this would require investigation.

The P olice expressed concern about the use of the car park behind the
Stand. P erson s entitled to use this car park frequently arrived just before
the start of a match and drove through the spectators attempting to gain
a c c e s s to the ground. As they left immediately afterwards, the same thing
occurred at the end of a match. This practice had to be stopped, either by
banning the use of the car park entirely on match days or imposing some sort
of time restriction on its use before and after a match.

(h)     General Requirements

These were not discussed by the Working Party at this stage.

(i)    Future Ground Capacity

If additional exits are not provided on the Spion Kop, this will have the
effect of reducing the ground capacity to 45,140, made up as follows.—

I refer to my minute of 5th March, 1979, and to the recent telephone
conversations between Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff and Divisional Officer
K. Jones of your Fire Prevention Secfon.

Following the return from holiday o f the Chairman of the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club L td ., the Club Secretary Informed me that the 30th March,
1979 was not convenient. That meeting has, therefore, now been arranged
for 2.30 p .m . on Monday, 2nd April, 1979, after conferring with the members
of the Working Party.

However, because of evident differences of opinion on means of escape,
tile original time and date of 1 0 .0 0 a .m . on 30th March, 1979 (but at
your Headquarters) Is being retained to discuss these differences, prior
to meeting the Club.

1.        Purpose of Meeting

Following the postponement of the meeting with the Club because of adverse
weather and the difficulty in agreeing a mutually convenient alternative
date, the purpose of the m eeting was to review the position since 12th February,
1979, prior to the r e - a r r a n g e d meeting with the Club which was now to take
place on 2nd April, 1979.

2.        P lan s

The plans at 1:500 scale and indicating all site fixtures were, it was still understood,
to be supplied by Eastwood & Partners at the meeting with the Club.

          R eport
(a)       General

T he County Council had contacted the Home Office, but had been given little
information additional to that contained in their v a rio u s C ircu lars. Basically,
they had said that any new work or reconstruction had to be to a standard not
lower than that set out in the Guide. However, the maximum flexibility had
to be maintained in the case of existing structures and differences in such
matters as age, size and mode of construction had to be taken into account.

IFii#' Fire Service had contacted four other B rig a d e s with designated grounds,
Mad only in one case had the recommendations of t i e Guide been strictly


                                        1.
Additional to the points mentioned on 12th February, 1979, concern was
e x p ressed by the Building Authority as to the general maintenance of the Kop
and the lo ose and broken concrete at the bottom in particular. If attention
was not given to this, it was AGREED that it would be necessary to restrict
adm ission to the Kop, additional to the restriction to 11, C40 if the extra
exits are not provided.

On the question of exits, it was again AGREED that it was essential to line
up the gates in the existing barrier with the gangways. Of the existing two
exits, concern was expressed as to the effect of the right-angled turn on
the embankment at the exit at the rear. After discussion, it was AGREED
that the best compromise was to leave things as they existed, provided
handrails are provided on the stairways, taking into account the
desirability of maintaining a smooth flow.

The Fire Service queried the exact form of the lateral separation discussed
at the meeting on 12th February, 1979, as this would naturally have a
bearing on the means of escape recom m endations. After discussion, it
was AGREED that the metal fences should not be of the climb-proof type,
that it was not intended that they should obstruct the gangways, and that
in consequence the padlocked gateway recommendation should be dropped.
However, it was AGREED that it was still desirable to seek 3 x 2 central
barriers but, if the Club really r e siste d the suggestion, 2 x 2 could
reluctantly be conceded. The Building Authority str e sse d that whatever
barriers were provided would have to p ass the appropriate strain te sts.

The fact that the height of many of the existing crush barriers was below the
recommendation in the Guide, in some ca ses well below, was pointed out by the
Building Authority. The corrosion point mentioned at the la st meeting was
also reiterated. It was AGREED that these points must be drawn to the
Club's attention, as must the condition of the Score Board Structure.

(c)      The West Terrace (pages 4 & 5)

A s w ell as the condition of the crush barriers mentioned at the la st meeting,
tiie Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places of the
terracing in sm all areas near to the stand. The c r o s s -fa ll on the steps on
the north-west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw
people forward. The height of the crush barriers mentioned in regard to the
Spion Kop also applied. It was AGREED that all these points must be drawn
to the Club's attention.

(d)      The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 6)

Having now had the opportunity of having a c lo ser look at the existing corrugated
sheeting, the Building Authority confirmed that it would require alteration to
m eet the requirements of the Guide.
                                         £7

(e)      The North Stand (pa%es 6 & 7)

The rem oval of a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangway
to the upper exits and the rem oval of four seats at those exits was
confirmed as being a reasonable compromise to put to the Club.

A s the asb estos sheets at the top of the stand were protected, the Euilding
Authority fe lt that these could be accepted, and confirmed that the glazing
at the ends of the stands was not g lass and so would not shatter.

(f)      The W est Stand (page 7)

Consideration was given to the Building Authority's suggestion of lateral
gangways and the segregation oi' exits but, after discussion, it was AGREED
that the additional staircase agreed at the la st m eeting should be confirmed.
So long as it was of 4-unit exit width, it was AGREED it was not necessary
to in s is t it should be on the scuth-w est corner. Such sta irca ses could be
bought "off the peg" and, if not installed in the close season, it was
AGREED that a 5 reduction in capacity would be n ecessary.

(g)      The South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

A s mentioned at the la st meeting, the penning arrangements of the seating
and the numbers of seats in the rows caused problem s. Bearing in mind the
need for reaso caolen ess and to make the situation better, it was AGREED
that, even though not strictly in accordance with the Guide, that the bost
com prom ise was to seek the rem oval of the existing barriers and their
re-alignm ent, toge ther with the widening of the gangways at the position
of the w in gs.

The Fire Service pointed out and it was AGREED that Fire R esisting Doors
would be required leading to the D irectors' seating, and i hour fire
r esista n ce would be required for all problem areas under the stand. This
could be reduced to \ hour if automatic detection equipment were to be
installed.

For their part, the Building Authority reiterated their concern as to the
corrosion of the steelwork of the stand, and also pointed out the concrete
spalling which was occurring. Again, the likelihood of the baiustrading,
b a rriers and guardrails needing to be reinforced or replaced was mentioned.
It was AGREED all would need to be given attention by the Club.

(h)      General Requirements (pages 8 & 9)

A s w ell as the Fire Service pointing out that the presen t temporary
structures u sed for police and first-a id purposes would need removal
from a means of escape point of view if the capacity of the North Stand


                                    3.




                                              0
was not to be reduced, the P o lic e stated that they w ere ready to discuss
with the Club the fa c ilitie s they would re q u ire . B riefly, they envisaged
a permanent structure a lm o s t twice as la rg e as the existing te m p o ra ry
Structure, and expected communications, detention, toilet, parade room,
e t c . , fa c ilitie s .

S f far as F ir s t- A id was co ncern ed, the Sheffield A re a Health Authority
had confirmed th e ir w illingness to provide advice on F irst-A id and
Medical F a cilities, bat the person nominated (Dr. H. Bailey - Specialist
in Community Medicine (Social Services)) was on holiday until
2ftf| A p ril, 1979. Hs had been invited to the meeting, with the Club on
2nd April, but it was recognised that possible practical difficulties might

1.    Scope and Objectives of D iscu ssion s

M r. H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and str esse d that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best in Europe. Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely a s a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Com m ercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and it was hoped to expand this side of the Club's activities. The Club s
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical co n sid e ra tio n s.

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    T hat, whilst Designating Orders did not specify time lim its for the issu e of
General Safety C ertificates, it was essen tial to aim for the Certificate to be issued
by the start of the 1979/80 Season.
                                                   n o


2.    That, a s the Club wanted to attract representative gam es, the aim should
be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.

3.     That a s much work a s p ossible should be carried out In the c lo se season,
bearing In mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
w ill be m ore restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah’s Witness Bally had
a lso to be borne In mind.

2.    D iscu ssion on Standing A reas

A.    Spion Kop

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That the siting and angle of the new b a r r ie rs to be installed be the subject
of detailed discussions between D r. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

2.    That the Club consider the installation of sim ple lateral b a rriers (hot of the
clim b proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
central block (but not so a s to obstruct the gangways).

3.     That, in view of the clearance tim e of I l f minutes compared with the
8 m inutes specified in the Guide, the m eans of escape be discussed in detail
between Dr. Eastwood and the F ire Service (including the re-sitin g of the gates
in the existing barriers and, possibly the widening of the existing gates and/or
an Increase in their number).

4.  That the headroom at the North end under the bridge be increased to the
maximum possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

5.    That representative parts o f the concrete wall and boundary posts and fences
be tested to the appropriate standards.

6.   That the condition of the concrete at the lower end, the height of some of the
crush b a r r ie rs and the scoreboard structure be the subject of detailed discussions
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

7.        That the Club’s longer term proposals for the improvement of the means of
e g r e s s be unanimously welcom ed.

8.    That the maximum capacity of the Spion Kop be determined after the foregoing
points have been resolved.

IT WAS AGREED -

1 .'   THat the Club's proposals for the Installation of additional b a rriers and the
f eduction In capacity to 7,200 sp ectators without the need for additional gangways
should be implemented.

2.    That the question of the c r o s s - f e ll on the steps on the north-w est corner
exit, the height of some of the existing crush barriers, as well as their corrosion
and sharp edges in places, be the subject of detailed discussion between
D r. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

C.    North West Corner T errace

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That the Clubs proposals to bring the crush barriers up to standard and
supplemented by new b a rriers with a consequent capacity of 2,900 spectators should
be Implemented.

2.    That the improvement or replacem ent of the existing corrugated sheeting be
the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

3.    North Stand

IT WAS AGREED -

1.     That, in view of the obvious difference of opinion between the Club and the
Working Party as to the appropriate steps (If any) to be taken over the width of the
existing gangways, both sid es be requested to consider all the points made, and
to re-con sid er the matter at the next m eeting.

2.    That the question of fire protection works to the Store Room and to the Team
Room be the subject of detailed d iscu ssio n s between Dr. Eastwood and the
Fire Service.

3.     That the replacement (from a fire hazard point of view) of the existing Police
and F irst-A id Temporary Structures under the Stand be accepted in principle, and
that the facilities required in the new permanent structures be considered later in
the Agenda.

4.    That the existing Wire Mesh b a r r ie r s under the Stand be the subject of
discussion s between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service.

5.    That the question of the provision of handrails be the subject of discussions
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

4.    West Stand

IT WAS AGREED -

That, w hilst the upper level of the Stand can be emptied in the required time,
consideration be given to reducing the congestion which may occur in the lower
level by examining the possibility of erecting an additional stairway at each
end of the Stand (possibly of the Fire Escape type for emergency u se, rather
than for normal use).

5.    South Stand

IT WAS AGREED -

1.     That Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor d iscu ss in detail the apparent
spalling of the concrete frame at high lev els, apparent corrosion of the main
steelwork columns, rem oval of the timber casing at base level for inspection (2
only as representative sam ple), and load testing of a representative sample of
single and double skin w alls.

2.    That, to overcom e the means of escape problems in the upper part of the
Stand (the covered area), the existing barriers be removed altogether, the Club
to deal with any problems about different admission charges by way of coloured
seats or some such alternative.

3.    That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the methods of upgrading the
fire resistance in the central area, protected escape routes, and the provision of
handrails down the stairways.

4.     That the m eans of escape problems in the front open air part of the stand
be dealt with on the West side by making an additional exit for emergency use only
through the Tea Bar wall to the foot of the existing stairway, and that on the east
side consideration be given to providing an addi tional gangway to exit on to the
d erelict land adjoining the Spion Kop.

5.    That no immediate answer seemed to be available with regard to a possible
limitation on the use of the car park behind the Stand by entitled persons immediately
before a m atch, even though police had control of its use after a match.

6.    Ground Exits

Dr. Eastwood apologised that the 1:500 site plan had, unknown to him, not been
already supplied some time ago. He undertook to ensure that copies were
circulated without delay.

to an em ergency back-up system In the event of failure.

8.    P olice and F ir st Aid F a cilities

IT WAS AGREED -

1.       That the Club accept the principle of permanently contracted Police and
F ir s t Aid F a c ilitie s.

2.     That the P olice would supply the Club Secretary with a copy of their initial

it was essen tia l that any points for discussion between the various representatives
of the Working Party and Dr. Eastwood had to be cleared without delay.

11.   Date of Next Meeting

IT WAS AGREED That the next meeting should be held at 2.30 p .m . on

P a r a . 4 - The exploratory work regarding the im provem ent of the headroom had
s tiii to be c a rr ie d out, but was not expected to be a m ajor item .

P a ra . 5 - B ecause o f the difficulty in devising a suitable method of testing in places
(such as the top of the Kop), it was AGREED that proposals should be formulated
after further d is c u s sio n s between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

P a r a . 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
structure should be looked at. It was AGREED that the question of the hsight of some
of the crush b a r r ie rs be considered again after it was s e e n which of them failed on
testin g.

P a r a . 7 - The Club s tr e s s e d that their proposals for the improvement of the means of
e g r e s s would hopefully be ca rried out in the shorter rather than the longer term future.

P a ra . 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the existin g crush b arriers, together with,
the Installation of the new crush barrier layout and alteration of the gates in the existing
b a r r ie r, could a ll be carried out in the c lo se sea so n . Their aim was to achieve a
1 6 ,8 5 0 crowd capacity.

P a r a . 2 - The Club accepted that in view of the c r o s s -fa ll on the north-west corner
exit, the ste p s should be r e-b u ilt. It was AGREED that the other m atters would be

2C      North West Corner T er r a ce

P a ra . 2 - W hilst accepting the need for the Improvement or replacem ent of the
existing corrugated sheeting, the Club felt they wished to consider whether to carry
out m ore exten sive works s o as to bring the existing unused area into use for an
additional 2 5 0 /3 0 0 s p e c ta to r s.

3.      North Stand

P a r a . 1 - D r. Eastwood, the Building Surveyors and the Fire Service had reached
agreem en t on a s c h e m e which could be recommended to the Club. This would
Involve the rem oval of 10 s e a ts from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats from in
front of each of the 9 upper e x its . The resu lt would mean a lo s s of 126 seats
compared to the 225 in the original proposals. The Club AGREED to give
consideration to the proposal.

P a r a . 2 - The word at the end of the fir s t line should have been 'Tea' and not 'Team '.
It w a s AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service would discuss in detail any
fir e protection works considered to be n e c essa ry .

en casin g In concrete for permanent protection. B ecause of the apparent accumulation
of w aste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
Club a ls o AGREED that the space beneath the tim ber floor should be cleaned out.

P a r a . 2 - Provided the penning b arriers were removed entirely, It was AGREED that
It would not be n e c essa ry to rem ove any seats for esca p e purposes In the upper part
of the stand (the covered area).

P a r a . 3 - It was AGREED that tim ber handrails should be provided down each of the
outer ed ges of the main sta ir ca se ; that the existing Iron centre railing should remain,
and that a new handrail down the centre of each sid e of the stairway should be Installed.
It was a ls o AGREED that the brick sta ir ca se w alls should be buttressed where crowd
su rg e p r e ss u r e could be generated.

P a r a . 4 - So far as the front open air part of the stand was concerned, it was AGREED
that on the w est side a new exit through a new 1.2 m etre wide door adjacent to the existing
sn ack bar should be provided, with appropriate fir e resista n ce m easures in the
surrounding a r ea . On the e a st sid e, consideration was given to an extension of the
footway at the front of the stand aad the removal of the wall, provided the new exit was
isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service
should con sid er p recisely what m ea su res could be considered satisfactory so as to
avoid any lo s s of s e a ts.

6.      Ground Exits

The 1:500 s ite plan was in the p r o c ess of being circulated.

7.      Communications

to r ec e iv e fir s t priority and to wait for the 1980 clo se season for the work to be
carried out. II was understood that Dr. Bailey had not yet com pleted his investigations

        Any other T opics                          '

The evening of the 27th A pril was agreed as mutually convenient              to     t e s t the existing
em ergency lighting equipm ent.

10.     Future Action

M r. McGee s tr e s s e d that it was e sse n tia l for decisions to be taken urgently if the
Club were to com plete their plans, both from a financial and practical point of view.

The Club w ere to make application for financial a ssista n c e under the Football
A ssocia tion 's Ground Im provem ent Scheme, and had to have over 5 0 ,0 0 0 crowd      '
capacity if the aim of attracting international m atches was to be achieved. The la test
proposals, If im plem ented, appeared to give a capacity of som e 5 0 ,7 5 0 .

So that they could be noted and returned for agreem ent, the Working Party asked for
2 copies of all plans (as r e v ise d ) to be supplied by Dr. Eastwood, e sp e c ia lly to the
F ire Service and the Euilding Surveyor.

M r. McGee requested that he be advised if it appeared that any undue delay was
occurring as the Club wished to ensure that the certification procedure proceeded without
delay.                                                                 •

 Lear Sir

 Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground
 Hillsborough, Sheffield

 I refer to recent meetings with regard to the improvements required at the above
 ground and now append a summary of matters, in relation to the Building Authority
 requirements, which require attention and have been discussed at the various
 meetings.

 West Terrace

  1.     The downward slope of the exit steps to be corrected.

  2.     Limitation of numbers as agreed between Police representatives and club.

  Subject, to these two points this area is acceptable.
                                                       \                              _                          ...

 West Stand

 Provision of additional stairways for egress purposes is required.  Subject to
 this provision the slight shortfall on headroom in certain cases can be accepted.

 South Stand

 1.      Removal of divisions between areas of seating is required, and following
         this the general arrangements of egress provisions can be appraised.

 2.     Areas of badly spalled concrete to be repaired.

 3.      Corrosion to steel columns to be investigated and its effects assessed and
         repaired as necessary.

 4«      All balustrades and walling to be subject to test and strengthening as may
         be revealed.

 5.     Additional handrails to be provided to main entrance stairs                                              and to stairs
         from first floor to stand.

 6.     Consider raising height of front wall opposite foot                                     of each gangway.

 7.     Additional egress to be provided through tea bar to                                     foot of main stairs.


                                                                                                            P.T.O.

The officer dealing with this correspondence is             Mr.                           Tel 7 3 . . 4.16 9 . . .     (STD Code 0 7 4 2 )

                                                G. R. Adamson,     Manner.   C. J. Dorrell, Chief Civil Engineer.

        0. J , Rhodes. Chief Quantity Surveyor.      J. N. Ster    tiding Surveyor.       T. N. Blackmore, Group Secretary.
                                              7°\

South Terrace

Provide new means of egress to South-East area as discussed in detail.     •

North Stand

1.   Radial gangways to "be improved to 1.1 m in width for at least half the
     gangway length above each central exit, and remove 4 No. seats immediately
     below each exit to allow for barrier erection. .......................

2.    Replace existing wire mesh barriers by suitable substantial barriers
      complying with guide recommendations.

It is noted that there are no handrails to the stairs from the stand, but in
view of restricted width and length it is not proposed to require these. ..

North-West Terrace

1.   Replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear is required.

2.   The removal of under-strength barriers and their replacement by new       ones
      constructed to guide recommendations.

Spion K o p

1.    The arrangement for crush barriers as produced by the consultant, whilst
      not complying fully with the guide recommendations, is considered adequate
      if the other requirements are fulfilled.  These other requirements include
      the 2 No. radial barriers indicated on Plan 1XA and the provision of an -
      additional 3 m wide egress route to South-East area, and of gated openings
      to give access from the radial gangways to the ground perimeter area.

2.    Make good all broken and spalled concrete terracing.

3.   Increase headroom to North-East egress route to a minimum of 2.1 m.

4.   Check and carry out any necessary work to ensure safety of score-board
      building.

5.    Replace corroded perimeter rails by construction complying with code
      recommendations.

6.    Improve egress conditions at rear by provision of balustrades, rails, etc.
      as indicated on the plan.

General

1.    All crush barriers, balustrade walls, fences and railings to be tested and
      replaced, or strengthened, where necessary.

2.    Provision of handrails and suitable headroom to egress routes to be re­
      assessed after re-routing of gangways etc. has been carried out.

3.    Fire resistance and restriction of flame spread to be improved to all areas
      as discussed; the consultant is to confirm the work proposed to be carried
      out. Arrangements to be made for the clearance of all combustible material
      from under stand areas.
                            <bO

With regard, to future meetings I think it is essential that all matters agreed
be recorded, as we are now approaching finality in many areas and it is necessary
that we have recorded exactly the agreed matters.

I-would also suggest that in view of the approach of certification it would,
perhaps, be advisable to hold future meetings away from the ground, and that
Mr. Vaughan, as the co-ordinator, should chair such meetings.

Yours faithfully




fuilding Surveyor

               Dear Sir

               I refer to your letter, reference number                                                                                                         583i dated 20 April 19791
               concerning the above matter.

               The requirements I wish to see imposed are as follows:-

               1.         The existing crush barriers at the groundbe tested on aload of
                          ^00 lb./ft., the maximum required by the guide to the Act. (This is
                          to be done immediately and, thereafter, 20 per cent of the crush
                          barriers, chosen at random, to be tested each year, ensuring that
                          each crush barrier is tested at least once every five years)

                          movement of the crowd.

               3.         Gatewaysin the existing perimeter fencing berealigned                                                                                                         with    the
                          gangways of the Spion Kop.

               k.         The police have the facility to override the public addresssystem.

               5«         A suitable police room be provided.

               Representatives of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have accepted
               these proposals without demur and, with the exception of item    will be
               carried out during the close season of 1979* The police room will be
               provided during 1980.

              At the request of your Mr.                                                                                                                  |, I am enclosing a copy of

                   Dear Mr.


                                   Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975


                        Since you spoke to me yesterday by telephone, the St. John's
                   Superintendent rang and I have today had a very long discussion
                   with him about the requirements at the Hillsborough Football
                   Ground. I have put my observations into a separate report which
                   I attach for your perusal* Perhaps you would contact me if you
                   require any elucidation of the points and I would esteem it a
                   favour not to get involved in any long meetings with the Club
                   Officials as there are so many demands on my time that I cannot
                   afford to be away from the office for any length of time.


                                                    Yours sincerely,




                                      Specialist in Community Medicine
                                             (Social Services)




                                                                                           DOCUMENT No. <5j.
3.1512
The existing facilities are much "below an acceptable standard and I
would suggest the Club consider providing1a more permanent structure
which is not likely to require up grading for a very long time. The
internal finish particularly of the Treatment area should be of an
impervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered
fairly sterile a n d require no decoration. This can be achieved by
the use of tiles or formica type finish etc....

WATTING AREA

The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor npace to minimise
the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

TRTATMEHT AREA

The Treatment Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
patients at any one time and consideration should be given to the
needs for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that
the three patients may well be lying on couches.

LIGHTING

Good lighting is essential ard at the present time strip lighting
is very much in vogue and would be satisfactory. The provision of
a power point would also appear to be a basic requirement.

WATER

A supply of hot and cold water is essential} the cold water suitable
for drinking. It would also appear reasonable to request provision
of a hand basin and a large Belfast type sink. The Club should
consider whether it would be cheaper in the long run to provide
stainless steel basins which are not subject to chipping.

TOIIET REQUIREMENTS

The Club should provide at least one male and one female toilet, for
the use of the public and should consider whether they should provide
an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

STORAGE

Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and   for two sets
of wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen.   This storage
should be lockable.

EQUIPMENT

T&e following is a minimum list to provide a basic service.

treatment couches with lift up ends* two or three in number depending
on space available and/or number of cubicles, if the accommodation is
cubicledo

Six Stretchers.
Two sets of stretcher wheels

20 Blsnkets.

TEL**?HOirg FA Cl LI TP'S

A telephone facility would appear to be basic in 1979* This can be
achieved by an extension from the main switch,, or sharing with police

CAR PAFX1HS

The Club may also consider what facilities should be extended to the
St. John’s personnel for the parking of staff cars*




Access for ambulances at ths present time appears to be adequate but
           ! overlooked in any redesigning. It is understood that
           ;rack us insufficient in dimension to easily run the
           .round ^he football pitch.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

I have now received the detailed comments of all of the disciplined
represented on the Working Party.

These have been collated into the attached schedule which, together with
plans, confirm formally In writing the matters dlBcussed by the Working
Party with the Club over the series of meetings held so far and which
the County Council feel require attention so as to secure reasonable
safety at the Ground.

They are, of course, Indlvldualzrequirements on specific matters and are
additional^) the general requirements set out in the specimen form of
General Safety Certificate forwarded to the Club with my letter of
8th December, 1978, and discussed at the meeting held on 13th December,
1978,

After the Cluji has had the opportunity of considering the schedule, perhaps
you would let me know which of the requlraments you feel will be able to
be carried out in the close season.

Should you have any queries, Mr.                  |of my staff (ext. 422) would
be happy to discuss thejn with you.

                                      Yours faithfully,

     (a)      Improve the width of the exit from the Southern end of the Kop to a
               minimum of 4.7 metres throughout. This can be done by providing              y
               a gate through the perimeter wall In front of the Hillsborough Suite as    \/ y
               indicated on plan no. 1610/11.
     (b)      Increase the headroom of the north east exit to a minimum height of 2.1

              include the 2 No. radial barriers indicated on Plan 1XA and the provision  /
              of an additional 3m wide egress route to South-East area, and of gated
              openings to give access from the radial gangways to the ground perimeter
              area.

    2.     If the proposed rew iring of the em ergency ligh ting sy stem is adopted
            as d iscu ssed by Mr. Clough and D ivisional O fficer Jones then, with the
            reduced ligh tin g output, it may be n ecessa ry to provide a number of
            illum inated e x it boxes.
N.      Em ergency Procedure

        E m ergency procedure notices should be placed at strategic points throughout
        the ground.

O.      A c c e ss for E m ergency V ehicles

         1.       Adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct
                  a c c e ss can be obtained by em ergency v eh icles to all exterior parts of               *

         2.       Ensure that parked vehicles w ill not obstruct em ergency vehicles on
                  th ese a c c e ss roads.

p.      Public A ddress System

^       The existin g public address system to be upgraded, with the P olice having an
        o v er-rid e facility from th eir P olice Room.

 Q.      P o lice F a c ilitie s

         A suitable permanent P o lice Room (with fa c ilitie s as shown on the sketch plan        ✓
         marked AA ) to be provided in the 1980 c lo se se a so n .

 R.      F ir st Aid F a c ilitie s

         (i)       Structure

                   The existin g fa c ilitie s are considered to be below an acceptable standard
          f       and it is suggested the Club co n sid er providing a more permanent
   f V f ** - n    structure which is not lik ely to require up-grading for a very long tim e.
 L       |C % '    The internal finish, particularly of the T reatm ent area, should be of an
\ \«              im pervious nature so that it can be e a s ily cleaned and rendered fairly
    6             ste r ile and require no decoration. T his can be achieved by the use of
                   tile s or form ica type finish e t c . . . .

         (ii)      Waiting A rea

                   The W aiting A rea could be arranged within corrid or space to m inim ise
                   the c o st, w here sitting c a se s could w ait fo r attention on ch airs.

          (iii)    T reatm ent A rea

                   The Treattnent Area should be su fficien t to accommodate two o r thFee-----
                   patients at any one tim e, and consideration should be given to the needs
                   for privacy within the treatm ent area, bearing In mind that the three
                   patients may w ell be lying on cou ch es.




                                                5.




                                                     4-7
(Iv)     Lighting

         Good lighting Is essential and strip lighting would be satisfactory. The
         provision of a power point would also be a basic requirement.

(v)      Water

         A supply of hot and cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
         for drinking. A hand basin and a large Belfast type sink should also
         be provided. The Club might consider whether it would be cheaper in
         the long run to provide stainless steel basins which are not subject to
         chipping.

(vi)     Toilet Requirements

         The Club should provide at least one male and one female toilet, for
         the use of the public, and should consider whether they should provide
         an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

(vii)    Storage

         Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and for two sets of
         wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen. This storage should
         be lockable.

(vlil)   Equipment

         The following is a minimum list to provide a basic service

         Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
         on space available and/or number of cubicles, if the accommodation is
         cubicled.

         Six Stretchers.
         Two sets of stretcher wheels.
         20 Blankets.
         Six Pillows.
         One Minute-Man Resuscltator.

(ix)     Telephone Facilities

         A telephone facility would appear to be basic in 1979. This could be
         achieved by an extension from the main switch, or by sharing with
         police.




                                    6.



                                         4-8
     (x)       Car Parking

               The Club might a lso con sid er what fa cilities could be extended to the   y /
               St. John's personnel for the parking of staff c a r s .

H.____ E m ergency Lighting

1 &        It was obvious that there was a difference o f opinion as to whatcould be
2         regarded as acceptable as regards the em ergency lighting in the South
           Stand. It was agreed that a trial should be conducted during the hours of
            darkness attended by represeucaUves of the Club and the F ire Scrvice se­
           a s to identify the danger a rea s. Consideration would then be given to
            p ossib ly installing an extra battery and additional wiring to those particular
           a rea s not covez-ed by the em ergency lighting covering other parts o f the
           ground.

L_____F ire Warning System

          The problem s with the public address sy ste m seem ed to be m ainly ones of
          diction and c o r r e c t volume le v e l. It w as agreed that the police would monitor the

    The original intention of the v isit had been to check that the outstanding m atters
    referred to in the Note of the m eeting held on 12th November had been completed
    or w ere In the course of completion p rior to the anticipated issu e of the C ertificate .
    by the County Council this week.

    2.      Minor M atters

    An inspection of the ground showed th a t a number of minor m atters s till required
    attention, but the Club undertook to ensure that these were attended to in the m xt ’
    few days.

B.       South Stand Construction

The Building Authority ex p ressed concern a s to what they saw a s a la ck o f structural
Integrity in the South Stand. In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
p r o g r essiv e deterioration o f the Stand which, It was felt, could only be properly
determ ined by a full structural survey. The report forwarded by M e s s r s . Eastwood
and P artn ers In the la s t week was not considered to be sufficiently com prehensive
to provide the required Information, and the b a sis o f calculation used could not be
agreed a s appropriate. W hilst It was agreed that there had not been a sp ecific
w ritten request fo r such a full structural survey of the South Stand, the Building
Authority fe lt that It had been Inherent in the detailed d iscu ssio n s which had taken
p lace that such a report would be forthcom ing. The Building Authority w ere
concerned at the p o ssib ility that the requirem ents of the Building Regulations and
the Code o f P ra ctice Safety Factors could not be met; In particular the Structural
stability o f the South Stand In conditions o f gale force winds and heavy snowfall
was m entioned.

For the Club, D r. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obviously not be built to the
sam e specification or the sa n s construction standards nowadays, but pointed out
that, fo r Ins tan c e, none o f the buildings In Sheffield built before 1970 could m eet
the la te s t wind p r e ssu r e requirem ents. Even the Building R esearch Station was n
evidently thinking in term s that these requirem ents w ere u n reallstlca lly high. In
his profession al opinion, the Stand was structurally safe and able In practice to m eet
the loadings demanded. In any ca se, the conditions which had been described as
being p ossib ly dangerous would mean In practice that a match could not be played
and consequently no spectators would be p resen t.

E xperience of the corrosion o f Indoors s te e l In the Sheffield area showed this to be
m inim al, and the Stand was regularly te s t loaded by sp ectators. Structures such
as this would show obvious external sig n s, such a s cracks, well before there was
any p o ssib ility o f collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
visual inspection. Even though he did not consider It e sse n tia l, p la tin g o f the
front ste e l columns had been carried out as a com prom ise to try and m eet the
Building Authority's concern. He agreed there might well be a continuing
maintenance problem with the stand, but this was a different m atter to saying there
was a structural problem . R eference was made to the Guide's advice that when
a s s e s s in g whether existing situations provided adequately for the safety o f sp ectators,
the criterion to be used Is that of a reasonable degree of safety. In D r. Eastwood's
view , It would be unreasonable and u n n ecessary to In sist on a full structural survey
of the South Stand or to delay the Issue o f the C ertificate. It was his profession al
opinion (which he was m ost jealous of and would not put In jeopardy) that the South
Stand was structurally safe and that the basis o f the calculations provided was
appropriate. He was prepared to advise the Club to u se the appeal procedure open
to them should this be n e c essa ry .
                                               \o&



IT WAS AGBEED that:

(a)   a s there was no obvious deterioration In the South Stand structure of such
       a nature a s to be o f im m ediate concern, no objection would be raised to the
       continuance o f the derby gam e with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning
       provided that no extrem e weather conditions occurred In the Intervening
       period, and

(b)   a further m eeting should be held as a m atter of urgency between the Building
        Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood to d iscu ss the structural Integrity of the
       South Stand and the appropriateness of the calculations used (Mr.
       to be p resen t at Dr. Eastwood's request).

NOTE A s the d iscu ssion s on the South Stand Construction hinged on structural
     th eories and p ra ctices, the F ire Service and P o lice representatives felt
     there w as little they could contribute and left the m eeting p rio r to its
     term ination.

                            HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM



                       EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURE


The following notes of guidance are prepared and issued to assist all
official stewards and others in a position of responsibility at the
Hillsborough Stadium on the action to be taken and procedures to be followed
in the event of the possibility of evacuation of the stadium during the
playing of a game when spectators sure present. The notes are not intended to
be a comprehensive list of all the action necessary, but are for personal
issue to each steward and for retention by the steward for immediate ref­
erence all the time ho/she is on duty at the stadium.

It is appreciated that the reasons evacuation may become necessary are many
and varied, but the most obvious are fires or information that explosive/
incendiary devices have been placed somewhere within the stadium/ground.
That information may be received or discovered either by members of the staff
at the stadium, or by telephone to the stadium, police,- local or national
newspapers.

IT IS STRESSED THAT WHENEVER SUCH INFORMATION IS RECEIVED THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE DECISION TO EVACUATE ALL OR PART OF THE GROUND RESTS WITH THE SENIOR
MANAGEMENT OF THE CLUB. (The senior police officer on duty will be in a
position to advise as to whether the ’bomb call’ is likely to be genuine or
not) .

Whenever such information becomes known, a message will be relayed to the
police officer on duty in the ,:P. A . Commentary Box" at the ground, who, on
instructions from the senior police officer, and irrespective of whether
the match is in progress or not, will cause the record 1        'fflrfigWrto
be played over the loudspeaker system.                       ?uT Tu b . K.eT7Ic C-bi

The playing of that record will indicate to everyone present at the ground,
other them spectators, that a possible emergency situation exists.

N.B.   As part of the regular pre-match brief of referees and linesmen and
       both teams, this information should be passed to them so that the
       game officials are also aware of the possibility of an interruption in
       play and the significance of the playing of the record.

On hearing that record all club stewards will make their way to their des­
ignated duty points on gangways/gates/exits, etc. Those on exit gates will
open the gates and remain at that point. During this period senior
officials will consider the nature of the emergency alleged and will decide
to evacuate all/psxt of the stadium. Once that decision has been taken, but
not until, the senior police officer on duty will cause a spoken message to
be relayed over the :,P. A. System” which will have the effect of:-

 (1)   Stopping the game and removing players from the field of play?

 (2)   Informing the spectators/officials of the prccise nature of the
       emergency and its location if known, and requesting all or specified
       sections of the public to leave their seats and make their way out of
       the ground by the nearest normal exit route unless specifically directed
        to do otherwise by means of the :!P. A. System”.
                                      I~2- °


IT IS STRESSED THAT NO EVACUATION tJILL TAKE PLACE EXCEPT HI EXTREME
EMERGENCY AND ALTHOUGH THE PREPARATORY WARNING RECORD 'THREE BLIND MICE'
MAY 3E PLAYED, THERE IS EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT INITIAL ENQUIRIES WILL
ESTABLISH THE PERPETRATION OF A HOAX, ETC., AND IN THAT CASE, INSTEAD OF
A SPOKEN MESSAGE TO EVACUATETHE FACT THAT THE EMERGENCY HAS PASSED
WILL BE INDICATED BY THE PLAYING OF THE RECORD - 1W K H L                  A
ON HEARING THIS 'ALL CLEAR* STEWARDS ON EXIT GATES AND GANGWAYS WILL         *   **
REMAIN ON STAND-BY AT THAT POINT FOR FIVE MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING THE GATES
AND RESUMING THEIR NORMAL DUTY POSITIONS.

In the event of any steward/club official discovering a fire or receiving
information that an emergency situation exists within the ground* he will
immediately -

  (i) Notify the Club Secretary by telephone;

 (ii) Inform any police officer.

(iii) He must also, on discovering a fire, activate the fire alarm system
       by means of a *Break Glass' call point.

The activation of the call point will not immediately sound any form of
audible alarm but will indicate by light signal in the police staffed
control point the location of the emergency. The police controller can
then deploy manpower to investigate the cause.

In the event of discovery of fire by a steward, he should take additional
action in accordance with the following points

 (A)    Sound the alam by breaking the nearest break glass call point?

 (B)   Tackle the fire with the appropriate extinguisher if safe    to do so;

 (C)   Close doors within the immediate vicinity of the fire;

 (D)   At no time mention the words ’Fire' or 'Bomb'.   Remember,   if you
        don't panic, neither will the crowd?

 (E)   Upon completion of the evacuation of your section, report to the
        assembly area (which has been specified by the Club) and report to
        the person in overall charge, who will, in turn, report to the Fire
        Service and any other relevant emergency service which may be in
        attendance.

ALL STEWARDS MUST FAMILIARISE THEMSELVES WITH THE LOCATION OF:-

 (a)   Fire Alarm 'Break Glass5 call points;

 (b)   Location of the Fire Fighting Equipment;

 (c)   Knowledge of all escape routes at their sector of the ground.

Dear Mr. England,
                               Certificate of Ground Safety, 1979
                     Test on Crush Barriers,                       Balustrades and Fences
           We have pleasure in presenting a formal report drawing
together the results of all the load tests on crush barriers,
fences etc. which were carried out between June and December
1979.


Crush Barriers
           The first series of tests were made on all the barriers
existing at the time of the application for a safety certificate.
These are shown on the attached prints of drawings Nos. 1610/61 and
62.        The barrier numbers used in the following descriptions of
the tests are as shown on these two drawings.


(a)        A total of 19 barriers failed to carry the specified test
           load of 6 kN/m length when first tested.                                      Seven of these
           failures          (Nos. 40, 41, 42, 57, 58, 62 and 68) were caused
           b y defective retaining clips on the horizontal rails.
           Seven failed because the horizontal rail suffered permanent
           deformation             (Nos. 34, 87, 91, 92, 93, 97 and 98) and five
           failed because of bending of vertical posts (Nos. 4, 18,


                                            Registered In England - No. 1134631

                                                                 Go
                                                                     SHEET   2.

            19, 37 and 38).
                  During the course of the testing careful inspection
           was made of each barrier and it was found that, although
            they passed the test, a number of barriers had~minor
            defects mainly due to corrosion.     A total of 32 new clips,
            eight new rails and five new posts were fitted in addition
            to strengthening of those barriers which failed the test.
            All protruding or sharp edges were removed.
                  One further barrier was modified because it was initially
            significantly lower than the minimum height recommended in the
            green Code of Practice.
                  Following construction of the new additional barriers on
            Spion Kop and the completion of repairs to the old barriers
            a second series of tests was made.     All the new barriers
            and all the repaired barriers now passed the test.


    (b)     Lepplnqs Lane
                   In the first series of tests six barriers   (Nos. 104,
            105, 106, 107, 110 and 123) had failures of the tube
            retaining clips.     Five barriers (Nos. 107, 114, 115, 121 and 130)
            suffered permanent deformation of the horizontal rail.
                  All these barriers were repaired.    In addition 13 new
            clips and five rails which were badly corroded were replaced,
            and any protruding or sharp edges removed.
                  After construction of the new barriers, they and all
            the repaired barriers were tested and all withstood the
            test load satisfactorily.


    (c)     North West Corner
                 The initial testing of the first few barriers in this
            corner showed that all of them were only capable of taking
            about half the test load.     The rails deflected excessively
            and the holding down bolts were also inadequate.
                                                                        SHEET



E A STW O O D £r PARTNERS




                Major strengthening in the form of extra posts to
         shorten the span of the rails and to share the load with
         the existing posts were installed.         A new type of holding
         down arrangement was devised.
                When re-tested all existing barriers plus all the
          new barriers successfully withstood the specified load.


^ ?he Safety Cage
         When the first series of tests were made on the crush
 barriers it was found that the safety cage along both ends of
 the ground had defective supports.           It was found that certain
 holding down bolts had not been fixed when the fence was
  installed.       There was also a need for support from the
 concrete perimeter wall in some places.           After appropriate
 remedial work the fence was successfully test loaded in 4m sections
 along both ends of the ground using the normal crush barrier
 loading of 6 kN/m length.


 Boundary Fences
         Concern had been felt for the boundary fence along the
  idge of the ramp from Spion Kop.          Any failure of this fence
 4S the crowd leaves the ground could result in people being
 spilled down a steep bank.           The whole length of this fence
 from the score board down to the bottom was therefore tested
 using the lateral force specified in the green Code of 2.74 kN/m.
 The whole length carried the load satisfactorily.
         The continuation of this fence round to the north-east
• c o m e r of the pitch, plus the two lines of fence which protect
 the island of spectators to the west of the tunnel were also
 appropriately tested (the lengths marked in red on the attached
 print of drawing 1610/11).           All the sections successfully
 carried the test load without signs of distress.
         It was also found to be possible to test load five sections
 of the boundary fence round the top of Spion Kop as shown by the
 short red lines.           The load applied was again that appropriate to
                                        124 -

  the lateral force on exit routes.      Again the load was
  satisfactorily resisted.


  South Stand     Balustrade
         The final testing was on the south stand       balustrade.
  At the foot of every gangway a length of 2m was subjected
  to the same test load as crush barriers i.e. 6 kN/m length.
  In every case this load was resisted without distress.
         In between the gangways, the    balustrade was subjected
  to a test load of 3 kN/m length applied to the whole span
  between successive pairs of supports.         Again the load was
  everywhere satisfactorily resisted.


  Future Numbering of Crush Barriers
         Many of the barriers have been lengthened and also
  additional barriers have been installed.         It is obviously
  inappropriate to continue with the old numbering system.
  We therefore include prints of two new drawings 1610/63 and 64 which
  show a new numbering system for Spion Kop and the whole of the
  west end of the ground.      It is proposed that these numbers
  will be used in all future reports.


                                      Yours sincerely,

    Dear Sirs,
    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 -
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited
    I thank you for your le tte r dated 15th July.
    After consultations vith the Building Authority and in viev of the fact
    that a ll of the barriers were tested prior to certificatio n , the County
    Council is able to agree this year vith the course of action which you
    propose. However, I would stress that this agreement is conditional
    upon i t being recognised and accepted that i t is without prejudice as
    to what may be required in future years under the provisions of paragraph
    25(2) of the Safety C ertificate.
    May I also mention the C ertificates by:-
    (a)      a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer (as required by
             paragraph 24 of the Safety C ertificate) as to a ll structural
             parts of the Stadium, excluding crush barriers and handrails;
    (b)      an independent E lectrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
             26 of the Safety C ertificate) as to the electrical installation
             within the Stadium; and
    (c)      an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
             12(2) of the Safety C ertificate) as to the condition of the
             Emergency Power Supply.
    I take i t that if the Club has not already done so, they w ill shortly be
    requesting you to supply these.
                                                              Yours faithfully,

                       ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED
                                        BY THE CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


                       On various dates in July I made inspections and had
       approximately one-fifth of the crush barriers tested by members
      of my staff under my control.                                                   A final inspection was made on
       28 August in company with Mr. ]                                                                C .E n g ., M.I.Struct.E.
      of the City of Sheffield Building Surveyor's Department, acting
      on behalf of the licensing authority.
                       In my opinion the various structures on the ground are in a
       satisfactory condition and appropriate for the stadium to be used
£      to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of Ground Safety.
                       The crush barriers Nos.                                       1-39     (see our drawing No. 1610/63)
      were tested in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Guide
       to Safety at Football Grounds on 21-23 July.                                                                  Certain barriers
       suffered excessive deflection, generally on the second or third
       cycle of the test load.                                             In sane other cases retaining clips had
       to be replaced.                             The barriers concerned were Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15,
        17, 18, 24, 26 and 34.                                             After remedial work these barriers were
       successfully re-tested on 11 August.
                        I am now able to certify that all 39 barriers have a satisfactory
       strength.
             Certain items of maintenance work which it is suggested should

The Chairman opened the meeting by. stating its intention of assessing the
planning, action and incidents relating to the FA Cap Semi-Final between
Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhamoton Wanderers held at Hillsborough on
Saturday 11 April 1281.              *        .

Certain problems had occurred but in his and the Chief Constable's opinion
we had acted correctly. Oneletter of complaint had been received from a member
of the public as well as oneletter praising the police action in a dangerous
situation. Chief Superintendent Harold mentioned that other letters
congratulating the police on their actions had also been received.

Mr Goslin said that it was M s decision to remove spectators from the Leppings
Lane end of the ground to the other side in order to ease a dangerous situation
where serious injuries or even fatalities were a real possibility. He then
read the letter of complaint, which contained an allegation that the police
herded more and more people into the Leppings Lane enclosure when it was* obvious
that it was full.                   cr'

The Chairman invited views on this point. Superintendent Chapman said that, the
entrances to Leppings Lane were controlled to ensure an even distribution of
fans. However, as .the gorund filled up the usual packing problems occurred.
There was space in the centre of the enclosure but fans refused to move over
and fill it. Police officers were placed into 'the crowd to•ensure t-’*--1-
best use was made of the available space*- "
                                           ■The' MoanteS Department also'
                                                                       jS
at the-rear of the crowd to prevent more"people entering that part of the
ground..

Chief Superintendent Berold pointed out that the problem was exacerbated by a
series of incidents which culminated in the late arrival-of a large number of
fans. This meant that 'instead of arriving over a period, they all-arrived ^
together very close to kick-off time.   .                 _                   .

At 11.25 aa an accident occurred on the Ml Motorway involving 13 cars, causing
two of the three lanes to be closed'down, for one and a half hours. Just north
of this, and at about the same time, a PSV broke down. Passengers alighted from

                                                                Continued/.

 It and caused problems on the motorway. -The pontoon bridges and extensive
 roadworks on the motorway in the Derbyshire Police Area also created delays.
This 90 minute delay resulted in a sudden flood of vehicles, all of them
•Sours supporters, into Sheffield. Acting Chief Superintendent Thompson took
uo this point and said that he accepted that the traffic routs, designed to
divide, the football supporters from the city centre shoppers, was too tortuous,
although this may not have proved a problem had there been a steady flow of
spectators rather than the sudden influx caused by the incidents described by
Mr Herold.

The Chairman then sought the views of the meeting over the crushing incidents
when several spectators were injured and which necessitated the removal of
some spectators from the Leppiags Lane enclosure.

Mr Herold said that the capacity for the Leppings Lane enclosure, stated in
the certificate issued under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, is 10,100.
This must, of necessity, contain a safety margin. The actual turnstile
reading;was 10,435 to which must be added the 70 Spurs supporters who had
managed to obtain tickets which put them amongst the Wolves supporters. These
had been moved to Leppings Lane from the Kop for their own safety. This made
a total of 405 spectators over the authorised limit. Inspector Calvert pointed
out that this created a similar situation to last year when about 400 forged
tickets were printed for the Leppings Lane end, although the same problem was
■not experienced then.

Mr Herold had already referred to the late arrival of a large number of
spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppings Lane enclosure when
the match started. The flashpoint occurred when Tottenham scored after only
three minutes. The spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was
happening and caused a crush, which resulted in the injuries. Inspector
Greenwood also mentioned that there had been two or three fights, albeit of
a zinor nature, at the same time. This had resulted in the order from Mr Goslin
to open the gates at the front of Leppings Lane in order to release some
spectators onto the pitch surround. This was done by opening the gates,
releasing a few spectators and then closing them to allow a steady flow. This
was difficult to maintain because' as soon as pressure was relieved at the
frcnt the crush from the back- filled the void.

The lack of a reserve serial between the South Stand and the Leppings Lane
stand (where one has normally been situated) caused a few minutes delay in
the 'deployment of officers to police this situation but this problem was soon
overcome. Superintendent Chapman stressed that there was still room in the
centre of the Leppings Lane enclosure although it was quite full. This was
o n l y to be expected when there was a capacity crowd,but the refusal of
spectators to fill spaces had caused difficulties elsewhere in the enclosure.

The discussion progressed to the construction of the Leppings Lane enclosure.
Mr Goslin felt that it was inadequate and required more divisions .so that
spectators are not in such a solid mass. He also felt that the limit of
10,100 was too high, although Superintendent Chapman disagreed with this.
Tht Chairman disagreed with Mr Kerold’s suggestion of a- 6 ft to 8 ft wide
channel down the centre of the enclosure to divide spectators and s e g r e g a t e
opposing fans on the grounds that such a small segregation gap only encouraged
opposing spectators to throw articles at each other and at police officers
in the middle. Inspector Calvert expressed concern about the central


                                                                  Continued/
 entrance to the Leppings Lane area because it always causes delays and
 blockages. It would benefit from reconstruction.

.The Chairman said that talks would take place with Sheffield Wednesday
 Football Club on the ground capacities and for any reconstruction thought to
 be necessary.

 The discussion progressed to the fans who ran onto the pitch during the half
 time interval.

Mr .Herold said that the trouble steamed from the front central cate being
opened from where about 150 young fans were led onto the pitch surround.
These were the ones who eventually ran onto the pitch although at the time
it was necessary for the gate to be opened to relieve crowd pressure. The
match referee,               |.had said that he was unable to start the match
when he wanted to. This was, however, based on a five minute half-time
interval and not on the normal ten minute one. It was unfair to suggest
that the match was held up as a result of the fans on the pitch.

Mr Goslin said that he may have made a wrong decision at half-time to try
and get the fans from the pitch surround onto the Kop. They had not been
causing any trouble where they were, ye- the decision to move them onto the
Kop precipitaced a minor pitch invasion. The half-time interval was, on
reflection, insufficient to carry out the necessary manoeuvre. Some of the
people who were being shepherded into the Kop refused to go in, resulting in
a minor 'break-out' which was quickly controlled. Mr Herold said that it was
apparent, for future reference, that when people have to be moved from the
Kop the area behind the hoardings is an ideal position to put them into. Chief
Inspector Smith also pointed out that 50-100 fans had been successfully removed
from the pitch ana placed into the centre of the Kop. Mr Herold said that
this situation prompted the only criticism of the police by the club in that
we seemed to be helping fans to climb ovsr the railings. Inspector Sykes
replied to this criticism by saying that only the fans who had become stuck
whilst attempting to climb over the railings to avoid the crush had been
helped by police officers so they did not injure themselves. The other fans
were released, in small croups through a police controlled gate.

One problem which was totally unnecessary was that caused by the sale of
unwanted tickets by Wolverhampton Wanderers direct to Tottenham Hotspur. This
is contrary to FA directions and neither the FA, Sheffield Wednesday FC nor
the police were told of this decision. This made a nonsense of the
segregation arrangements and was a contributing factor to the difficulties
which occurred. Discussions were to take place about this situation.

The Chairman then asked for any comments or criticisms which could prove
useful for future occasions. The following points were raised:

Acting Chief Superintendent Thompson

The route for traffic frcm the motorway was too tortuous and the more direct
route, the Parkway, should be considered in the future.- Chief Superintendent
Herold pointed out that this would bring the fans through the city centre
and into .direct conflict with the bus routes for walking spectators.




                                                               Continued/
                                                f3<?




        Mr Thompson also relayed criticisms that officers outside the ground had
        made no attempt to direct traffic at blocked up junctions. This cricitism
        was not accepted because with the size of the crowd some delay must be
        accepted and anticipated.

        Superintendent Chacman

        The absence of a reserve serial between the South Stand and West Stand caused
        a slight delay in the deployment of officers to the disorder situation and
        there should be a reserve stationed there in future.

       There should be female officers available at the turnstiles to assist in any
       necessary searches. There was a narked absence of female officers-at the
       gates.

       The back to back radios are not useful in the situation when there is
       extensive media coverage at the ground. There is a high degree of inter­
       ference.
O      Acting Superintendent Ruddy

       The communications had proved successful with three channels being used
       (1, 2 and 4). The splitting of the ground control and the public order control
       meant that the caravan for public order control need no longer be situated
       inside the ground and could be moved about outside for optimum reception.

       Mr Ruddy also pointed out that the supervisory officers from foreign
       forces had made many complimentary remarks about the planning, organisation
       and operational aspects of this event. He felt that we were being over
       critical of ourselves.

       Inspector Calvert

      Mr Calvert suggested the inclusion of a de-brief chart so that the comments
      of any officers at the ground could be included for discussion.

       Inspector Svkes                      •
Vw/
      Cn this occasion officers from foreign forces had been employed on duties
      insice the ground. Mr .Svkes felt that this should be the duty of the regular
      o f f i c e r s ('F' Division)' who are familiar with the territory.

      Mr Kerold pointed out that the reverse situation had applied last year and
      there were still difficulties. In fact, the local knowledge of the visiting
      officers who were inside had helped to overcome situations, which our own
      policemen may not have been able to deal with easily. There are also
      logistical difficulties with the deployment of foreign officers outside the
      ground.

      S erc rea n t


      Difficulties were experienced because officers from foreign forces had not
      road or understood the correspondence sent to them. Despite having maps and
      being taken on a tour of the ground, some had gone to a different part of


                                                                     Continued/.
                                              '31



    the ground to where they had been deployed. This could have had serious
    consequences whpa assistance was urgently needed.'

    •The local call signs (eg Sierra 5 - Sergeant) should be stressed to visiting
     officers as the lack of this knowledge could lead to confusion.

    There had been too many people inside the control room   a maximum of nine
    persons during the critical stages in a room designed for three, and this
    had shown that the ventilation was inadequate. On this point Superintendent
    Chapman said that the number of senior officers in the control room at this
    time had cauned confusion because on occasions conflicting instructions had
    been given and the control room staff did not know which particular
    instruction zo accept and relay.

^   The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) agreed to consider all the points
    raised for future occasions and thanked all present for their attendance.

    The meeting closed at 7.20 cm.

               Dear Sir,                  _

               SEMI-FINAL - 11TH APRIL 1981

               On the occasion of the above match, there was an incident
               at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, in the standing
               enclosure, which resulted in injuries to spectators
               because of crushing.

               From our enquiries it appears the crushing was caused
               through Tottenham supporters arriving late, due to
               problems on the Motorway, and rushing to their places
               after the game had commenced, thereby causing problems
               to spectators at the front of the terracing who had
               been in the ground a considerable length of time.

               According to our turnstile readings there were 335 in
               excess of the stipulated capacity for that particular
               area; this was the result of Tottenham fans having
               purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival
               at Turnstile *N*, Penistone Road, which was the
               Wolverhampton standing area, were directed by the
               police to the other end of the ground where the
               Tottenham fans were standing.

               I give below details of injuries reported to m e :-
                     30 spectators treated by St. John*s Ambulance
                                  Brigade for minor ailments, etc.

      Mr*           H of ®7 staff and Chief Inspector Ruddy

      cojry of a letter since received from the Sheffield

  In accordance with=?ycur instructions, end due to your fully comltted
  diary this weak, I can report that I net vith tha Club Secretary c£
  Sheffield Wednesday ?■;ir. E2ic England, pricr to the natch with Griraby
  on Tuesday, 25 April 1031. iia diseased our actions at the Semi-final'
  and I inferred his that the Chief Constable would be reporting
  independently cur position to tha Football Associati.cn. In his report
  to tha F.A. .Mr. -England .is going to include that fact.

  I have acquainted hir with all cur efforts to cove tha ‘Spurs fans
  into tha less densely packed central part of the terracing and of tha
  visa of tha public address syster, etc-

  Mr. England new tells aa that despite his earlier belief that the
 •referee,              , .was going to report adversely to the Football
• Association, in fact.he does net now know whether)         will do so or
  net. Certainly, the F.A.officials were present and sav what occurred
  therselves and will, I think, Understand the ccsiticn vhen they receive
  the reports frca tha .Club and the Chief Constable.             ’

 I have inferred Kr. England that our consensus view is that the 10,100
 crowd figure specified in the Safety Certificate is hco high. Under­
 standably, he fefutas this and defands tha position by stating that the
 fcrrer capacity, prior to tha irplenantaticn of tha Safety Of Sports
 Grounds-Act.r at Sillsborcugh in Decanber 1373, was 11.100, and that on a
 nianbarjaf occasions in previous all-ticket Hatches the terracing has
 accccsscdated that nunber. Certainly, at tha 1020 Seri-final, when va
 again had a capacity crowd of 50,174, we also had scse hundreds of
 forged tickets, all for the L«p?ings Lane end, and apart frc= cna very
 jainor crushing of spectators there was no prcblen.

 Mr. England has bean acquainted with our view that the leppings Lane
 terracing should be sectioned 'virtically* front to back to produce
 pens to enable rors accurate crowd control and prevent sideways cove­
 nant and he is. alraady activaly'Coasidaring this. He has also con­
 sidered using turnsziles 1-4 for cna part of the terracing and 5-5
 for anothar part and controlling tha crcvd entering through those turn­
 stiles by tha placing cf safeay barriers in that open area between tha
 Leppings Lana tumsailes and the back of the West Stand/tarracing. '1
 agree with hir that for cost catches that would possibly vcrk but have
 grave reservations as—ts its efficacy for the potentially troublescre
 e z i z a s . Additionally, to irple=ent it he would have to find so=e w a y
 for spectators to enter the 3est Stand without crossing the other
 corridors cf supporzcrs.

The Hinutss recorded-by Sergeant           1 are incorrect vhaa vs state
that that sal* by Kclverhaspton Wandarsrs was Contrary to Football
Association directionsThere were no such directions, but an
agreerent between, tha F.A., the participating clubs and Sheffield
Wednesday, as to the ticxet allocation, was quits clearly eircucvanted.
Hr. England is-recc=-nding to the F.A. that in future they should
give directions to participating clubs that they will cot act in thi3'
way and irost retain, or return, any unsold ticxet3 and not put then cn
open sale as wciv^s.had dons cn this occasion.

No other points of. any great ’importance were discussed but you should
be aware that‘I- have-condeded to Hr. England that vith hindsight ye
accept that our attar?t to cove the ’Spurs fans fr=s the perisetar
tracx to the '-Cop1 during tha lisited period at haJLf tine was,.perhapsf
ill advised. I have told Mr. England that no police officer encouraged
fans to cliab the-fence and, despits his opinion, at1 we dad was to
assist those who did so and becaae stuck or injured in the process.

I have also inforsed Hr. England of the Q i e f Constable’s concern at
the attituda of senior nenbers of the Hillsborough rv.vi ta you and the
Chief Constable and of the±± apparent lack of co-cperaticn and support.

I recc=aend that a report, setting out the Police position in this
case, new be compiled and forwarded under the Chief Constable's
signature for tha information of the Feciba.il Association.

          Copy to Chief Executive
         Dear Sir

         FA CUP SEMI-FINAL                  -   11 APRIL 1981

•to      I would refer to the FA Cup Semi-Final match between Wolverhampton
         Wanderers Football Club' and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, held at
         Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
         Saturday 11 April 1981.

         As you will no doubt be aware many similar Semi-Final matches have been
         held at this ground without previous problems. The stadium is issued with
         a certificate under the provisions of the Safety in Sports Grounds Act 1975.
         This limits the total capacity of the ground to 50,174. The area of the
         Leppings Lane enclosure has a capacity of 10,100.

         Prior to the match itself, difficulties were envisaged because both sets
         of supporters were obliged to use the Ml Motorway. This problem was added
         to when a major road accident occurred on the Ml near to its junction with
         the A38. The problem was exacerbated by a coach breaking down further along
         the motorway, and by extensive road works. This set of circumstances
         caused a large number of spectators, predominantly Tottenham Hotspur fans,
         to be held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes. As you will appreciate
  ■A )   traffic jams built up and resulted in a sudden influx of large numbers of
         football supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the
         start of the match when a fairly steady build up of support throughout the
         afternoon could have been anticipated.

         I now wish to outline an aspect of the problem which could have been avoided
         and which should be anticipated for future similar occasions.

         Cn the day before the Wolverhampton ticket allocation was put on sale to
         the public, Tottenham Hotspur played Coventry City Football Club at Coventry
         in a league match. Many Tottenham Hotspur supporters stayed overnight in
         Coventry and travelled the short distance to Wolverhampton to obtain tickets
         which were at a premium in London. Others also made the journey from London
         to Wolverhampton on the Sunday. This completely defeated the spectator
         policy which is put into effect at these matches and which places the largest
         groups of standing supporters at. opposite ends of the ground. Neither of
         7«*l' '^ T ->VJT~' ■               •••:•*     <-•.......
-the -two. participating Semi-Final clubs saw fit to inform the South
Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club or the Football
Association about this situation and in that event the mixing of supporters
was not—properiy catered for. The result of this was that some 400
Tottenham fans had to be removed from the Spion Kop, in the interests
of general safety and public order, and were accommodated in the Leppings
Lane end of the ground,, which had been designated for use by Spurs
supporters. -

The capacity at the Leppings Lane end is 10,100 and this obviously contains
a safety factor. At a previous match some 400 holders of forged tickets
gained entry into this part of the ground and were absorbed without any
apparent difficulty. However, on this date turnstile readings showed
that 10,435 people were admitted to this part of the ground.

A policy of packing spectators occurs at most football grounds where
large crowds are in attendance so that all the available space is utilised.
On this occasion the Tottenham Hotspur fans, who had arrived early in the
day and taken up advantageous viewing points, refused to move into the
centre of this enclosure,’
                         -thereby creating a jamming effect at the
extremeties of it. The late arrivals caused an immediate problem upon
gaining access to the Leppings Lane area because of rushing forward
immediately upon entering after Tottenham Hotspur had scored a goal soon
after kick off. This resulted in a number of crushing injuries on this
terrace including broken arms, legs and crushed ribs. In all, some 38
fans received treatment either at hospital or from the St John Ambulance
representatives present at the game.

As a result of this the safety gates at the front of the L-eppings Lane
enclosure were opened and spectators at the front were allowed to go
onto the playing area perimeter track to relieve the pressure within the
terrace. Due to the problems being created by crushing, my officers also
refused access to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to
get in. In my view no other course of action could have been adopted in
the interest of public safety.

During the half time interval my officers attempted to move the spectators
who were standing or seated within the tracks around onto the normal
spectator areas. During this manoeuvre some rather foolish youngsters
did run onto the pitch but the situation was quickly brought under control
by officers within the ground.

In conclusion I would add that there were no other incidents either
inside or outside the ground other than those caused by the circumstances
I have described. The circumstances I have outlined have been discussed
at length and will be borne in mind in the planning of future similar
events. Discussions are to take place with my officers and officials
of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding suggestions for obviating
the problems caused within the Leppings Lane terrace on this occasion.

Yours faithfully




Chief\Constable

I accept that we should now be discussing the seal-final operation
have asked Mr Goslin and. Chief Superintendent Eerold to arrange ar.
nee ting with Hr England./ I consider it advisable for the Safety a

Zxiuuil* cdiXiLuee or the South Yorkshire County Council to visit t
Leppings Lane end to discuss the probless encountered at the seni-
vith a view to taking further preventive neasuras. I dc net wish
spectators a>~ain clinbing over the fence and it is therefore irnrcr
that the construction cf harriers and the arrangements of the crcv
die Leopincs Lane end should be looked at critically to ensure tha
~olica and the stewards are able to control and maintain order r.or
effectively within tha terrace. I as in favour of a free zone cr.

Although we aust learn lessons frcn the serai-linal, vs should at t.

                           (South Yorkshire County Council)

1.        Purpose of M e e t i n g

The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981. The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2.        Inspection of Stadium

The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

(a)       South Stand

The p r o g r e s s o f t h e monitoring o f t h e a p p a r e n t d e f l e c t i o n i n t h e s t e e l
t r u s s e s r e f e r r e d to a t t h e meeting on 1 0 t h F e b r u a r y was q u e r i e d b u t , i n
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be given.

It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
be provided.

(b)       West S t a n d

The c r a c k e d b r i c k w o r k at the rear o f the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars supporting the steps at the rear of the
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
had been made good.

As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
(nearest to the South Stand).

Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand.
An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
when these had substance.


                                                   -1
    (c)       North-West Terrace

    The two s m a l l areas wh e r e w a t e r s e e p a g e had c o n t i n u e d   to take p la c e a f t e r
    t r e a t m e n t had now b e e n s a t i s f a c t o r i l y t r e a t e d .

    I t was a l s o n o t e d t h a t t h e t i e b a r s through the upper level concrete
    a r e a to t h e r e a r had been protectively wrapped.

    (d)      North Stand

    The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
    Kop) had been made good.

    (e)      Spion Kop

    The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
    original exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would
    be attended to shortly.

    The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of the
    new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
    Kop original exit steps (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
    to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained.  However, the Club intended to
    extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
    level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
    original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.

    (f)      General

    It was noted:-

    (i)    that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the
    rear of the Butcher's Shop on Penistone Road required attention because of
    corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall between the Spion
    Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

    SUBJECT:     SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY. FOOTBALL GROUND
                 EDUCATION OF CLUB STEWARDS

 -•You are both aware of m y feelings that Club Stewards at Hillsborough often
   do less than they should and are at times not aware of our function and
   operation and our respective roles.

    X, crossed swords with them personally once or twice last season and in an
    effort to set things right for the coming season I have arranged, through
    the Club Chairman and the Secretary - Mr. England - for the stewards to
    attend in the gymnasium at 1 pm on Saturday, 22 August 1981, prior to
    starting their duty, and I should like you to address them.

    They should be told very bluntly that each of them should be aware of the
    location of their respective fire points, emergency exits, the recently
    introduced evacuation procedures, how to react to the broadcasting of the
    nursery rhyme records, etc.etc. They should also have drawn to their
    attention the Ground Rules of the Club, and in particular the recently
    introduced Cand even more recently revised) Rule 15 which, in effect,
    appoints police officers as- agents of the Club and allows us to deny
    admission to the ground on the Club's behalf.

    We' should stress to the stewards that the admission of spectators and the
    •peeking of,those'^spectators at the'big^r^g^es on to the terracing is _
    primarily their "function and not a police one.

 - Such unruly behaviour as the throwing of cushions, etc., also falls within
   their responsibility. -                                  • •

    When I received critical letters from the Club Chairman^ast year after —
    several of the matches, I replied to the effect that much or the criticsm
    he levelled at the police ‘should "more properly have been levelled at his
    own administration and the stewards. ..

   We should cooperate- fully with, them and they with, us, and not pull in                 _
 ■ opposite directions.

    I remember one particular incident (I believe during the Derby County
    game last year) when the steward on the South. Stand Terracing close to our
    new Control Box quite deliberately ignored fans climbing the railings
    between the Leppings Lane Terracing and the South Stand Terracing when I
    and a number of other officers had witnessed it and drawn it to his attention.
    The steward subsequently maintained that the fans in question had occupied
    those seats for the whole of the time, obviously with a view to ’taking the
    easy way out'.

    That is not their function, and indeed it would be m y intention   certain
    circumstances to call upon stewards to give statements of evidence that
    might support a prosecution.  In the past we have never done that but they
    would be good and relatively independent witnesses.

     I a m ^ u r e y o u ^ i i i both understand what I have in mind and get the message
     over to the stewards,           r have already personally told the Club Chairman and
    /the Secretary of my views and they both support them.
                                                               /3M3

for the attention of Mr.

               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.


        We have been instructed by the Club to organise the
installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the
teppings lane end of the ground.

        It is intended that these fences are so positioned
that they divide this section of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own


        By dividing the terrace sore control over supporters
                                                                       Ig
should result.     A visiting teas with only a few followers
will be allocated one section, with the other two sections
retained by the hoae supporters.

        Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers
dictate.            -

               metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
during a game. "Th®~gat« copfC tee              but fastened

are occupied by supporters of the sane teas.      When establishing
the height we have considered that the views to the corner
flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
present by the perimeter fence.       We therefore propose that the
top of the fence should be approximately 1080ms above the
terrace.

     This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
but should eliminate a mass Invasion from one area to the other.
Fences this height appear to work successfully at St. James's
Park, the home of Newcastle United.

     We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
within the Working Party and your comments forwarded to us.

     Also to be included in the same contract are some gates at
various locations around the north stand.      Now the gymnasium is
open to the general public security to other parts of the ground
must be maintained.    It is proposed that gates are provided at
the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Boad end of the
stand.     A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to
prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
Lappings Lane.

     Six copies of our drawing 3563/1 together with two copies
of our drawings 3563/2 and 3 (for reference only) are enclosed.

Dear
                     Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
       As previously intimated to you we carried out tests
ad approximately one fifth of the crush barriers in July and
also made a preliminary inspection in company with Mr.             ~
       One or two of the crush barriers showed signs of distress
under the test load and along a length of the boundary fence of
the Kop at the North East c o m e r it was discovered that certain
of the stays were rusted through.      Remedial work has new been
carried out and the defeatlve crush barriers have been successfully
subjected to the test load.      We shall be inviting Mr.
to Inspect the remedial work In the next few days following
which I will issue a certificate on the lines of that which Z
sent to you last year.


                                        Yours sincerely.

                 Members of the Fire Service and Buildings Department were in
                 attendance and the only reservations expressed were by the Fire
                 Service, who indicated that the security gates - which will be
                 open during football matches - should not in any way restrict the
                 egress routes, which they feel are of minimus width as it is.

                 The Buildings representative indicated he would seek further
                 information regarding the construction materials to be used but
                 this would pose no prcblem.

                Note of a Meeting of the Officer Working Party
                (Sheffield District),'held at the Division Street
                Fire Station, Sheffield, on 11th September 1981

                              (South Yorkshire County Council)

1.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 2nd September
and plans submitted by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners on behalf of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. relating to the proposed erection
of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and
Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand now that the
gymnasium was open to the general public..

2.    Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
gates, but the poli ce considered that they could cope with any problems
of this nature.

The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
Terrace.

It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head­
room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the
radial barriers and gates be installed.

WS WAS AGREED that Mr.           should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the proposals to instal
        —  i-- -i- — -*-•-1 t ___ — •-t- t -»= — -— wide gates at the rear,
on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to

       (i)■      the further calculations required by the Building
                  Authority being satisfactory;

       (ii)      confirmation that adequate headroom will be
                  available at the rear of the Terrace, and

       (iii)     the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being
                     ;r police control.




                                                                 DOCUMENT Ho. J o H

3.    Security Gates around North Stand

Now that the gymnasium was open to .the general public, the Club wished to
erect security gates at the top of -the ramps  at both ends of the North
Stand, with additional gates at ground floor   level at the Penistone Road
end of the Stand. A separate gate would also be placed behind the West
Ramp to prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
Leppingp Lane.

These gates would .be fastened when the gymnasium only was in use so as to
provide security for the rest of the ground. However, on match days they
would be secured in the fully open position to allow unrestricted access.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. |
                       ________[should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the erection of security
gates around the North Stand, subject tcf the gates and/or their supports,
hinges, etc not impinging on the existing critical ramp widths, and to the
gates being secured in the fully open position on match days.

4.    Police and First Aid Facilities

It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first aid
facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim basis.
The Club had undertaken to provide purpose built facilities in a similar
position to the existing timbered facilities during the 1980 close
season. Whilst some progress had been made in discussing details of the
facilities, no firm indication had yet been given as to when they would
actually be provided^

IT WAS AGREED that/Mrl.        ~     [should press the Club and/or its
Consultants   for ia fi\jrm indication/ as to when the new police and first
aid facilities are! to- E^e provided./

5.    Lottery Ticket Boxes

Attention was drawn to the b\ocked egress which could result if the
timber lottery ticket boxes pi>esently sited close to the ramps were, to
be tipped over or ignited, eitl^r accidentally or deliberately.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr,         should draw the Club's attention to the
desirability of re-siting the lott^-jry ticket boxes.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Weriaesday Football Club

Referring to your letter of 9th September, the Officer Working Party
(Sheffield District) has considered the proposals referred to in your
latter of 2nd September and accompanying plans.

1.    Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst welcoming the increased control on the Terrace which should
result, concern was expressed as to the problems which could occur with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or at the entry/
exit gates. However, it was felt that only experience would show
whether this would prove to be a reality and, if realised, whether the
problem was of such a small scale that it could be easily coped with by
the police.

Accordingly, the Officer Working Party at this stage sees no objection
to the proposals to instal two 1680 mm high radial barriers, with 1.15
metre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject to:-

(a)   the further calculations required by the Building Authority being
      satisfactory (Mr.         to contact you direct);

(h)   confirmation that adequate headroom will be available at the rear
      of the lerrace after installation of the barriers and gates, and

(c)   the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being under police
       control.

2.    Security Gates around North Stand

The Officer Working Party fully recognises the Club's need to provide
security for the remainder of the stadium when only the gymnasium is in
use.

Provided that the gates and/or their supports, hinges, etc. do not
impinge on the existing critical ramp widths and the gates are secured
in the fully open position on match days, the Officer Working Party
sees no objection to the erection of security gates around the North Stand.

3.     Other Matters

Tvo other matters were also raised by the Officer Working Party relating ~ ?-
to the Police and. First Aid Facilities and the siting of certain of the
Lottery Ticket Boxes.                                        '       .....
                • *rr *                                        —      .............
(a)    Police and First Aid Facilities

       It vas recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first
       aid facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim
       basis on the understadding that the Club would provide purpose built
       replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

       It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are
       still continuing, but it is felt that the Club should be asked to give
       a firm indication when the new police and first aid facilities are to;
       be provided.
 (b)   Lottery Ticket Boxes

       Concern was expressed as to the blocked egress which could result if
       the timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramp*
       were to be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately*

       The Officer Working Party felt that the Club should be requested to
       re-site the boxes in a less critical position.

I attach an additional copy of this letter for your use.

                                         Touts faithfully,




                                         Chief Executive.

       14 September from which you will see that the proposal to
       instal the radial barriers on the West terrace and to

        ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED
                               BY THE CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


          On 23 September 1981, I made an inspection of the ground,
 after having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
 and sections of the perimeter fence on Spion Kop tested by members
 of my staff under my control.
          In my opinion the various structures on the ground
 are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate for the stadium
 to be used to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of
 Ground Safety.
          In July, crush barriers numbers.40,41,42,47,48,49,50,
 55,56,57,58,59,60,61,68,69,70,71,85,90,114,115,116 and 118 (see
 our drawing 1610/63) were tested in accordance with the procedure
 laid down in the Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.                                                                Certain
 barriers deflected excessively and would not sustain the test load*
 In one instance a clip retaining the horizontal tube had to be replaced.
          Remedial work was carried out on barriers 41 (one post)
 and 115 (one post and one clip).                                              At the same time two corroded fence
 posts and four corroded fence post stays were replaced.
          After remedial work the sections of barriers which failed
 were successfully retested on 9 September.                                                      I am now able to certify
 that all 24 barriers have a satisfactory strength.
          The step at the top of the original stair flight at the
 back of Spion Kop has been filled in to give a safe landing.



                                                           Registered in England — No. 1134531

               A permanent barrier has been installed adjacent
           to the servery at the bottom of the new stair flight
           leading from Spion Kop and a new concrete landing added
           in the same area.
              Certain items of maintenance work which it is
           suggested should be carried out at an appropriate time
           have been recommended to the club.   A list is attached.

                    The work on the radial fences and security gates
       indicated on our drawings 3563/1-3 which we sent to you on

m      2 September 1981, is now substantially complete.
                    Three first team home games have been played since the
       fences were erected.                              We have not heard any formal comments
       from the Working Party about the operation of the fences and
       their access gates but we understand that representatives of the
       South Yorkshire Police have inspected the work and they are
       satisfied with the new arrangements.
                    To increase security it is proposed that pairs of gates
       are installed at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of
       the West Stand.                      Two copies of our drawing 3563/4 are enclosed
       showing details of the gates.

 Dear Sir

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975
 SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOT3ALL CLUB LTD

I refer to ycur letter of 23 December 1981 and to the letter from Messrs.
Eastwood & Partners - the Club's consulting engineers - relating to their
proposals to erect a pair of security gates at the base of the two staircases
at the rear of the West Stand at ths ground. From a policing point of view I
see no problem whatever concerning the erection of these gates, subject of
course to then being secured in a fully open position during the time the
public parts of the ground are occupied when matches are being played.

Dealing now with the radial fences which have recently been installed on the
Leppings Lane terracing, I can confirm that the fences are working particularly
well and proving to be most satisfactory in effecting the segregation of
opposing groups of fans. Since the fences were put up there has been no
fixture at the ground of sufficient interest to result in that; entire section
of terracing being given to one group of fans and so 1 am unable to coanent in
that respect, but I see no problems whatever.

 However, there are one or too points concerning the actual construction of the
 fencing which give cause for concern from a police point of view, in seme
 places the existing barrier rails .harve been extended up to and completely
 through the new radial fences at a height of 4'6" or so from the ground,
..making it very easy for fans to climb from one pen to another. In other
 places the existing barrier rails have been cut off short of the radial
 fencas, leaving what the police consider to be dangerous pieces protruding
 into some of the gangways. This matter has been drawn to the attention of the
Club Secretary, who has been advised of my intention to bring it to your
notice. I would point out that Hr. England totally agrees with police
observations regarding the construction of the radial fences but I understand
from him that it is being suggested that any alterations could conceivably
result In a reduction in the capacity of the Leppings Lane terracing. Z am
not aware of the thinking behind that but for my part see no reason why that
should be.

                                 \ In reply to your letter dated 14th December, 1981, I understand that
                                 ^ the Building Authority has contacted your office direct for clarification
                                   on a small number of points regarding the proposed installation of pairs
                                   of gates at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of the Vest
                                   Stand. Subject to the satisfactory resolution of these points and, of
                                   course, to the gates being secured in the fully open position during the
                                   time the public parts of the stadium are occupied when matches are
                                   being played, the Officer Working Party has no objection to the proposals.

                                   As regards the radial fences installed on the West Terrace and the
                                   security gates around the North Stand, the Officer Working Party vishes
                                   to make the following comments

                                    (a)          Radial Barriers on West Terrace

                                   The matches played at the stadium since the installation of the barriers
                                   confirm that they appear to be working well and satisfactorily effect the
                                   segregation of opposing groups of fans.


                                   The Police inform me that, on installation of the new radial barriers,
ic^^l tlMV (AwJli..''
                                   the existing crush barriers have been extended in some places up to and

                                   from the ground. The effect is to make it very easy for fans to climb
                                   from one pen to another. In other places Che existing crush barrier
                 tud ^      Xt     rails have been cut off short of the radial barriers in a manner which

                                   leaves dangerous pieces protruding into some of the gangways.

                                   You will recall that my           letter of 14th September, 1981 stated that,
                                   provided that the gates           and/or their supports, hinges, etc., do not
                                   impinge on the existing           critical ramp widths, the Officer Working Party
<^VwwbJl “>o

For the attention of Mr.


Dear Mr,
                    Safety of Sports Ground Act
           Thank you for your letter of 20 January.
           X believe the small number of points needing
clarification have already been discussed between
                and Mr.        .   One of these refer to the
need for a goal post type frame over the gates but this is
In fact already provided by the sheeting frrfae.      There is
also a small amount of rust staining arising from misplacement
of reinforcement In the l O O n thick retaining vail.       There
Is no immediate danger arising from this and an appropriate
maintenance repair will be carried out.
           Turning now to the radial barriers on the West
terrace it is of course accepted that where there is a
crush barrier passing t r o u g h or close to the radial barrier
it will make It easiftr.-■for anyone who. so wishes to climb ;
over.      Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable to
leave the crush barriers as they are.      Zf all barriers
were removed back to a distance say 1.2m from the fence it
would mean a 2.4m wide gap which is not protected by barriers.
                                     17o




There would be a consequent loss of calculated spectator
capacity which is undesirable from the Club's ptlnt of
view.     However from the point of view of safety a strip
of that width without a single crush barrier would be a
major hazard.
          Zt should be kept in mind that the introduction
 of these radial barriers has effected a very great
 improvement frota the point of view of segregation of
 spectators but to achieve perfection froa the point of
 view of segregation brings with it other disadvantages.
 Z believe that what we have done is a reasonable compromise
 between the various interests.
          Xn the second paragraph on this subject you
 refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding from the
 crush barriers.     Z have not had an opportunity to check
 this since receiving your letter but Z am informed that
 the word 'dangerous* is a little exaggerated and they
 do not of course protrude into a gangway as there is no
 gangway at this position.
          With regard to the security gates around the North
 stand the point at issue is whether the encroachment into
the gate width is at all critical.          The remaining clear
width is 3.300mm which is equivalent to a six unit exit.
Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in
eight minutes using the green book figure of 60 people
per minute per exit width is 5,760 shared between the two
routes.     The stand capacity is of course 10,000 and in
practice more' than-half- the 'number -tend to u s e t h e lower *.•**
exits since, most.spectatorsara.reluctant t o w a l k uphill..
to the upper set of exit stairways.          The picture is that
fewer than 5,000 people will be trying to get out of
-exits which can aeeommodafee 5r760-in-eight-minutes-.               -
        Cher* vert very good structural reasons for placing
the gates in this way.   Tha theoretical exi* capacity has
not been changed since it was always a six unit gateway.
There is no funnelling effect# and there Is a good
'reservoir* area upstream of the gates.
        I telephoned your office yesterday but gather
you were on leave and have again telephoned this morning
with a view to agreeing a tentative date for the winter .
meeting of the working party.       Z will try again in the
next day or so.
                                              .   * *• »'     *•

1.     Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the neeting was to discuss^jhe apparent difference of opinion
on~certain"’aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
aad— the-securi ty' gates-at" the top ox ..the North stand raap.s,. as well as to
carry out the usual winter inspection of the Stadium.

2.     Ground Inspection

A.     West Terrace

Whilst the whole --Terrace-had—yet to be used, the matches played since the
erection of .the..radial barriers indicated that generally they''worked veil and
satisfactorily effected the segregation of opposing groups-of' fans.

However, the p olice pointed out that in places the existing crush barriers
had been extended up ..to. and,,,in..,soae~..ca.sesr,.-^completely' through~th e-new
radial barriers, which had the effe.c.t_.,of ..making ...it relatively easy for anyone
who”wished *co do so to clinb from one pen to another.               Also, in the pen
nearest to the South Stand, a small length of existing crush barrier had been
1e f t 'imVup.po r"t¥3".    ..       '""             ' -• -••

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
prevent crowd surge -by “the-"existing barriers being extended up to and/or
through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
able to clirzb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of the
current season,

(ii) That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
be cut off,                         '            ’




                                      m   '
B.    West Stand"

One of the-security gates .which the Club wished to instal at. the bottom of
the two staircases had now been erected.      ..........

IT WAS AGREED     that this could be regarded as satisfactory.

C.    North Stand

The Fire Service felt that the “manner in which the security gates had been
installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available

The Club's Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
applied in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the
of the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or not

IT WAS AGREED   that, as the point might well have been covered in the
initial consideration of the Club's application for a General Safety
Certificate,  the point would not be pursued at the moment.

      NOTE -     A search of the file subsequently revealed that,   as
                suspected, the point had been considered at a
                meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.2.79,
                the relevant part of the Note of the meeting reading:-

                  "the construction and width of the ramps being
                   such that they could quite properly be
                   regarded as elevated roadways".
                                  >... *r ’

D.     Spion Kop

It was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on
theleft of the original exit at    the top of the Kop had taker, place; that
the   boundary fence at the top of the Kop had been reinforced, and that    the
existing barriers had been permanently extended and the area at the foot
of the new Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)
levelled off as agreed.

E.     South Stand

The agreement to visually inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection
after exceptional gale or snow loading conditions was recalled.

F„    Items of General Maintenance

IT WAS AGREED     that the following items of general maintenance required
attention:-

(i)   The rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
the exit at the southerlyend of theWest Stand (tobe done     that day), as
well   as the rounding offof thebrackets to  the North Stand securitygates.

(ii) The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
Gate "0".

                refreshment point and the Owls Club to be fixed more securely.

                (v)      The brick wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop (nearest
                to the South Stand) to be. pointed.

                (vi) The concrete supporting strut to the wall between the Spion Kop and
                the South Stand (nearest po the Spion Kop) to be protected (cracks and
                exposed b a r ) .

                G.       Temporary Structures

                Concern was expressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability
                of temporary structures, such as scaffolding used in connection with
                television transmissions,.
 J;
                Paragraph 20 of the Club's General Safety Certificate required T.V. cameras
                and portable equipment to be placed only in such positions as may be agreed
                between the Police and the Club.  The Club also were generally required to
                ensure that the Stadium complied with good engineering and building practices
                and with the relevant British Standard Specification or Code of Practice.

                IT WAS AGREED that the question of temporary structures should be kept
                under review, and that the Club's Consultants should give advice to the
                 Club.

                 3.      Future Developments                       - '

                 A.      Police and First Aid Facilities

                'It was likely that, following continuing consultations with the Police, the
                 Club would shortly be in a position to formally notify the County Council
                 that the new Police and First Aid Facilities would be provided in the
                 forthcoming close season.

                 B.      Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate inPenistone Read

                 The Club hoped to formally notify the County Council shortly of their^
                 intention to proceed in the forthcoming close seasonwith the demolition or
                 some of the existing toilets on the Penistone Road side of the Stadium in
                 order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate on that side of the
                 Stadium.

                 C.      Widening of Walkway and Erection     of New Fence

                 Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the
                 rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Owls Club) had had to be removed.
                 When settlement was complete, it was intended to widen the existing
                 walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.

For the attention of Mr, E. England


Dear Eric,
                Annual Certificate of Ground Safety
     We have completed the testing of the remainder of the
barriers at the Spion Kop end of the ground excepting
those bariites which because of their position cannot be
subjected to the test load.      Z am pleased to say that all
the barriers withstood the load but unfortunately in a number
of cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed
considerably.      It is inevitable thatwwater gets under
these clips and they rust thus becoming weaker with the
passage of time.      In one or two esses the clip actually
snapped as the final load was taken off.      A total of 25 new
clips are needed on Spion Kop including a few on the barriers
at the top which have not actually been tested.      John also
Inspected the Lappings Lane end and 10 clips are sufficiently
corroded to make it wise to change then rather than wait until
they are tested during the next^twg ^years^Jffe are using
a heavier gauge metal for the .re IngairocBwr^ clips so that the , .
future life expectancy will be increased.         ...
     The metal in the tube beneath the clips is also subject
to corrosion and 11 lengths each about '8ft. long on Spion Kop
are clearly nearing the end of their life.      He have to bear
in mind that the corrosion which can be seen on the outside may



                                                                         /
be matched by corrosion inside the tube which cannot
of course be painted.     Whilst all 11 lengths successfully
carried the test load you may think it prudent that they
should be replaced now because they could become dangerous
within five years.
     If all this work is carried out (new clips on both
Spion Kop and Lappings Lane plus 11 new lengths of barrier
top rail on Spion Kop) the likely cost is between £1250
and £1500 exclusive of professional fees*      Z should be
pleased to have your view as ttowhether we should carry out
the whole of this work or merely replace the clips on
Splon Kop which deformed under test in which case the cost
of the work would be approximately halved.
          has already walked round the ground and he tells
me that some splitting and spelling of the concrete columns
is developing at ground floor level at the back of the
South stand.   Z*shall be making my inspection in company
with the Building Surveyors department representative during
this month and it is likely he will raise the matter.        In
any case it is important that splitting of this kind be dealt
with reasonably quickly so as to retard the* rate at which the
reinforcement corrodes.     Z will discuss this matter with you
when Z have seen the damage myself.


                                      Yours sincerely.

ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED BY THE
                               CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


                  On 16 August 1982, I made an inspection of the ground,
after having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
on Spion Kop tested by members of my staff under my control.
                  At the end of June, crush barriers numbers 43, 44, 45,
46, 51, 52, 53, 54,                            62, 63, 63A, 65, 66, 72,                      73, 74, 75, 76, 78,
79, 80, 86, 87, 88,                            89, 91, 92, 94, 95, 97,                      98, 99, 100, 101, 103,
104, 105, 107, 108,                            109 and 110 were tested                      in accordance with the
procedures laid down in                                   the Guide to Safety               at Football Grounds.
All the barriers sustained the test load although in some instances
the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed.                                                    These clips have
been replaced.                  At the same time, other clips and horizontal rails
showing signs of advanced corrosion were replaced.
                  I am now able to certify that all 41 barriers have a
satisfactory strength.
                 Two radial fences have been installed on the Leppings
Lane terrace to segregate spectators.
                 Gates have been installed at various locations around
the ground to prevent intruders entering the stands.
                 Repairs have been carried out to six stanchions
supporting sheeting along the boundary wall near gate 'O' on
Penistone Road.                                                                                        ______

Dear Ur.
       Sheffield Wednesday football Clab L t d .,
                  Barrier Testing 1983
       Over June 2 0 - 2 4 ,    crush barriers 121, 122, 123, 124,
124A, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134,
135,136 (part),      137,      138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143,   144 (part),
145,     (part), 146 (part), 147, 148, 149 (part),      150,   151, 152,
153 and 154 (part) at the Lepping Lane end were tested in
accordance with the procedure laid down in the Guide to Safety
at Football Grounds.        The layout of the barriers is shown on
the enclosed print of       our drawing 1610/64B.
       Spans 3 and 4 of barrier 136 could not be loaded because
of the recently installed radial fence.           Soae spans of
barriers 144, 145, 146, 149 and 154 could not be tested because
being towards the back of the terrace the absence of a suitable
reaction point or obstruction prevented jacking.
       In all but one case the barriers sustained the test load
although in two cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube
deforaed.     These^were on barrier 136 between spaas 6 - 7          and
8-9.      New clips have been fitted.        On barrier 129 the tube
has been voided onto the clip to give a aore positive
fixing,   but neverthelesa the test load vaa restated.
       The only failure vaa the centre support of barrier
141.    The angle leg, vhich vaa corroded round the top
rivets,   parted during the first load application.   The
angle has been plated and new bolts inserted to coaplete
the connection.    Thie is shown on our enclosed sketch,
4644/2.
       Also enclosed are single copies of our record sheets
shoving the results of the barrier tests.

        Annual Inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium as required
                                 by the Certificate of Ground Safety


              On 25 July, 1983 I made an inspection of the ground after
  having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
  tested by members of my staff under my control.

              At the end of June, crush barriers numbers 121, 122, 123,
  124A, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135,
  136         (part), 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144                                                  (part), 145
   (part), 146               (part), 147, 148, 149                              (part), 150, 151, 152, 153
  and 154            (part), all at the Leppings Lane end of the ground
  were tested in accordance with the procedures laid down in the
  Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.

              In all but one case the barriers sustained the test load
  although in two cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube
  deformed.               These clips were on barrier 136 between spans 6-7
  and 8-9.              New clips have been fitted.

              The only failure was the centre support of barrier 141
  where the angle leg parted where it was badly corroded.                                                              The
  angle has been plated and new bolts inserted.

              I am now able to certify that all the barriers tested
  have a satisfactory strength.

Kop and protection of the North side gable stanchion in the
West stand have been completed as part of the maintenance
programme.

     Certain other items of maintenance work which it is
suggested should be carried out in the near future have been
recommended to the Club.     A list is attached.

     New toilets and turnstiles have recently been constructed
behind Spion Kop.      During these operations the ramp down the
back of Spion Kop was disturbed by movement of the embankment.
In particular the hand rail and concrete wall guarding the
edge of the gangway moved sideways.      The hand rail and wall
have now been tested in accordance with the requirements of
the Code of Practice and in all but one case, where there was
excessive deflection of a hand rail post, successfully
resisted the test load.

     Following these inspections and tests, I certify that in
my opinion the various structures on the ground are in a
satisfactory condition and are appropriate for the stadium to
be used to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of
Ground Safety.

      Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
StadiunTin accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football   i              i    W
League Grounds in.South Yorkshire.

2.    Ground Inspection

A.     South Stand

The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
had been completed since the "summer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
the rear of the Stand would continue to be'monitored and receive attention
by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

(ii) That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit sign in the Match
Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

(iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
should be infilled with mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly
with the appropriate Regulations.

 (iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
 of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

B.    '/West Stand and Terrace

The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
temporary barriers.  This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
was the policy of the Police to aim for'exclusive use by'visiting supporters
of the West Stand and Terrace. On those occasions when the number of
visiting supporters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
obviously desirable to allow hone supporters access to a sheltered area.
   r WAS AGREED -

 (i)    That the Club would consider at some future date a scheme for
 ptjrmanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
 bfing submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party in the
 usual way.

 (ii) That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column

SOUTH YORKSHIRE METROPOLITAN
    AMBULANCE SERVICE

  MAJOR INCIDENT PLAN-
          SOOTH YORKSHIRE METROPOLITAN AMBULANCE SERVICE

                     MAJOR INCIDENT PLAN


Introduction

A major incident is a situation that we can never predict, it can occur
at any place at any time. The object of this plan is to enable us to
deal with any incident in an organised professional way, by each and
every mentoer sticking to their own job and knowing exactly what their
role is.

The Ambulance Service has more problems regarding manning levels than
the other two Emergency Services especially at night, the weekends and
Bank Holidays. This problem alone makes the construction of a plan
such as this a major task due to the difficulties that can occur in
contacting off duty personnel. The plan has been designed to be simple,
easy to read and each duty itemised so individuals can concentrate on
the areas that concern than and all unnecessary information left out.

Attention must be drawn to the following factors

The colour of Safety Helmets will denote the duties and rank of the
wearer i.e.

1.   Antoulance Personnel transport         =   Waite
     Leading Ambulance Person               =   White with Black Band
     Emergency Support Team (Foot Squads)   =   Yellow
     Ambulance Officers                     =   Blue

2.   All personnel must ensure that their H. V. jacket and suitable
     footwear are taken to the scene of any major incident with other
     items of personal safety equipment.

It is most important that the Incident Officer remains in or close to
the Ccrnnunications Vehicle, this being the centre for directing and
monitoring the whole operation. He must also ensure that a V.H.F. R/T
Handset (which will be marked) is given to the first available crew
that depart for the designated hospital so it can be handed over to the
Liaison Officer who will be on duty.

Antoulance crews must remain with their vehicles at all times, their
role at a major incident is transportation and Ambulance Nursing whilst
mobile, all rescue and treatment duties will be performed by the
Emergency support team which are Arcbulance Personnel without antoulances.

Delegated officers will be issued with a U.H.F. R/T Handset to enable
cccnnunications to be made via the mobile Control.

The support and caimunication vehicle will be based at Headquarters, this
vehicle will contain all the necessary equipment and drivers will be
allocated by Control.

To enable the plan to run efficiently, it is essential that all personnel
concentrate on the objectives and check list of their individual role.

       Dear Mr Chester

       SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS TO LEPPINGS LANE END OF THE GROUND

       With reference to our conversation of last week regarding improvements
       required to the West End of the ground, I forward herewith our thoughts.

       You will see that we favour the erection of a stone wall on the ground side
       of the current terraces, with such wall housing a bank of turnstiles. Our
       belief is that once a spectator goes through the turnstiles he should then
       be segregated from the other fans, and this can be achieved by the erection
       of permanent high metal railings on that concrete area at present behind
       the Stand.  Similarly, there should be a high metal railing down the centre
       of the West Stand. What is then created is total segregation of all three
       portions of the Terrace and the two areas of the West Stand, with each of
       these segregated areas having its own refreshment and toilet facilities.

        If you have any query on these recommendations, no doubt you will come back
        to me.

mm     Yours sincerely




        Chief Superintenden

  For the attention of Mr

   Dear Mr
                          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
             Segregation of Visiting Spectators at Leppings Lane End

                 The club is anxious to segregate the visiting tea m’s supporters
    as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control
    their exit at the end of a game.
        We have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
    drawing 6705/2. This involves the construction of two new banks of
    turnstiles            (Nos 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various runs of fencing
    and new gates.
        It would be appreciated if the Working Party could consider this
    proposal at an early date. Mr Chester has already given a copy of
     the drawing to the police so that they have had some advance notice.




                                                                      Yours sincerely,

              Note of a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield
              District) held at the Police Sports & Social Club, Ni_agara
                            Sheffield, on 18th April 1985

                      (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
and plan from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of
turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates in order to achieve
segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
Hillsborough Stadium.

2.    Consideration of Proposals

The Police representatives pointed out that the proposals had been
prompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At one
time, both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element of use by
home supporters as well „

The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
Police representatives, subject to;-

(a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 18
      and the wall of the inner access road;

            central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral area or
      visiting supporters’ terrace) being divided in half by a new
      central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the
      pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
      t®.fee'diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed new
      secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
      o n 'tRe"':
                'plan to be abandoned);

       the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters’
       terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial^ fence
       running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
       fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral area
            supporters - to have a second gate installed;

       the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
       installed - one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters



                                         1.
                                         | ”2 —



The County Fire Service saw no objection in principle to the proposals,
Subject to more detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects,
and the Building Authority similarly saw no objection, subject to
submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of
Shorts Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

3.      Action

IT WAS AGREED

(a) That              should investigate a s a matter of urgency the means
of escape aspects of the proposals and let                know the
 * f-




(b)  That, subject to satisfactory clearance of these aspects by the
County Fire Service, the outline proposals submitted by Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners be agreed as now amenlded by the suggestions of the South
Yorkshire Police, also subject, pf course, to the submission of the
necessary detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

  Dear Dick,
                                              Turnstiles at Leppings Lane
                 After speaking to                                    jlast Wednesday about the number of
  turnstiles required to serve spectators using the Leppings Lane
  end of the ground we have altered our proposed layout accordingly.
  Three prints of our drawing 6705/3 are'enclosed.
                 The eighteen existing turnstiles will remain.                                           Ten will serve
   the North stand and eight the terraces for the home supporters.
   In addition to four turnstiles from (A - E) , which can be re-use<J,
   twelve new turnstiles will be required.                                        Four each of these will be
   for home and away spectators using the West stand, four for visiting
   supporters using the terrace under the score board and four more,
   primarily for away supporters to the centre terrace, but they could
   be used for home supporters if the need arises.                                                We understand the
   police have suggested a central fence to divide the middle section
   rather than provide a 2 m wide sterile area to one side.                                                          This may
   work providing you are happy having home and away supporters in the
    same area o u t s id e .
         Would you and                                         be kind enough to have a look at the
    drawing because X would like to hear your comments before proceeding

further, though in the meantime we are pressing on with the toilet
facilities.
     We have spoken to Mayor Turnstiles Ltd who supplied the
turnstiles on Penistone Road and they have told us that if the
new turnstiles are wanted during the close season they will want a
letter of intent within the next few days.   Other clubs are busy
installing new turnstiles and their order book is getting full.     We
can deal with this on your behalf but an indication that the numbers

 Dear ____ |,

                                                            Turnstiles at Leppings Lane

                 Thank you for returning the marked copies of our drawings
 6705/2 and 3.                   After our telephone conversation yesterday we
 have altered the layout accordingly.                                             Two prints of our drawing
 6705/4 are enclosed for your comments.
                 We have equalised each combination of turnstiles and gate
 as requested but each gate needs to be at least 2.75 m for exit
 purposes.
                 If this arrangement is satisfactory, or even if you wish us
 to make more alterations, we would be available to have a meeting
 with you and South Yorkshire Police sometime next week to discuss
 the proposals in detail.

                                                                          Yours sincerely,

                     Further to the joint meeting on 1 8 April 1 9 8 5 , to discuss the proposals for
                     new crowd control arrangements, the means of escape implications have now
                     been considered. The scheme would appear to be satisfactory providing that
                     ceartain gates have the minimum widths (in metres) as indicated on the enclosed
                     plan. It is understood that these gates will be supervised by either the police
                        club officials.                       \ •

  Dear Dick,
                                                 Re-organisation of Turnstiles
                           and New Toilet Facilities at Leppings Lane
                    As requested we have now prepared an estimate for the
  cost of works envisaged at the back of the West stand for the
   segregation of visiting spectators.
                     The scope of the work falls into two categories, firstly
  the turnstiles,                    fences, walls and gates, and secondly, the
  toilets and refreshment facilities.
                     The proposed layout of the turnstiles etc. at the back
  of the stand is shown on our drawing 6705/4, a copy of which is
  enclosed.               Including the radial fence on the West terrace, we
  estimate that the cost of this work, including professional
   fees, is likely to be in the order of £66,600.                                                     This
   assumes that five of the existing turnstiles can be re-used
   and seven new turnstiles are purchased.
                     Also enclosed is a print of our drawing 6705/7 showing
   the proposed layout of the new and refurbished toilets beneath
   the West stand.                      We estimate that the cost of the toilets,
   again including professional fees, will probably be around
   £60,700.              This includes stainless steel fittings which are fairly
   resistant to abuse but are expensive.                                              The saving if vitreous
   china is substituted for stainless steel urinal troughs and

 concrete frame at the back of the South stand and the corrosion
 of stanchions at the back of the West stand, repointing the
 boundary wall on Penistone Road and providing the mesh infill
 on the bridge to the kitchens are added to the same contract
 we suggest that an allowance of £3,000 be made for this.
              The total expenditure for the whole scheme plus
 the mainteannce work is therefore likely to be about £130 300
 including professional fees and Building Regulations fees.

 For the attention of Mr,

 Dear Mr,
                              Safety of Sports Ground 'Act 1975
                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                     Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
 of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
 to you on 9 April.
                     In the interim period several of the points which you
 raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
 which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.                                                                            However I
 would ask that further consideration should be given to the
 request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a second gate to
 be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
 barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.                                                                           :f£ these
 gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having                                                                                   a
 steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
 would hardly be justified.                                                            It is our view that in the event of
 emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the
 gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
 We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
 Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                                                                     Yours sincerely,                 OOGUMEHT Ho. i r - H r M -

            I understand, following              s telephone conversation
    with you yesterday, that South Yorkshire County Council did not send
    you a copy of their letter to us dated 2 May.       A copy is now
£   enclosed.
            A number of things that they request .have already been
    incorporated since ve wrote to the* on 9 April.

Dear Sirs,

In reply to your letter of 3th May, the extra gates referred to in paragraph
(c) of ray earlier letter of 2nd May were included primarily at the request

Provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
are incopworated in the latest proposals (yet to be considered by the Club),
the Police are prenarea to concede the request for two gates ner radical fence
in the right hand area of the bappings Lane End Terrace (indicated as hone
supporters' terrace on the plan).

Dear Dick,
                                                Alterations at Leppings Lane End
                   We have pleasure in enclosing two prints of each of our drawings
6705/5 and 6705/8 showing two possible alternative arrangements for
the turnstiles and toilets at the back of the West stand.
                   Both drawings show the following turnstile arrangements.
                            Turnstile Nos                                    1 - 8             -   North stand
                                                                              9 - 13 -             North west terrace, home supporters
                                                                           14 - 16 -               West stand, home supporters
                                                                           17                                               - 19 -       West stand, away
                                                                           20 - 23 -               South west terrace, away supporters
                   The proposals for the toilet and refreshment facilities are also
the same on each drawing.                                                            You will see that we propose to build a new
ladies toilet for away supporters using the end of the existing
refreshment bar.                                    The existing ladies toilets will be refurbished for
the use of home supporters.                                                                 The existing gents toilets will be
divided and refurbished.
                   Drawing 6705/5 indicates present turnstile                                                             housings      (17 & 18)
remaining with the ajoining fence covered with sheeting to completely
separate the home and away supporters.                                                                  However, doing the calculations
for the evacuation of the ground reveals that there is a pinch point at

    the two external gates on the left hand side of the row of six.
    It could take over 20 minutes to evacuate that end of the ground
    depending on how many people leave the South stand from that side.

    arrangement by demolishing the two end turnstiles                                            (17 & 18) and
    constructing a new dividing wall angled across to enclose three
    gates on the left hand side instead of two.
                 We believe that the cost of the scheme on drawing 6705/5 will
    be about £57,500 and for the one shown on drawing 6705/8 around
    £59,500, both including professional fees.                                         To these figures add
    say another £3000 for the maintenance work mentioned in our letter
    of 2 M a y .
                 If a decision to proceed with one of the proposed schemes is
    given within the next few days it may be possible to have the work
     substantially complete by the start of next season.                                              This is not
     certain but we would have a go.

   Dear Dick,
                                                    Ground Safety Work,                             1985
                           Meeting with Chief Superintendent ioseley
                                                    and Councillor
               As requested I met the police representatives on Thursday,
    13 June.                  I had some difficulty in persuading Mr. Moseley
    that it was not appropriate to have a high segregating barrier
    down the middle of the seating area in the West stand.                                                                         I think
    he finally accepted that it was not necessary to do any more
    than have a relatively low level rail which would be sufficient
    to make the two lots of spectators go to the appropriate
    refreshment bars and toilets and also make their way out through
    the correct route.
        Superintendent Moseley was very concerned about the
   Segreg a t io n of the two lots of spectators on the West terrace
     on those occasions when the centre of the terrace will be filled
     by visitors.                             He said that on the occasion of the Liverpool
     match he had had to station policemen in pairs down the full
     length of the dividing fence and this had been a very uncomfortable
      situation for the officers.                                                             Not least of his difficulties was
     that it was not easy for the officers to get in and out of that

 particular area if the ground was packed with spectators.
 He felt that a higher fence than the present one or a double
 fence was necessary.                  I suggested that we should have a double

                              a space in which his officers could stand,
 fewer policemen would be needed if the spectators had a
 gap between them.                   It so happens that right alongside the
 existing fence there is a gate on to the pitch and if the
 second fence were placed on the other side of the gate, it
 will provide an easy access gangway for the police and they
 will         be able to move in and out of the gap depending on the
  situation.                Mr. Moseley was clearly very pleased by this
  suggestion and subject to your approval , we are including
  the work in the contract for segregating the spectators at
  Leppings Lane end.
      I should point out that it will mean losing about a metre
  of advertising space because the hoardings carry straight on
  past that particular gate at present.                     There will have to be
  a gap in the hoardingsto enable the police to get in and out and
  of course, to evacuate the crowd in emergency.


                                        Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Calvert,
                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
           Further to ‘
                      our telephone conversation on 24 June we have
pleasure in enclosing two copies of our drawing 6705/8 showing
the proposed arrangement of the turnstiles and fences and gates
at the rear of the West stand.
            also proposed# hut not shown on the drawing to
install a single barrier rail, just above head height down
the centre of the seated area and also a fence approximately
2m away from the existing radial fence.on the right hand side
of the terrace (looking from the pitch)#to separate standing
spectators.            The fence will be just like the ones already installed.
           Although Dr# Eastwood has discussed the proposals in
outline with Chief Inspector Moseley we would also appreciate
receiving your comments.
      Perhaps the work can be completed ready for the start
of the season if the scheme meets with your approval.

                                                     Yours sincerely#

     Dear Dick,
                        Alterations at Leppings Lane End

          We have pleasure In enclosing a set of prints of our drawings
     showing details of the work at the Leppings Lane End.
          Drawing 6705/8A is worth a look at because it shows the proposed
     layout of the turnstiles and fences.      South Yorkshire Police have
     given their approval to the scheme though we have not received
     anything from then in writing.
          Tenders are due back on 11th July# 1985.
                                  Yours sincerely.

     Dear Sirs,

     Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

     As requested by your letter dated 16th July, I have written a confirmatory
     letter to the Club regarding the steel sheeting and non-slip surface of
     the timber deck to the South Stand upper seated area (copy attached for .
     your information).

     I understand that applications for building regulation/planning approval
     have been made by the Club in respect of (i) re-organisation of fences
     and turnstiles and alterations to toilet facilities at the rear of the
     West Stand, Leppings Lane, and (ii) erection of roof and enclosure to the
     Spion Kop Terrace.
                                                                                                    UL   A
     Hie Officer Working Party considered and gave approval in principle to the
     rear of the West Stand re-organisation proposals in May but, other than
     brief mentions by the Club or yourselves at routine meetings of the
     possibility of the Spion Kop being enclosed, no outline plans or details
     of such proposals have been considered to date.   -

     As on previous occasions, I am assuming that you will subnit the necessary
     detailed plans, specifications and calculations for Safety of Sports Grounds
     Act approval (bearing in mind the General Safety Certificate requirement
     to give the County Council at least 21 days notice of any proposed
     alterations or extensions at the Ground) should the Club decide to implement
     the proposals after building regulation/planning permission consideration.

                                                          Yours faithfully,

1.     Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the detailed plans submitted by the
letter dated 25th July from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners of arrangements
for the segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.  It was
recalled that consideration of outline proposals had taken place by the
Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985. Whilst formal application had been
made for Building Regulation approval and some of the work had actually
commenced, Messrs. Eastwood'and Partners had apologised by 'phone that
submission of the detailed proposals for Safety of Sports Grounds Act
approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and staff
holidays.  The plans also included details of repairs to certain crush
barriers on the Spion Kop.

2.     Consideration of Proposals           •   .

The   14 detailed plans submitted     were each considered anddiscussed individually.

IT WAS AGREED -i that, subject to the     following points and to the submission of
the necessary detailed calculations       to the Building Authority, the proposals
for segregating visiting supporters       at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium were generally       acceptable:-                      ^           3

        Plan No. 8705/6 - firr both security access and emergency egress purposes*
      sh perimeter fence gate to be provided; .         - _ - - _        F F

(b)    Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by Turnstile 23 to be either
shortened or re— aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer
(river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile 18 and
the new handrail not to be less than the width of the roller shutter gate
between Turnstiles 16 and 17;

(c)   Plan Ho. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the interal walls
(e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
be required;

(d)        Plan No. 6705/10A ~ same   comments as for plan 9A;

(e)     Plan Mo. 6705/11A - no objection in principle, but       details of exact
location required;

(f)   Plan Mo. 6705/12      — no objection in principle, but no barrier height
indicated;

(g)    Plan Ho. 8705/14A — so long as increased thickness is achieved by steep
slopes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped" arrangements to give
                                        Z2-J&£>
foothold, the proposals are satisfactory but the possible need to take
measures on top of the wall to discourage persons from attempting to climb
over will have to be borne in mind;

(h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last year, the front
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered 5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
possible lateral crushing hazard w h e n large crowds are present;

(i)    Plan No.' 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Pence Gate to be provided;

       For the attention of M r .


       Dear Mr.                                   I,

                    Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
Cl-y    outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.   We note
        the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
        by the Building Surveyors Department. We believe that all the
        calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
        checking and comment.
               With regard to your detailed observations our response
        is as follows :-
        (a)    we are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
        the proposed extra security gate.                                          «Jtere is already a gate in
        the 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the
        fSlice. This same gate will still be available for the spectators
        ±o emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
        Which will be under the control of the police.   This point may
        perhaps be clarified during the Working Party's visit on 7 August.
         (b)         The foundations "for this fence are in fact already aligned in

       the way you suggest.

        (c) and (d)
               We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
        single biocK thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
        walls.    The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
        vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
        Studding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
        durability, and would probably invite vandalism.

         (e)     The refreshment area is under the most westerly
        staircase up to the north west corner terrace.        There will
        be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.
         (f)     The handrail is to be at a height of 1250mm (4 1 )
        above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
         step.
         (g)     The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45
         chamfers which will not form good footholds.

         (h)      Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
         object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
         the precise location can be discussed on 7 August.

40       (i)      as   with point   (a), we are not sure what is intended,
         and the matter can be discussed on 7 August.
         (j)     Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
         taken care of by Mr. Chester.

                  It will be much easier for your Working Party to
         appreciate what is intended when they see the works under
         construction.      There will also be an opportunity to see
         the metal decking of the South stand.

                                         Yours sincerely,

                           (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

       Purpose of Meeting.

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "summer" inspection of the
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

2.    Ground Inspection.

A.    Leppings Lane E M

The progress of the works to segregate visiting supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Working Party’s meeting held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive*s letter
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of 1st August.

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
checking and comment.

 On the inspection, the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
 to be the poor standard o£ workmanship in the construction of the ne w
 dividing wall which was being built behind the Sta nd. The position of the
 Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by
 45° chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

 The foundations of the n ew handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
 aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall
 and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on the plan submitted).
                                                                                                      f
  As regards the single block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
  in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
  Messrs. Eastwood and. Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
■ was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the walls were braced
  b y both the outer walls and the door frames.  The Building Authority noted
. the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the

dividing walls in the new toilet facilities evidently did not have any
foundations, apparently having been built straight onto the existing
concrete slabs.  It was noted that there were some 9 inch thick brick walls
in the Male Toilets, it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
would be more likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

The Club pointed out that the new toilet facilities would not be completely
finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would
be left on site.

up to the North-West cutner terrace was noted.    This again had been built
straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

O n the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
n e w 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial    fence for use by the    Police.
This gate would still be available for the use of spectators in an
emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
Police would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. wide gap.
However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required.   It
was also agreed that a n ew gate would be required from the n ew South
Central Terrace Pen.

As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
both the Stand and at the Access level.

IT WAS AGR E E D :-

(a)   that the condition   of the internal walls in the new male and   female
toilet facilities at the   rear of the Stand should be monitored;

(b)   that the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
extended or have steps to provide easier access from the new 2 m. wide gap
formed by the new radial fence;

(c)    that a n ew gate in the pitch perimeter fence should be provided    from
the n ew South Central Terrace Pen;

(d)   that the advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated stand
area should be securely fixed to the concrete wall;

(e)   that the spalling of the concrete of the wall at the front of the
upper seated stand area should receive attention as a matter of maintenance;

(f)   that the corrosion   of the steel columns at the rear of theStand
should receive attention   on a maintenance basis.

B.     South Stand

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reported that the condition of the upper
concrete outer portion of the exterior wall of the Stand had been
investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.

It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the non-slip
surface was to commence ver y shortly (and certainly be completed by the
start of the season).
                                          2 - 7 3


IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand should largely overcome the flammability problems inherent in such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they would ensure that the
wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
laying of the metal sheeting.

C.           Spion Kop

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details of the Club's
proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of the
Officer Working Party by letter dated 22nd July.  As part of that scheme,
the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed.  Its present condition
—   <r   *                       ,




In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
to the South Stand to overcame the lateral crushing hazard which could
occur when large crowds were present.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new ^ate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
arrangement to assist access and egress.

D.           North Stand

The temporary storage facilities created by the erection of a timber wall
(in front of the L a d i e s ’ Changing Facilities in the Sports Hall) were
inspected.

IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
basis.

E.           Closed Circuit Television Facilities

The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and outside
the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed Closed Circuit
Television System were explained to the Officer Working Party.

IT WAS AGREEDS-

(a)   that a 2| kg. C O 2 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the
Police Control Box and'the Disc Jockey Box;

(b)   that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should be made
secure *

     Dear Sir,

     Many thanks for your communication dated 9th August 1985.

     I can confirm that arrangements have been finalised with South Yorkshire
     Police Authorities, Hammerton Road, for the staff concerned to be briefed
     on matters relating to safety/emergency procedures prior to our first home
     game, Saturday 17th August 1985.

     The written instructions are already in existence with the amended "warning
     message" of an emergency situation confirmed during season 1984/5.

     My Head Steward and various sectional senior stewards, are kept fully
V>   informed of the various matters and are responsible for advising the
     "match day" staff accordingly.

     In addition the staff are supplied with distinguishing attire, and are
     given specific duties to perform and required to be in attendance at those
     points throughout the entire period.

     With the approval of South Yorkshire Police, due to holidays and the
     unavailability of a full complement of staff, I have delayed the convening
     of an evenings seminar/instructional course, by the Fire Authorities until
     after the season has commenced. Having spoken to the Fire Authorities they have
     confirmed their willingness to attend leaving only the finalisation of the date
     in abeyance.

     Yours faithfully,


                                                                                            DOCUMENT No.       5 0 3

 For the attention of Mr.


 Dear
                                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                                                Safety of Sportsgrounds Act
                                                        Roof of North Stand
               I spoke to you before going on holiday regarding the very
 advanced state of corrosion which we discovered when I made an
 examination of the external steelwork of the North stand roof
  at the end of the la!st football season.
               Attached are four photographs which are representative
  of the conditions which I discovered.                                      Photograph 1 shows one
  of the main trusses.                              It will be seen that the vertical
  member and the top boom and diagonal were fairly rusty and they
  clearly needed a paint treatment because the paint had largely
  disappeared and corrosion can be expected to accelerate from now
  on.          It has to be kept in mind that the roof was designed for
  the pre-1970 wind loadings including downward suction when the
  wind is blowing from the back of the stand so that factors of
   safety have always been slightly less than they would be

 according to the present day Building Regulations.
          At the time of my first inspection the bottom boom
 member was covered by some flashings which hid two side
 legs.      I arranged for representative lengths of these
 flashings to be removed and as you will see from photograph 1
 rusting had been taking place rapidly for many years.       It seems
 that when the roof was painted last time the flashings were
 left in place so that there had only been the original paint
 treatment which had disappeared long ago.          Photograph 2
 was taken on the same day at another location.      You will
 see that there is a very large rust lamination on the nearside
  leg of the bottom boom where a large piece of rust is splitting
  away from the remainder of the steel.
          In addition to the very serious rusting of the vertical
  flanges, there were many places on the web of this bottom
 boom member where rust had progressed quite considerably.
 The web had clearly been painted 18 years ago but because
 of the very shallow slope of the bottom boom (parallel to
  the roof) the rain which falls in it had been ponding thus
  keeping the steel wet for a considerable portion of the time.
  This had tended to occur locally where small dams of dust had
 built up.
       As a result of these findings I reported to the Club
  that all the steelwork needed painting as a matter of urgency
  but in addition, the bottom boom would need to be blast
  cleaned before painting and finally that a completely different
  form of flashing should be incorporated which would stop
  rain from falling into the trough and which could also be
  easily taken off when next the roof is painted.
          The Club took the decision to carry out the painting.
  Tenders were obtained and work began at the beginning of
  July.     When the flashings were taken off everywhere, we found
  even worse conditions in some places than had been discovered
  in the original inspection.     Photograph 4 shows the extent to

 which metal had been lost in some parts of the bottom boom.
 Photograph 3 was just as bad but the damage does not show
 up quite so well in the photograph.                                      Incidentally, photographs

 of the members.                    This steel had of course already been painted
  and does not represent the original condition.
                During the work on the underside of the roof which
  has also been painted but for which the Club is not intending
  to apply for a grant, we discovered that at many places
  water had been leaking between roof sheets and had caused
  some localised rusting.                        The reason for this leakage is clearly
  the very shallow slope of the roof which is only about 1°
  (1 in 60).               A normal minimum roof slope is about 5°.                                 With the
  1° slope it seems that when the wind is blowing from the south
  rain which falls on the roof can be blown up the slope under
  the lap between sheets and small amounts leak into the stand.
                In order to give long term protection from this leakage
  which could in time cause the steelwork beneath the roof to
  become unsafe, I have recommended to the Club that they spend
  approximately £3,000 in having the lower edges of each roof
  sheet lifted and a seal placed before fastening the sheet down
  again.
                The Club will therefore be applying for a grant towards
  the cost of
  (a)  painting the external steelwork
      (b)       blast cleaning the steelwork which                            was worst affected
                by rust.
      (c)       completely new flashings over the bottom boom of the
                main trusses of a kind which will shed the rain and
                can be easily taken off for future painting.
      (d)       placing of the seal between all roof sheets.


                    For your information the total cost of all this work
      including professional fees will be in excess of £60,000.
      This does not include the cost of the internal painting for
      which the Club will not be applying for a grant.                                      It is

                 It will be very much appreciated if the County Council
          can certify that in it's oniric**?    i o - F   worv f* v   f>o
          (c)   and (d) set out above were essential in the interests
          of ground safety and that they would have been made a requirement
          of the next    annual safety certificate if they had not been
          carried out.

                        (South Yorkshire Police)

                          (South Yorkshire County Fire Se r v i r e ’)


1.   Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the response to be given to the
proposals outlined in the letter dated 2 5 th October, 1985 and plans received
from M e s s r s . Eastwood & Partners relating to facilities for the disabled, an
increased capacity for the Spion Kop and consequent additional exit rout es .
putline details of the roof to be erected over the Spion Kop had also been
pr ov i d e d .

2.   Disabled Facilities

 The Officer Working Party expressed reservations on both of the suggestions
 proposed by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for the disabled.      If the disabled
 continued to be accommodated in front of the North Stand, they would still
 be in the "firing line" of mis-aimed shots and any clear sheeting over the
 top of the area they occupied could consti tute an unacceptable hazard to
 persons who might vacate the North Stand in an emergency situation by
 climbing over the front wall of the stand onto the pitch perimeter.       It was
 accepted that the means of escape did not provide for this to be d o n e , but
 it had to be recognised that in practice this was a real possibility. The
 s tructural strength of such a structure would also be something of a problem.
 The other suggestion of accommodating the disabled in front of the perimeter
 fence along the front of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) was also
,unacceptable for the reasons stated by M e ss rs . Eastwood & Partners.

^tie suggestion of the Police representatives was that the front area of the
 lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the terracing levelled
 to provide, say, a two-tier level landing on which to accommodate the disabled,
with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch perimeter fence in
 front of this area could be removed, and the disabled would continue to gain
 access from the ramp between the Spion Kop and the North Stand as at present.
 This would also enable free access by the disabled to the proposed disabled
 toilets under the rebuilt terracing of the Spion Kop.

The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.

IT WAS AGREED that the proposals for the disabled, as now .
outlined by the Police representatives, should be supported and
 transmitted to Messrs .' Eastwood & Partners as the views of
the Officer Working P a r t y , subject to there being no obstruction of exit
routes and flows.

3.    Enlarged Spion Kop

The Fire Service and the Building Authority agreed that calculations showed



                                                                    DOCUMENT No.    5 ^
 that the enlarged Spion Kop would provide for an increaso of some 5,000
 spectators on the present capacity of 16,850, and that the number of exit
 widths required to achieve evacuation was 46.  The proposals to increase the
 tunnel exit on the north side of the Kon to 8 clear units and to provide a
 complete new six unit staircase on the south side were regarded as acceptable.
 As when the original calculations had been made, the units of exit width
 included the emergency gates in the pitch perimeter fence, but it was cons­
 idered that landings in front of these gates should be constructed (as has
 been done at Bramall Lane).

 IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, the proposals from the
 enlarged Spion Kop submitted by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners were generally
 acceptable

       (a)   ade^uace headroom being provided between the new roof and the
             upper rear and the new south side exit routes;
       (b)   to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents'
             toilets and the new ladies' toilets in the new six unit staircase
             on the south side;
       (c)    to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
              gates in the pitch perimeter fence;
       (d)    to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on

•      (e)
              the south side and on the Penis Lone Road side;
             until acceptable alternatives are available,
             be fitted with a turn-bar arrangement    under
                                                              the new exit gates to
                                                              the control of
              stewar ds.

  4 .R oofing of Spion Kop
  _




  Whilst it was accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals had been
  supplied to date, the Building Authority pointed out that the plans showed
  that the gables were not lined.

  IT WAS AGREED that this should be pointed out to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,
  as well as the fact that should any of the proposed works on enlarging or
  roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the close season, it will be
  a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be secured to prevent
  unauthorised access.

  5.    Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

- T h e Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the merging of
   spectators from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Lane end.

  ]^‘was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the physical restraints
  tjp'lichieve this could conceivably be more of a danger than a l l y i n g the present
  position to continue.

  6.    Duties of Stewards Booklet

  IT WAS AGREED that the draft of a Booklet prepared by the South Yorkshire Police
  outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and should be distributed
  to designated grounds for the information and guidance of stewards employed at
  such grounds.  Factors peculiar to particular grounds could, of course, be
  added if considered appropriate.

  7.    Spot Checks at Designated Grounds

  The Fire Service reported on the success of the recent spot check carried out

                                            .2.
                                             J24 >


at the Oakwell Ground of the Barnsley Football Club in conjunction with the
Police and the Building Authority, and reported that tho Divisions of the
Brigade were being asked to carry out similar spot checks at designated
grounds in their areas.

IT WAS AGREED that such spot checks; were essential to ensure that the required
standards were being maintained by the Clubs.

           Dear Sir,

           Following lengthy discussions between The' Football Association
           and The Football League, we are now able to send 'you, over our
           joint signatures, a revised Memorandum on Crowd Management.

           This document sets out to amplify and clarify the 'responsibilities
           of Clubs in relation to this most difficult problem.   Both our
           bodies are fully aware of the enormous amount of time, money and
           energy expended'by our Clubs in ensuring that the public can
           attend matches in safety.   With the eyes of the world on us,
           however, we cannot afford to relax for one moment.

 :-;N     | We ask you to study the Memorandum in great detail, failure to
            act on any of the recommendations 'may be taken into account should
      V     a Club subsequently be charged with misconduct under Football
            Association Rules 23 and 24.

                                                                    ‘Yours faithfully.

'memorandum to football league clubs on crowd management

SEASON 1985/1986 AND UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

A.        ADMISSION OF SPECTATORS

          1. Clubs must, in consultation with the Police and visiting Club, consider
             whether any match should be made "all ticket".

                  consultation wiU* ctie Police and visiting Club, how many tickets,
                  if any, shall be allocated to the visiting Club.
             b. Under no circumstances should tickets' be sold on the day of the
                match. Maximum publicity should be given to this fact, in the
                areas of both Clubs.
 £           c. Clubs are entirely responsible for the distribution of tickets
                allocated to them and must take all possible steps to ensure that
                tickets are not sold to supporters of the opposing team.
             d. Ticket sales should be restricted to two per person.

          2. Clubs must give serious consideration to restricting admission to
             part of their ground to "members only",
          3. The Football Association may order any match to be "all ticket" or
             "members only" and restrict the distribution of tickets in any way
             it deems appropriate.
B,        PRIOR PLANNING
                                             i
          1. Clubs mustj in addition to the above, undertake detailed liason with
             the Police, opposing Club, rail and coach operators and supporters®
*            Travel Clubs at least 10 days before a match to determine the likely
             movements of spectators and any other relevent matters. In the cases
             of Cup ties, due consideration must be given, at the time of the
             Draw, to possible replay arrangements.
          2. The number of Police and Stewards to operate at each match must be
             agreed with the Police
          3. Clubs should consider, in the interests of control at particular
             matches, reducing capacity, even when agreed with the competent
             authority under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, either for the
             ground as & whole, or for a particular section.
          4. Clubs should consider, if necessary, closing a particular section
             or sections of the ground.
          5. Clubs should consider in full consultation with Police, The Football
             Association and The Football League varying the kick-off times or
             even requesting permission to change the day of the match.
          6. The Football Association may close a section or sections of a ground
             for a particular match, or order it to be played without spectators.

         C.      SEGREGATION

                 1. Clubs must make adequate arrangements for the segregation of rival
                    supporters.
                 2. To ensure segregation, it will be necessary to reserve a
                    section or sections in the stadium for visiting supporters.
                    It is essential in this process that adequate information
                    on the likely movements of visiting supporters is obtained
                    by the Home Club in consultation with the visiting Club and
                    the bodies listed in 61.
                 3. If the match is not "all ticket", maximum publicity must

                 4. As far as possible, the arrangements for the transport of    _
                    visiting supporters should ensure that they do not come into
                    contact with home supporters when making their way to and
                    from the ground.
         £       5. Contingency plans must be made to move supporters situated

                    or else to be expelled from the Stadium.
                 6. Wherever possible, segregation should be effected by permanent
                    structures such as wall, barriers or fences. Only in
                    exceptional circumstances should Police be called upon
                    to form a "human" barrier.
                 7. Double barriers and walkway systems should be installed to
                    allow the Police to reinforce segregation and to gain access
                    to terracing or seating should the need arise.
                 8. Spectators must not be able to circulate freely between
                    sections of the Stadium.

 For the attention of Mr.


 Dear Sirs,
                                Safety of Sport Grounds Act, 1975
                          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
               Thank you for your letter of 18 December, 1985 enclosing the
  comments of the Building Authority to which I would reply as follows


  Disabled Facilities
  a)   There is no doubt that the Kop is covered by the Building
               Regulations and that we shall need Building Regulations
               approval.            However, there has effectively been no change
               in the 1985 Regulations.
               Even if there were a change in Regulations, it is obviously
               commonsense that facilities for the diabled apply to the
               ground as a whole and not to one particular building.                                                  At
               the moment there are perfectly adequate facilities under
               the overhang of the roof of the North stand.                                        There is a
               level approach.                          The disabled are under the            cover; of the
               cantilever roof.                            Any facilities at the front of the Kop
               would be less sheltered from the rain, and more prone to
               disruption by the fans immediately behind.                                     It is not a good
               place at all for disabled people.                                                       ------------ — —
                                                                                                   DOCUMENT No. 5 H O
                                  An Unlimited Company, Registered in England — No. 1833144
                                                                           SHEET   2


EASTWOOD St PARTNERS


b)   We have no intention of entering into further discussion
     regarding a way in which the 50 or any other number of
     places could be provided under the new Kop.      There are
     adequate facilities for the ground as a whole at the
     moment.


c)   The Building Authority clearly has no knowledge whatever
     oi u.c cust oi luouuaj.1 tjrounu structures.   ■V h k h e x t r a •
     £500,000 is made up of several components.      Firstly,
     there is a steel frame supporting a precast concrete
     deck, some of it at very high level.     Very expensive
     piling is required for the columns of this steel frame
     because most of the columns are high up on the bank.
     Secondly, the main roof girders have to carry very much
     more load, because of the larger area.      The spans of the
     radial girders are also that much greater so they have
     to be stronger.      The cost per square foot of all the
     covered space is increased.      In addition the framing and
     sheeting at the rear of the stand are on average very
     much higher and, therefore, more expensive.       Thirdly,
     the addition of the extra spectators has resulted in
     the need for complete re-organisation of exit routes with
     considerable extra expense.      New turnstiles are needed and
     additional toilet accommodation..     A re-examination of our
     figures shows the additional cost for the 5,000 extra places
     is about £560,000.      To simply roof over the existing Kop with
     no extension would reduce the cost of the scheme to less than
     a half of that for the enlarged Kop.      I trust we shall have
     no more of this uninformed opinion.

     This extra money is being provided to achieve 5000
      extra spectators.     If we give up 1000 of those spaces to
      provide for say 100 disabled plus 100 helpers then over
      £100,000   of the extra cost of the enlarged Kop has to be set
      against the disabled accommodation.     The Building Authority
      must accept that the extra £580,000 the Club intends to spend

     With regard to the proposal that a glazed shelter might
     be placed over the disabled accommodation in front of the
     North stand, it was not our intention that any seats within
     the North stand would have an obscured view although a few
     of the spectators might have to look through the glass of
     the canopy to see the near touchline.     There are materials
     available for the glazed roof which might prove to be safe for


     I regard it as regrettable that there has been such a
     negative attitude on this particular matter.     We have not,
     of course, taken the design study any further with regard
     to the possibility of a covering for part of the disabled
     area nearest to the Kop end of the North stand, but would
     reconsider the matter if the Working Party has a change of
      heart.


      Enlarged Kop
           With regard to the request for a barrier to protect
      the ladies toilet, it has perhaps not been realised that
      there is handrailing already in place.    A gap will be
      created for an entrance to the ladies toilet.    The
      final version of the proposed arrangements is shown on
      the attached print of drawing number 6648/53.    The new
      brickwork is shown shaded.


      Roofing the Kop
           We are really surprised by the suggestion that the
      steel frame of the gable walls and presumably the back of the
      stand should be sheeted over.   It is a common feature of
      every stand structure that I know of in any football ground
      in the country that the sheeting rails and other bracing
      members are exposed on the inner face.     In older structures
      they are generally only at 1.2 m centres but in more modern
      structures they are generally at 1.8 m centres.     With the
      1.8 m spacing it would be extremely difficult indeed to
      climb up except adjacent to a column.     However, I know of
      no instance where the sheeting rails of an existing stand
       are regarded as being such a hazard that they should be boxed
       in, with an inner skin as well as an outer skin.      I find
          very surprising that this matter is being pressed.

                     This correspondence on these matters leads me to believe
           that there would be great advantage if the Club's advisers were
           present for part of each of the meetings of the Officer Working
           Party.       Matters of this kind need to be discussed round the
           table rather than in lengthy correspondence.                              We can be of great

           to give the opportunity to comment at an early stage.                                   The
           plans are incomplete in some respects and this may lead to
           misunderstanding of what is intended or a lack of appreciation
           of the thinking behind what is proposed.                          There is also the
           difficulty^in the light of comments received from the Club, and
           indeed those from the Working Party, quite significant
           changes may take place at a very late stage.                                  It is desirable
           that any late changes be dealt with in as short a time as
           possible.       In this regard I now enclose six prints of each of
           our drawings numbers 7C, 8A, 9A, 17A and 56.                                  As the Club
           will be wishing to place an order for the new building not
            later than the end of January, it may be that an oral presentati
            to your Working Part of what is proposed might be beneficial
            all round.

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 7/1986

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT 1985

Introduction

1. HOC 5^/85 and 5/1986 were copied to Chief Executives of
Metropolitan District Councils and London Boroughs in view of the
forthcoming transfer to them of responsibility in the Metropolitan
counties and Greater London for the administration of the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (SSGA).  The purpose of this circular is to
advise successor authorities of the changes to the SSGA brought
about by the Local Government Act 1985 (LGA) and to give guidance
on discharging these responsibilities* It is not intended to affect
any internal or locally agreed arrangements which may be in train to
ensure that all those who have an interest in securing safety at
sports grounds are fully consulted.

SSGA 1975

2. The SSGA gave effect to the main recommendations contained in
the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds which
was prepared by Lord Wheatley following the serious accident at
Ibrox Park Football Ground in 1971.

3„      The main provisions of the Act are:

        a. A power, exercisable by the Secretary of State, to .
        designate sports stadia with a capacity for more than
        10,000 spectators. Once designated, a stadium will require
        a safety certificate from the local authority.

        b. An obligation on the local authority to issue such
        certificates .

Guidance to the SSGA procedures

9. A copy of the SSGA and the Regulations (Statutory Instrument
1263 1976) are enclosed with this circular.   A detailed description
of the Act and its provisions is contained at Annex B. The Regu­
lations set out the procedures and time limits associated with
safety certificate applications and appeals.   These same regulations
also empower local authorities to determine fees in respect of
applications for the issue or amendment of safety certificates. A
guide to the procedure for the issue of a general safety certificate
is at Annex C. Similarly, the procedure for the issue of a special
safety certificate is at Annex D.

 U-. Xuu 1'uu.ywiiife poi-nt-ii.are hxgnxxgncea as ueing of particular
potential interest to local authorities:

     a. Procedure under s. 10. Paragraph 21 of Annex B refers.
     Authorities may wish to note that this procedure can be
     applied to all sports grounds within the meaning of the Act,
     not just to stadia.   It is hoped that authorities will not
I   feel inhibited from   invoking the procedure, as necessary,
     where they perceive the risks to be such that urgent action
     is required to provide reasonable safety for spectators.

    b. The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) (The
    Green Guide).  Attention is drawn to paragraphs 5 and 6 of
    Annex B and paragraph 3 of Annex C. Authorities will no
    doubt bear in mind the contents of paragraph 4 of HOC 5^/1985
    dealing with action on the Interim Report of the Inquiry
    contains additional recommendations on the content and
    structuring of the Green Guide which will be revised as soon
    as possible.  In the meantime the existing guide, a copy of
    which is enclosed, may be used until such time as the revised
    version is available.

Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds

11. The Final Report of Mr Justice Popp-lewell1s Committee of Inquiry
into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds was published on
16 January 1986 (Command 9710). A separate Home Office circular,
number 5/1986, was sent to local authorities - including Metropolitan
District Councils and London Borough Councils - on 20 January 1986,
giving details of the Government's response to the safety recommend­
ations contained in the Report, and next steps.

Other

12. A list of designated stadia for England and Wales is attached at
Annex E. Management of those stadia in Metropolitan counties and
Greater London have been informed of the change in responsibility for
administration of the SSGA and have been advised to copy applications
for special safety certificates or amendments to existing general
certificates to successor authorities (see Annex F).

13. This circular is copied to Chief Executives of County Councils,
 Secretaries of the successor authority coordinating committees, and
 to Chief Fire Officers for information.  Paragraph 10 is of
 particular relevance.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975

I enclose for your information a copy of my Report totheGeneralPurposes Panel
on 6th May, 1986, together with a copy of the Panel’s Resolution in relation to
that Report.

I would like to make the following comments in relation to the decision

(a)      Although it has been decided to carry on with the old administrative system
         organised by the County Council I wish to make it clear that the system is
         under review and may be adjusted in the future;

(b)      I will shortly write to the other District Councils in South Yorkshire with
         a view to establishing a basis for consultation as described in the
         Resolution;

(c)      the re-drafting of the Certificate conditions will shortly be completed and
         I will then be asking for your comments on them.

If you have any questions to ask on this matter,please do nothesitate                                                              to

         REPORT OF THE HEAD OF A DM IN ISTRA TION AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO THE GENERAL
         PURPOSES PANEL

                                     Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

         Introduction

     • The Panel will recall that a report was submitted to the March 1586 Meeting

         covering the general safety of sports grounds legislation as it affects the City

         Council.     This follow-up report aims to deal in detail with the   current

     .                         '*■’ -as inherited from the South Yorkshire County Council.

         There are    2 sports grounds currently subject to the legislation   - Sheffield

         Wednesday    Football Club and Sheffield United Football Club; the Owlerton Sports

   : j. iium is likely to be made subject to the legislation shortly..

    t         iald Wednesday Football Club - Hillsborough

         The Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited was designated as requiring a

         Safety Certificate in August 1978 and such a Certificate was issued by the

         fgaacy Council on 21st December, 1979.     /The Stadium is currently undergoing

         major works which, w h e n complete, will form a roof over the Spion Kop and thus

         substantially improve the accommodation for spectators.

         Sheffield United Football Club, Bramall Lane

         The Club was designated as requiring a certificate in August 1984 but to date

   .y- certificate has not been issued as there are outstanding works to be

'• |j||amPlete^» The County Council took the view that the certificate should only be
+ •'I'
    - i s s u e d as and when the Ground was up to the appropriate safety standard and not

        before.     This procedure effectively insured that the terms of the Safety

         Certificate were not breached as soon as it was issued.      It is hoped that the

        Council will be in a position to issue a certificate before the start of the

        1986/87 season.

        Owlerton Sports    Stadium

        It is understood that the Home Secretary will shortly be designating the S t a d i u m .

     as requiring a Safety Certificate in accordance with the Popplewell Report

        recommendations.     It will, therefore, be necessary to arrange for a full

     inspection of the Stadium in the next few weeks to find out what works are
■7
                                                           3*t
            2.

            going to be required to raise the standard of the Stadium to appropriate levels.

            The Panel is probably aware that the Stadium is Council owned but is currently

            leased to the Owlerton Sports Stadium Limited.         This Lease will expire on 1st

            November,    1987.

            Safety Certificate Standard Conditions

            At the moment "the Safety Conditions attached to Safety Certificates are

            standardised chrougnout south toricsaiie a u u    gov. ’
                                                                   T

            have -indicated that they would wish this situation to continue for reasons of

            administrative simplicity.     The Conditions do, however, give some cau'se for
■:
      ’
          ( concern,                                  /
                        as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas.      The

            irafting of these Conditions is of particular importance as it is a serious

            criminal offence to contravene any of them punishable by the Statutory Maximum

            Fine (Currently £2,000) or 2 years imprisonment or both.



            It is proposed to re-draft the Certificate conditions, where appropriate, and to

            submit them to the Panel for approval.        The Sheffield Wednesday Certificate

            would then be replaced in accordance with Section 4 (1) (b) of the Act.         The

            Sheffield United Certificate could then be issued with the new conditions before

            the start of the 1986/87 season.     The re-drafted conditions would,     of course, be
     .(

 ' '        submitted to the Fire Service, the Police and Building Surveyor for comment;

            other authoritiesin South Yorkshire could also be involved in this process.

            Existing Administrative Arrangements

            The County Council system for administering the Act is based on 2 main

            components - (a) bi-annual inspections of the Stadium; and (b) meetings of an

            officer working party.     The bi-annual inspections consist of representatives

            from all the interested authorities and involve thorough inspections of the

            Stadia and the identifying of any defects.       These defects are at the time of the

            visit brought to the attention of the certificate holder and its technical

            representative if one is present.     Depending on the nature of the faults found

            (if any) steps are then agreed between the Authority and the Certificate Holder
                                           2   / -5 "

to rectify them or so arrange matters that no risk co the public occurs.      The

Working Party consists of representatives from Che Police, Fire Service,

Building Surveyors and Che County Council r it considers in detail various

matters (such as the Spion Kop development at Sheffield Wednesday Football

Ground) and also any outstanding items from the bi-annual inspections.     The

Working Party is effectively a coTordinating body which attempts to ensure that

a balanced and cons is cent approach is maintained tc. oirrent issues at the Spores

Grounds.    Any recommendations it makes are subject to approval by this Panel.

The Bealch and Safety Executive

Recommendation 9 of The Popplewell Committee's Interim Report read as follows

“There should be urgent consultacion between the Health and Safety Executive and

the Fire Authorities and Local Authorities as to how besc to co-ordinate and

communicate their inspections and reports”. Searing this in mind the local

office of the Health and Safety Executive was invited to participate in the

administrative system for safety at sports grounds.     This invocation was

declined.    The ExecuCive will apparendy take no direct part in the

Certificacion system.

In view of this problem the Home Office was contacted and the position

explained; it appears that negociations are under way becween the Home Office

and the HSE abouc Popplewell's recommendation but as yet there has been no

useful outcome.

In these circumstances the Council could keep the Health and Safety Executive

informed of all developments in Sheffield and to invite their comments on them.

It would then be the responsibility of the Executive to decide whether or not to

respond.

Fees

The basis on which fees may be charged is set out in Regulation 14 of the Safety

of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 which states ”14.    A local authority may

determine the fees to be charged in respect of applications for the issue or
 amendment of safety certificates but such fees shall not in a particular case

 exceed aa amount commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done."     The

 South Yorkshire County Council did-.not fix any fees under the Regulation

 apparently as a matter of policy and the Panel is therefore asked to decide

 which of the following options to adopt:- (a) state as a matter of. policy that

 no fees will be charged in respect of Safety of Sports Grounds legislation or

 (b) decide in principle to fix fees and to asic tor a rep — t      on ttie costs

 to th'e Council.

 Conclusion

 The Panel is asked to:-

 (a) Note the broad    outlines of the administrative system organised by the

       County Council and authorise its continuation for the time being;

 (b)   Note the position of the Health and Safety Executive and request the Head

       of Administration and Legal Department to keep the Executive informed of

       all matters relating to sports ground safety;

 (c)   Request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to draft new

       safety certificate conditions in consultation with the appropriate

       authorities approval by the Council;

 (d) Either resolve   that no fees will be charged under the legislation or

       request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to report on the

       Councilfs costs in this respect.

            Before the start o f next season I want you to arrange a Seminar for
    stewards and programme sellers so that they can be informed exactly of their
    duties.

            It is important that you draw up a list of stewards and their
    respective duties, and similarly with programme sellers. In the case of
    programme sellers they must be instructed that this job is a selling job and
    they must go out to our supporters to sell and make some vocal contribution to
    it. They must be strategically placed and their performance monitored.

            Many of the-above requirements apply also to stewards.

             Do you think it would be rewarding if other people such as our
    turnstile operators were also properly instructed along these lines?

Dear Dick,
                Home Office Document on Fire Safety and
                      Safety at Sports Venues
          I have read through the part of th. document which deal*
with Sports Grounds. I do not see any grounds tor objecting to
any of the recommendations. There will be little if any change in
the procedure already established at Hillsborough. The document
envisages that far more grounds for various sports will be designated,
but in appropriate circumstances the procedures will not be so
onerous as those relating to Hillsborough. However, as it is a
 •top* ground we cannot expect that there will be much relaxation
compared with the present arrangement* •
         There 1* a welcome statement on page 11 that due account
whould be taken of the need to keep the cost* to clubs and local
authorities to reasonable proportions. 'There are also various
references to Safety Certificates reflecting the circumstances of
each particular ground and the number of spectators who are likely
to attend (see page 14).    These words may be useful to us in the
future, although we can expect to have more stringent requirements
compared with some of the smaller clubs.
         It is comforting to know that the new Green Guide will not
become a statutory code, and will continue to be subject to

some clubs.      But in paragraph 2.38 on page 20 there is a clear
implication that it is only necessary to reduce the risk to
an acceptable level, rather than trying to remove all risk.                     This
wording will help curb excessive demands, and may be useful to
us sometimes in negotiations.
            I am returning the document herewith.

Dear Mr Chester

Following your recent telephone conversation with Mr Wilkinson on 28th/July 1986
in regard to your Club s u p f j ^ n g pa§s€s for Officers from the South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Serviced T a m submitting the following information for
you to discuss with your fellow directors.

              16th July 1986 Mr W ilk in s o n v:                                                             with tw      other Officers




                                                                          involved
ill. anyvents after they had already occurred and therefore, slight delays could
               on occasions ia responding to the incident. To avoid this 1 would
ask if two passes could be supplied to the Ambulance Service which would enable
us to ensure that aa Ambulance Officer was in your ground at all home fixtures.

There would be no cost to the Club for this facility, and it would improve ground
safety.  In the event of any untoward occurrence my Officers would be in a position
to identify problems prior to them happening and would therefore be in a much
better position to respond to any emergency.

If you require any further information then please do not hesitate to contact
Mr Wilkinson on Rotherham 361581 extension 259, who will ask one of our
Offciers responsible for the safety of your ground to contact you.

Yours sincerely “

Dear Sir,

                                                             Safety of Sportsgrounds Act 1975
                        Application for Increased Crowd Capacity on the Spion Kop
                    I am grateful to M r . _______ for sending us a copy of your
letter to the Club dated 14 August.                                                      This enabled me to see it over
the weekend, and to do a little research into the points you have
raised.

                   The proposed meeting at 2.00 p.m.. on 21 August is convenient
for the Club officers.                                              It is likely that the Chairman will be present,
but he is indisposed at the moment.                                                     A director with special
responsibility for the ground, Mr. Keith Addy and the club secretary
will also attend, and I will hope to deal with the technical side
assisted by
                   Turning now to the matters raised in your, letter, I think it
appropriate to make a preliminary response, so that the members of
the Working Party may be informed of our thoughts.                                                          No doubt there
w ill be fuller discussion at the meeting on Thursday.
       I will use the same nomenclature a to f, as is used in your
letter.

(a)                The statement is made that the new terrace construction does
not comply with the plans submitted to the Council for Building
Regulations Approval.
                   As far as I can see it is incorrect to say that our drawings

 do not show the steepest slopes.
         I should explain that the submission of plans was
 complicated by changes of mind which were forced on the Club
 u* '■■'.i.w.uiuijcances oeyona tueir control.    The intention was to
 redevelop the Kop broadly as the present scheme.           They were
 informed at a very late stage that the level of grant which
 had been expected may not be forthcoming, because of demands
 from other clubs following the Bradford fire.           The scheme was
 therefore changed in January of this year, to roofing with no
 extra accommodation.       All our drawings had to be changed.
 The contract was let in early February and we sent a very full
 set of drawings and calculations to the           Council on 24 February
 1986.    Following a good run in the cup the Board were able
 to revert to the original scheme in March.             By that time the
 steel frame for the roof only scheme was ordered and we had
 to make use of it.      The columns and the bracing arrangement
 against wind now had to be modified to receive the new terracing.
 In effect a third scheme had to be prepared utilising steel which
 was more suitable for the roofing only version.             Thus, we had
 to do completely new calculations and drawings in March and April.
 This necessitated a re-submission for building regulations approval.
         However, that re-submission showed the steepest slope
 which occurs on the terracing, and the drawings submitted in
 March and April show accurately what has been built.
         I enclose a photo-copy of our letter of 30 April which was
 the one which accompanied most of the drawings relating to the
 new inclined terracing.       It will be seen that it lists the drawings
 which were enclosed, five of them, Nos. 45, 47, 48, 49 and 51,
  being drawings of the Kop terracing.           Prints of these five drawings
  are enclosed.
          It will be seen that each of these drawings has a small
  triangular diagram above the steps which gives the rise and the
  tread of the steps, and hence indicates the overall slope.
                                                                           SHEET

         Four of the drawings, Nos. 45, 47, 48 and 51 show
 sections   through the main part of the new deck and have a slope
 of 173/330   which is   just over 27*°.          The drawing 49 shows a
                                    w x iiy s ' at the back of the stand.
 This has   a slope of 173/285 which is       just over 31°.   The
 slope occurs everywhere in the wings, and there is nowhere
 on the Kop where a greater slope occurs.            Thus it is not correct
 to say that the terrace 'does not comply with the plans
 submitted.........' and 'in particular....... is now steeper'.
         We believe that because the City Council did not respond
 to the drawings which were sent on 30 April within the five
 weeks allowed, we have Building Regulations approval for the
 construction shown on those drawings.
         It is expected that this development is subject to the
 Safety of Sportsgrounds Act as well as the Building Regulations,
 but as the same officers advise the Council on both matters, there
 could now be a possibility of a charge of maladministration if the
Council decides to restrict the crowd capacity in the Safety
Certificate because of the slope of the terrace.
         With regard to possible danger,, the Green Guide clearly
envisages 30° slopes because the spacing of crush barriers for
such a slope is given in table 12.3.
         No doubt there will be discussion on this matter at
the meeting on Thursday, but the slopes we had to use were
determined by the very crude shape of the existing Kop.            Matching
the main new part of the terrace to the old part so as to give
good sightlines determined the slope of 27°, to which we assume there
is no objection.    Because of the presence of Penistone Road the
corner had to be swung round and this modified the slope in the
wing areas to just over 31°.      We consider this difference of just
over 1   to be acceptable bearing in mind the very good crush
karr^-er arrangement and the excellent viewing which will stop the
crowd craning forward and thus causing a surge when some exciting
play takes place in the goal area     (the viewing can only be judged
by visiting the ground).

   (b)      The vertical steps from terrace level to the new gangway
  can be measured in different ways depending on which foot it is
  assumed will be used to step down.         As a result of observation


  found that the spectator generally holds the rail with one hand
  and steps down with the opposite foot.            This reduces the step to
   just over 1ft.       Even if he does not use the opposite foot he
   still steps onto the higher step which is avai-j.able.
            But if it is thought to be necessary, the addition of a
   short length to the barrier running parallel to the gangway
   can direct the spectator a little further up the slope, so that
   he will automatically take a small step downward. This can be
   discussed with the Fire Service and the Building Control Department.
   Only one or two of the gangways need consideration.


            it has always been intended to sheet down to the ground
   level at the Ozzie Owl corner, but the precise detail had to wait
   until that part of the Kop was built, and the trees cleared.             When the
    frame had been erected it was my view that it was preferable not to
    sheet to ground level for reasons which I have expressed to the
   Working Party.      As my view was not agreed the work is proceeding
    as was intended.

    (d)      We are a little surprised that the Building Control officer
    who has spotted a pre-cast step resting on (as we understand it)
    a bearing of 50mm instead of the intended 75mm did not point it out
    to either my resident engineer or to the contractor so that if there
    was need to take remedial action it could have been done there and

    then.
             However, we u n d e r s t a n d that it is one of the concrete steps
    which has a short span, and it rests on steel.            In that case it is
    probably incorrect to say that the seating is sub-standard.            The
    Code of Practice to which we are working gives the Engineer
    discretion to reduce the step below 75mm.            (See attached, photocopy
    of clause 5.2.4.3).       Firstly the seating is subject to a permissible
     tolerance so this will reduce the 75mm.           Also this is a solid step
                                                                              SHEET   g

        with a full width of bearing to take the load.   In other buildings,
        precast units are oft«n n       ^      i       r         -•
        and all the load is concentrated on the narrow beam.       A smaller
        seating can clearly be permitted where the beam is of full width.
        If as we understand it the beam in question is of short span, which
        means the load at each end is small, I think it highly likely that
.*®Sv
        when I know which one out of the approximately 1000 new steps
        has the smaller than specified seating I shall take the view that
        it is perfectly safe and no action is needed.     If I think it necessary
        we can weld a small plate to the steel on which it rests to increase
        the bearing width, but this is very unlikely to be necessary.
                I am surprised that this matter has been raised in this way.


        (e)      The reference to the provision of a toilet and kiosk underneath
        the new terrace not featuring in the application is surprising.          The
        word   'provision' makes it appear that these have been constructed
        as part of the scheme.     They were built about three years ago.      The
        work was not designed by us, but I know it was subject to building
        control from discussions X had with the Building Control Department
        at the time.
                The presence of the kiosk and the toilets was shown on various
        of our drawings.     For example the drawing 6648/16   (a copy is enclosed)
        shows the way in which the foundations had to be orientated to miss
        the toilets and also the kiosk.     This drawing was submitted for
        Building Regulations approval.     Drawings 7 and 9 were issued for
        distribution to the Working Party together with others to explain
        our scheme, on 23 December 1985    (see last page of attached copy
        of my letter).     These drawings each show parts of the toilets or
        of the kiosk protruding from under the stand    (copies enclosed).
                The drawing No. 6648/9 showing the rear elevation of the stand,
        which was included with our planning application in July 1985 shows
        the upper part of the kiosk projecting into the sheeting.       Our
        drawing No. 6648/7 which was also distributed via the Working Party
        secretariat in December, 1985, shows the toilets and kiosk protruding
        from under the roof of the Kop
                                                                       SHEET   6 •

               The Building Control department was visiting the site very
     frequently during late February and March, 1986, to watch the
     piles being installed immediately alongside the toilets and the
     Jciosk.    Visits have ta^en place frequently since May.
               I am at a loss, therefore, to understand why this matter is
     being raised now.     However, the kiosk is not used for storage.
     All saleable material is taken back to a central store after each
§5   game.      During a match the goods on sale consist of no more than
(4) packets of crisps, and Bovril, tea and Coke served in paper cups.
     The number of cups and packets of crisps is not great and there
     is no significant fire hazard.
               The kiosk performs exactly the same function as the several
     kiosks inside the south and north stands.      These kiosks are also
     on exit routes, and have never been considered a hazard by the
     Fire Service.
               One matter which might cause concern is the fact that the
     roof of the kiosk is combustible.      If this matter is considered
     critical, the Club would no doubt be prepared to put a fire resistant
     inner and outer skin on the roof.


               The discussion   on evacuation times which has arisen in the
     xast month was apparently sparked off by the Popplewell report
     recommendation No. 24.      This says that the Green Guide should be
     revised to make it clear that the suggestion of an eight minute
     evacuation time is concerned with 'the effect of crowd turbulence
     on the rate of flow' which arises if there are delays in evacuating
     spectator accommodation.
               It may be that the wording of the Green Guide had not
     always been understood by other licensing authorities, but there
     was no misunderstanding on this matter in the South Yorkshire
     Working Party when the ground was granted its Safety Certificate
      in 1979.    The calculated evacuation time for the Kop with its
      pre-certificate capacity of 20,000    (23,000 until the Ibrox disaster
      in 1971) had been about 16 minutes    (or 18£ minutes pre 1971).
      At that time there were far fewer crush barriers to control
      turbulence in the crowd, and the barriers were not so strong.

 The very experienced police officers on the South Yorkshire
 Working Party, who had been in attendance at games for many years,
 said they had never seen turbulence occur when the crowd was
 sufficient to give an evacuation time in excess of 8 minutes.
 It should be remembered that through the 19fiO'« i-he ^+-4—            j-
          sucu chat more than ll,Ooo people would be on the
 Kop at almost every game    (this number could just get out in
 8 minutes with the exits as they were at that time).
        *he present Chief Fire Officer, Mr. Harry Wright, was
 on the Working Party at the time.          He requested an extra exit
 route from the very top of the KoP .               This was constructed by the
 Club at a cost of £16,000    (1979 prices).              He was prepared to
 count the exits onto the pitch as part of the evacuation system
 in an emergency    (each gate is controlled by a policeman).             With
 these measures the evacuation time in an emergency was brought
 below eight minutes, and disregarding the gates onto the pitch the
evacuation time in normal circumstances with a full Kop                (16,850)
would be 11 /4 minutes (see attached extract from Minutes of
Working Party dated 2 April 1979).
        The Fire Service at that time took the view that the very
slight risk of turbulance    (if there really is such a risk) could
not justify greater expense to the Club. The Fire Service in
its advisory role is always having to balance money against
slight or very slight risk, and this was a calculated decision
which Mr. H.E. Wright supported.
       I am a frequent attender at the ground.                The police are
there every week.    There has never been an occurrence to my
knowledge of turbulance associated with this ll3/4 minute
evacuation time in the seven years since the ground received
its Safety Certificate.     The police can give their own view.
       I know that at other grounds longer evacuation times have'
applied without there being the slightest trouble.               For example,
at Bramall Lane, the evacuation time was almost 20 minutes at
the Bramall Lane end until the new exits were constructed onto
Bramall Lane near the centre of the stand about three years ago
There had never been •turbulance' of the kind envisaged in the
Green Guide as far as I know.
       Further, in recent years various police forces have
adopted a policy of keeping the gates closed at one end of the
                                    3 ^ 1
                                                                     SHEET

 ground for 10 minutes or so after a match to keen fh*
  '                   pUT:b tne eight minute rule in perspective.
         The words   'eight minute rule' are not really correct*
 of course.   The Green Guide uses the words    'it is suggested'.
 It is not nearly so positive as it is about its other
 recommendations.

         With this as background the club has been quite shocked
 by the suggestion that the gates onto the pitch should be Ignored
 in the calculations of evacuation times, and that eight
 minutes should be achieved by means of ordinary exits.     They
 feel this change of view cannot be justified.     The fact that
 Popplewell has clarified what it is the Green Guide suggests
 is of no relevance in Sheffield where we have always interpreted
 the Guide correctly.  The change of view is not the result of
 Popplewells clarification.
        If the City Council chose to ignore the gates onto the
pitch   in setting the number of spectators which will be
 allowed the effect would be to limit the capacity of the enlarged
Kop to almost the same as it has been since 1979.      The completely
new exit which has been built at the south end of the Kop, and
the widening of the exit at the north end,.will only cancel out
the loss of the exits onto the pitch.
        It should be emphasised that the provision of the new
decking to accommodate almost 6000 more spectators, the new
exit routes, extra toilets, and the part of the roof over the 6,000
extra places, will have cost about £500,000.     It has stretched
ingenuity to find room for the new exit routes, as the Fire
Service will i am sure agree. I see no way In which further exits
could be provided even if there were unlimited money available.
        However, it should be brought to the attention of the City
Council that I entered into discussion with the South Yorks
Working Party at a very early date and kept them informed of our
proposals regarding the exit arrangements for the Kop at all times.
In particular, I sent a clear exposition of our    proposals in a
letter dated 25 October, 1985.    it will be seen that near the end

of the letter I described the proposed new exits and enclosed
drawings showing their positions.            I also gave the arithmetic on
which our proposals were based (see copy attached).
                       vreie pxacea u e t o r t    cne Working Party on
13 November, 1985, and their decision was sent to me in a letter
from S.Y.C.C. dated 14 November 1985.             A copy is enclosed,     it
will Joe seen that under item 2 on page 2 it is stated that the
Working Party "agreed with your calculations and proposal to increase
the tunnel exit on the north side of Spion Kop to 8 clear units
and to provide a complete new 6 unit staircase on the South side".
       The only change we have made since that submission in
October is to improve the arrangements by widening the tunnel
exit to 9 units instead of 8.
       In the light of that completely unequivocal acceptance of
proposals last November the Club has proceeded with the scheme
in its entirety.   The Fire Service did not voice any second thoughts
until July, 1986, by which time the structures were virtually
complete.   It is now not    feasible to construct a new exit route.
The new decking for the extra places, the new exit routes, and the
extra cost of making the roof large enough to provide the extra
places amounts to about £500,000.        This would now be wasted.
       It is quite unacceptable that with the Popplewell report
being published in January, 1986, only a few weeks after our proposals
had been approved by the Working Party, the Fire Service did not
give any indication of a possible change of mind until July, 1986.
This is clearly maladministration in the Club's view.
       The Club did not make the decision to install the extra
decking until March, and did not erect it until June/July,              if the
change of policy had been indicated earlier the Club could have
been saved much of the additional expense.




       With regard to the proceedings on Thursday, we would like to
have a clear statement of all the points which cause concern, so
that we can properly answer them.       I presume that the various matters
                                                                                     SHEET

will be explained to the Committee by officers of the Council or
by the Fire Service representatives.                      Following that, I presume
we will be allowed to ask questions.                      It will then be our turn to
                   .   ■   -- -   - — it--"*-:   W w ——   ^utauxotieu.
       Finally, I suggest there will be a brief summing up.
       I mentioned in our telephone conversation yesterday that
the Club thinks it would be very helpful to the Committee in
coming to its decision if it would inspect the Kop.                      Indeed we
believe it will be very difficult for them to get a true picture
to enable them to make a fair decision from drawings.                     They would
be welcome to visit on Friday afternoon, say if they decide to
reconvene their meeting at Hillsborough, or such other time as
will suit their convenience.

Dear Sirs,
                                 Safety of Sport Grounds Act. 1975

              Thank you for your letter of 18 December, 1985
comments of the Building Authority to which I would reply as follows

Disabled Facilities
a)            There is no doubt that the Kop is covered by the Building
              Regulations and that we shall need Building Regulations
              approval. However, there has effectively been no change
              in the 1985 Regulations.
              Even if there were a change in Regulations, it is obviously
              commonsense that facilities for the diabled apply to the
              ground as a whole and not to one particular building.                                          At
              the moment there are perfectly adequate facilities under
              the overhang of the roof of the North stand. There is a
           level approach. The disabled are under the cover, of the
           cantilever roof. Any facilities at the front of the Kop
           would be less sheltered from the rain, and more prone to
              disruption by the fans immediately behind.                                 It is not a good
              place at all for .disabled people.

     With regard to the proposal that a glazed shelter might
     be placed over the disabled accommodation in front of the
     North stand, it was not our intention that any seats within
                                                                    *
     the North stand would have an obscured view although a few
     of the spectators might have to look through the glass of
     the canopy to see the near touchline. There are materials
     available for the glazed roof.which might prove to be safe for
     that purpose.

     I regard it as regrettable that there has been such a
     negative attitude on this particular matter. We have not,
     of course, taken the design study any further with regard
     to the possibility of a covering for part of the disabled
     area nearest to the Kop end of the North stand, but would
     reconsider the matter if the Working Party has a change of
     heart.


     Enlarged Kop
          With regard to the request for a barrier to protect
     the ladies toilet, it has perhaps not been realised that
     there is handrailing already in place. A gap will be
     created for an entrance to the ladies toilet.   The
     final version of the proposed arrangements is shown on
     the attached print of drawing number 6648/53. The new
     brickwork is shown shaded.


     Roofing the Kop
          We are really surprised by the suggestion that the
     steel frame of the gable walls and presumably the back of the
     stand should be sheeted over. It is a common feature of
     every stand structure that I know of in any football ground
     in the country that the sheeting rails and other bracing
     members are exposed on the inner face. In older structures
     they are generally only at 1.2 m centres but in more modern
     structures they are generally at 1.8 m centres. With the
     1.8 m spacing it would be extremely difficult indeed to
     climb up except adjacent to a column. However, I know of
     no instance where the sheeting rails of an existing stand
     are regarded as being such a hazard that they should be boxed
     in, with an inner skin as well as an outer skin. I find
     it very surprising that this matter is being pressed.

          This correspondence on these matters leads me to believe
     that there would be great advantage if the Club's advisers were
     present for part of each of the meetings of the Officer Working
     Party.   Matters of this kind need to be discussed round the
     table rather than in lengthy correspondence. We can be of great
     assistance in providing information which may result in fewer
     matters becoming contentious.       It is also inevitable that we

     to give the opportunity to comment at an early stage. The
     plans are incomplete in some respects and this may lead to
     misunderstanding of what is intended or a lack of appreciation
     of the thinking behind what is proposed. There is also the
               TVJutr
     difficultj^in the light of comments received from the Club, and
     indeed those from the Working Party, quite significant
     changes may take place at a very late stage. It is desirable
     that any late changes be dealt with in as short a time as
     possible. In this regard I now enclose six prints of each of
     our drawings numbers 7C, 8A, 9A. 17A and 56. As the Club
     will be wishing to place an order for the inew inilding jaot
     later than the end of January, it may be that, an oral presentation
     to your Working Part of what is proposed might ie beneficial
     all round.

          If   Ur° uP concluded that this availed "eight minute rule" was concerned solely with the effect
          of crowd turbulence (arising from delays m evacuating specator accommodation) on the rate of
         flow. It was not related to emergency evacuation time criteria (see paragraph 32 below) and the
         Group recommends that the Guide should make this clear.




 Photocopy of Recommendation 24 from Final Popplewell Report.




            6.5 Recent research has indicated that when it takes more than
            7 mmutes to vacate an area of spectator accommodation the
           crowd flow tends to become turbulent. In these conditions in­
           dividuals can lose control over their own movement and the rate
           of flow may be reduced. It is therefore suegested that the exits
           from each area of spectator accommodation should be so designed
           that the spectators can. if desired or reauired, leave that area in
           8 mmutes o r less.

1.     Scope and Objectives of D iscussions

Mr. H. E. McGee welcom ed the representatives, and str esse d that the Club w ere
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the b est in Europe. Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely a s a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and it w as hoped to expand this side of the Club's a ctiv ities. The Club’s
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

IT WAS AGREED

1.    That, w hilst Designating Orders did not specify time lim its for the issu e of
General Safety C ertificates, it was essen tia l to aim for the Certificate to be issued
by the start of the 1979/80 Season.
                                                              3 > & /
    I

             2.    That, a s the Club wanted to attract representative gam es, the aim should
I            be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.

             3.      That as much work a s possible should be carried out in the c lo se season,
I            bearing in mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
             w ill be more restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah's Witness Rally had
             also to be borne in mind.

             2.    D iscussion on Standing A reas

I           A.     Spion Kop


a            IT WAS AGREED -

            I.    That the siting and angle of the new b a rriers to be installed be the subject
I           of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.


            2*    That the Club consider the installation of sim ple lateral barriers (hot of the
        -           clim b proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
•           central block (but not so a s to obstruct the gangways).

            3.     That, in view of the clearance time of I l f m inutes compared with the
            8 miDutes specified in the Guide, the m eans of escape be discussed in detail
            between D r . Eastwood and the F ire Service (including the r e - s i t t n p o f the gates
            in the existing b a rriers and, possibly the widening of the e x i s t i n g gates and/or
            an increase in their number).

            4.   That the headroom at the North end under the bridge be increased to the
            maximum possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

            5.    That representative parts of the concrete wall and boundary posts and fences
            be tested to the appropriate standards.

            6.    That the condition o f the concrete at the lower end, the height of som e of the
            crush b a rriers and the scoreboard structure*be the subject of detailed discussions
            between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

            7.        That the Club's longer term proposals for the improvement of the m eans of
            e g r e s s be unanimously welcom ed.

            8.    That the maximum capacity of the Spion Kop be determined after the foregoing
            points have been resolved.

I have now receiv ed the detailed comments of a ll of the disciplines
represented on the Working Party.

These have been collated into the attached schedule which, together with
plans, confirm form ally In writing the m atters discussed by the Working
Party with the Club over the s e r ie s of m eetings held so far and which
the County Council feel require attention so a s to secure reasonable
safety at the Ground.

They a r e, of course, individual requirem ents on specific m atters and are                                            ri^iry-
additional to the general requirements s e t out In the specim en form of
General Safety Certificate forwarded to the Club with my letter of
8th Decem ber, 1978, and d iscu ssed at the m eeting held on 13th December,
1978.

A fter the Club has had the opportunity of considering the schedule, perhaps
you would le t m e know which of the requirem ents you feel will be able to
be carried out in the close season .

Should you have any q u eries, M r.                                   of my staff (ext. 422) would

                          Matters reqiiring attention at the
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground, Hillsborough, Sheffield

A.   Spion Kop

     1.        To secure a crowd capacity of 11, 040 people the following work to be
               undertaken:-

     (a)       Improve the width of the exit from the Southern end of the Kop to a
                minimum of 4 .7 m etres throughout. This can be done by providing
                a gate through the perim eter w all in front of the Hillsborough Suite as       \ / y
                indicated on plan no. 1610/11.

     (b)       Increase the headroom of the north east exit to a minimum height of 2 .1         v />
                m etres.

     2.         To secure a crowd capacity of 16, 850 people the following work to be
                undertaken, in addition to item 1:-

     (a )       Provide four gates of at le a st 1 .1 m etre wide from the radial gangways to     /     /
                the perim eter track of the ground area.

     (b)        Provide an additional exit from either the top or side of the Kop of at
                le a st 3 m etres width. It should be so designed that it does not impede
                the e g r e ss from any other gangway, (enclosed for guidance is a form                 ✓
                FS 902).

     3.         The arrangement for crush barriers as produced by the consultant, w hilst
                not complying fully with the guide recommendations, is considered
                adequate if the other requirements are fulfilled. T hese other requirements
                Include the 2 No. radial barriers indicated on Plan 1XA and the provision          /
                of an additional 3m wide e g r e s s route to South-East area, and of gated
                openings to give a c c e s s from the radial gangways to the ground perim eter
                area.

     4.         Make good all broken and spalled concrete terracing.

     5.         Check and carry out any n ecessa ry work to ensure safety of score-board
                building.

     6    .     Replace corroded perim eter rails by construction complying with code
                recommendations.

      7.        Improve e g ress conditions at rear by provision of balustrades, rails,

                   ' Spion Kop Development
      As design of the roof over Spion Kop and the extension of the
terracing proceeds we thought that the Working Party should be
given an early opportunity to comment upon the proposals. At this
stage the roof, although it Will be an impressive structure, does
not hold the individual interests of all members of the Working
Party and we will deal with the roof at a later date. However, we
would like to discuss the parameters surrounding provision for the
disabled, the increased capacity of the Spion Kop and the exit routes
as we see them.
     Enclosed are six prints of our drawings 6648/7, 8, 9, 16 and 17
showing In outline the areas of terracing for the enlarged Spion
Kop together with the exits.
     It was initially thought that the disabled could be accommodated
along the front of Spion Kop between the North stand in front of the
perimeter fence, which would be set back about two metres. There
are disadvantages to this proposal. The advertising boards would
need to be mounted well into the perimeter track level reducing
its width. The disabled would be in the ‘firing line' of mis-cued
                                  3 £ jr




shots on goal but also It would mean that the emergency exit
gates could possibly be obstructed. Providing suitable
protection for them from the weather would also be difficult.
The new roof cannot be proieeterf  ------------ -+-ZJ vzzer
exits projection and a purpose made, low level cover, could
obscure the vision of spectators behind them.
       There are ways round these difficulties and it is not
one hundred percent certain that the disabled will not eventually
be accommodated along the front but the present favour& k proposal
is to lfeave them where they are, in front of the North stand, and
provide them with a cover. The cover may be constructed using a-
timber frame with clear polycarbonate yoof sheets so as not
to obstruct the vision of people •*ai^~be*hind them in the stand.
     The number of wheelchairs attending matches varies but it
probably averages about 33. As you would expect the number
increases to say 40 or more for the attractive matches.  The
ambulant disabled occupy normal seats in the stands.
     To serve fche disabled whether they are placed in front of
the North stand or eventually along the front of Spion Kop we
propose that toilet facilities are provided, possibly beneath
the terracing a<f/acent to the ramp leading down the side of the
North stand gable. We calculate that the new capacity of Solon
Kop will be 21,850, without the disabled along the front. This
is an Increase of 5000 on the present capacity of 16,850.
     The number of exit widths required to evacuate the terrace
in eight minutes is therefore 46.     The unit widths of the exits
are shown on the prints.
     The tunnel exit on the north side will be increased in width
to eight clear units whilst a complete new six unit staircase
is proposed for the south side
       We believe that     drawing^is self explanatory but if
you wish to have a meeting to discuss the proposals we shall
be pleased to attend.

                               Yours sincerely,

                 The O ff ic e r Wbrking Party expressed r e s e r v a tio n s on both o f your s u g g e stio n s
                 fo r the d is a b le d . I f the d isa b led continue to be accommodated in fr o n t o f
                 th e North Stand, they w i l l s t i l l be in the " f i r in g lin e " o f mis-aimed sh o ts
                 and any c le a r sh eetin g over the top o f the area th ey occupy could c o n s t it u t e
                 an unacceptable hazard to persons who might v a c a te the North Stand in an
                 emergency s it u a t io n by clim bing over the fr o n t w a ll of the stand onto the
                 p it c h perim eter. I t i s accepted th a t the means o f escape does not provide
                 fo r t h i s to be done, but i t has to be reco g n ised th a t in p r a c tic e t h i s i s a
                 r e a l p o s s i b i l i t y . The s tr u c tu r a l str en g th o f such a s tr u c tu r e could a ls o be
                 something o f a problem. The oth er su g g e stio n o f accommodating the d is a b le d

                 The su g g e stio n o f the P o lic e r e p r e s e n ta tiv e s was th a t the fro n t area o f the
        I        lower Spion Kop (n ea rest to the North Stand) should have the te r ra c in g
                 l e v e l l e d to provide, sa y , a tw o -t ie r l e v e l lan d in g on which to accommodate

        I        perim eter fence i n fro n t of t h is area could be removed, and the d isa b led
                 could continue to gain a ccess from the ramp between th e Spion Kop and the
                 North Stand as a t present* This would a ls o enable fr e e a ccess by the

I t was accepted th a t only an o u t lin e o f th e r o o fin g proposals has been su p p lied
to d a t e , but th e B uilding A uthority p o in t out th a t i t appears th at the g a b les
are not to be lin e d and thus i t would be com paratively easy fo r them to be
clim bed.

A lso the P o lic e asked me to s t r e s s th a t should any o f the proposed works on
en la rg in g or r o o fin g the Spion Kop take p la ce oth er than in the c l o s e sea so n ,
i t w i l l be a requirement th at the areas concerned w i l l have to be secured to
prevent unauthorised a c c e s s .

4.     Crowd Flow a t the Leppings Lane end o f the Stadium

The P o lic e reported on the contin uin g problems caused by the merging o f s p e c ta to r s
from a l l p a rts o f the Stadium a t the Leppings T.ano end.

I t was agreed th a t i t was d i f f i c u l t to see how t h is could be overcome, as the
p h y s ic a l r e s t r a in t s to a ch iev e t h is could conceivably be more o f a danger than
a llo w in g the p resen t p o s itio n to co n tin u e, but I was requested to r e g i s t e r the

   Dear D i c k ,

                                                                                       Safety Work 1986

                 During the summer inspection Inspector Calvert asked for some
   of the barriers at the Leppings Lane end of the ground to be
   removed so as the allow easier access into the various p e n s .
   Rather than ask Ackroyd & A b b o t t 's sub-contractor to do the work,
   who were at that time working overtime, we instructed George Shaw
JJl Engineering Ltd.                         to have the work completed before the Everton
   game.            This they did and today we have forwarded a certificate
   for the payment of £ 129.92 plus V.A.T. to t h e m . The original of
   the certificate and their invoice is enclosed. Payment should be
    received by them no later than 16 October 1986.

                                                                                           Yours sinc e r e ^ ) ________ /

         SUBJECT:              AT SPORTS GROUNDS - REVISED EDITION
                        OF THE GUIDE TO SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS


         I have gone through the whole of this extremely comprehensive document
         and whilst a considerable amount of the contents is applicable to management
         of the club, engineering problems and fire officers, certain paragraphs
         are worthy of mention in relation to Sheffield Wednesdays Football Ground


         Paragraph 16 relating to crowd pressures. As you are aware the kop has
         had a tendancy at recent matches to produce this wave effect and it is
         necessary that when a large match is anticipated in the future, we should
         ensure that the numbers allowed onto the kop strictly adhere to the capacity
         allowed. It is imperative therefore that the automatic counting system
         is always in working order for 'A' and 'B' category matches, such as the
         visits of Manchester United, where almost capacity crowds can be expected.

         Paragraph 23 onwards lays down the management responsibility very clearly
         and is to be welcomed, since there have in the past, been grey areas as to
         who is responsible for crowd control etc.

         Paragraph 28 recommends the appointment of a safety officer and identifies
         his duties. I can only presume that the safety officer is in fact Mr ---- 1
         although I have never heard him designated as such, and this should be
         clarified with the club.    Furthermore, in the discussion of a central
          control point being designated (other than then police control) one would
          assume that the central control point designated in respect of the Sheffield
         'Wednesday ground would be the video viewing room in the south stand.

          Paragraph 43 relates to records of tests kept and examination of the ground.
          I am not aware that these are kept by the club.

          Paragraph 199 relates to exercises of stewards regarding emergency procedures
          and I am not aware that the club have ever carried out exercises in this
          respect.
          In conclusion, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have complied with the
          guide to a very large extent, more so I would suspect, than the majority
          of clubs in the country, and it is only on minor points as identified above
          where improvements could be made, so far as police procedures are concerned.

remedy then.

   Dear Sir

   SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB
   AND SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

   I refer to your letter dated 13 November 1986.

   Both stadia, so far as the Police are concerned, meet our requirements
   under the 1975 legislation.

   Co-operation afforded by both clubs is very satisfactory with the
   exception of the lack of CCTV facilities at Bramall Lane. It is hoped
   that this can be remedied as soon as possible as it will be a valuable
   asset to us in effectively policing the ground.

   Yours faithfully

                                         ___________
    For the attention of Mr.


    Dear Sir,

    SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

    Thank you for your letter dated 3rd November, 1986, in respect of the above
    Club.

    Please find below my observations in response to outstanding matters.

    An inspection of the ground was carried out on 17th November,                                      1986.        The
    comments appended below do not take into account the numbers of persons using
    individual areas, lateral and radial gangways or units of exit widths, as
    it is assumed that from previous correspondence and documentation that the
    various working parties and committees have adequately dealt with these items.

    MEANS OF ESCAPE IN CASE OF FIRE

    North Stand

    Timber framed and clad buildings are constructed and located under the stand.

    The only reference as to the acceptance is minuted in meeting dated 7-8.85
    in which one large store for bulky items was agreed on a temporary basis.

    There is also no record to indicate whether these buildings have been treated
    with fire retardant paint or solutions. Confirmation is required as to treat­
    ment of these buildings.

             installation, this should be removed immediately.

AUTOMATIC FIRE DETECTION

In 1979 the working party d isc u sse d the p r o v isio n o f automatic f i r e d e te c tio n
in the South Stand.

I t i s recommended th a t such p r o v isio n should be made in a l l areas beneath
the sea ted area o f the stand as soon as p o s s i b le .   The system should a ls o
cover the Tavern Club which has a d ir e c t lin k on to the f i r s t f lo o r corrid or
o f the South Stand.

The automatic d e te c tio n provided should be t i e d in to the e x is t in g f i r e warning
system.

In order th a t persons usin g th e Spion Kop can r e c e iv e e a rly warning o f any
f i r e occurring in the "Stands" Club, i t i s a ls o recommended th at automatic
f i r e d e te c tio n be provided in th a t Club.

EMERGENCY LIGHTING

Spion Kop

The emergency lig h t in g has y e t to be t e s t e d - no t e s t c e r t i f i c a t e r e c e iv e d .

South, North and West Stands

In l e t t e r dated 12th November, 1980, from Eastwood and P a rtn ers, i t was
suggested th a t fo llo w in g t e s t c e r t i f i c a t e s dated 11th August, 1980, a period
o f 5 years should e la p se before r e - t e s t i n g fo r South Stand and 2 years fo r
North and West Stands. As o f today no record appears to e x i s t as to whether
th ese areas have been r e - t e s t e d or th a t th e t e s t c e r t i f i c a t e s to g eth er w ith
maintenance records have ever been r e-p r e se n te d .                 The emergency lig h t in g
system should th e r e fo r e be r e - t e s t e d fo r the whole o f the ground and t e s t
c e r t i f i c a t e s produced. In a d d itio n the whole o f the system should conform
to B.S. 5266.

                  South Stand

                  This stand appears to be well covered with regard to the provision and siting
                  of call points.

                  Indicator Control Panel

              The indicator/control panel is situated within the Police control centre
              between South and West Stand.    Whilst this is reasonable for match days it
              is not considered to be practical for the majority of the time.

              This panel        should be duplicated with   control   at each location which should
              b e :-

              1.      Police control box

              2.      Main office reception area

              FIRST AID AND FIRE-FIGHTING EQUIPMENT
        r
A           The current standard and displacement           of First Aid   fire-fighting   equipment
^           is considered satisfactory.

             GATES

                e sliding gates already in situ in the ground have been accepted by this
               uthority after due consideration and account being taken both of their location
              and the fact that they are of existing construction.     I would wish, however,
            .to point out that it is the view of this Authority that doors required for
             means of escape should open outwards and it is recommended that notice be
             given to the Club to the effect that when any such sliding gates are to be
             replaced then their replacements must open outwards even i f , this involves
             structural work to recess the opening to avoid impinging over footpaths,
               hile the sliding gates remain in use however, they must be immediately avail­
             able for use from the inside by any person should an emergency' situation
             arise. Any method of securing the gates against illegal entry from the outside
             must be by way of a simply operated device not requiring the use of a key,
    i        additional security being afforded by the- presence of a steward who should
             De lamiliar with the emergency evacuation procedures for the ground.

            I I       ^   any queries on these matters please do not hesitate to contact               '
            the Officer concerned.

            Yours faithfully,




            Divisional Command^?

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
received them as yet.

The Police have indicated that they are quite satisfied wit"h the stadium and
have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they receive is very
satisfactory.

The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. I think the letter
is largely self-explanatory but I would particularly like to refer to the
comments which are made in respect of final exit gates. As you can see from the
           *ire Service are concerned about the sl-jdJng gates and have indicated
that as and when they reach the end of their useful life they must be replaced
with outward opening doors. The Fire Service have also produced a drawing (a
copy of which I enclose) to show a better arrangement for securing the sliding
gates against forced entry from the outside during the course of the game. The
rire Service feel that this hook type arrangement will be more easily used in
the event of an emergency than the current locks, about which they are very
concerned.

Would you please let* me have your comments on the Fire Service letter as soon as
possible.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

 Dear Sir,

 In Noveaber 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
 condition of your atadlum having regard to the proviaions of the 1975 Act.   1

with the stadium and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they

The Fire Service have, however, made a nunber of comments and I attach for your
information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February.  Some pointa in the
letter have now been further clarified as follows

(a) The timber b u i M i n g s referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
from the walkways.

(b) As far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they will be
dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

(c) Gates aust be unlocked and stewarded at all times, during matches: if this
cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
particularly like to refer to the comments which are made in respect of final
     ?•**•*   As you can aee from the letter the Fire Service are concerned about

                You will appreciate that to carry out a complete survey of all
                parts of this complex is a long and time consuming job which
                should not be approached in anything other than a thorough
                manner.

*               I have therefore yet to find available diary time for my Officers
                to spend on this site.

                A report will be sent to you after a complete inspection has been
                undertaken.

        •’or the attention of Mr.


    Dear Sire,

    In rcoly to ycur latter datsd l;ith May, 198? rasardins the "Future Administration
    of the Council's Certificating Function" under the Safety of Shorts Grounds Act
    1975 r please find below the observations of this Department.

    1.       With resnect to the schedule detailing a proposed division of responsibilities
              between "authorities it io felt that this should remain along the lines of
             'the dccuncnt issued by the crsvicus certificating authority i.e. South Yorkshire
              County Council, a copy of which is attached.     As this document has steed the
              test of tine with fe:; problems, it is recommended that a neetins of all author­
              ities concerned ce called as see:: as possible in order to discuss the division
              of responsibilities it lays down.

              lihatcvsr tie outcome one area where there •r.ay be a need for emphasis is a
              reference to the fact that all authorities should be more aware of other author-
    I        ities responsibilities and that when considering any proposals all aspects
              Qp the screen guide should be taken into account in orasr tnat full consul
              tafcion car, take place with other interested authorities.

        2. The nmoosal for one annual inspection by the                working   group in conjunction
            with'individual inspections by authorities as             and when    considered necessary
            is agreed with although it is envisaged that               because   of manpower resource
            limitations the degree of central cc-ordir.atior.         referred   to nay cause problems.

             The Fire Authority would wish to carry out such inspections subject to the
             limitations referred to above and under varying conditions at the ground.
             Obviously any adverse comments on crowd safety would be forwarded- to your
             Department.   A.o to the annual inspection, a good time would be at the ena
             or towards the end of a season in order that any necessary work can bo followed
             up befoft the cor.mcncor.ont cf a new season.

        3.   Whilst the situation regarding the status of working group is fully appreciated,
             ibis authority feels that the recognition of the group as a decision making
             bodv by the City Council is imperative if it is to remain effective. As under
             the County Council however, the terms of reference of the group would be within
             the conditions of certification laid down by the City Council, anything beyond
             these terms being referred back via your Department for a Comaittce decision.

                                                                                            0 on t » •*»•

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -                       _
Future Administration of the Council’s Certificating Function

Following a meeting on Tuesday 10th March I have given some further thought to
the above subject.
Many points were raised at the meeting but I think that the general feeling was
that the roles of each Authority involved in the system should be defined
perhaps along the lines adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

                          v                           nr1-nciDal to roles being defined in this way but I should
I have no o                                                    eed that particular Authorities adopt particular
ma^S ^ h f ^ t h e v will be under a duty to consult with other interested parties
where t h ' e L ^ a n o v e r l a p of interest. As I see it the Authority which carries
        n a r t i c u l a r * role will have the responsibility of advising the Council as
Cert if icat ing Autho ri ty on all matters falling within that Lead Authority role.

I have drawn up a draft Schedule which attempts to define Lead Authority roles.
I have ara    P             d f ± intended to be open for discussion and I
woSd  t h e r e f o r e we l c o ^ your comments on it. Would you please also let mekr.ow
If there are any other matters which should be included it. the Schedule.

 Perar a n d Sinstallationrwithin the6^ ^ ^ ^ " ’the^egislation. _ To back up this
 S e c t i o n there should be a number of "during performance" inspections by
 Officers      I think that there is general agreement in relation to du£in°
 performance" inspections as they would highlight the performance of the safety
 system at each stadium whilst it is in operation.


                                                                                                        734690 - Mr.

                                                                  Telex 54243 (Administration & Legal)

                                      - 2-

Perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree of central
co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
fiESt step towards the development of a programme of inspections it might be
appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives from
all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
encountered.

                          .farty" structure I-think ir. is clear from the meeting
Of 10th March that some clariJrication or ics        xs required, it is
reasonably clear from the County Council's records that the working party as
such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
powers. However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
remain with a Committee or Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purposes
Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
myself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
as a forum for discussion.

I take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
to be submitted to the Certificating Authority. I propose that when an
Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with .
my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr.       , who will then make arrangements for the
meeting to take place. An agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr.        will prepare a list
showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
Authority. This list will be circulated as wall.

Would you please consider the points I. have raised and let me have your comments
on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

For the attention of Superintendent Stuart

Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Future Administration of the Council's
 Certificating Function______ ______ ______________________________ _____ _

 Please note that I have arranged a meeting for all Interested parties on
 Thursday 16th July, 1987 at 9.30 a.m. In the Town Hall to discuss the above
 matter further. I hope that the meeting will produce a consensus view on future
 administrative procedures which will form the basis of a report to the General
 Purposes Panel of the City Council. I should emphasise that nodecisions have
 yet been made on this subject and any comments or suggestions which you have
 will be most welcome. I Intend that my report to the Panel will be near
 completion by the end of July and it is, therefore, important that the maximum
 advantage is taken of the meetiog on 16th July.

 This meeting may also provide a useful opportunity to discuss dates for
 inspections of the stadia prior to the beginning of the 1987/88 football season.

 Should the need arise please do not hesitate to contact my Chief Licensing
 Officer, Mr. Bownes on the number given below.

  Yours faithfully,




  Head of Department

Dear Sir

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Future Administration of
the Council's Certificating Function

Thank you for your letter dated 14 May 1987 which I have now
had the opportunity of discussing with Superintendent T
Stuart.

As you rightly point out, there is an overlap of interest in
the matters you outline in the draft, and therefore I fe©i
it would be helpful to have a meeting as soon as possible so
that comments may be made by all parties concerned before
making a final decision regarding this matter.

If I can be of any further assistance prior to the meeting*
please do not hesitate to contact Me.

Yours faithfully

For the attention of Superintendent Stuart


Dear Sir,                                                                                                                        1

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
F u t u r e Administration of the Council's Certificating Function

Following a meeting on Tuesday 10th March I have given some further thought to
the above subject.

Many points were raised at the meeting but I think that the general feeling was
that the roles of each Authority involved in the system should be defined
perhaps along the lines adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

I have no objection in principal to roles being defined in this way but I should
make it clear that if it is agreed that particular Authorities adopt particular
roles then they will be under a duty to consult with other interested parties
where there is an overlap of interest. As I see it the Authority which carries
out a particular role will have the responsibility of advising the Council as
Certificating Authority on all matters falling within that Lead Authority role.

I have drawn up a draft Schedule which attempts to define Lead Authority roles.
I should point out that the draft is intended to be open for discussion and I
would therefore welcome your comments on it. Would you please also let me know
if there are any other matters which should be included in the Schedule.

Moving onto the question of inspections of stadia, this point was also discussed
at the meeting on 10th March. My view is that the existing system of bi annual
limited inspections is no longer appropriate; I feel that one major inspection
per year should be carried out on each stadium which should include all the
areas and installations within the scope of the legislation. To back up this
inspection there should be a number of "during performance" inspections by
Officers. I think that there is general agreement in relation to "during
performance" inspections as they would highlight the performance of the safety
system at each stadium whilst it is in operation.
                                                           Cont

                                                                                           734690 - Mr
                             For tatoptMM enquiries on this matter please ring......................................(STD Code 0742)
                                                      Telex S4243 (Administration & Legal)
Perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree of central
co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it might be
appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives from
all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
encountered.

Moving bn to tne woxuU.g p a r t y structure I cninK i t ts clear trom  ^ecrflg
of 10th March that some clarification of its status is required. It is
reasonably clear from the County Council's records that the working party as
such was actually a decision making body presumably actingunder delegated
powers. However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
remain with a Committee or Sub—Committee (in this case the General Purposes
Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
myself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
as a forum for discussion.

I take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
to be submitted to the Certificating Authority. I propose that when an
Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with
my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then make arrangements for the
meeting to take place. An agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will prepare a list
showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
Authority. This list will be circulated as well.

Would you please consider the points I have raised and let me have your comments
on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

 Yours faithfully,

Future Administration of the Council's Certificating Function.

Dear Sir,
              I refer to your letter dated 1^ May, 1987 .
                                                                                                       ,*r
             So    far as the    'Division o£ Responsibilities between Authorities' is concerned

to consultation being necessary with other authorities*

             I feel that wherever possible the SOSGA 1975 officer working party should meet

as a group and that the meeting should be minuted by the licensing authority.                              This leads

to a good working tDfrlatj-Migiiip n«d all members of the working party. a*»e aware        all the

                                  *       am in general agreement with the 'Divisions of RespoiisiMlit:

allowing for some          'Overlap' in for example, means of escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                                                  «vvoa*<-*   U U -v   ^             v«N            K

I «^ffo note that 'Communications' is not ircluded and this is of particular concern to

the police at stadia.

    y'~L agree   that there should be one major inspection of Mrf* stadia each year by the

officer working party.         So far as 'during performance' visits are concerned, these are

of course constantly monitored by police officers carrying out duties at the groundsc

      I am, as you will have noted from my previous comments in full agreement with your

recommendations at the penultimate paragraph of your letter, the officer working group

having due regard to the 1986 issue of the Guide to Safety at Sports Ground which covers

of course the areas of responsibility.

      Finally, I note, as I understand do the fire service, that the areas of responsibilit

allocated tc the Director of Environmental Health and Consumer Services (Sheffield City

Council) are generally covered by 'Means of escape' and that 'Food aagety and hygeine®

toilet accommodation' are not really matters for the Safety of Sports Ground Act Officer

Working Party.

        Meeting of S.A.S.G.A.G - l6th July, 1987


        M r.       •opened the meeting and stated that the discussions would be divided
        into_four areas

        1.     Definition of Rolls
        2.     Inspections
        3-     Status of Group
               ftonin. Macflinery or the Group


               It was agreed that rolls should be broadly defined and responsibilities
               taken on by the appropriate of the three "lead authorities" i.e. Police,
    /
               Fire and Building Surveyors subject to agreement where overlap occurs.
    V

               A1 contact with the grounds should be through the licensing authority.
J
               Environmental Health would take          a    "general safety roll"    and not be a
               "lead" authority.

        2.     The annual inspection is to be           a joint full inspection to be carried

               D . P . inspections to be done on an individual basis.  Prior arrangements
               to be made with the Police, but not the Club.      The Licensing Authority
               to be informed when an inspection has taken place.

        3.     The meeting was informed that legally the group is essentially an advisory
               authority - only the council can be the ultimate decision making authority,

        4.     Individual authorities to correspond to the sports grounds through the
               licensing authority who will subsequently circulate copies of all letters
               to each "lead" authority.
    V
               Meetings of the group will be held at irregular intervals depending
               on need and can be called by any member of the group.       Individual
               authorities need not attend specific meetings if they have no "interest".

               Agendas will be issued prior to each meeting.

For the attention of Mr.


Dear Sirs,

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 “                                                             .
DRAFT REVISED SAFETY CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS

In reply to your letter dated 7th July re                  the above,     please find below
the observations of this Department:-

Section 3(a)     An additional item agreed with Barnsley and Doncaster Councils
                 in respect of their standard conditions is that the age
                 range of stewards should be 18 - 65 .

Section 10(a) Whilst specified         in    the   green    guide,   it    is   difficult to
                 feaffi'ao how this task can be controlled by stewards.                  This
                 matter should be considered'further.

Section 10(i) Reference should be made to the opening and securing open
              of exits on the intiation of any emergency procedure or
              at the end of a game and to assisting and directing spectators
              out of the exits.

Section 18       Add . . , "The emergency power supply should operate independ­
                 ently of the      main powersupply and come into automatic
                 operation on the failure of the latter and be      capable of
                 maintaining the necessary power output for a minimum period
                 of three hours.

Section 23       Reference to "compressed gas or liquid" should be amended
                 to = . . "flammable liquid or compressed gas (except fire
                 extinguishing apparatus)".

Section 24       Add after "whatsoever"        "whether combustible or not".

Section 28       The old SYCC certificate required that the Police had knowledge
                 of the whereabouts of the doctor.

Section 29       Again   the    old   SYCC   certificate      required     that members    of
                 the press, T.V. and radio were identifiable.
Section 35(d) This requires that the electrical installation be examined
              and a report submitted to the Council every 12 months.
              The same requirement should al30 apply to emergency lighting,
              and fire warning (including P.A.) systems.

Section 35(f) Sub paragraph (iii) requires emergency lighting to be tested
              at least 24 hours prior to an activity. It would be preferable
              that the original requirement     of testing 3 hours before
              an activity be maintained.

Two additional items for consideration are: -

 (i)   That  a competent electrician employed    or retained   by   the Holder
       3hall be present during a specifled activity.

(ii)   The   Holder shall provide and maintain    within the stadium to the
        satisfaction of the Council the access routes for emergency vehicles
        shown on the plans.

SCHEDULE - Interpretation

VJhereas the old SYCC Certificate required certain matters (e.g. fire alarms,
extinguishers etc.) and the maintenance of these to be to the satisfaction
of the Chief Fire Officer, the proposed Certificate nox* requires these
to be to satisfaction of the City Council.

This Department does not foresee this causing      any problems subject     to
espies of the required annual certificates of      test being forwarded     to
us for examination.

If there are any queries on the above matters, please contact Divisional
Officer Grinshaw.

Also enclosed for your information ia a list of sports grounds and indoor
socrts premises within Sheffield and, known to this Department.

Yours faithfully,

             Safety of Sports             1925
             Annual Visit - Sheffield Wednesday' Football Club, Hillborough, Sheffield

             During the annual visit of the above ground, the following observations
             were noted:-

     1.0     KOP

     1.1     The timber ticket hut adjacent to the refreshment bar on the main means of
             escape exit route from the KOP should be removed, since it is causing both
             a high risk and a narrowing of the escape width.

     1.2     A broken concrete post supporting the end of a crush barrier adjacent to the
             tunnel exit at the north    end of the KOP to be removed, and the crush barrier
             be modified to join onto    the end of the new steel supported barrier directly
             adjacent to it.                                                                     J

     1.3     A timber hut at ground level, under the KOP structure should be removed.

     1.4      An additional length of crush barrier is required to be installed adjacent
             to the base of the ramped stairway from the extended terracing. This was
             agreed on site by Dr. Eastwood.

    2.0      WEST STAND

    2.1     Signs over the front parapet wall at the upper level are to be permanently
            secured at the following positions:—

            a)     between seats 1 and 14
            b)     between seats 20 and 28
            c)     between seats 136 and 150

            Binding wire ties are not considered to be satisfactoryfor this purpose.

            Additionally the sign brackets adjacent to seats 62 and 72 are to be
            correctly bent Cor otherwise suitably checked) and secured.

    2.2     R a m water drainage holes through the upper level slab should have a gauze
            inserted so as to inhibit the dropping of missiles onto the crowd below.

   2.3      It is felt that discussion should take place regarding the suitability of
            the gate fastening device at the base of the emergency exit stairway on the
            south end o^jthis stand. The fastening consisting of a patent lockable
            barrel bolt,, cannot easily be unfastened inthe direction of travel, and is
            impossible to be unfastened from the other side.

   3.0      NORTH STAND

   3.1      A broken glass panel in the west gable end should be replaced.

          THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
          SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB, PENISTONE ROAD, SHEFFIELD
          SAFETY CERTIFICATION INSPECTION, 6TH AUGUST, 1987.

          I write with reference to the above and following our recent site meeting

          requested, I would now submit my Department's findings to the "Safety of
          Sports Grounds Advisory Group" and to yourself as Certificating Officer.

          Spion Kop

          1.    An area of the corrugated metal sheeting used as cladding
                to the side of the Kop is corroded and torn.

          2.    It was noted that in some places the stair nosings serving
                radial gangways had become defective.

          3.    At some positions within the new development there is a
                difference in height between a terraced area and radialgangway
                of over 600mm. As such these areas require to be protected by
                a suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.

          4.    Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
                minor repairs. It was agreed, however, that this defect would
                 be adequately controlled by means of "ongoing" maintenance.

           5.   xhe defective rendering to the final exit gate wall requires
                to be repaired„

           North Stand

          -I.   It is important to ensure that the groundman's store beneath
                this stand is not used for the storage of potentially inflammable
                fertilisers or weedkillers.

           Health and Safety - General

           1 . At a number of points within the standium various pieces of
                abandoned builders waste were readily available for use as
                projectiles by the crowd. Such material should be collected
                and suitably disposed of.

           2.    The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate
                 ilrst aid equipment for the treatment of spectators should they
                 become ill or injured within the sports ground.

           3.    In order to ensure that the football club fully discharge their
                 duty to supply an adequate number of first aiders, I would require
                 that a minimum of 12 be employed to render first aid to sepctators
                 during an activity. If the club continue to use the voluntary
                 services of the St. John's Ambulance Brigade, then it would be
                 necessary to formalise their relationship with them in order to
                 ensure adequate deployment.
                                                                                 DOCUMENT Mo.   U l
                                   f V 3




4.   I am to understand that the club is now prepared to appoint,
     in writing, a safety officer of adequate status and authority.
     I would propose that he has the functions described in the draft
     safety certificate conditions.

Conclusions

During the inspection of the football club's standium it became obvious
that the stands and associated areas are subject to excellent standards of
maintenance and upkeep.   Bearing in mind the size of the premises the

impressed with the level of ground management being maintained.

I would advise that the identity and role of the Ground Safety Officer be
formalised in accordance with the green guide and without undue delay.

        REPORT OF THE HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO THE GENERAL
        PURPOSES PANEL

        SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - THE CURRENT SITUATION AND PROPOSALS FOR THE
        FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNCIL'SCERTIFICATION FUNCTION

        Introduction

        The Panel will recall that on 1st April 1986 the City Council inherited from the
        South Yorkshire County Council the role of certificating Authority under the
        1975 Act.   The Act itself is basically aimed at ensuring adequate standards of
        safety at designated stadia; there are three of these in Sheffield at the moment
        - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield United Football. Club., and the
        Owlerton Sports Stadium. A detailed report on the Act and its application in
        Sheffield was submitted to the Panel on 6 th May 1986.

        The Current Situation

        The Panel at its meeting in May 1986 identified several main areas for further
        investigation.

        Firstly it was accepted at the time that the broad outlines of the
        administrative system organised by the County Council should be continued for
         the time being. This system has now been reviewed and the proposed
(       reorganisation is detailed later in this report.

        The Panel also asked that the Health and Safety Executive be kept informed of
        al1 natters relating to sports ground safety and that the Association of
        Metropolitan Authorities also be asked about the HSE's involvement. As far as
        keeping the HSE informed of safety developments at the stadia the Executive made
        it fairly plain that they would not make any comments. The practice was
        therefore discontinued. The involvement of the AMA in the HSE issue has been
        somewhat forestalled by action at central Government level' to review the HSE't
        relationship with local authorities; this review was announced in the
        Government's reply to the Popplewell Report but no results of that review have
        yet been received. Fortunately, however, the Council's Director of Health and
        Consumer Services has permitted his Officer's to provide ahealth and safety
        input into the decision making process in relation to safety of sports grounds«
        This substitution, therefore, temporarily covers the absence of an input from
        the HSE.

         The Panel also made reference to consultation on the safety of sports grounds
,       policy with the other District Councils in South Yorkshire. Unfortunately,
         attempts at arranging consultation meetings have been unsuccessful to date. IE
         is proposed to try again to organise some consultations in the fairly near
         future, perhaps when the Certification system has settled down in each area.

        The drafting of new safety certificate conditions in consultation with the
        Council's advisers has been progressing steadily and new draft conditions are
        currently under consideration by those advisers. It is hoped that the new
        conditions will be submitted to Che Panel at its meeting in October for final
        approval     ■j^T*  - ..                                           «

        As to the question of charging fees under the 1975 legislation, it should be
        be made clear, that such fees are only payable on the grant of a Certificate.
        It is anticipated that if the Panel approves the new Certificate conditions a
        Certificate will then be issued to Sheffield United and at that ciae it is
        proposed to deal with the question of fees.

Future Administration of the Council's Certificating Function

Following a thorough review of the legislation it has become deir that a
detailed administrative system needs to be established in connection with the
Council's Certificating function. Discussions on this matter have been underway
for some time with the Police, the Fire Service, the Council's Building
Surveyor and the Director of Health and Consumer Services on the establishment
of such a system.

Accepting that the Council as the Certificating Authority will act on the- basis
of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service) the question arises as to how

an Officer Working Party which was apparently used as a forum for discussion
between Officers prior to the final formulation of advice to the Council* That
particular working party also appeared to have had some decision making powers.

As it is essential that meetings take place due to the potential overlap of
requirements in many areas, all the Authorities and Officers have now agreed
that it would be appropriate to establish a revised form of the working party to ^
perform a similar function for the City Council. It is recommended that the
'Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group'* (which would consist of
representatives from the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's
Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services), would function as
a forum for discussion between Officers; its most regular use would probably be
the discussion of items of advice to the Council before they are f i n a l l y
fornulated by the appropriate Authority. Meetings of the Group would be held at
the request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the Head @f
Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a lisf;
of Items to be discussed. At the conclusion of the meeting a further.list of
items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be taken by each
Authority would be noted. It is then anticipated that detailed written advice
would be provided by each discipline and be acted upon as appropriate.

In addition the Head of Administration and Legal Department will keep copies @£
all relevant correspondence which will be available to all participants in the
Group.                                                           9

Under the old County Council administrative structure the different Authorities    J j


represented in their working party had fairly clearly defined roles within which
to operate. Although it can be seen that there is some merit in this idea the
areas of potential overlap of responsibility are quite extensive in dealing with
sports grounds. However it appears that the various Authorities and Officers
wish for some definition of roles and the following have been agreed:-

Authority                                       Area of Responsibility

The Ihillding Surveyor                  All matters relating to the structure of
                                        stadia including crush barriers, wallss
                                        etc.

South Yorkshire County Fire Service     Fire precautions, fire alarms, means of
       V-                               escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                        capacity.

South Yorkshire Police                  Stadiun policing, evacuation procedures,
If-:is anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department would have an
input to the Advisory Group on (a) aspects of general safety; (b) the general
safety management of stadia; (c) various special items such as first aid
requirements-. It will be appreciated that these areas of responsibility are not
      stive but it is anticipated that any areas of doubt will be dealt w i t r n y
          ins at advisory group meetings.

Inspections

Moving on to a matter of more general policy it has been suggested .that one
large scale inspection per stadium should be carried out by the Group backed up

This proposal is in line with both the Popplewell Report and with licensing
practice in other areas.

Delegations

There is also a further question to be dealt with at this stage and that relates
to the day to day decision making required for the running of the Certification
System. At the moment decision making powers rest with the Panel but this, is a
highly impractical arrangement which needs to be reviewed urgently. It seems •
that as an interim measure all routine matters could be delegated to Head of
Administration and Legal Department with other matters remaining at the
discretion of the Panel.  It is proposed that when the revisedCertificate
Conditions are in force then the delegation will be much more closely defined.
Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment with the current Certificate of
Conditions.

Recommendations

The panel is recommended to:-

(a)   Note the current situation;

(b)   Approve the revised administrative system detailed in this report includiag
      the establishment of the "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group".

(e)   Delegate to the Head of Admiaistratcm and Legal Department authority to
      deal with all routine matters in connection with the Administrative System*

   Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Gate Release Devices

    I refer to your letter of 19th August and the enclosed plans of a proposed gate
    release device.

    The proposed device has been discussed by the various Authorities at some length
    and it has now been suggested that^erhapsk prototype device could be fabricated
    anA fitted to one of the gates for testing purposes. It has also been mentioned
    that with some modifications the proposed device could also be used for the
    sliding gates at Sheffield United Football Club*

    I look forward to hearing from you with your comments on this matter.

    Yours faithfully.

STATUTORY GUIDANCE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES OH INSPECTIONS TO BE
CARRIED OUT UNDER SECTION 10B OF THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT
1975


The following guidance is given by the Secretary of State in
pursuance of section 10B(2) of the Safety of Sports Ground Act
1975 (as inserted by section 25(1) of the Fire Safety and Safety
of Places of Sport Act 1987).


General
1.   The local authority should be satisfied that inspections
under this guidance are carried out by a person or persons
qualified for that purpose.
Scope of inspection
2.    Inspection of the ground should, where practicable, include
inspection of the following certificates of testing and records
as required under the terms and conditions of the safety
certificate to be kept by the holder and/or submitted to the
local authority.
(a)     any certificate covering testing of
(i) strength/loading tests carried out on crush barriers, guard
rails, hand rails, balustrading, walls or fences;
(ii) strength, stability of buildings or other structures;
(iii) inspections and condition of electrical installations.

(b)     records of the following
(i)     spectator attendances;
(ii) accidents involving spectators;
(iii) maintenance and other inspections of buildings, components
     and installations, together with identified deficiencies and
     recorded remedial measures taken;
(iv) tests and checks on emergency lighting, public address
     system, fire fighting equipment, fire warning system (if
     installed);
(v)     emergency evacuation procedures and steward training
        sessions.




                                   ED
                                f-Z£




3.   Thm inspection of the ground should normally include
inspection of the following items:-
(a) any part of the ground where an accident or incident
resulting in serious injury to spectators has occurred since the
last inspection?

(b) any recorded defect or deficiency which has arisen since the
last inspection and which, in the opinion o f the inspecting
officer would be likely to lead to an accident which could result
in serious injury to spectators;

(c) major remedial work carried out since the date of the last
inspection to ascertain that it has been satisfactorily carried
out;

(d) all public stairways for their general condition, slip
resistance, condition of hand-rails (see also (j) below), trip
hazards especially at the head of stairways, adequacy of lighting
and structural fire separation;

(e) all egress routes used by the public, including emergency
exit routes, for obstructions, operation of exit gates, adequacy
of sign-posting and lighting, presence of any uncleared litter;

(f) fire fighting equipment and fire warning system (if
installed);
(g)   for the presence of any accumulation of litter,

(h) the emergency lighting system including any generator or
batteries
(i)   first-aid facilities and equipment;
(j) 10% of any crush barriers, balustrading and hand-rails for
overr signs of weakness which might signal the need for further
testing,, remedial action or (additional) restriction on the
number cf spectators allowed to occupy that part of the ground;
                                                                    )
(k) 10% of the terraces or viewing slopes for general surface
condition, even-ness and slip resistance;
(1)   anchorage and fastening of 10% of any fixed seating.

(m)   any provision for the disabled.
Where the inspection of a sample as in paragraphs (j), (k) and
(1) reveals matters giving rise to serious concern for the safety
of spectators, the authority should go on to inspect all the
crush barriers etc, terracing or seating in that part of the
ground where the sample indicated that there were deficiencies.

Testing of equipment
4.   Tests should if possible be carried out to confirm that the
following is in working order:-
                                f-^-7

(a)   lighting, particularly on stairways and exit routes;
                   ->
(b)   emergency lighting;
(c) public address system, including the proper functioning of
zoning where this facility is part of the requirements of the
safety certificate;
(d)   fire warning system (if installed);
(e) 10% of any metering system for recording the admission of
spectators to parts of the ground.




Home Office
25 November 1987
Supplementary advic* and explanatory notes to the Statutory
Guidance to local authorities given by the Secretary of State
under section 10B(2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

Introduction
1.   The following advice does not fora part of the Statutory
Guidance given under section 10B of the 1975 Act. The following
advice is given in good faith but it should be remembered that
only the courts can rule authoritatively on interpretation of
points of law.
Objective of Inspections
2.   The object of the inspections is to monitor the suitability
of the terms and conditions of the safety certificate (where
issued) in the light of any change in the condition of the ground
and secondly, to assist local authorities in enforcing compliance
with the terms and conditions of the safety certificate or other
notice served on the ground occupier.
3.   Local authorities may wish to note that the inspection is
not intended to shift responsibility for spectator safety away
from the holder of any safety certificate or ground occupier, but
rather to help see that he succeeds in achieving (and
maintaining) the safety standards intended to be set by any
certificate for the number of spectators authorised to enter the
ground for a specified activity.

General
4.   As the size, age, configuration, condition and usage of
designated sports grounds as well as the attitude of management
can give rise to different inspection needs, the discretion of
local authorities to carry out more frequent or more extensive
inspections than is laid down by section 10B of the 1975 Act is
not restricted. The requirements of the Statutory Guidance have
been set at what is seen as the desired minimum likely to achieve
the objective described above leaving authorities free to add to
the content of the inspections or increase their frequency
according to locally determined needs. In this context local
authorities may wish to bear in mind that inspections carried out
under section 10B of the 1975 Act are in addition to, not a
substitute for those required to be carried out under the terms
and conditions of the safety certificate by or on behalf of the
holder.
Inspection frequency
5.   As section 10B(3) of the 1975 Act stipulates that an
inspection should take place of a "designated" ground at least
once every twelve months, this frequency must be observed even if
the issue of a safety certificate is delayed. Where a safety
certificate has not been issued, the inspections carried out
prior to its preparation and issue should be such as to fulfil
the requirements of the Statutory Guidance. Once a safety
certificate has been issued at least one further inspection of
 the ground should be carried out either:-
 within a year of its issue, or

 within a year of the last inspection, whichever is the earlier.

 Thereafter, inspections should take place at least annually from
 the date of the last inspection.

 Where an inspection of a sports ground takes place at the
 discretion of the local authority for some other reason, for
 example as a result of proposed alterations or an application for
 amendment to the safety certificate, that inspection can be
 regarded as an inspection carried out under section 10B of the
 1975 Act provided the criteria of the Statutory Guidance are met.
 Inspection Team

 6.   The Statutory Guidance allows the local authority to
 determine how best to arrange and effect inspections under
 section 10B of the 1975 Act and does not stipulate that they
 should be carried out by a particular professional discipline.
 As it is nonetheless important that inspecting officers are
 qualified for that purpose, the guidance places an onus on the
 local authority to be satisfied on this account.  (The Guide to
 Safety at Sports Grounds (paragraph 36) envisages that
 inspections arranged by ground management will be carried out by
 someone who is professionally qualified. Local authorities may
 wish to consider whether inspecting officers should also be
 professionally qualified.)

 7.   Local authorities are also asked to bear in mind the
potential advantages of a team approach to inspections under the
Statutory Guidance and the role of the fire authority, building
authority and the police. Local authorities in London and
metropolitan counties may therefore wish to arrange at least one
inspection per year to be carried out with a representative of
    fire authority in attendance. Elsewhere, local authorities
will no doubt wish to consider inclusion of a member of the fire
service as well as a representative of the building authority.
Local authorities may also wish to consult the Chief Officer of
Police so that the opportunity can be given for a police officer
to attend at least one inspection each year.   (It is not intended
that these considerations should interfere with any internal or
locally agreed arrangements between the local authority, fire
authority, building authority, police and any other agency with
an interest in safety at the ground.)
Scope of Inspections

8.    Where possible all the items listed in paragraphs 3 and 4
of the Statutory Guidance should be inspected and tested, it is
recognised however that there may be occasions when one or more
of these elements cannot, for some reason, be inspected. For
this reason there is a degree of discretion within paragraphs 2 -
 4 of the Statutory Guidance. In this way it is hoped to avoid
the situation where the local authority has to pay repeated
visits to a ground in order to comply with the Statutory
                           6
Guidance.
9.   The Statutory Guidance does not require that an inspection
should take place at any particular time so the local authority's
discretion to carry out an inspection whilst the ground is in use
is not restricted. An •’in-use" or "during performance"
inspection could therefore constitute part of the inspection
required by section 10B of the Act even though it might not be
sufficient (having regard to the requirements of the Statutory
Guidance) to be an inspection itself.
Records -                                         ’
10. Local authorities will doubtless need to keep a record of
all inspections carried out under the Statutory Guidance and may
wish to consider whether a copy of any report/record should be
sent to the holder of the safety certificate. Local authorities
are also asked to consider affording a reasonable opportunity for
any such report to be made available for inspection, if so
requested, by members of the public.

1.0   Spion Kop

1.1   The timber ticket hut adjacent to the refreshment bar on the main
      means of escape exit route from the KDP should be removed, since
      it is causing both a high risk and a narrowing of the escape
      width.                                                       [

1.2   A broken concrete post supporting the end of a crush barrier
      adjacent to the tunnel exit at the north end of the KOP to be
      removed, and the crushbarrier  bemodified to joinonto the end
      of the newsteel supportedbarrier directlyadjacent    to it.               I

1.3   A timber hut at ground level, inder the KDP structure should be
      removed.                                                       j

1.4   An additional length of crush barrier is required to be installed
      adjacent to the base of the ramped stairway from the extended
      terracing. This was agreed on site by Dr. Eastwood.

1.5   An area of the corrugated metal sheeting used as cladding to the
      side of the Kop is corroded and tom.

1.6   It was noted that in some places the stair nosings serving radial
      gangways had become defective.                                                     '

1.7   At some positions within the new development there is a
      difference in height between a terraced area and radial gangway
      of over 600mm. As such these areas require to be protected by a
      suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.

1.8   Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
      minor repairs. It was agreed, however, that this defect would be
      adequately controlled by means of "ongoing" maintenance.            ___

1.9   The defective rendering to the final exit gate wall requires to
      be repaired.

2.0   North Stand

2.1   A broken glass panel in the west gable end should be replaced.

2.2   The step between seats 12 and 13 on row 43 is loose and should be
      correctly bedded down.

2.3   It is important to ensure that the groundman's store beneath this
      stand is not used for the storage of potentially inflammable
      fertilisers or weedkillers.

3.0   West Stand

3.1   Signs over the front parapet wall at the upper level are to be
      permanently secured at the following positions

      a) between seats 1 and 14
      b) between seats 20 and 28
      c) between seats 136 and 150.
       Binding wire ties are not considered to be satisfactory for this
       purpose.

       Additionally the sign brackets adjacent to seats 62 and 72 are to
       be correctly bent (or otherwise suitably checked) and secured.

3.2    Rain water drainage holes through the upper level slab should
       have a gauze inserted so as to inhibit the dropping of missiles
       onto the crowd below.

3.3    It is felt that discussion should take place regarding the
       suitability of the gate fastening device at the base of the
       emergency exit stairway on the south end of this stand. The
       fastening consisting of a patent lockable barrel bolt which
       cannot easily be unfastened in the direction of trave1, andis
       impossible to be unfastened from the other side.

4.0    Miscellaneous Points

4.1    At a number of points within the stadium various pieces of
       abandoned builders' waste were readily available for use as
       projectiles by the crowd.  Such material should be collected and
       suitably disposed of.

4.2    The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate
       first aid equipment for the treatment of spectators should they
       become ill or injured within the sports ground.

4.3    The provision of qualified first aiders is being reviewedat   the
       moment; it is felt that the existing arrangements require
       formalisation. The Club's views on this point are sought.

               Safety of Sports Grounds Act
               Stewarding at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.i
               Hillsboroughi Sheffield

                   I am advised by a member of my staff, who has attended recent games, that
                   there has been a lack of effective stewarding on the Kop, resulting in
                   the crowd occupying the radial gangways as additional standing areas,
                   throughout the games.

                   Although it is appreciated that these games were important Cup-ties and,
                   therefore, attracted increased crowd capacities, stewarding must be of a
                   quality and of such numbers as to maintain these gangways free from
                   congestion during performances.

                   It is also understood that the turnstile capacity on the Penistone Road
                   frontage was insufficient, and that many of the spectators were still
                   entering the ground up to 15 minutes after the kick-off.

                   The combination of late arrival and ineffective stewarding could lead to
                   dangerous occurances.

                   It is considered that the Club should be made aware of these matters and
                   be required to confirm that stewarding will be made available to keep these
                   areas clear.

                   This is possibly a matter that should be raised at the next meeting of the
                   Working Party, so that police and fire authority comments may also be sought.

                 Means of Escape in Case of Fire

                 North Stand

                                 With the exception of a small hut and the steel
                 clad groundsman's accommodation, which are both
                  located under the ramp and not the stand,                                                                      the timber
                  clad buildings have been removed.
                                  We believe that the reference in the minutes
                  dated 7 August,                              19 85 was to storage facilities and
                  not to buildings.

     removed so that the width of the exit route is not
     reduced.
     b)      This item has already been dealt with in our
      letter dated 15 January.
      c)     Some of the concrete terrace steps have been
      repaired but, as has always been accepted,      the
      repairs will continue to be a regular maintenance
      job.
      d)     The intention of the mesh was not to prevent
      people from climbing onto the steelwork but to act
      as a guard preventing spectators damaging and
      possibly loosening the rear sheeting.
             We disagree that spectators climb onto the
      steelwork in large numbers although we do not deny
      that the police have,       at some matches, had to tell
      a few spectators not to sit on the steelwork.
             The cost of erecting a full height fence
      would be several thousands of pounds.        The Club is
      not at present contemplating that magnitude of
      expenditure just to protect a few spectators from
      their own foolish b e h a v i o u r .
      e)     There are four or five lengths of barrier
      where the drop in front is just over one metre,
      but as far as we are aware this has not created
      any hazard.       In fact to the contrary, because
      people can leave the ground by going under the
      barriers onto the lateral gangway.        This is a
       common feature of most league grounds.
             The welding is performing well and it seems
       that any additional vertical support is
       unnecessary.      However, the welding can be inspected
       at regular intervals to make sure that it con­
       tinues to hold the mesh securely.

      f)    Exit gates are unlocked before spectators enter
      the ground.     The keys then remain in the possession
      of the steward (s), given the responsibility of
      unlocking the gates, until after the end of the
      match and all spectators have left the ground.

      West Stand

      a)    Do we understand correctly that the
      reference to 'timber framed and clad units          is to
      the bar fittings at first floor level?          If so, then
      those fittings were part of the original construction
      for which Building Regulations Approval has been
      granted.     There has not been any previous comment
      about the presence of the bar fittings in that stand
      or other stands.       We do not consider that they
      present a hazard.
      b)     This item has already been dealt with in our
       letter dated 15 J a n u a r y .

       South Stand
       a)    (i)   we note the comment about the doors and
       this point has been dealt with under the regular
       procedures of obtaining a Fire Certificate under
       the Fire precautions Act of 1971 for the offices.
       Fire Officer            "   ”       ^ as been dealing with

       the matter.
           (ii)          We see the principle behind the creation
       of fire compartments.         That is sensible.   Sealing
       off the windows is not difficult but the provision
       of ducting to the south wall is, and furthermore
       very expensive.       A major exercise such as providing
       ducting would by necessity have to wait until the
       redevelopment of the South stand in 1991.

           (iii)         We agree that stored materials should be
      removed from stairways and exit routes.            There is a
      particular problem outside the kitchen area, at
      ground floor level, but the caterers have been asked
      to clear that particular area well before the public
      are admitted on match days.
      b)       (i)       It was agreed in 1979 that the fans
      ventilating the lounges at first floor level should
      be fitted with intumescent grilles with smoke
      controlled shutters.            Those grilles and shutters
      were fitted although we see that two recently
      installed fans do not appear to have similar grilles
      and shutters.           As the form of fire protection from
      those lounges has already been agreed with the Fire
      Service, the Club are not prepared to have ducting
      installed,although the new fans should perhaps be
      fitted with intumescent grilles and smoke controlled
      s hu t t e r s .
              (ii)       A close inspection of the gas supply pipe ­
      work in the five bars revealed that four bars have
      valves fitted to the feed pipe or to the appliance
      when there is only one appliance in the bar.                The
      pipework in the bar nearest to the Spion Kop has
      been replaced recently but without a valve.
                         However,   there is a master valve, at
      ground floor level, which isolates the gas supply
      to the whole of the first floor.             That valve was
      installed at the request of the Fire Service in
      1980.
            (iii)            We confirm that all the timber facing onto
      the public circulation areas was treated with an
       intumescent paint during the work carried out in
       1980.         Since then the walls have been re-decorated

      but this does not reduce the effect of the
      intumescent paint underneath.
            (iv)          We cannot understand this comment because
      the paint store was constructed in its present
      position on the advice of the Fire Officer.              A
      special       'non-sparking'   light fitting was even
      installed on his recommendation.              It is not contem­
      plated to move the store again after spending money
      to build the store in its present position.
              (v)    We do not consider that the two laminate
      covered toilet kiosks present a hazard.              As for the
      wooden cupboards,       they have been on the first floor
      for many years and no previous adverse comments
      have been made by the Fire Service about their
      presence.
             (vi)     We agree that the holes round the cables
      should be plugged with an appropriate fire resisting
      material.
            (vii)     As far as we are aware all doors leading
      onto the first floor and ground floor circulation
      areas were provided with 25mm rebates and the doors
      made up to a nominal one hour standard.              That work
      was done in 1979-80.
           (viii)     We agree that the spaces above toilet
      accommodates should not be used for storage but
      believe that the Club have now removed the stored
      materials.

      c)      We believe that clinbing over the existing low
      wall does not present any difficulty in the event
      of an emergency.        Spectators will go over the wall
      whether there are gates or not.               We do not consider
      that the installation of gates is necessary.

     d)       Escape through the rear of the stand has always
     been accepted by the Officer Working Party.       Further­
     more, it has been readily accepted with the
     protection which has been provided so far to the
      escape routes.


      Automatic Fire Protection

              We will suggest to the Club that proposals
      should be put forward for the provision of a fire
      detection system but the system is not likely to be
      installed until the maj or re-development of the South
      stand which is planned for 19 91

      Emergency Lighting

              Testing of the emergency lighting system is
      being organised and we will be contacting the Fire
      Service in the next day or so to agree a date and
      time for carrying out the test.
           The testing of the general electrical circuits
      will also be organised over the next few weeks and
      a current IEE Certificate produced.

      Fire Alarms
              The Club was told by the Fire Service to put
      the call points in the bars in the stands.      Moving
      the call points again is out of the question.

       Inidcator/Control Panel

               The Officer working Party was asked,   at the
       time of installation, where the indicator/central
       panel should be placed.     The Club was told that it
       should be located in the Police control centre,
       where it is now.     No duplicate panel was asked for
       and it is not considered that one is necessary.

        Gates
                The comments about the gates are noted.


        The Club have expressed to us their increasing c on ­
cern that with the introduction of each new member of the
Fire Service to the Officer Working Party new or
different recommendations are put forward by that officer,
which in some cases openly contradict the recommendations
offered by his predecessors.           Whereas we agree that    many
of the observations and recommendations are of a
 subjective nature the Club cannot be expected to continue
 spending money on matters which are purely a matter of
 personal opinion.           Some consistency in the comments
 offered by members of the Officer Working Party would be
 a p p r e c ia t ed .

Dear Sir,

Do y o u provide the best standards of Ambulance Care for the large u m b e r of

Employees and Members of the Public whilst they are on your premises?

Major Sporting Events have always relied heavily on the resources which are
provided by the V o lu n t a r y First Aid Organisations.

We acknowledge the very valuable contribution which the St John Ambulance
and British Red Cross Society make. There are, however, areas where the
level of care which we can provide, of necessity, exceed those which can be
provided by the Voluntary Societies. These include Advanced Ambulance Aid,
Treatment   of   Fractures   with   the   most   modern   equipment   available
(particularly Spinal     injuries).   Stabilisation   of patients with lead
Injuries,    Intubation,     Intravenous    Infusion,    Cardiac    Monitoring,
Defibrillation and the Administration of Drugs.

Can we be of assistance to you ? If so, get in touch with Don Trueman on
Rotherham (0703) 828820 to discuss your requirements.

If we can’t help with your im m e d ia te r e q u i r e m e n t s , please place this letter
on file for any future occasion when we nay be able to assist.

 1   am sure that you will be more than happy with any the facilities which we
 are able to offer.

Yours faithfully,




 A. P a g e .

   Dear Sirs,

   SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB -
   SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUND ACT

   Following the inspection at the above sports ground on 19th May 1988, the following
   items are forwarded for your attention.

    Spion Kop
       Rubbish is accumulating under the new structure and requires removing.

.(£ South Stand
       a)   The extractor fan from the laundry has an accumulation of fluff and requires
            cleaning.

       b)   The new Sponsors Lounge on the first floor has been fitted                   *
            fan that breeches the fire resisting wall. At the time of the
            could not be determined whether it is fitted with an automatic heater detector
            operated shutter or not. If not, some such device will be required.

       West Stand                                                                                     "                               .
       There were only two small EXIT signs situated above the exits from the covered
       walkway which could not be seen from the extremities of the waUcway. As this
       stand is used by visiting fans it is recommended that larger signs be fixed,
       in a more prominent position.                                                 '



                                                                                                   *1 * ‘/-iff.

Mr.



Fire Safety
It is recommended where gas cookers are used in the snack bars that a fire blanket
be provided.
Should you require any further information concerning these matters, please do not
hesitate to contact me.

              Spion Kop Development

              1 . The pylon situated to the left-hand side of the kop was not suitably
                  protected from unauthorised access and climbing.

              2.       To several locations around the kop, accumulations of associated
                       builders wastes and stonework that could easily be obtained for use as
                       projectiles were noted.

              3        At some positions within the new development, there is a difference in
                       height between a terraced area and radial gangway of over 600mm. I
                       would advise that these areas be protected by a suitably constructe
                       pedestrian guardrail.

              4        An area of stair nosing was found to have become defective upon the
                       "new" part of the spion kop and a similar defect was located upon the
                       older radial gangway.

               5.      some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of minor
                       repairs.
               6.      A loose rainwater pipe and length of guttering were located to one of
                       the Penistone Road turnstiles.

               7.       to area of glazing serving one of Che Penistone Ro.d turnstile huts
                        has been broken.

                  8.    The club might consider the now combustible nature °f much of.-the
                        vegetation situated immediately behind the spion kop and take the
                        appropriate remedial action.

                  9.    The rendering to the entrance gate side wall was still found to be in
                        a loose and defective condition.

                  West Stand                                                                                       -       -
                        In   a number of cases terrace nosings require to be repaired


                                                                                        /Contd.
                                                                                                          liB iiftl® :
      2.   A number oE seats were defective and require to be renewed or
           repaired.

      3.   To the left-hand side of the stand, some pieces of old barbed wire
           were found to project over a walkway at head height.

Stewards must at all times wear their official waistcoat on duty.

Stewards must report for duty no later than 1% hours before kick-off time.
Any Steward reporting for duty after this tire cannot be guaranteed a job.
This provision may be subject to amendment in the event of major fixtures

Whilst every endeavour will be made to allocate the ssre job throughout
the season, you will be expected to carry out any alternative duty as
directed by the Chief Steward or his deputy, or an official of the Club.

Duties at specific locations:

(a)    Exit gates - to be manned at all tirres throughout the match and
       opened at the specified tiae to allcw general exit and in the
       event of an emergency.

(b)   Car park (south stand). Stewards must ensure thatthe one way
       system operates, the free passage i s maintained for motor vehicles
       and supervise car parking.

(c)   Stands. Stewards are responsible for ensuring spectators sit in
       correct seats (as shown on tickets). Where this is not the case,
       they have a responsibility in the first instance for requesting
       them to co so and only if there is a refusal should they
       contact the Police for assistance.   Stewards are also responsible
       for ensuring that gangways and exits ■ar=_ kept _tle=r. ’ -

General Duties:

(a)   Preventing, so far as possible, standing on seats, and the clirriing
      of fences and other structures. Where by virtue of the scale of the
       incident Stewards are unable to comply with this requirement,
      they should without delay report the matter to the nearest Police
      Officer, or, if no Police Officer is present, to the Chief Steward
      or designated club official.

(b)   Where more than one Steward is on duty at the s e r e gangway, one
      Steward is to remain at the bottom of the steps until at least
      10 minutes after kick-off, or until any 'rush' is over, to ensure
      that the spectator uses the correct gangway and to remove any
      ticket stubs.

(c)   No gangway Steward is to sit down until at least 15 minutes after
      kick-off, and then only if there is a vacant seat on the end of
      a row in the immediate vicinity of the gangway - all other Stewards
      must sit as close to their allocated position as possible at tfie end
      of a row. No more than two Stewards ray sit together.

(d)   Stewards are reminded that they should remain on duty until the final
      whistle and until their area is clear. The practise of Stewards
      leaving their positions before the final whistle will not be tolerated.
      Only in exceptional circumstances (and with the permission of the Chief
      Steward) will a Steward be allowed to leave early. Except in an
      emergency Stewards should not leave their place of duty without consent
      of the Chief Steward or. senior Police Officer present who should, if
      it is considered necessary, arrange for a replacement.

              are either creating a disturbance or whose presence is likely to
              create a disturbance - this covers a wide' range of activities
              contrary to ground regulations.

       (a)   At the end of the match Stewards are responsible for ensuring

             to Police Officers and Stewards that emergency evacuation
             procedures are in force. Stewards will take up positions at
             their exits and gates.

       (b)   In the event of an emergency evacuation being necessary, an oral
             message will be passed by the Police Officer in charge giving

Travelling First Aid Kits
The contents of small travelling first aid kits (for use, in some circumstances, in
establishments where there is dispersed working, or by employees working away
from their employer’s establishment or by self-employed persons) may vary accord­
ing to the circumstances in which they are to be used. However, items included
should always be among those specified above. In general, the following items should
be sufficient:
   a. six individually wrapped sterile adhesive dressings;
   b. one medium-sized sterile unmedicated dressing (approx 10 cm X 8 cm;
       examples of suitable dressings currently available are the Standard Dressings
       No 8 and No 13 BPC);
   c. one triangular bandage (this should, if possible, be sterile; if not, a sterile
       covering appropriate for serious wounds should also be included);
   d. six safety pins.
Supplementary equipment
The approved code states that where first aiders and occupational first aiders are
employed in an establishment the employer should provide appropriate carrying'
equipment for them to use. In addition it is recommended that where such
equipment is provided, blankets should be stored alongside the equipment and in
such a way as to keep them free from dust and dampness.
Protective Clothing and Equipm ent
Protective clothing and equipment should be provided near the first aid materials
where there is a possibility that the first aider or occupational first aider might need
protection to avoid becoming a casualty him self while administering first aid.
Protective clothing and equipment should always be properly stored and checked
regularly to ensure that it remains in good condition.                      •    f )

  Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                    Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                               Barrier Testing 1988

                 Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, Lae fourth
  part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
  The barriers tested were n u m b e r s 121 to 124, 124A,                                                                         125 to 128,
   128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
  the lower area of terrace at the L e p p i n g s Lane end of the ground.
  The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
   1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
                 The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
  procedure 'set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
  Grounds'.
       In a l l but one case the barriers tested, successfully                                                                                           /                       ^
  withstood the applied load,                                                fillip over the rail of barrier 124                                                     ^     14$

     ■ b e f o r e reaching the full test load.
  broke
        Visual inspection of all the b a r r i e r s on the ground revealed
   that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
   tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those tested on the
   Lippings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
   load.

                  The rail on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
             replaced now.         There was also a lot of movement of the rail on
             barrier 144, when tested,and we also recommend that that rail
             is also replaced.
                   As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
             be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
             the start of the coming season.
                   Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
             results of the barrier tests.

Dear Mr.

               Following your telephone call I am very pleased to enclose
a copy of my report to the Club concerning the barrier testing
at the West end of the ground in July, 1988.                                                                  You will see from
the carbon on page 2 that a copy of the letter part of our report
was certainly sent to Mr.                                                      in your department and to
Mr.                       J in the Legal department,                                        I know it is our normal
practice to send you all the record sheets but if we did not do
so, a full set is now enclosed.
               I also enclose a copy of the test certificate from Sheffield
Testing Works who checked the calibration of the testing equipment
the previous week.


                                                                              Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell


Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                     Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                           Barrier Testing 1988
     Over the four days 14,15/18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
the lower area of terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
     The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
procedure set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds'.
     In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
withstood the applied load. A clip over the rail of barrier 124
broke before reaching the full test load.
     Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those, t «ted on the
Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
load.

     The rail on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
replaced now. There was also a lot of movement of the rail on
barrier 144* when tested, and we also recommend that that rail
is also replaced.
     As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
the start of the coming season.
     Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
results of the barrier tests.



                             Yours sincerely,

             METHOD

             The calibration was carried out in a Grade 0.5 lever arm testing machine                                                                                                           in
             terms of the Technical unit of force the ton force (tonf). The uncertainty                                                                                                         of
             the forces applied during the calibration is +0.5$*

             Three tests were made on each cylinder.

             Tests were made to determine the reading indicated on the gauge at fixed loads.

                                        by the Certificate of Ground Safety



                    On 18 July 1988,                               I made an inspection of the ground
    during the time that this year's quota of crush barriers
    were being tested by my firm.
                    The results of the crush barrier testing are given
     in a separate report of today's date.
^                    I made a visual inspection of all the main structural
    features of the ground.                                              Particular attention was paid to
    gates and entry and exit routes and to boundary walls and
    fences.                       No significant defects were noted.
                    The roof of the South stand was inspected from the ground.
    No deterioration in its condition was observed.
                    I certify that in my opinion the various structures on
    the ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate for
    the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid down in
    the Certificate of Ground Safety.

    I tefer to your letter of 13th August 1387 (your reference FP19/2/4:RG/EB) in
    connection with Safety Certificate Conditions.

    I now enclose for your attention a copy of the final revised Safety Certificate
    Conditions which as far as possible incorporate the comments made in your
    letter.  You will appreciate that the wording of certain of your comments has
    had to be amended slightly but 1 hope that the objective has none the less been
    achieved.

    There are four points which require some further consideration:-

              (a)     You say In your letter that an age range should be specified in
                      connection with stewards.  I think however that the wording of
                      Condition 11 should be satisfactory without stipulating an age range.
                      No final decision has yet been taken on this issue and you may like to
                       consider It further;

              (b)      folice knowledge of the whereabouts of a doctor - 1 believe this is
                       adequately covered in Condition 7;

              (c)     identiflability of press T.V. and radio personnel - I am not sure of
                      the justification for such a Condition and wonder If you have any
                       further comments on it;

              (d)     the attendance of competent electrician - again I wonder what the
                       justification for this Condition would be.

     Would you please let me have your comments on the new Conditions in due course.


     Yours faithfully.

                        IDANCE FOR SAFETY CERTIFICATE HOLDERS



 INTRODUCTION

 This note has "been prepared by the Sheffield City Council in ..order to inform
 Certificate Holders as to the general background of the Safety. Certificate
 Conditions. The Council in dealing with Safety Certificates takes advice from
 the Chief Fire Officer, the Chief Constable, the Director of Jtealth and Consume
 Services and the Council's Building Surveyor. . These Officer/and the Council
 itself is concerned to see as far as possible that the spectators at any
 specified activities are reasonably safe.

" GUIDANCE

 Where advice is given to the holder by any of the four Officers mentioned it
 should be acted upon in accjrdance with the time constraints given in the •
 advice. The holder is reminded that failure to take steps to ensure the
 reasonable safety of spectators could give rise to a prosecution.

  The Chief Constable and his Officers have a particularly important role in
  relation to "public order" situations the correct handling of which should
  reduce any risk to spectator safety.

  The Chief Constable mist therefore be provided with appropriate facilities at
  the stadium for control, crowd surveillance, detention and administrative^
  purposes. These facilities are essential if public order is to be maintained
  and the risk to spectators minimised.

  The Chief Constable must also be informed at the earliest possible moment of. the
  proposed date and content of all specified activities so that appropriat
  planning can take place.

  In addition there must  he consultation and agreement between the holder and the
  rhiPf Constable well in advance of specified activities about t h e proposed
  methods of admission and the segregation of spectators. Consultation must also

  atlse
  take place if advance information is such that public order difficulties may
           £ a result of this consultation it is possible that the Chief Constable
  may require, for reasons of preserving public order, that the specified activity
  is ’’all ticket" or the specified activity should not be played at all at t e
  Stadium or the day and the time of the specified activity should be changed.

  The Chief Constable should also be able to use whatever means are * P P ™ P £ aCe t0
  exercise control over spectators for reasons of safety and as part of this
  control he and his Officers should be allowed full access to all areas
   Stadium.

For the attention of Mr.


Dear Mr.
                               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                                  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                             Barrier Testing 1988
              Following your telephone call I am very pleased to enclose
a copy of my report to the Club concerning the barrier testing
at the West end of the ground in July, 1988.                                                You will see from
the carbon on page 2 that a copy of the letter part of our report
was certainly sent to Mr. _______ in your department and to
M r .|               in the Legal department.                                I know it is our normal
practice to send you all the record sheets but if we did not do
so, a full set is now enclosed.
              I also enclose a copy of the test certificate from Sheffield
Testing Works who checked the calibration of the testing equipment
the previous week.


                                                                  Yours sincerely,



c.c. Mr.                                                                                      00CUMEN1 Ha

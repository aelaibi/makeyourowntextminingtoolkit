                     picked         up.

                     After      briefing             around             11.13     am    we    went             to   Rawson           Spring              Road      to

                     supervise            the    parking                of   vehicles         belonging                to          the        Nottingham               Forest

                     supporters.                We    did          this      from      that       time          until          3    pm.             There     was       no

                     trouble         from       the        supporters,                they    all       seemed             in a              happy       mood      and       a

                     number         had    been       drinking.

                     Just      after       3    pm    our          brief       was     to    go    to          Claywheels                    Lane      for     meal.

                     We   walked          up    Rawson             Spring        Road       onto       Herries             Road              and     then      down

                     towards         the       Hillsborough                  ground.

                     Once      we    reached          the          junction           with    Penistone                Road          adjacent                to    the           ‘

trouble       within          the          ground          at    the       Leppings             Lane       end,

A    matter       of   30     seconds                to    a minute             later       he    ordered          us     into       the    ground

We    went    directly             into          the       ground          and       at    that       time       saw    the        players

leaving       the       pitch,             we    approached                from       the       Kop    end       and    whilst        running

towards       the       Leppings                Lane       end    I saw          supporters                climbing           over    the

fence       onto       the    pitch.

On    arrival          at    the       Leppings                Lane    end       I saw          supporters              crammed       up

against       the       fence,             these          were    obviously                being       crushed.

I went       to    the       right          hand          side    of       gate       4,    that       gate       was     already          open,

there       was    several             officers                already          at    that       gate,       I     remember          one    was       a

bald    headed          Sergeant.                    These       officers             were       pulling           supporters             from

inside       the       gate.           I    climbed             onto       a    wooden          spar       situated           to    the    right,

hand    side       of       gate       4    in       front       of    the       wire       fence.           I gestured              with       my

hands       and    shouted             to       the       supporters             at       the    rear       in a n       effort       to

encourage          the       supporters                   to    move       back       and       pull       back     the       people       in

front*        This          was    met          by    shouts          of       abuse       such       as    "Fuck        off'       and    two

One    man    attracted                my       attention             he       was    approximately                 4    yards       into       the

crush       and    was       crying,             he       said    he       was       stood       on    someone           and       couldn't

move.        At    this       time          I was          also       assisting             supporters              who       were    freeing

themselves             to    get       over          the       fence.

The    wooden          spar       that          I was          stood       on    broke          and    myself           and    other

officers          fell.

At    that    point          I noticed                the       people          who       were    at       the     front       were       being

crushed.           One       man       was       trapped          about          1 foot          to    the        right       hand    side       of

gate    4,    his       head       was          turned          sideways             and    trapped          against           the    fence,

                                                                                                                                                 R 106

             he    was       bleeding             from       around       the       ear.        Other       people       adjacent           to    him

             were       obviously                dying.

             I then          gave' a s s i s t a n c e         at    gate       4    pulling          people          through.        Then        in

             company          With          PC    1914       Royle,       other       officers            and     several          supporters              we

             ripped          up    wire          meshing       fences,          I tied          one       section       up    with    a     scarf

             supplied             by       one    of    the    spectators,                then       assisted         with     pulling           people

             out    and       onto          the       pitch.        Once       the    crushing             had    ceased       an    officer

             dropped          down          into       the    terrace          and    was       giving          mouth    to    mouth        to    a

             supporter,                I    do    not    know       who    this       was       or    whether          the    person

             survived.                 I then          assisted       supporters                on    the       pitch    with       first        aid.

             Then       PC     1914         Royle       and    PC    1513       Reeves          and       myself       along       with     several

             supporters                carried          the    body       of    a    person          to    the    gymnasium.              The     three

             of    us    carried             the       body    into       the       gym    and       PC    Reeves       remained          with        it.

             Then       PC    Royle          returned          onto       the       field,          and    at    that    stage       there        were

             many       distressed                supporters.              1’ j o i n e d o t h e r         officers          then     to      form        a

             cordon          across          the       field,       I then          remained          there       until       ordered          onto

             Penistone             Road          to    supervise          Nottingham                Forest       fans    leaving          the     ground.

             I then          returned             to    original          point       on       Rawson       Spring       Road,       junction

             with       Herries             Road,       assisting          with       traffic             control.           Whilst       at     that

             location             I was          approached          by a       distressed                Liverpool          fan,    who       was

             shouting             about          the    gate    at    the       Leppings             Lane       end    being       opened.            He

             threw       a    hamburger                across       the    road       at       me    which       struck       my    leg.         I went

             over       to    him,          calmed       him    down       and       advised          him,       he    was    then     escorted

             away       by    his          friends.

             At    6.30       pm       returned          to    Claywheels             Lane          where       eventually          we. g o t     back

             m     the       coach          and       returned       to    Rawmarsh             Police          Station.

             During          the       incident          there       appeared             to    be    a    lac

                                                                                                                              I do     not       have

             any    previous                experience          at    the       Hillsborough                ground.

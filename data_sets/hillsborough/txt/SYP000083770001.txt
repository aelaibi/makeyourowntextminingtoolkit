Rm so    I entered        the    playing area via the entrance at the                               corner       of     the

N o r t h S tand and the S p i o n Kop.                 An    Inspector       on the       pitch told us

to   complete a cordon at that                      location,       w hich a p p e a r e d    to

circumn a v i g a t e    the whole        pitch,        but    it seemed more             compact and

contained,       more O f f icers         at    the L e p pings Ln end.               I took flP^'a position

in front      of the N orth S t a n d , which                 I could see        contained Liv e r p o o l

supporters,        facing       the    crowd.         The     crowd was       very hostile           towards          the

Police,     both voca l l y and           by throwing m i s siles              at us,        m o s t l y were      coins

w hich were      landing        beside      us.       Host were        pointing       towards       Leppings            Ln«

I looked across and              I could see            numerous       supp o r t e r s    on the     pitch at

the L e p p i n g s Ln end.           Numerous        fans were        running      up the         pitch towards

us and    the Forest         fans      on the Kop.             We   broke ^afway from the             cordon and

went    towards another            cordon spanning              the                           pitch on the

centre    line.         Liverpool       suppo r t e r s       i(er/ running       up Vo —             Qne       grab b e d

me   by the neck and shou t e d                to go the L e p pings           Ln end.          It looked          like

a general       pitch     invasion.            1 did not know what was                    happening,        I

deci d e d to keep        in line       to stop the Liverpool                  s u pporters        going     towards

the Kop.        I remained         in that          position for a p p r o x i m a t e l y         five minutes.

As   I stood there          numerous        suppo r t e r s     came to me and they                 looked       very

upset and distressed.                  I saw s upporters              to my    right       taking     advertising

boards    down and        running       back        towards     L e p pings Ln.           I saw     people       being

carried     towards       the Police Rm are a with                    people     lying       injured on these

boards,     which were          used as m a k e s h i f t       stretchers.

              It was    obvious     to me then that             this was     not a pitch      invasion,        but      some

             major     incident     had h a p p e n e d at      the Liverpool       and.     I could see Police

             O f f i c e r s walking    towards         me who were      very upset.       I looked         for a

             senior Officer,           but     could not see one,          sq/'i left the cordon and

             wal ked towards        the goal           mouth.     I helped    / ”*  /

             crying.         I eventually        fell     back again      to the    centre    line,     where       I

             stayed until        the ground star t e d            to empty at a r o u n d 4. 1 5 p m    <1615).

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEgL-TSPVITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

1)     MORE EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED INv BENERAL ON FACILITIES AND A M E N I T IES

FOR THE CROWDS.      IN THAT WAY PEOPLEf'wOULD BE PREPARED TO ENTER GROUNDS

EARLIER AND NOT LEAVE IT TO T>fE LAST MINUTE THINKING THEY WERE GUARANTEED

ENTRY BY POSSESSING A TICKET.

       BETTER ACCESS F A C I L I T E S , PARTICULARLY TURNSTILES AT HILLSBOROUGH.

3)     DO AWAY WITH INNER FENCING ON TERRACES FORMING PENS.

4)     PERIMETER FENCING ON CERTAIN TERRACES SHOULD REMAIN, BUT STRUCTURE

SHOULD BE RADICALLY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS HILLSBOROUGH.               IT SHOULD BE

MORE LIKE THE ONE IN FORCE THAT OPENS AUTOMATICALLY IN ONE GO.

5)     IF FENCING REMOVED THEN IT S H O U L D A L L   SEATING.

6)     F OOTBALL SHOULD SPEND MORE ON jf&QILITIES FOR FANS AND LESS ON P L A Y E R S ’

SALARIES.

7)     POLICEMEN POLICING BIG GAMES SHOULD HAVE EXPERIENCE OF LARGE CROWDS.

S^p-FIELD WED N E S D A Y ’S AVERAGE CROWD IS LESS THAN HALF OF THE CROWD THAT THE

POLICE WERE EXPECTED TO DEAL WITH ON 15.4.89.          (150489).
                                (
8)     TICKETS SHOULD BE CHECKED AWAY FROM THE GROUND.           I ENTERED THE GROUND

WITHOUT MY TICKET EVER LEAVING MY WALLET WHICH IS RIDICULOUS FOR AN ALL

TICKET GAME.

9)     MORE STEWARDS AT HILLSBOROUGH,     I ONLY SAW ONE BEFOREHAND ON GATE 'C 5.

AT ANFIELD THERE IS ONE OR TWO BEHIND EVERY TURNSTILE.

10)     PARTICULARLY AT HILLSBOROUGH,     THOUGH IT IS TRUE OF MANY OTHER G R O U N D S ;

THE SIGNS WITHIN THE GROUND DIRECTING THE FANS ARE INADEQUATE.

•11)    BETTER MONITORING IS REQUIRED OF BUILD OF THE. CROWD WITHIN INDIVIDUAL

AREAS OF THE GROUND.

 •12) * BETTER LIAISON BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT BODIES RUNNING THE GAME , POLICE ,

 STEWARDS ETC, PRIOR TO BUT PARTICULARLY DURING A G A M E „

 13)    ON 15.4.89 (150489) THERE APPEARED TO BE NO ONE INDIVIDUAL TAKING

 CONTROL AND ORGANISING THE SITUATION AFTER THE GAME HAD BEEN STOPPED.

 14)    THE FIRST CLEAR MESSAGE OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER CAME FROM KENNY DALGLEISH

 AND THAT MUST HAVE BEEN 1 HOUR AFTER THE E V E N T S ^ N F O L D E D - NO CLEAR

 COMMUNICATION TO THE FANS ON THE TERRACES.

 15)    IN FUTURE CLUBS SHOULD HAVE STATUTORY MINIMUM MEDICAL EQUIPMENT            fO DbAL

 WITH CROWD NUMBERS THAT GO TO FOOTB^U. MATCHES.

 16)    IN FUTURE TICKET ALLOCATIONS SHOULD MORE CLOSELY EQUATE TO AVERAGE

 d £ w D S ATTRACTED BY THE CLUBS.

 17)    EVEN THOUGH I HAVE CR ITICISE*5THE POLICE IN GENERAL THERE WERE~

 INDIVIDUAL POLICE OFFICERS            ACTED WELL AND DID THEIR DUTY WHEN      THEY

 THERE FOR PUBLIC ORDER REASONS ONLY WHEN THEY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER USED

 TO HELP THE DEAD AND INJURED.                THE FANS WERE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE TAKING

 THE INITIATIVE TO HELP.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS WRONG IF WE HAD TO HAVE THAT END OF THE GROUND

 THEN .THE*GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO OLD TRAFFORD.          WE HAVE

 TWICE THE AVERAGE GATE OF NOTTS FOREST BUT LESS T I C K E T S »    THE GROUND

 ITSELF    IS QUITE P O O R , THE STANDS ARE QUITE GOOD BUT THE VIEW FROM THE

 TERRACES IS GENERALLY BAD.       THE USE OF THE TANNOY WAS POOR.       THE ONLY

 ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WAS MADE WAS TELLING PEOPLE TO GET OFF THE PITCH.

 1.     I DID NOT SEE ANY PEOPLE CAUSING TROUBLE BEFORE THE GAME, OR ANY

 FIGHTING BEFORE OR AFTERWARDS.       THERE WAS SOME VERBAL ABUSE DIRECTED

 AT THE POLICE AFTER THE GAME WAS ABANDONED BUT THERE WERE NO RAMPAGING MOBS

 OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE.

 2 ..   THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT FANS TURNING UP L A T E , I TURNED UP

 H^LF an HOUR BEFORE HAND AND I HAD PROBLEMS GETTING IN.           HOW EARLY DO

 THEY CONSIDER TO BE LATE?

 3.     THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH TURNSTILES TO GET PEOPLE INTO THE GROUND

 QUICKLY ENOUGH.

 4.     LAST YEAR   I WAS IN THE NORTH STAND BUT ONE OF MY BROTHERS AND SOME

 OF MY FRIENDS WERE IN THE LEPPINGS LANE END AND COMPLAINED OF THE

 OVERCROWDING LAST YEAR.       THE GROUND STEWARDS AND THE POLICE MUST HAVE

 KNOWN ABOUT THE OVERCROWDING BUT NOTHING WAS DONE TO AVOID A REPEAT THIS YEAR.

 THE SIGNING INSIDE THE GROUND WAS POOR AND THERE WAS NOBODY TO DIRECT

 FANS ELSEWHERE.

 INTO PEN 2 AT ABOUT 2.50PM          (1450) THERE WAS A CONSTANT SEVERE CRUSH, WORSE

 THAN ANYTHING I HAD EVER EXPERIENCED.


Q17



        YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,        IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT?

 (BRIEFLY)

 THERE WERE A FEW WAVES OF Si           fN G .   I C A N ’T SAY WHAT CAUSED IT

 SUSPECT IT WAS JUST BECAUSE WORE PEOPLE WERE GOING ONTO THE TERRACES

 THROUGH THE TUNNEL
                                 /
 WERE YOU INJURED,      IF SO, DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN SHEFFIELD?

 NO



 D ID   YOU W ITNE S S ANY DEATHS?

 NO, ALTHOUGH I SAW DEAD BODIES ON THE TERRACES IN PEN 3, NOBODY I WOULD

 RECOGNISE OR BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE.


G1S

 Q48

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,           IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 NO.

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS,

 OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 FROM THE TIME WE FIRST ENTERED THE TERRACES           (PEN 3) AT ABOUT

 2^fcpM (1435) THE CENTRE OF THE TERRACES WERE DANGEROUSLY OVERCROWDED AND         n

                               O h TO                   S x l v5 n 'VCq- C J O H r
 PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PULLED OUT AT THAT TIME.  WHEN PEOPLE WERE TRYING

 TO CLIMB OUT ONTO THE PITCH THE POLICE WERE PUSHING THEM BACK IN.                I

 CONSIDER THAT EVEN AT AN EARLY STAGE AT ABOUT 2.45PM (1445) THE POLICE OR

 STEWARDS SHOULD HAVE REALISED HOW BAD THE SITUATION HAD GOT IN THE CENTRE
   ------------------------------------------                 C't'T        AC^_       ArT~
 OF THE TERRACES AND SHOULD HAVE GOT PEOPLE OUT.

 I THINK THAT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLOCKED OFF BEFORE

 WE ENTERED THE TERRACING AT 2.35PM (1435) AND PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 DIRECTED ONTO THE SIDES OF THE TERRACING.


Gll^

 G50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 AT 5PM (1700).

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD,

 A LOUDSPEAKER      ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OF OUR OWN ACCORD.

 G52

 NO,   IF PEOPLE HAD WANTED TO STEAL THERE WAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF

 VALUABLE PROPERTY SPREAD AROUND THE TERRACES,       I NEVER SAW ANYONE

 TAKING ANY PROPERTY.


020

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS/6N THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS S T O P ^ D ?

 THERE WERE ONLY A FEW POLICE ACTUALLY HELPING PEOPLE AT THE LEPPINGS LANE

 END, THERE WERE A LARGE NUMBER OF POLICE AND SOME STEWARDS JUST STANDING

 DOING NOTHING.     MOST OF J«E WORK OF CARRYING THE DEAD AND INJURED WAS

 D U   BY THE SUPPORTERS/                                 N    C a Xt "  ^
                                                                  /tt>v/i££se-
 THERE APPEARED TO BE,4lO ORGANISATION BY ANY,<5FF ICIAL.

 IT WAS ONLY ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTER THgr MATCH HAD BEEN STOPPED THAT A

 LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE A0KING FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE.

 WHEN THE SUPPORTERS WERE BREA&SWG DOWN THE ADVERTISING HOARDINGS TO USE

 AS STRETCHERS THE POLICE AND STEWARDS WERE TRYING TO STOP THEM, OBVIOUSLY
 ik               ________________________________________________ ___ _
 JUMPING TO THE WRONG CONCLUSIONS INSTEAD OF REALISING THE PURPOSE OF THE

 SUPPORTERS ACTIONS.

 ALTHOUGH THERE WERE POLICEMEN DOING THE BEST THEY COULD, AT LEAST NINETY

 P^CENT    OF THEM COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING INSTEAD OF NOTHING.      THIS

 CAUSED A LOT OF ANGER TO BE DIRECTED AT THE POLICE AND STEWARDS

 AFTERWARDS, AT LEAST AN HOUR AFTER THE MATCH HAD STOPPED ONCE ALL THE

 BODIES HAD GONE.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THAT DEFINITELY BY S.45PM      (1445) AN ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD HAVE

 BEEN MADE POSTPONING THE KICK OFF AND FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS MADE TO

 INFORM PEOPLE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND OF THIS, TO EASE THE PANIC

 THAT WAS OCCURRING.

 IN AT THE TURNSTILES THERE WAS NO RECORD ON THE PORTION RETAINED BY THE

 CONSIDER WOULD CAUSE CONFUSION.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

NO

<353

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

SOME POLICE WERE TRYING TO PUSH PEOPLE BACK INTO THE PENS THAT THEY WERE

TRYING TO CLIMB OUT OF, OTHER POLICEMAN REALISED THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND WERE
                                            >
HELPING THEM OUT.      IT SEEMED THAT THE FANS REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING BUT

THEY C O U L D N ’T CONVINCE THE POLICE THAT\IT WAS SERIOUS.

LMDS     OF POLICE CAME AND STOOD INFRONT q K t HE NORTH STAND AND ACROSS THE

PITCH.     THIS GOT PEOPLE BACK-UP BECAUSE THEty JU S T STOOD THERE DOING NOTHING;

AND NO ONE fOLD THEM WHAT TO DO,

<354

 IS THERE ANYTHING TflKT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF CRO^D CONTROL.        THERE D I D N ’T SEEM TO BE ANY SORT OF

PLAN TO CLEAR THE GROUND AT ALL.       IF THERE HAD BEEN A FIRE THEN I AM SURE

PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PERISHED JUST THE S A M E .    ONCE IT HAD HAPPENED NO-ONE TOOK

CONTROL AND THE FANS WERE INFORMED OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

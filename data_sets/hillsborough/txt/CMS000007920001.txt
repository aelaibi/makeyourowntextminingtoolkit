    %              ^tiVUuJb,
      Thank you for your letter of 17 April about
the disaster at Hillsborough football ground.

      As you know, I vent to the ground on the day
after the tragedy and I visited St Helen's on
Friday, so I have seen something of the grief
inflicted on Merseyside by this terrible event.

      My office will mention your kind offer of
assistance to Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry to Mr
Robert Whalley, the Secretary to the inquiry, (who
is at the above address). I am sure he would be
glad to receive any comments or suggestions which
you are able to provide.

 It is some time since you visited us in Liverpool. Today,     ' Okj v^^^-
 regretfully, I write this letter under the most unfortunate
 circumstances following the greatest tragedy to be inflicted on
 Liverpool since the war.

 I know you are aware that our Company has a unique position in
 the Football World and this tragedy further confirms our
 determination to assist in any way possible.
 As the Company's Chief Executive and a Director of Everton, I
 have a first hand experience of the football scene and would be
 pleased to extend assistance from the company or, if you thought
 fit, offer my own services in any temporary capacity.

 It is my own personal view that the attitudes and ambitions of
 leading members of the Football Authorities have led to a
 serious lack of realism as to what can be done to make the game
 a safe, popular and enjoyable pastime.

 Reforms need to be far reaching and they have to be seriously
 pursued by people inside the sport. I hope your enquiry will
 show the way forward and remove the current vacuum in
 leadership.

 I was born and brought up in Liverpool and never have I known
 such sorrow and despair since my boyhood experiences of the war.

Thank you for you r lett er o ^ - H j u n e a g r e e i n g to the sugge s t i o n in
my le tter of 25 M a y that we sh ould wor k up a p r o p o s a l for the
l i c e n s i n g a u t h o r i t y p r o v i d e d by the Foot ba ll S p e c t a t o r s Bill to
m o n i t o r local au th or ities' p e r f o r m a n c e in g r a n t i n g and o p erating
s a f e t y c e r t i f i c a t e s and to enfo rc e any d i r e c t i o n w h i c h y o u mig ht
m ake abo ut the conte n t s of saf et y c e r t i f i c a t e s in the lig ht of Lord
J ust i c e T a y lor's rep or t (my option C ) .

We s u b s e q u e n t l y spoke a bout the nee d for an I n s t r u c t i o n from the
House of Comm o n s to the S t a n d i n g C o m mittee on the F o o tball
S p e c t a t o r s Bill to enab le the C o mmittee to co nsider an ame n d m e n t on
this subject, since safety is not w i t h i n the p r e s e n t scope of the
Bill. I have a g r e e d w i t h the B u s iness M a n a g e r s that we should move
this I n s t r u c t i o n w i t h Second Read i n g next T u e s d a y 27 June, rather
t ha n come back to the Ho use at a later date while the Bill is in
Comm it te e. I have a s k e d P a r l i a m e n t a r y Cou ns el to table the enc lo se d
I n s t r u c t i o n tomorrow.

The I n s t r u c t i o n is w i d e l y drawn, in order to en sure that it provi de s
for the a m e n d m e n t s that we m a y nee d to ma ke to the Bill. I propose,
however, in m y speech on Second R e a d i n g on T u e s d a y to e x p l a i n wha t
we have in mind, ie that the l i censing a u t h o r i t y w ill be back i n g up
you r e x i s t i n g powe rs u nder the Safety of Sports G r o u n d s l egislation
(though o nly in r e l ation to d e s i g n a t e d footbal l m a t c h e s in Eng la nd
a nd Wa les); an d e n s u r i n g that we can act u p o n Lord Just i c e Taylor' s
r e commendations.

I a m copy i n g this let te r to the Prime Min is te r, the M i n i s t e r s
p r e s e n t at her m e e t i n g of 9 Ma y , t o Joh n M a j o r , a n d to Sir Robin

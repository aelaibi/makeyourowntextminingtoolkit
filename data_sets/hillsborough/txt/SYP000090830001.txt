I can only        recall    seeing    one m o u n t e d    policeman amongst            this mass        of
                                                               ^
people,        I recognised him from Anfield,                he was      p ositioned towards             the

road,    I don't     know what he was            doing.      In amongst            this mass      leading to

the terrace        turnstiles      I can remember           seeing about           three    policemen on

foot    but they were as         crushed as everyone               else and were           unable      to do

a ny th in g   other than to shout          to    people to get          into queues.

It took us about           thirty minutes         to get from the area of the outer

perimeter        gates    to a turnstile gate,             during      that time the situation

outside        the turnstiles was        chaotic,         I was getting            crushed and the

closer     I got to the t urnstiles              the worse       the    crush became,            by the time

I got to the turnstile             entrance       I was being c r u sh ed /s ev er ly but not to

W hi ls t working        our way towards         the turnstile          entrances       our group got

split up,        I r emained w ith my brother                                                   and

               The four     of us got     into the ground through a turnstile at

about 2.40        pm (1440).

I did not hand my ticket              in as      I went     though       the t u r n s t i l e , the

see a ny pol ic emen or stewards              by the/ en tr an ce        to the tunnel.

We made        slow progress     thro ug h the tyunnel b ecause                it was      so    packed with

people at the end of the tunnel                   we made        our way over         to our      right hand

We got to the end of the tunnel at about 2 .45                             pm (1445)         I noticed how

packed the terraces were as we star te d working                            our way      into    pen number

three     people were         being     pulled up into         the West Stand above              the

All    four of us wit h great d i ff ic ul ty m a n ag ed to work our way forwards

say w ou ld have         been a b o u t 2.5 0       pm ( / 4 5 0 ) we   ended up against a crush

barrier       I was about        three feet awa y from the dividing                    fence     between

pens    three and two.            I have ma rk ed this           position with a figure                one    <1)

on the separate grid              plan,      w hich    I produce        (Ex No          ) (Ex REf

We    remained at        position one         (1)     for about     five minutes during which

timethe       crushing     increased         in severity we were trapped                     up against

the    crush barrier,           the    crushing was        very severe       I had turned sideways

to try and          relieve     the    pressure.

Beca us e     of the     pain we were         in being       pushed up against           the barrier,          my

brother                                       and                         m a na ge d to      push their

w ay under         the barrier when they had done                 this they pulled me over                   the

top of the barrier,              all    four of us stood          in front        of the barrier,            the

crushing was as           bad    in front      of the       barrier as      it had been behind               it.

We were       stood    in front        of the barrier         for only a couple              of minutes

there was a lot of m ov em en t               in the       crowd to such an extent              that    I

f ound myself         turned a ro u n d an d        I was facing        back up the terraces

towards       the West Stand,           this m ov ement was         totally       involuntary.          I

could see                              and                                  up at the front            of the

By a time          I w ould say w o ul d have          been about 2.5 5          pm (1455)      we had been

three and two,                       and                           were next to me on my                   right

hand side.                                 had d i s a p p e ar ed from view by the time we got

to p osition number            two    (2 > .

By the time we got             to    position number          two      <2> the        crushing       had got

even worse.           I c a n ’t be sure about what was going on on the                               pitch

because       I was facing          the wrong way.

We were       stuck    in position two             (2)    for a few minutes             up until          a time

w h i ch    I think was    just       before       kick off,       a lt h o u g h    I didn't a c t u a l l y see

the game kick off,             at/this          time there was a very sudden                   release       in the

pressure ar ou nd m y and             I suddenly found             I had      room to move.               I turned

ar o un d and     I saw what         I can only describe as a sight                       of   carnage.           A

large gap had a p p e a r e d on the terraces about six feet                                 in front of me

a nd s l ig htly to/my         left    in front          of this    empty space           I could see a

pile of faodisyr lying              tilted forwards          on top of each o t h e r up against

the front       peri meter      fevyce.

The sight       of this     carnage made me               p hysically sick,            I was    unable       to

stay       in that    position and          I had to get away,              so      I made my wa y back up

the     terraces.

My brother                 and                              went    down to this             pile of bodies

a nd started         pulling    people          out of the    pile.

As     I was m ak in g my way back up the                  terraces       I looked onto             the    pitch

a nd    I saw a      p oliceman      run up to Bruce G R O B H A L L E R            the L iverpool          goal

keeper.

Wh en      I got back    up to the back wall                of the terraces             under the West

S t an d by the gate        in the dividing               fence of      pens three and two                 I met

were       dead down the front             of    pen three.

At a time       I w o u ld say was about 3.1 0               pm <1510)           I went      back    down to the

                  As    I went     back       down    I saw that      the    players    had left the        pitch and the

                  pitch was        covered       in fans.

                  As    I went     down towards           the front     I saw that two sections              of a crush

                  barrier had collapsed,                  I can say that        the area where        the    collapsed

I                 barrier was           is the same area where               I had seen the gap appear            in the

                  crowd on the terraces.                   I can be fairly           positive    that w hen    I saw this

                  down on the terrace                steps.     At this       time the    police were        on the

                  terraces        trying       to help     people.      I could see both                    and

                  were     very upset so I persuaded them to                     come a way and       let the Police

                  get     on with       it.

                  I cannot        really         describe any of the           bodies     I       saw laid out on the

                  terraces,        there         seemed to be so m any and the whole scene was so

                  horrific, that a lt h o u g h you were                looking at        the    carnage you were not

                  but as we were w orking                 our way through the           people at the back of the

                  ter races       I got se parated from                        and              again,    I w al k e d back

                  up the tunnel           towards       the turnstile at a time               I w ou ld say was between

                  3.2 0    pm    (1520)       and 3.2 5    pm (1525).         At that    time w hen      I walked out

                  of the tunnel           there were a number               of bodies    laid on the floor         in the

                  area b etween the tunnel                 entrance and the           rear of the turnstiles.            I

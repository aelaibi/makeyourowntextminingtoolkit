S h e f f i e l d W e d n es d a y        by       coach.       I bought                four       tickets          to travel          on

park we had to walk                   down to the ground                   following                   the    crowd.

At about         1345 hrs we ar r i v e d at the ground and                                       1 saw queues at                the

turnstiles            of about 3              5 deep.         I joined a queue and e n tered t hrough

a turnstile where                part     of my ticket was                  taken from me.                          Just     inside

the turnstile a P o l i c e m a n                  searched my             pockets and then                        I was a l l o w e d

into     the     ground.



Last     year     I a t t e n d e d the FA Cup SeffiiH^nal at                                    the    same       ground and my

ticket         this year       was     for the same area so once                                  inside          I knew where          to

go to get behind the                   goal where           I w a n t e d to be to see the match*                                    the

1445 hrs Nr           1450 hrs         it was             lutely     packed and together                 w ith others

a r o u n d me,       I shou t e d up to Police               o f f i c e\s     on the west b t a n d upstairs

to stop anyb o d y              else    coming      in or to get           petiple to move            back      because

it was       ridiculous           the    number      of     people       that    were      in that a rea           fay then,

but    nothing was              done about        it at all.



S u d d e n l y tft'ssre was a big            surge       forward of           people and         I wa<»ypi nned

forw a r d agai n s l H h e            perimeter       fencing.           I could see my son s l i g h t l y                   to

my    left a bit           in the air as            he had started              to   climb the fencing                to get

out    but was         slam m e d agai n s t        the     fencing,                       was on my       right,         up

a g a i n s t me.         My son s t a r t e d      to call        out    to me      "Help me D a d !,          I c a n ’t

breathe?",           but     I was      unable      to do a n y t h i n g       to help a n y b o d y as           I was

jammed       tightly agai n s t           the     fencing      and       the    pressure was          increasing.               I

could feel my              ribs    being     crushed and my b r e athing was                       becoming         more

a n d more         difficult.           I felt      that     the    pressure         was    becoming       so bad that

I thought my              ribs were       going      to     cave    in.'^Ny^tiien lost             sight      of

a n d at the same               time    I became aware             of a person on the               floor agai n s t

my    legs and         I thought         it was                      I tried d e s p e r a t e l y       to

a v o i d standing          on this        person as         I d i d n ’t want        to cause any            injuries

to whoe v e r        it was.           I also     was aware         of someone          else      behind me         pushed

up agai n s t me wit h his                 chin     pushing        down onto my            right    shoulder.

This     person was             calling     for help and as               time went         by,    stop p e d      s h o uting

•and I could hear                the    br e a t h i n g an d then        it stopped.             By now      1 was

vi r t u a l l y    unable      to breathe myself.                  My    son was       still      calling         for me

to help him,              and    I was    trying       not    to s tand on what              I thought          was

s t o p p e d breathing           due    to the     pressure        on my       chest.        I was    not

unconscious,              but all       I could thing of was               "God,       take me,       not my son",

an d    I resigned myself                to die.



Suddenly           I was aware          of someone        saying     that       there was       room to move

backwards           and    I said that, I c o u l d n ’t move.                  1 realised then that                  I wa

bre a t h i n g a g a i n so the          crush must         have    stopped.           By now,       __________ was

next     to me and he could see                    by the trainers              that    the    lad on the       floor

was wearing,              that    it w a s n ’t                                  star t e d   to shout        to me

on his       chest        but, nothing was          happening.            1 think       he was      dead.      He was

L iv e r p o o l    ScaH^ound            his    neck.       By now                      was upset, and         I jus

wanted       to get        him out       of there,        e s p e c i a l l y as we had been at, Heysel

S t a d i u m whe n the d i s aster             h a p p e n e d there and        I knew that we had to ge

to a     phone       to    call    home    to     let    people     know we were            alright.



                   and myself m a n a g e d        to get, onto       the       pitch through some             fenci'

which      had been ripped a w a y and we went                       to    look     for                  A fter       a

w hile we          found                who was         running a r o u n d      confused and d a zed and

obviously           upset.        I was    just     pleased to see              him,    and star t e d to       look

for                          and                Eventually        I found        everyone and was             relieve

to find that              everyone was alive.                We all       sat    in the stands          and w a i t e d

to see what, would ha p p e n                  next.                      was    very upset and was             cryin

and tried to get me to go to the First Aiders                       but   I could see          there

were    dead and dying          people    everywhere; and     I d i d n ’t want    to bother

them.     I just w a nt e d to get         everyone   onto    the   coach and back home.



At about       1630 hrs    there was a loudspeaker            announcement        that    the     game

would    not    be   played and     for   everyone    to   leave    quietly.      We     left     the

ground and found          the    coach home.     On the      coach home     no one spoke,              it

was    eerily    quiet antk I r e a l i s e d what an effect         the whole      event        had ha

on everyone.         My   ri b s were blurting    badly      now a n d got worse         all     the

way home.

In my view,          after      the      disaster      o c c urred    there was    organised        chaos,

w i t h nobody knowing what                  to do and Police O f f i c e r s       s t a nding a r o u n d

looking at          people      but      not doing anything,            they didn't       seem     to know

w hat    to do.        From     early      on it was       obvious      that    there was more         than an

ordinary        crush,      that        s o mething    serious       was wrong and       1 c o u l d n ’t

u n d e r s t a n d why the P o l i c e       d i d n ’t react       quicker    than they did.              There

was     no co m m u n i c a t i o n s    between Police at            various    areas    of the     gr o u n d or

if there was           they didn't           do a n y t h i n g about    it.     I don't     know how

so many       people       could have         been a l l o w e d     down the tunnel,        the    gates

sh o u l d have      been     closed off at            the e n t rance    to the    tunnel,        or Police

(
The Police who w e r k in the West S t a n d that we                           s h outecKto were       looking

c

to stop       it gett i ng worse.



I w o u l d be      prepared to a t t e n d           court   or any hearing as a result                    of this

Judicial        Inquiry       or any Cor o n e r ' s      Court       held as a result         of the

findi n g s     of the       Inquiry.

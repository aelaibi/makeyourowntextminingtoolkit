SAFETY AT FOOTBALL MATCHES


The Secretary of State asked for briefing on the attached Sunday
Tiroes article alleging that Home Office Ministers had ignored
warnings about the enforcement of safety at sports grounds,
before the Hillsborough disaster. I attach a copy of the briefing
note which has gone to Home' Office Ministers this evening.

I am afraid that the briefing note is not very helpful. The
implication appears to be that the people quoted in the article
had given warnings but that their advice was either inappropriate
(in the case of the HSE) or under consideration at the time of
Hillsborough (in the case of first aid facilities). From the copy
of th© Home Secretary's letter to Neil Thorne MP attached to the
Home Office note, it seems clear that they will deflect questions
on these issues on the grounds that they are being looked at by
Lord Justice Taylor.

The aS’tioi© touches    on the issue of stricter safety legislation.
I will put forward     a submission on the options for amending the
Football Spectators     Bill on safety, in advance of Lord Justice
Taylor'S report, in    the next day or two.

     Sunday Tlaas                      i saa

     Ministers may have seen the attached press article in the Sunday
     Times article o£ 21 May (copy attached) about application of the
     Health and Safety of Work etc Act 1974 (1974 Act) and provision
     for First Aid at sports grounds.  This note responds to these
     points and is for information only.

     The British Safety council

     Th<l Council is a registered charity set up by Mr Tye (quoted in
     the article). He has been described in the past as a publicity
     seeker.   He gained some prominenoe a few years ago over what he
     described as the fire risks at the Albert Hall.

     Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (1974 Act)

     Section 3 Of the 1974 Act is wide ranging in that it places a
     duty ©n an employer to conduct his undertaking in such a way as
     to ensure, SO far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not
     in his employment who may be affected thereby are not exposed to
     risks to their health or safety.   A sports "undertaking" would
     fall into this category.   It is the stated policy of the Health
     and Safety Commission that, as a general principle, they and the
     Health and Safety Executive (HSE) wish to avoid duplication with
     Other authorities.   HSE would not therefore generally attempt to
     enforce section 3 «of the 1974 Act when they overlap with the
     specific duties imposed by other legislation where other
     authorities have responsibility for policy and enforcement.   The
     Safety Of sports Grounds Act 1975 (1975 Act) represents more
     specific legislation.   The HSE does not therefore enforce section
     3 of the 1974 Act to secure the safety of spectators at sports
     grounds.   (HSE responsibilities would not in any event extend to
     safety issues arising from hooliganism).

      First Aid
      Commander Fenton of St Johns Ambulance has been pressing (via
      Neil Thorne MP) for statutory requirements on First Aid provision
      at sports grounds.  Both have met Lord Ferrers.  We were
      considering expanded advice in the 'Guide to Safety at Sports

first aid facilities at sports 0f 20 April about the provision of
                                grounds.

    As Robin Ferrers explained in his letter of 21 February the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 does not empower us to issue
the sort of statutory^guidelines that St John Ambulance were
seeking; but we were intending to update the Guide to Safety of
sports Grounds and would include information on the provision of
first aid facilities.

    The system of safety certification by local authorities is
the way in which statutory requirements are brought to bear on
ground operators.  The question of whether this is the best
system or whether changes need to be made are matters which the
Inquiry under Lord Justice Taylor will no doubt look at.

    I think in the circumstances it might be better not to pre­
empt the Inquiry recommendations.   I know that the St John
Ambulance intend to provide evidence to the Inquiry.   However if
you are still keen to discuss this issue now, Robin Ferrers, as
the Minister of State at the Home Office responsible for dealina
with emergencies, -would be very happy to see you.

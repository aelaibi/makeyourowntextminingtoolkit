HILLSBOROUGH INCIDENT.

On^Saturday 15 April 1989 I was on weekly leave day and was in possession of a ticket
for the FA Cup semi final tie at Hillsborough, with entrance to the Penistone Road
Terrace (Spion Kop).
I live in the Loxley area and this is about a 20 minute walk from the ground and due to
other commitments did not leave home until 2 .30pm. At about 2.^5pm I was crossing Dykes
Hall Road near to The Beehive public house where I saw a large gathering of Liverpool
supporters on the front car park,most of whom were still drinking and in a rowdy mood,
I would estimate that there were about 50 outside the premises but I could not see
inside*
I continued to walk to the ground and as I reached the junction of Leppings Lane/Catchbar
Lane there was a heavy build up of Liverpool supporters rushing to the ground. As I
walked along I was approached by at least ten of the supporters who asked if I had a
ticket to sell.
As I got to a point near the bridge the crowd was packed solid from the turnstiles to the
roadway and being swelled in numbers all the time , all of whom were jostling and pushing in
an attempt to get in. The mood was hostile and derisive chants were being made as to the
situation from a lot of whom were worse for drink. I saw youths in their numbers
climbing over the perimeter wall and fencing into the ground, with no thought for the
obvious dangers,just intent in getting in. There was severe crushing and officers,
including mounted were completely overwhelmed by the sheer volume of suppwpters and their
aggresive attitude. I did see Superintendent Marshall standing on the bridge parapet
obviously attempting to gain a better view of the situation and give instructions to
officers and supporters alike, (approx 2 .50pm).      As he was doing so ,supporters on the ground
were hurling abuse at him about the situation.
I continued down Vere road towards Penistone Road where I saw supporters urinating in
gennels between the terraced houses and also going into those back gardens looking to
gain entry to the ground via the perimeter fences abuting the gardens and the ground.
I went on to the Peiistone Road entrance and in startling contrast there were no
queues at any of the turnstiles and by about 3•03pm I had gained access to the terracing.
I saw play stopped and at first thought there had been          a pitch invasion.
As the situation deteriorated I decided    that the match would not continue, but not grasping
the full extent of it I walked home presuming it would be sorted out by the officers deployed.
On arrival home I heard the call on radio for off duty          officers to attend HammertonRoad
Police Station and I went there by car arriving at approximately 4.00pm.
 I have attended such games in the past, on numerous occassions both on and off duty but
I have never n i b such hostile and aggresive behaviour by football supporters.

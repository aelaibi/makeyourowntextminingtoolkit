                At 3.05 pm (1505) we attended at the Peni stone Rd turnstiles of

                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to collect two officers who had

                escorted fans to the ground.



                Whilst waiting outside the ground in Penistone Rd we we re di rected

                into the ground.                On entering the field of play I saw the Lepping Ln

pitch invasion had taken place.                     We were lined up facing the crowd in

the N o r ^ h S t a n c L ^ “This crowd were shouting obscenities and throwing

coins at the line of Police Officers.                      From radio messages              I then

became aware that it was not a pitch invasion but a crush had taken

place.        We were stood in this line for approximately five minutes

for signs of life but none could be found.                         The body was then taken

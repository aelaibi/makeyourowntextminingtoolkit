 PARTICULAR COURSE OF ACTION.

 3. THERE WAS MORE EMPHASIS ON MA I NT AI NING SEGREGATION ACROSS THE FIELD I .E

 SEPARATING LIVERPOOL AND NOTTS FORfESjT SUPPORTERS RATHER THAN PUT RESOURCES

 INTO GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THE CRUSHING,

 4. AT ONE POINT THE POLICE ACROSS THE PITCH BEGAN TO PUSH THE C R ^ D                      UP TOWARDS

 THE LEPPINGS LAND END AND I SAW THE POLICEMAN ON THE GATE TO b»€N 6 .                      HE HAD THE

 GATE PADLOCKED AND WAS REFUSING TO OPEN IT , SO THERE WAS A'SITUATION WHERE

 THE CROWD WAS BEING CLEARED OFF THE PITCH, BUT COULD NOT .GET, OFF,, BECAUSE OF

 IE CARRYING INJURED/DYING AWAY FROM THE LEPPINGS LANE END RATHER THAN THE

 POLICE ON THE PITCH.

 ABOUT 3 - 4     PEOPLE SCAVENGING IN THE TU>           OR MONEY AND AT THE BACK OF THE

 IT THOUGH - OTHER SUPPORTERS ^ERE/TAKING MATTERS IN HAND,

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,
AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 < i)   THE POLICE DID NOT HANDLE THE SITUATION WELL - THEY COULD HAVE HELPED A
        —
LOT MORE.        IT DID NOT HELP MATTERS WHEN POLICE OFFICERS ALLOWED PHOTOGRAPHERS

TO TAKE PICTURES OF THE DEAD FANS.                                 ,^    ^

 <ii) THE POLICE OFFICERS ATTITUDE WAS NOT RIGHT HAVING TAKEN MY BROTHER OUT

OF THE PEN, WITH HELP,        I TRIED TO GET BACK     IN BUT THE POLICE WOULD NOT LET

ME - DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE HAD VERY GOOD FRIENDS IN THE PEN WHO MAY HAVE

 BEEN INJURED.       INSTEAD EE HAD TO WAIT FEARING THE WORST FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS

 UNTIL OUR FRIENDS WERE ALLOWED OUT, UNHURT.           THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE

 SYMPATHETIC.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL      INQUIRY.

 <i>        THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE POLICE PRESENT FROM THE BEGINNING,         WE DID

 NOT SEE MANY AT ALL WHEN WE ARRIVED.

 <ii)       THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS UNFAIR.      LIVERPOOL HAS BY FAR THE GREATER

 “GATES" PER MATCH YET ENDED UP WITH THE SMALLER END,              IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 THE OTHER WAY ROUND <NOTTS FOREST WITH THE LEPPINGS LANE END).

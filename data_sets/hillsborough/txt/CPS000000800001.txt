     Dear Mr Croston

     Arlington VM urray: AdlinstOH YT>uckcpfifclcl

     Flea* find enclosed copy letter from Michael Kennedy which
     We take it that you do not feel any embarrassment in advising m this matter given the tact that
     » S &           h d the D ireL r of Public Prosecutions to conclude that there were no
     grounds to justify the re-opening of the criminal investigation.

     We trust also that you have satisfied yourself that you can properly offer guidance to the
     South Yorkshire Police on the custody of the papers.

     Yours sincerely

       RE: HILLSBOROUGH: ADLESfGTON -v- DUCKENFIELD & MURRAY

       Thank you for your letter of 25 August and enclosures which 1 received today. ™ suicluded
       a copy of a four page letter to Mr Croston, a copy of a three page statement marked 101A,
       101B and 101C, and a red ring binder of material paginated 1-207.

       I confirm that 1 have sent all this material to Mr Croston at our York office from where this
       case is being handled.
       1 want to make it clear that, although I have replied to some recent correspondence as acting
       Chief Crown Prosecutor during Ms Shaipling’s absence on annual leave, I will not play any
       part in the review process which is being handled by Mr Croston. This is because, as I
       believe you know, I was involved in the case and decision not to prosecute which was mad
       some years ago after the West Midlands Police enquiry.

    The Home Secretary has asked me to thank you for your letter
of 8 June 1989 and to offer his personal sympathy for your
terrible loss.

    The Government has instituted the inquiry by Lord Justice
Taylor in order to discover what went wrong at Hillsborough on
that day.  Whilst the responsibility for deciding whether
disciplinary action should be taken against a police officer or
chief superintendent rank or below lies with the Chief Constable,
the Home Secretary considers that any final decisions on
disciplinary matters are bound to await the outcome of Lord
Justice Taylor's inquiry.

    I understand that the Deputy Chief Constable of South
Yorkshire takes that view.




                                                                           MISS C J BANNISTER




T Hicks,   Esq

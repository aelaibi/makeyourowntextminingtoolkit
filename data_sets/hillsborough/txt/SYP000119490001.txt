               I am     a    Police          Constable                   stationed          at    Doncaster             Town    Centre         Police

              Station,            I have          3    1/2       years       servi c e .

              At      0845       hours       on S a t u r d a y ,           15th       April          1989,       together          with other

               officers           I    left       Doncaster                and    travelled             to       Sheffield          to    perform

               police        duties          at       the    Hillsborough                   Football             Ground.

               At     1100       hours,       after          a       briefing          in    the       North       Stand,       I together             with

              Sgt.      Wilson,             also       from          Doncaster,             commenced             our    duty       manning       the

               barriers           which       blocked                off    the       road       at    Leppings          Lane       at   its     junction

               with     Bi c k e r t o n      Road,          this          measure          preventing             football          fans      from

               walking           down       Bickerton                Road    and       possibly             causing       distress          to    the

               residents              along       that       stretch             of    road.

               Whilst        manning           the      barriers,                I witnessed                very     large      numbers          of    youths

               going        to    the       match,          females          included,                the    majority          of    which       seemed

               good     humoured             and       well          behaved,          however          amongst          the    majority          of       the

               people        were       youths          who          1 would          consider          as       ’i d i o t s ’ and       possible

               trouble           causers,             again          a    good    proportion                of    the    large       gathering             of

               youths        were       drinking             either          beer       or       lager       from       cans,       some I saw were

               carrying           plastic             carrier             bags    full       of       what       must    have       been cans         of        the

               same.

               Throughout              my    duty       on       the       barrier          from       1100-1505          hours          although          the

people       going          to       the    match          were    reasonably                well       behaved,              certain

sections          of      them        made       various          anti-police                ’j o k e s ’ d i r e c t e d         at      myself

and    S g t « Wilson,                but       because       of    the        cont i nuous             stream          of     people

walking         by     the       parti cular               individuals              could         not    be       identified.

Again       whilst          on       duty       at    the    barriers              at   about         1445        hours        I envisaged

the    match         being           delayed          for    say     15       minutes           due     to       the    still         large

amount       of      people           walking          by    me    along           Lappings           Lane,        I    clearly           saw

groups       of      youths           sat       on    the    wall        to    gardens            opposite             m e,    not

attempting             to      walk        to    the       ground        but       just      sat      dirnking            o ut      of    cans    of

beer    or      lager.               I understand             that           the    match                                                 affair

evidently            Liverpool              and       Notts       Forest           supporters            did       not        heed       the

information               as     I    saw       and    heard       conti nuous               youths          shouting            and      asking

for    ’s p a r e s ’ t h o s e            spares          being    tickets             to      get     in       the    ground.

At    approximately                   1500-1505             hours        I    could       hear        the        crowd        within       the

ground       shouting                and    cheering          as     the       match         got      under        w a y , I was           very

surprised            at     this        due      to    the    still           large       amount         of       supporters              still

walking         to     the       gates.              Between       this            time,        perhaps          n e a r e r to      1505hours

I    could       hear       on       S g t . W i l s o n ’s r a d i o              that      there       was       some       sort       of

disturbance               ijq. t h e       Wefet S t a n d ,       however,             no      matter           how     intently          we

both    tried          to      listen           to    the    transmission                  it     was    very          incoherent.               I

did    not      know        what        was      happening           although              I made        out       from        the       message

that    all       available                officers          were        required            in    the       ground.             I then         made

my    way    with         Sgt.        Wilson          to    the    gates           where        I saw        a    huge        amount       of

people          from      the        g%yes       stretching              back       towards           Vere        Lane.          I estimated

the    crowd         to     be       the    full       width        of       Leppings           Lane     going           back       for

approximately                  75     yards          this    is     only           an   approximation.

As    I attempted                to     get      nearer       to     the           gate      at    the       Leppings Lane                end    I

understood             that          officers          successfully                 entered           the        ground,         at      this

stage       I    remained              outside,            again     with          other        officers           and        saw

supporters             coming            out     of    the        ground.

                  ground,           I did       not       receive        any       further              instructions                    on    what        to     do,

                  1520-1530              hours       it    was    apparent              at     this       stage             that        there       were        a     few

                  This        barrage          of    abuse        continued              until          the       ground          wasv^mpty,

                   approximately                1 hour           later,        together             with          other       officers               1 entered

                   the       ground       t ^ n      had    at d e b r i e f       at     the       North          Stand.

    m              On    reflection             into       the> i n c i d e n t          it    is       apparent             that        everybody               is

                   trying          to    blame       the       police        the     FA       and       various             other        bodies,           I do          not

                   think          that    criticism              can    be     levelled             at    a n y bo dy         until           the        true       facts

                   are       disclosed,             however,           without           presenting                a    biased           opinion           or       being

                   hypocritical                in    teeing        to    find        a    s c a p e — goat,             I believe                  that     if      the

                   fans       without          the    tickets           hadn't           converged                on    the       ground            in    the       way

                   they       djjid w e       would       not     have       the     loss          of    life          as    we     have           today.

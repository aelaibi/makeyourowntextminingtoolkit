     Subject:            Hillsborough: Letters to defence solicitors

     Re the draft letter to Walker Morris, i've checked their address with Ann

     I'm faxing a copy of Winckworth Sherwood's letter o f23.12.98 re their request for our reasons. This letter was
     not seen by me until 5.1 99 and therefore was not sent to the Treasury Solicitor before Christmas. As it's slightly
     different to the request from Walker Morris, I've attached an amended draft letter specifically for them.

     I agree with the rest of the draft letter except:

â€˜"   (i) Page 1 last para, delete full stop after w ord' that'
     (ii) In the light of a separate letter going to Winckworth Sherwood, the final paragraph might be amended to
     read: "I have sent a letter in similar terms to the solicitors for Mr. Duckenfield. In accordance with our previous
     agreement I have sent copies of both letters to Ms. Adlington."

     Ms. Adlington phoned me this morning to say that Trevor Hicks of the HFSG will be making oral
     representations before the South Yorkshire Police Authority on Friday 5.2.

     Robin Booth has asked for a sight of the letters to go to the defence solicitors. Perhaps Ann could oblige when
     they're ready for posting?

     George

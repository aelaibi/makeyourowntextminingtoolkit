 Dear S ir,

      I have w atched professional football re g u la rly fo r th ir ty one y e ars and am
 a season tick et holder a t Northam pton Town and a tte n d Nottingham F orest home
 m atches.

       I was         a t H illsborough with my wife and son on S a tu rd ay , 15th A pril. My
 wife and I          were in th e main g ran d stan d in th e u ncovered seats b y th e co rn er
 flag at th e        Leppings Lane end and my son stood on th e te rra c e w ith the
 Nottingham          F o rest su p p o rte rs at th e o th er end of th e g ro u n d .

         The following th in g s s tru c k me on th a t fatefu l day. I noticed as we
 e n te re d th e ground th ro u g h th e main gates th a t th e re appeared outw ardly to
 be a lack of police p resen c e . Having a tten d ed Wembley th e Sunday before
 w here obviously th e re was a la rg e r crowd and a b ig g e r police p resen c e , it was
 noticeable how insignificant th e police were p rio r to th e commencement of th e
 match at H illsborough.
         Once th e d isa ste r s ta rte d to unfold immediately following th e commence­
 ment of th e m atch, it was noticeable how slow th e police were to re a c t to th e
 situ atio n . T here appeared to be absolutely no leadersh ip of any so rt from
 senior officers and th e whole tra g e d y evolved almost as if in slow motion with
 those officers and rescu e serv ices on th e ground ap p earin g to be totally
 w ithout command. We w atched and waited u n til 3.27 pm and I cannot recall
 one single senior office coming acro ss to the L eppings Lane te rra c in g from
 e ith e r th e police h e a d q u a rte rs on th e ground or th e p la y e rs' en tra n ce .
         I and my wife moved from o ur seats a t 3.27 pm and we walked a t th e re a r
 of th e main sta n d to the main g ates w here we a rriv e d a t approxim ately 3.31pm.
 I p a rtic u la rly remember th ese times as I checked my w atch. As we left the
 ground th ro u g h th e main g ates th e re was an announcem ent over th e public
 a d d re ss system and although I cannot recall th e exact w ords it gave no in d i­
 cation as to what was happening and what should be done. I found it in c re ­
 dible a t th e time th a t again th e re was no leadership and no directions given
 over th e public a d d re ss system .

      The reason we left th e ground a t        3.27 pm was th a t a young boy had been
laid on th e g ra s s in fro n t of us who I    knew to be dead, having seen death in
th e arm y, although most of the people         around me were not aw are of it. He
was b ein g a tte n d ed b y a police officer   and two members of th e St Jo h n 's
ambulance b rig ad e who trie d to revive       him. If th e em ergency services and the
police were aw are of th e degree of th e       d isa ste r why on e a rth were people in
th e ground not told?

      In conclusion my so n , aged 16, who was a t th e o th er end of th e ground
told me he left th e grou nd a t 3.45 pm having p u sh ed his way out of extrem ely
packed te rra c e s and explained th a t he realised th e re were corpses on the
ground when he saw young fans with clothing over th e ir faces being taken to
th e p la y e rs' e n tran ce on broken down h o ard in g s. Again one must ask why
was th e re no lea d ersh ip , em ergency p ro ced u res or announcem ents on the
public a d d re ss system ?

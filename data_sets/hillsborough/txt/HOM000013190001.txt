         HILLSBOROUGH: COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE
         Thank you for your letter of 15 June.
         I fully support your aim of persuading the South Yorkshire police
         authority that the additional costs for the investigation should
         fall initially to be met by them.   Any other outcome would set an
         entirely unwelcome precedent.
         I agree that a special payment offers the best hope of achieving
         this and is justified in view of the likely scale of the costs of
         the investigation in relation to the authority's budget. I also
         agree that in this case it would be difficult to justify
         arrangements less generous than those applied in the cases of the
         miners' dispute and the demonstrations at RAF Molesworth.- I am
         therefore content with the formula that you propose and for
         Robin Ferrers to make an offer on this basis when he meets the
         South Yorkshire police authority tomorrow.
         Of course the expenditure which the special payments cover will
         represent a claim on the Reserve. As such I must ask that you
         make every effort to make equivalent offsetting savings on your
         cash limited Votes.
         I am copying this letter to Nicholas Ridley.

                                                                       V—)

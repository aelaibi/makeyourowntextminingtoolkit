  g round or just w al k i n g           around.

W h e n we a r ri ve d outside           the ground         I seen my         lads and their            friends

t h r o u g h the     t urnstiles an d         I went and met Ken C A S T L E Y at               gate       ’A ’ and

we went        into the gr o u n d an d met             back   up w i t h my       lads.       I met     up with

the     lads after         having      been told by the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y S t e w a r d s

that     none of the L i ve rp oo l            stewards were          required to work.

T o g e th er w i t h my       lads and their           friends we w a l k e d a r o u n d the ground

and     then stood         in pen three at             the front we         c o u l d n ’t really see much

from there           so we m ov ed      into     pen two at         the    top by the fence             that

we had a rr iv ed safe.

A fter     trying        to phone my wife          unsuccesfully            I returned to the               ground

and     tried to get           back    in.     W hen    I returned to the             ground the         time must

have     been half two            or a quarter         to three
                                                                          /

At the        time    the w hole      are a outside        the Lsrppi ngs Ln entrance was a sea

of     people all        the    length of Leppi n g s Lxf.                I fought my way            t h r o u g h the

crowd and at this time                  some     of the farfs were            panicking        in case       they

c o u l d n ’t get       in on time.

1 e v e n t u a l l y got      back    into the ground and                r e t urned to w here         I had      left

my     lads    in pen two.

When     I got       there     I found that               a nd his        friend               had    left

an d                 and had       retur n e d    into    pen three.             I c o u l d n ’t see them         from

w here     I stood so we           t ried to join them but                 the    stand was      so     packed we

c o u l d n ’t move      so we d e ci de d to stay.

I can      remember        the game      k icking       off a n d    I was       o b livious    to what          was

going      on a r o u nd me.          I can only        remember      the     crowd tight e n i n g         in

a r o u n d me,      I looked a r o u n d and          I saw   lads       being    pulled up         into    the

     seating area above me,                   but    I j/till          d i d n ’t know what was            hap p e n i n g        .1

     just    thought          that    they w e r e /t ry in g          to get a better             view.

     The    game    had not          long kic k e d off whe n                I saw    lads     starting       to     climb

     over    the    perimeter          fenc e / o n t o        the    pitch.     The Police were              trying         to

     stop them an d get thejji Sack                      into the stand,

     P eople were         starting          to s cream at             this    stage     that    they were          being

     c rushed and         it was then that                 I /realised that            there was a problem                   in

     the    crowd.       No    body    really knew what was                    going     on or what was

     happening.           I remember          seei p g     a blonde           haired     p o l i c e w o m a n who   opened a

ts   gate    to    right       of the goal/as              I     looked at       it pushed two             fans who          had

     climbed over             back    into \#he crowd                 I cannot       d e s cribe     this P o l i c e w o m a n

     and    I w ou l d    not       recognise       her a g a i n       but    I have     seen her         on the TV

     coverage       of the          incident.        v

     By this       time       the, whol4      of the           crowd were       panicking and            I was w o r r i e d

     because       of my son wyno was               in the middle              of the     crowd a n d       I c o u l d n ’t

     see him.

     The whole        of the         crowd were          pushing        trying       to get awa y from the middle

     to the sides             but    it was    useless           because       of the     fencing we          c o u l d n ’t get

     anywhere.

     I could see more and more                      fans        climbing       the    fence a n d being            pulled up

     into    the    seating area.              E v e r yo ne was         scared an d         panicking,         so m u c h so

     I cannot       remember          the   game     being abandoned.                   I was      really scared             not

     for my s e l f      but    for my sons and their                    friends.

     I d ec i d e d that        the    best    pl^ce           for             an d his        two    friends was            up in

     ten maybe        twelve         peoply.     I cannot             remember       how man y       or a n y of their

     faces.       I remember          looking       out    onto        the    pitch and seeing a fan a young

white      lad who was          lying    in the      corner       of the     pitch near      to the West

S t a n d S o u t h S t a nd    corner.

I seen that           the    lad lying       down was       turning a black          colour and          people

were     trying m ou th to mouth.                 I then saw a young St Johns A m b u l a n c e

girl     giving m ou t h to mouth,              she must         have    brought   the     lad    round

because        the    crowd     cheered.

The    next     thing       I saw was another ma n               come    up to the     girl w i t h a oxygen

bottle and w h e n he got               there    it must         have    been broken or empty because

he threw        it down.         I d o n ’t know who         he was        or even describe         him.       The

man went        off a g a in and        returned w i t h another             bottle w h i c h he threw

down again.            I d o n ’t know what was             the matter w ith         it.     The    next       thing

I remember was              seeing    them    covering       the    lad over wit h a coat or a

blanket        the    lad must       have died.

At this        stage    I was     really upset and scared and                    I was     panicking       about

my son               because     I could not see            him,

I left                  and d ec i d e d that       I had to try and find                          I w a 1k e d

out of the           pens,     people    saw that     I was        upset     and seemed to move           for me

I w a l ke d a r ou nd the stand thro u g h the                   corner     nearest     to the S o u t h

stand and w a l ke d a r ou nd to the tunnel                      entrance      to the West Stand.

All    I could see were              people walk i n g a r o u n d upset and             in shock.

I seen a line of dead                 bodies     in the      concourse are a some where                  covered

w i th shirts and            coats    others were          not     I looked at       the   bodies and at

this     stage       I was     in bits my ' b o t t l e ’ had gone because               I e x p e c t e d to

see my son lying               there.

T h e r e was a       line of Po l i c e      officers       standing       by the     bodies      not    doing

an y t h i n g and     I lost     control       and s c r e a m e d at     them to do s o m e t h i n g        even

if it was        to move       the bodies        out of view.             But   they just        stood there.

Near     to this       I seen a         white    fan trying         to give m o u t h to m o u t h        to

a no t h e r   fan who was        lying      on the    floor       twitching.        The    lad    lying       down
                                                       \

was    blue and        purple     in the face         I cannot          describe   either        of them

             although       it sounds        bad    I was      just    conce n t r a t i n g    on finding         my son and

             his friend.

             I went       towards     the tunnel        entrance           intent    on going         thro u g h an d        looking

             for my son.          The    entrance was              being   bloc k e d by a P o l i c e m a n and

             P o l i c e w o m a n they w o u l d n ’t let any one through.                     Before       I .was about         to

             force my wa y thro u g h           I heard someone             shout     ’D a d ’ I turned a r o u n d and

             saw my two sons holding                 each other and            crying,         at    this    I really went

             to    pieces,      I cried because            I could see         that my sons an d their                   friends

             were all       safe.

             I c o u l d n ’t take a n ym or e       so we all         left a n d after             phoning    home      to     let

             people know we were all                 safe we made           our way back             towards      the    car

             every w h e r e    people were w al k i n g a r o u n d          in a shoc k e d state            really         upset.

              To sum up I d o n ’t know what                   really h a p p e n e d and what              caused      it but my

            son            maybe able       to assist more             because      he was          right    in the middle.

             I myself       did not have a view of the                     crush    in pen three            but    I am

            w ill i n g    to a t t en d an y      court      or    inquiry as a witness.

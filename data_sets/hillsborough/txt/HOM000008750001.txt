I have requested, from the Members' Library, a copy of a statement given by a police office
concerning the Hillsborough disaster. The Library has informed me that this statement, along
with other various statements, is missing from the set.

Do you know why this statement is not available and are you aware that apparently South
Yorkshire Police have not complied with your order to ensure that all evidence was provided
to the Members' Library?

Thanking you in anticipation.


Your sinceffely,




MARIA EAGLE MP

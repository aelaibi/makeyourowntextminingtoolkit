Q17

 <349

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS,    OR

 THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 I SAW A YOUNG LAD ATTEMPT TO CLIMB THE PERIMETER FENCE AS HE GOT TO THE TOP

 OF THE FENCE A POLICEMAN PUSHED HIM BACK INTO THE PEN.

 <350

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT 1620HRS.

 <351

® I d YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR ACCORD?

 I LEFT OF MY OWN ACCORD


G18

 <352

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 ft-ER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 VERY BADLY,   I ONLY SAW A HANDFUL OF ST JOHNS AMBULANCE. THE INITATIVE WAS

 MADE BY THE SUPPORTERS. THERE WAS A DISTINCT LACK OF MEDICAL FACILITIES

 THERE WERE FEW STRETCHERS,    THE FANS STARTED USING THE ADVERTISING BOARDS,   IT

 SEEMED AN ETERNITY BEFORE THE FIRST AMBULANCE ARRIVED AND THEN IT WAS THE

 FANS WHO PUT DEAD AND INJURED INTO AMBULANCES. POLICEMEN COULD HAVE DEPLOYED

 IN A FAR BETTER WAY INITIALLY FORMING A CORDON ACROSS THE PITCH WAS OK BUT

 THEY WERE THERE FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME.

 <354

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS
                                                                           PAGE   9

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE TRAFFIC FACTOR SHOWED A COMPLETE LACK OF THOUGHT BY ORGANISORS THEY

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE THAT THERE WOULD BE AT LEAST 25,000 LIVERPOOL

 SUPPORTERS TRAVELLING"ViA MANCHESTER SHUTTING ONE LINE WAS RIDICULOUS.

 ALSO THE LACK OF POLICE ANDN3TEWARDS BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND

COMPARED TO LAST YEAR WHERE THEY'xWERE EVERYWHERE,   THEY HAVE HAD SOME

 CONSIDERABLE DEALINGS WITH LARGE CRO&H^s) THERE WERE NO EXCUSES FOR

 INCOMPETENCE IN CROWD CONTROL.

 THERE WERE NO SIGNS HAVING ENTERED THE GROUND, PEOPLE    IMMEDIATELY SAW THE

 TUNNEL,   THROUGH THE TUNNEL THEY SAW THE PITCH WHICH IS WHERE THEY THOUGHT

^ | E Y HAD TO GO.

 £     THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THERE WERE MORE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS BUT WE WERE ALLOCATED LESS TICKETS.

 I ’VE HEARD THAT A GATE WAS OPENED BEHIND THE GROUND AND A SURGE OF FANS

 WERE ALLOWED IN.      IN RETROSPECT,   THIS MUST HAVE BEEN A MAJOR CAUSE OF THE

 DEATHS AND INJURIES.      THE FANS TOOK UP THE INITIATIVE, NOT THE POLICE.

 THE FIRST AID PEOPLE WERE DOING THEIR BEST BUT THEY WERE OVERWHELMED BY

 THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO NEEDED TREATMENT.

 THE APPROACH TO THE GROUND IS A BOTTLENECK.         THE REPLAY LAST SUNDAY AT

 OLD TRAFFORD WAS QUITE THE OPPOSITE,       FANS HAD WIDE OPEN SPACES.

1. THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OTHER END OF THE GROUND

IN VIEW OF THE EXPECTED NUMBERS,    OR A GREATER NUMBER OF STAND TICKETS TO

COMPENSATE FOR IT.

2) THE TURNSTILE AREA IS ONLY ADEQUATE FOR A SMALLER NUMBER OF FANS AND COULD

NOT COPE WITH A LARGE CROWD,   THAT WAS BADLY ORGANISED.

3) NO VISIBLE SIGNS TO INDICATE THREE POSSIBLE ENTRANCES TO THE TERRACES.

4) THE TUNNEL IS FAR TOO NARROW FOR ENTRANCE/EXIT FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF FANS,

5) THERE SHOULD BE GATES IN THE SIDE SEGREGATING F/ENCES TO FACILITATE THE

QUICK RELEASE OF FANS SHOULD THE NEED ARISE.      \J

6) AT 3.20PM    (1520) ON THE TERRACES, THERE WAS A POLICEWOMAN WHO INFORMED ME

 THAT I COULD STOP OR LEAVE THE GROUND. BY THAT REMARK   I FORMED THE IMPRESSION

 THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN TOLD OF THE SERIOUS SITUATION DEVELOPING.

7) THE OPENING OF THE GATES WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CORRECT DECISION PROVIDED THAT

 THE TUNNEL HAD BEEN CLOSED OFF AND THE FANS DISPERSED THROUGH THE OTHER TWO

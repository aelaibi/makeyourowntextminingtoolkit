                  My Dear Prime Minister,

                         Nkny J thank you for coming to Sheffield to give your comfort
                  and support to the people most affected by the tragic events which
                  hit our City last Saturday,

                         I saw you ask if you might sit on the bed of one of the injured
                  victims and felt you were sitting amongst all of us.        Many people
                  will need counselling, victim s and rescuers a lik e , to ta lk out their
                  traumatic experiences.

                        Your presence in the early stages softened the pain for many
                  people.   Let us hope we can learn to elim inate these awful man-
                  made accidents.

                               Thank you Prime Minister for your thoughtfulness in visiting us

                                                                                      Yours sincerely,

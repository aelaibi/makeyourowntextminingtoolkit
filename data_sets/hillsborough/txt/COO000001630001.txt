        T A Y L O R REPORT:   HOME SECRETARY'S STATEME ^,.n '                   ---- -



    The Home Secretary was very grateful for the comments of
the Prime Minister as set out in your letter this morning and
those of the Chief Secretary, recorded in Carys Evans' letter.

   I attach a redraft which the Home Secretary has now
prepared in consultation with the Min ist er for Sport and
which, as you will see, picks up nearly all of your comments.
The peroration is somewhat longer than before since the Home
Secretary took the view, on reconsideration, that the original
draft ended too abruptly.

    Copies of this go to those who received copies of my
letter of 25 January.

        HOME SECRETARY'S STATEMENT ON
    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S FINAL REPORT
               OF HIS INQUIRY INTO THE
        HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
                     29 JANUARY 1990


W ith     permission,            Mr    Sp e a k e r , I should

LIKE      TO       MAKE A    ST ATEMENT                ABOUT       THE

FINAL      REPORT OF         LORD        JUSTIC E          TAYLOR'S

In q u i r y       into          the     tragedy at                the


Hi l l s b o r o u g h   stadium        on       15   April     1989,
which      is    published         today         .    So m e m o n t h s

have      passed         since    that           terrible       event


BUT     NOT        LONG     ENOUGH           I       KNOW TO      DULL

THE PAIN SUFFERE D BY THE BEREAVED,                                AND

I   WISH       TO PLACE ON             RECORD MY           SYMPATHY

FOR     THEM      AND     FOR     THOSE          WHO     SUSTAINED

INJURY.

I     AM     MOST       GRATEFUL           TO     LORD      JUSTICE

Ta y l o r   for       the     Re p o r t , w h i c h    sets      out


CLEARLY W H Y WE HAVE                     HAD SO M AN Y MAJOR

TRAGEDIES AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS OVER THE

YEARS        AND       WHY      WE    HAVE        HAD    DISORDER

AND        HOOLIGANISM.                     As        THE      HOUSE

FAMILIARISES              ITSELF          WITH     THE      REPORT,

IT       WILL       BECOME           CLEAR        THAT       IT     IS

ADDRESSED           AS        MUCH        TO     THE        FOOTBALL

INDUSTRY          AS     IT     IS    TO    THE    GOVERNMENT.

Lo r d     Just i c e        Ta y l o r    explains          how    in


HIS      INTERIM REPORT               HE       CONCENTRATED         ON

OVERCROWDING                 BECAUSE           THAT      WAS       THE

CAUSE        OF     THE        HILLSBOROUGH             DISASTER,

BUT NOW HE GOES ON TO T ALK OF A GAME,

TARNISHED,          AND         OF    A      BLIGHT         OVER       THE

GAME        DUE          TO         OLD          GROUNDS,             POOR

FACILITIES,               HOOLIGANISM,                     EXCESSIVE

DRINKING        AND       POOR       LEADERSHIP.



Lo r d    Ju s t i c e        Ta y l o r     does        not         spare


THOSE     WHO     RUN         THE     INDUSTRY.                 He    SAYS

INDEED       THAT        THE        PROVISION            THEY         MAKE

FOR      THEIR           CUSTOMERS               IS     OFTEN          NOT

MERELY       BASIC            BUT     SQUALID,                  AND     HE

SAYS     THAT     SQUALID            CONDITIONS             CAN       HAVE

AN    IMPACT       ON     SAFETY            AND       THAT       IN    HIS

VIEW THEY ALSO LEAD TO LOWER STANDARDS

OF    BEHAVIOUR.

WHICH        IS     NOT      CONFINED          TO     SOCCER,         HAS

A    MAJOR         INFLUENCE            ON     THE         CROWD.        I

ACKNOWLEDGE              THAT      SOME       CLUBS         HAVE    MADE

WAS       THAT     THE       MAJOR ITY HAD           NOT     AND

THAT      THE     GAME       ONLY HAS       A      FUTURE      IF

THE       DIRECTORS          AND THE           PLAYERS       CAN

CHANGE       THEIR       OWN       PRIORITIES        AND    GIVE

A    LEADERSHIP WHICH               IS   PLAINLY       LACKING

AT    PRESENT.

OF     RAISING     THE        MONEY           IF    THE       CLUBS'

MATCHES      ABROAD.



As I     have       said   ,   Lo r d     Ju s t i c e    Ta y l o r

TAKES    THE       VIEW THAT        BETTER         FACILITIES

AND     BETTER       TREATMENT            OF       FANS        WILL

BRING    BETTER      BEHAVIOUR.                BEYOND         THAT,

the   Re p o r t   recommends           the       creation       of


THREE    NEW SPECIFIC            THREE         NEW    SPECIFIC

OFFENCES TO APPLY AT DESIGNATED SPORTS

GROUNDS:               THROWING               A       MISSILE;

CHANTING       OBSCENE         OR    RACIALIST            ABUSE;

AND     GOING       ONTO       THE        PITCH          WITHOUT

REASONABLE         EXCUSE:          AND       IT     ALSO      ASKS

FOR CONSIDERATION              TO    BE     GIVEN        TO

USE OF          ELECTRONIC TAGGING                       IN THE          CASE

OF     OFFENDERS                   CONVICTED            OF    FOOTBALL-

RELATED          OFFENCES.                    The       SPECIFIC          NEW

OFFENCES            SUGGESTED                DO    TO    SOME       EXTENT

SEEM       TO    DUPLICATE                OFFEN CES           WHICH       ARE

ALREADY         AVAILABLE                 IN THE        PUBLIC        ORDER

Act.         Bu t     I        shall         look    ca refully           and

QUICKLY         AT    ALL           THESE         SUGGESTIONS.



I    NOW     COME             TO    THE       PROPOSED          FOOTBALL

Membership                    Sc h e m e .           Lo r d        Ju s t ic e

Ta y l o r       examined                 the       In v i t a t i o n     to


Tender          for       a     scheme          which        was    issued




                                   /b y   the       consultants
BY       THE     CONSULTANTS            EMPLOYED             BY     THE

FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES.                        He    CAME      TO THE

CONCLUSION           THAT     HE       COULD       NOT      SUPPORT

A       SCHEME   OF    THAT       KIND       BECAUSE         HE     DID

NOT       BELIEVE      THE    TECHNOLOGY M O U L D W O R K

WELL       ENOUGH       TO     AVOID         THE       DANG ER       OF

CONGESTION           AND     DISORDER.             He      WAS     ALSO

CONCERNED            ABOUT     THE       CALL          ON        POLICE

resources        .      In s t e a d    he        proposes          the


MEASURES         TO WHICH          I HAVE          REFERRED.



I   n    the     light       of        this        advice,          the

Government have decided not to proceed

WITH       THE    ESTABLISHMENT               OF       A    FOOTBALL

Membership           Au t h o r i t y , but        Pa r t    I of

THE    SHORTCOMINGS                 IDENTIFIED            BY       LORD

Just ic e      Ta y l o r    could        be        overcome           in


CASE    WE     HAVE     TO    RETURN           TO    THE       MATTER

AGAIN,          SHOULD              THE         PROBLEM                OF

HOOLIGANISM NOT              BE      DEFEATED            BY    THE

                rts Grounds Act, 19^5

Further to my letter of the 4th July addressed to the Club Chairman,
Mr. H. E. McGee, in anticipation of proposed designation of the Hillsborough
Stadium, you may care to see the attached Note which sets out the type of
information and plans which the County Council will require.

I am sure you will already be aware that tax relief is available under Section 49
of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1975 for expenditure in connection with the safety
certificate for sports grounds which have been designated under the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act, 1975.

I understand that an amendment tabled in connection with the current Finance
B ill will extend this concession to sim ilar expenditure incurred since
1 st August, 1975 in respect of grounds not yet designated.

The effect would be that owners of sports grounds who have in the past adopted
or who in future adopt a reasonable and public spirited attitude in carrying out
safety work, even though not designated, will not thereby lose tax relief. It is
understood that this concession will be conditional upon the owner of the ground
producing appropriate certification from the relevant local authority that the
expenditure was incurred in steps which would have b6en required or would have
been taken into account in connection with a safety certificate if the ground had
been designated.

As you are aware, the signs for the designation of the Hillsborough Stadium are
extrem ely promising, so the latter information will hopefully be superfluous.
However it may be worth bearing in mind in the unlikely event of things not
turning out as we foresee.

                                                 Yours faithfully.

    Dear Sir

    SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT:
    DESIGNATION ORDER 1978

    The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (a copy of which is enclosed) implemented
    the main recommendations contained in the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd
    Safety at Sports Grounds which was prepared by Lord Wheatley following the serious
    accident at Ibrox Park football ground in 1971*   The main instrument of control
    under the Act is the general safety certificate which will be needed by every
    sports stadium which is the subject of a designation order.   The county council,
    by means of the certificate, will be able to impose such terms and conditions as
    are necessary to ensure a reasonable standard of safety at the ground having regard
    to all the circumstances.

    2.   The international association and rugby union football grounds and those of
    the clubs in the First Division of the Football League and in the Scottish Premier
    Division were designated in orders made in 1976, which were followed by further
    orders made last year naming the grounds of clubs promoted into the First Division
    and into the Scottish Premier Division at the end of the 1976/77 football season.
    As will be seen from the enclosed copy, an order has now been made designating
    under the Act the grounds of two of the club6 promoted to the First Division at
    the end of la6t season (the ground of the other promoted club, Tottenham Hotspur FC,
    having been designated in-the 1976 order) and also the ground of Sheffield
    Wednesday FC by virtue of it6 quasi international use.

    3« It is an offence under Section 12(1) of the Act to admit spectators to a
    designated stadium after the date on which the designation order relating to it
    come6 into operation unless an application for a general safety certificate has been
    made.   Any such application should therefore be made before 1 January 1979 when
    the designation order becomes effective.   For thi6 purpose one of the enclosed
    application forms should be completed and sent with supporting documents (as
    indicated in paragraph 1 of Appendix A to thi6 letter) to the county council.   The
    application then fall6 to be dealt with in accordance with the Act and the Safety
    of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 (copy enclosed).

         Once the application has been made, and pending the issue of a general safety
    certificate, spectators may continue to be admitted to your ground as at present.
    As will be seen from the enclosed copy of a Home Office Circular to the Chief
    Executives of County Councils, attention has been drawn to the advantage, in
    appropriate cases, of deferring the issue of the certificates until the beginning of
    the 1979/Bo season.
5.   Guidance a6 to the procedure to be followed on matters connected with your
application for a general safety certificate i6 6et out in Appendix A to this
letter.

SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES

6.   After a general safety certificate has been issued, the need could arise
for an event which is not covered by the terms and conditions in that certificate
either becaiuse the activity itself is not named therein or the terms and
conditions normally applicable to that activity are considered inappropriate for
the special occasion in question.   The Act provides for special safety certificates
for thi6 purpose and guidance on the procedural matters concerning them i6 contained
in Appendix B to this letter.

7.   It should be borne in mind that, except with the permission of the local
authority, an application for a special safety certificate must be made at least
3 months before the event.   This period is necessary to ensure that no person will
be deprived of his rights of appeal under the Act, in cases where the full
procedure for which the Act and Regulations provide requires to be accommodated.
The period can therefore be relaxed only in cases where it is apparent that individual
stages of the procedure will not be required,.eg where the applicant has already
been accepted as a qualified person.   It has also been necessary, in order to keep
the length of the required notice down to an acceptable level, to apply a strict
limit to the time available for each stage of an application for a special safety
certificate.

8.   In the light of the foregoing considerations, clubs and local authorities will
no doubt consider that the need for special safety certificates should a6 far as
possible be reduced by widening the scope of the general safety certificate on the
basis suggested in paragraph 6 and 7 of Appendix A but that, where they continue to
be required, applications should normally be made by the holder of the general
safety certificate (rather than the independent promoter of the special event),
giving as much notice as po66ible.

9.   Once a general safety certificate is in being, all the requirements relating
to special safety certificates including the requirements of at least 3 months
notice automatically have effect.   Clubs will wish to bear in mind the possible
difficulties that could arise if a special event were scheduled to be held at the
ground within 3 months of the grant of the general certificate.   Local authorities
should therefore be made aware of any such event which has already been arranged or
which i6 arranged within the next 6 months or so, so that they may as far a6
possible provide for the requirements for that event to be covered in the general
safety certificate.   Otherwise there could be insufficient tine remaining for a
special certificate to be considered.

FEES

10.   Section 6(1)(b) of the Act provides for regulations to be made as regards
the fees to be charged in respect of applications for safety certificates, and in
accordance with the general policy that local authorities should be able to charge
economic fees for the work undertaken, Regulation 14 provides accordingly.   However,
by affording clubs an opportunity to co-operate to the full by, say, preparing
plans, checking crush barriers etc, local authorities should not in the normal
course find it necessary to charge fees representing aore than 17 man/dayB work.

11.   A copy of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) which was published
in December 1976 is enclosed for your convenience.

12.   A copy of this letter ha6 been sent to the Chief Executive of the County
Council for your area.


                                                    Your6 faithfully

APPMDIX A

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The Regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall be
made in the form contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the like
effect.   Copies of the form are being made available to potential applicants and they
are being advised of the need to provide such information in support of their applica­
tion as will enable the local authority to discharge its functions under the Act. In
particular, the application should be accompanied by detailed information as to the
structure, capacity, etc of the stadium, including plans of the stadium, certificates
relating to the testing of crush barriers and evidence of the applicant's status.
It is, however, open to a local authority, under section 5(4) of the Act, to require,
by notice in writing, such further information of this kind as it may consider
necessary to enable it to determine the terms and conditions to be included in the
certificate.

2.   On receipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local
authority must first determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a
person likely to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and
conditions to be imposed in the certificate.   If it considers him to be such a person
the authority is then under a duty to issue a general safety certificate to him.
In the case of a general safety certificate, where considerations of time are not
paramount, the regulations impose no specific time limit for such a determination.
In any event, it seems prima facie unlikely that an application for a general safety
certificate would be made by an unqualified person*   There is, however, a right of
appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is not a
qualified person (see paragraph 10).

3.   Bie local authority is required,, by section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of
any application for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate
Chief Officlr of Police and building authority, and oast consult then about the
terms     conditions to be included in the certificate*    In framing such conditions,
local authorities will no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles or guide lines
set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)*    In this connection
local authorities are reminded that, as has been stressed an previous occasions,
this non-8tatutory document is not a set of requirements to be rigidly applied
regardless of individual circumstances*    The maximum flexibility should be maintained
to take account of the different circumstances at individual grounds deriving from
differences in such matters as age, size and mode of construction*    In this regard,
it should also be noted that the Act provides that the terms and conditions should
be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety*' and it would be
unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek the absolute safety of everyone
attending the sports stadium*

i+.  It is envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the local
authority and the club in the process of drawing up the certificate conditions.
In this way, if evidence Is advanced that a ground is rarely filled to capacity, the
local authority may consider it proper to base its requirements on actual levels of
attendance over a given period rather than on maxi mum capacity*  On the rare
occasions on which a capacity crowd could be expected, separate provision might be
made for this contingency on the lines indicated in paragraph 7 below.   Again, if
    a stand were found to be structurally weak* the local authority might, in
    consultation with the club, offer the choice of having any necessary remedial works
    carried out or of restricting admission to the stand until it had been strengthened.

    5.    As will be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs, the form and content of a
    safety certificate is likely to vary according to the circumstances of the individual
    case.    Accordingly, a standard form of certificate would not be appropriate*   It
    must however contain full details of the terms and conditions imposed including,
    in particular, the matters referred to in section 2(2) of the Act and have annexed
    to it a plan of the stadium by reference to which the terms and conditions will be
    framed, ftie certificate when first issued may contain restrictive conditions which
    can then be relaxed or deleted by amendment of the certificate*    Die local authority
    may find it convenient to list, in an annex forming part of the certificate, such
    modifications as will be subsequently permitted, eg in the form of a statement of
    the increased spectator activities to be allowed for the separate sections of the
    ground when the various stages are completed, of any future works programme for the
    ground which has been agreed with the club.    Care must be taken not to exclude from

•   the certificate any restriction germane to current conditions, since section 5(3)
    of the Act provides for an interested party to appeal to the Secretary of State
    against the inclusion of anything in, or the omission of anything from, a safety
    certificate, and these rights must not be prejudiced in any way in consequence of
    the form of the certificate.

    6.   As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the Act
    provides that different terms and conditions may be Included for different activities.
    Althou^i, therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a football ground, in
    cases where it is also used from time to time to stage other events it would be
    desirable, and in many cases obviate the need for special safety certificates, if
    the terms and conditions appropriate to those events were to be included in the
    general certificate.   It is suggested that any such events for which it is
    considered desirable to provide might conveniently be divided into 2 classes:

         (1)   Those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of the
               stadium for the normal terms and conditions to be equally applicable?

         (2)   Those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop

•              concerts, etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being
               given over to spectator accommodation and for which separate terms and
               conditions will have to be devised*   It is not, of course, necessary
               to provide for these contingencies in cases where no clear need is
               foreseen by the stadium authorities*

    7*   There may also be circumstances in which the terms and conditions applicable
    to the normal activity of the stadium may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a
    special event, such as a cup tie or a "local Derby11, is expected to attract
    significantly more than the usual attendance*   In the case especially of cup
    replays these special events may arise with only a few days* notice, within which
    it would not be possible to accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure
    appropriate to the grant of a special safety certificate.    In order to overcome
    this difficulty, it would seem desirable for the local authorities and clubs to
    seek to work out in advance the modifications to the normal terms and conditions
    which might be appropriate to such occasions, eg the admission of increased numbers
    to certain areas on the condition that extra stewards and police are employed, that
    notice is given to the local authority, and so on, and to provide for their
    incorporation in the general safety certificate*


                                               8


                                         2
8.   Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the
determination of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal
amendment of the certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder
of the certificate or of the local authority (see section 4(2) of the Act) and will
presumably reflect changes in circumstances occurring since the grant of the original
certificate.   It will thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities and clubs
for a close liaison to be maintained after the issue of the certificate and certainly
while any further works of safety measures are being carried out*   It is likely to
be in the clubs* financial interest to get the safety certificate amended as
soon as possible after work has been completed, and they should accordingly ensure
that the local authority is kept informed of progress.   For its part the local
authority will no doubt wish to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following
completion of the work, the certificate can be amended without delay.

9«   After a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for the
transfer of the certificate to another person.   Similarly, while a local authority
is considering an application for a certificate and before the certificate has
been granted, it may be asked to substitute some person other than the original
applicant as the person to whom the certificate should be granted*   These are,
however, likely to be rare occurrences in the case of general safety certificates,
where an application will normally be made on behalf of a club by an authorised
official of the club.   However, if it does happen, the local authority will be
required in both cases to determine whether the substituted nominee is a qualified
person.   thereafter, in the first case, the procedure laid down in the regulations
relating to giving notice of, and the reasons for, the determination will apply
together with any necessary appeals procedure.   In the second case, there is no
reason why the local authority should not treat the application in all respects as
a new application and process it from the point it had already reached*

10* In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety
certificate against the determination that he is not a qualified person (see
paragraph 2 above), which, of course,' applies also in the case of a proposed
transfer of a certificate, the Act provides a further right of appeal to any
"interested party11 (which term includes the holder of the safety certificate)
against the inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety
certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.     Die
regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety certificate, notice of
any such appeal shall be given within 28 days following receipt of a notice of
the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified,
the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper circulating
in the locality*

11. In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or
amending a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain
specified "interested parties" and also to advertise their action in the press*
It is regretted that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of
advertising, but, since Section 5(5) of the Act is not specific in the definition
which it provides of "interested party", no other means could be found of ensuring
that       persons who might validly claim to be "interested parties" within the
■»A»iTing of the Act should be able to acquaint themselves with the local authority's
decision, and failure to bring the decision to their notice could result in a
denial of their rights of appeal or of a hearing by tile Secretary of State*     For
the same reason a similar obligation has been Imposed on an appellant (by
Regulation 8(7)) to advertise his Intention to appeal, and a. person wishing to
appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section 5(4) of
the Act la required to give notice within 28 days of such advertisement.
12. Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the appeal.
It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with Regulation 8(9), to
inform the Secretary of State in writing within 28 days whether it wishes to oppose
the appeal.   With any such notice, the local authority is required to submit its
reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to state whether it wishes a
hearing under section 5(4) of the Act.   (The procedure governing the conduct of
all such hearings is set out in Regulation 10.)

13» It ie also open to the Secretary of State, if ho considers it necessary, to
order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal.
In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in Regulation 12.

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


1.   The regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall
be made in the form contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the
like effect.   Copies of the form have been made available to potential applicants.
Part II of the form and its frontispiece should be completed in the case of
applications for special safety certificates*   In any case where an application for
a special safety certificate is not made by the holder of the general safety
certificate, it should be accompanied by evidence of the applicant's status.
Details of any planned changes to the normal standing and seating arrangements for
spectators should be provided, together with such further information in support
of the application as is considered necessary to enable the local authority to
discharge its functions under the Act.   However, it is open to a local authority,
under section 3(4) of the Act, to require, by notice in writing, any further
information of this kind which they may think it necessary to have to enable them
to determine the terms and conditions to be included in the special safety
certificate.

2.   A major difference in the grant of general and special safety certificates is
that, once the local authority has determined that an applicant is a qualified person,
the issue of a general safety certificate becomes mandatory, whereas the issue of a
special safety certificate remains at its discretion.    But an applicant has a right
of appeal to the Secretary of State against a refusal (see following paragraphs for
details).

3*   An application for a special safety certificate should normally be made at
least 3 months before the date of the proposed event, but a local authority has
discretion to permit an application within a lesser period if it is satisfied that
the procedures (including appeals procedures) required under the Act and
Regulations can, in the particular case, be carried out within that lesser period
eg when the applicant is known to be a qualified person.   On receipt of an
application for a special safety certificate, the local authority must first
determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely to be in
a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be imposed in
the certificate.   The local authority is required by regulation 5 to make this
determination within 14 days of receiving the application.   There is a right of
appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is not a
qualified person (see paragraph 9)» and, under regulation 5* the applicant must be
furnished with the reasons for such a determination.

4.   It next requires to be considered whether the application should be refused
on grounds other than that the applicant is not a qualified person.   This decision
must, in accordance with regulation 6, be made within 28 days of the receipt of the
application, not only in cases where the local authority has determined that the
applicant is a qualified person but also in those where it has determined that he
is not and an appeal has been lodged and remains to be considered.   There is also
a right of appeal against a refusal on grounds other than a determination that the
applicant is not a qualified person (see paragraph 9) •  In the event of such a
refusal, the local authority is again required, under regulation 6, to give the
applicant the reasons for its decision.
5.   When the first two stages have been completed, should it have been decided that
a special safety certificate should be issued, the local authority is required, by
section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of the application to the chief officer of
police and to the building authority and to consult them about the terms f»wri
conditions to be included in the certificate*     The special safety certificate must,
in accordance with regulation 6(2), then be issued not less than 28 days before the
proposed event is due to take place.

6.   The form and content of a special safety certificate is likely to vary
according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of
certificate woild not be appropriate.   (In suitable cases, however, regard may
be had to the guide lines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)
on the basis indicated in paragraph 3 of the note relating to the "Procedure
Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates” at Appendix A.)   Any
special safety certificate must, however, contain full details of the terms and
conditions imposed, including in particular the matters referred to in section 2(2)
of the Act, and as required by section 2(4) should be framed where appropriate by
reference to the plan attached to the general safety certificate.

7.    Once a special safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determination
of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amendment of
the certificate.    This may be on the application of the holder of the
certificate or at the discretion of the local authority (see section 4(2) of the
Act).    This seems an unlikely eventuality in the case of a special safety
certificate,otherwise than in the exceptional case where the certificate has been
issued well in advance of the event to which it relates.    Any such amendment must,
however, be publicised as indicated in paragraph 10 below.

 8.    Considerations of time render the transfer of a special safety certificate
 to another person an equally unlikely contingency.     Any possible difficulties in
 this connection are likely to be obviated, however, if the holder of the general
_safqt^aega^i^lcate applies for the special certificate.     Nevertheless, should an
 applfcia^ion -for transfer be made, the local authority must decide within 14 days
 if 'the proposed transferee is a qualified person and, if it decides to the
 contrary, the procedure laid down in the regulations relating to giving notice of,
 and the reasons for, the determination will apply, as will the appropriate appeals
 procedure, should the need arise.     In the case of an application for transfer
 before a special safety certificate has actually been issued, there is no reason
 why the local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a new
 application and process it from the point already reached.

9*   Reference has already been made to the rights of appeal against a determina­
tion that the applicant is not a qualified person (paragraph 3) and against the
refusal of an application on other grounds (paragraph 4)*   In addition the Act
provides (in section 5(3)) a right of appeal to any "interested party" against the
inclusion of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety'certificate
or against a refusal to amend or replace a safety certificate.   The regulations
provide that, in the case of a special safety certificate, notice of any such
appeal shall be given within 7 days following receipt of a notice of the local
authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not notified, the
publication by the local authority of the decision in a newspaper circulating in
the locality.

10. As in the case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a
local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate or refusing so to
amend it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties" and also to
advertise its action in the press#     A similar obligation falls on an appellant
(under regulation 8 (7 )) to advertise his intention to appeal« and a person wishing
to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section 5(4)
of the Act is required to give notice within 7 days of such advertisement.     (The
reasons underlying these requirements are set out in paragraph 11 of the note
on 'Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety Certificates' at Appendix A.

11,  Any appellant is required (by regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the appeal*
It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with regulation 8(9)» to
inform the Secretary of State in writing within 7 days whether it wishes to
oppose the appeal.   With any 6uch notice, the local authority is required to
submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to state whether it
wishes a hearing under section 5(4) of the Act*   (The procedure governing the
conduct of all such hearings is set out in regulation 1 0 )•

12. It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to
order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal*
In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in regulation 12.

        Dear Sir

        HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO. 136/78 - THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS
        (DESIGNATION) ORDER 1978

       The first designation order under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act was made in 1976,
       naming the international football grounds and those of the clubs in the First
       Division of the Football League, and this was followed by r further order made last
       year naming the grounds of the clubs promoted into the First Division at the end
       of the 1976/77 football season.   As will be seen from the enclosed copy, an order
       has now been made (S.I. 1978 No. 1091), designating under the Act, with effect
       from 1 January 1979, the grounds of two of the clubs which were promoted to the
     . First Division at the end of last season (the ground of the other promoted club,
       Tottenham Hotspur FC., having already been designated in the 1976 order); and
       also the ground of Sheffield Wednesday PC by virtue of its quasi international
       use.   The grounds of the clubs which were relegated from the First to the Second
       Division remain subject to their relevant designation orders.

        2.    Guidance as to the procedures to be followed in dealing with applications
        for general safety certificates and special safety certificates was provided in
        Horae Office Circulars No. 130/76 of 26 August 1976 and No. 1 8 7 /7 6 of
        8 December 1976 respectively.

        3.   Local authorities may feel that a similar pattern of timing may be applied
        as was adopted for the football grounds designated under the previous orders and
        that depending on the condition of the stadium and having regard to the powers
        available to them under section 10 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 to
        deal with cases of severe risk, the issue of a general safety certificate might
        with advantage be deferred until after the next close season ie, in the case of
        these 3 clubs not before August 1979*   In order to give the clubs every opportunity
        to carry out the necessary work beforehand, however, local authorities will wish
        to bear in mind that clubs will need to be notified at the earliest possible date -
        preferably well before the end of the playing season - of the work which is
        coneidered necessary to ensure reasonable safety for spectators.

        4.   For your information a copy is enclosed of the letter (but without the
        enclosures forwarded to you in 1976) which has been sent to the 3 clubs whose
        grounds have now been designated.



                                                                    /5.    A further

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds A ct, 1975

    I have received the C lub's application, signed by the Chairman, for a General Safety
    C ertificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds A ct, 1975.

    For your information, the County Council had heard nothing from the Home Office
    since early August and the receipt of the Club's application prompted a telephone
    enquiry of the Home Office who revealed the existen ce of their letter dated 23rd August
    to both Clubs and Local A uthorities. As this had evidently been received by the
    Club but not by the County Council, I asked for a copy to be forwarded on, and this has
    been received today.

    It is hoped that a m eeting of the O fficer's Working Party (involving the P o lice, the
    Fire Service, the D istrict Council Building Surveyor) w ill be held shortly to give
    prelim inary consideration to the m atter, after which I w ill get in touch with you. In
    the m eantim e, you w ill reca ll that I enclosed with m y letter of 20th July, 1978, a Note
    on the type of detailed information and plans which the County Council w ill require for
    consideration of the application.

                                                  Yours faithfully,

                Dear Mr England

                                                                Certificate of Safety

                               I                                    enclose a list of drawings which are likely to
                give the information we need concerning the North Stand,
                the West Stand and the North West Terrace and Stand.                                                             I am
                sending a copy direct to Mr Whitehead so that he can make
                his enquiries of Mr English.
                               Since Friday I have given some thought to the overall
                situation and I think that you should proceed a step at a
                time so as to reduce any unnecessary expenditure to a minimum.
                                I                                   am confident that in considering the granting of a
                Certificate the Local Authority is unlikely to raise any
                difficulties with regard to the North Stand and the West Stand.
                You may be vulnerable so far as spion cop is concerned since
                there may be a significant reduction in the number of
                 spectators permitted, unless there is an increase in the
                 number of t                      barriers or possibly some strengthening.                                         The
                 South Stand may also be questioned with regard to its fire
                    resistance and the consequent need for speedier evacuation of
                    spectators.
                               As a first step,                                       I suggest you commission an outline
                    survey of the standing accommodation plus the South Stand,
                which should only be taken sufficiently far as to give you an
                    idea of the possible loss of spectator capacity if no remedial
                w o r k is carried out,                                        and also to give you an idea of the
                    possible cost of remedial wo r k if the present capacity is to
                    be maintained.                                                                                                         a.
                                                                       Registered in England - No   1134531

    EASTWOOD Er PARTNERS




             Should you decide that it is appropriate to commission a
      first stage survey and report on these lines,   I would suggest
      that an expenditure limit of say £500 should be imposed o n
      whoever you employ to carry out the work.
             I       am sure that if there is any aspect of the matter
      which you would like to discuss you will not hesitate to give
      me a ring.
             Yours sincerely,

              Dear Mr Whitehead

                       As promised, I have looked through the list of drawings
             by Husband and Company and have extracted those which I
              think will provide the information needed in an application
              for a Certificate of Safety.
                   X am sending a copy of this list to Mr England, of course,
              together with a copy of this letter.

    Dear Mr. England,
              Mr. Whitehead very kindly let me have a sight of
     the prints which he had obtained from Husband & Co.                                                          Even
     though these do not contain all the information we would
     require*they give sufficient to make the task relatively
     easy so far as the North stand and West stand are concerned.
     I have now returned the prints to Mr. Whitehead but we have
     taken photo-copies to keep on our file.
               If you wish to go so far as making an application for
      a Certificate w e shall still need to survey the South
      stand and Spion Cop.                                              But as I said in my letter last week,
      for an expenditure not exceeding £500 we would be able to
      take the survey sufficiently far to let you have a report
      on what would be involved (if anything)                                                       in bringing the
      ground up to standard, and alternatively, what would be the
      likely effect on the ground capacity in any Certificate if
      you do not carry out any improvements for the time being.


                                                                                                 Yours sincerely

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act. 1975

Referring to my letter of 13th S eptem ber, 1978, the standard form of General
Safety Certificate recommended by the Officer Working Party to be used in
South Yorkshire has now been accepted by the County Committee concerned.

I fe e l it would be of mutual benefit if the Officer Working Party were now to
have a prelim inary m eeting with the Club. If you ag ree, could you kindly let
me have a number of dates which would be convenient to the Club.

In the m eantim e, I would mention that I am s till awaiting the detailed
information and plans referred to in the, concluding paragraph of my letter
of 13th September.

                                                        Yours faithfully,




                                                        Chief Executive.

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

    I thank you for your letter of 1 st December.

    Following my letter of 30th November and the telephone conversation which
    Mr. D . V aughan of my staff had with you today, arrangements are being made for
    the Officer Working Party to be present at the Hillsborough Stadium at 10. 30 a.m .
    on Wednesday next, 13th December, 1978, for a preliminary meeting with the
    Club.

    A sm all word of explanation on the'constitution of the Officer Working Party may
    be helpful. The County Committee concerned decided that the approach must be
    multi-disciplinary, and accordingly, the Working Party consists of representatives
    of the Police, the Fire Service, the D istrict Council Building Surveyor's
    Department, with co-ordination being undertaken by the County Council's
    Administration Department.

    It may also be helpful if the Club were aware in advance of the meeting of the terms
    and conditions contained in the standard farm of General Safety Certificate.
    Accordingly, two copies of the draft are attached for your information.

                                                         Yours faithfully,


     enclosure

      Note of a meeting between the Officer Working Party (Sheffield D istrict)
                 and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited

PRESENT:    Representing the Club

            Representing the Working Party

            H. B. Dimstan (South Yorkshire Comity F ire Service)
            D. Hurst (South Yorkshire Police}

     On behalf of tne Club, Mr. Whitehead welcomed the Working Party and gave the
     apologies at the Chairman, Mr. fi= E , McGee. Mr. Whitehead str esse d that tne
     Club wished to see the Stadium used for big matches as-regularly as possib le.

    For the County Council, it was emphasized that the aim of the meeting was purely
    exploratory so that any possible points of misunderstanding could hopefully be
    cleared before the forma] p rocess began.

    During the course of the discussion, the following points w ere rnade;-

     (a)   the Stadium had been used for many capacity matches over the years and
            its safety record was the equal of any in the country;

     (b)   if the Code of P ractice w ere to be applied literally, then there would
            probably be minor discrepancies such as in the width of the steps on the
            Spion Kop and in the width of the gangways and exits in the Stands;
(c)    in order to form a base from which to work, all of the crush barriers
        would require to be tested initially, with up to 2 0 % tested annually
        thereafter;

(d)    it was likely that the fire risk in the North and West stands would be
        minimal, but the main stand would probably require more detailed
        attention: however, only a detailed inspection by the Fire Service would
         reveal the true position;

(e)    the police would be happy with the existing position of the P olice Control
        Centre, but felt the present structure would not meet their requirements;

(f)    the North and West Stands were m odem structures, but the main stand
        had originally been built som e 50 years ago and there w ere now no
        records, which would mean that a complete survey of this would be
        necessary;

(g)    the only activity which normally took place at the Stadium other than
        football w as the Annual Jehovah’s W itness Rally, and an endeavour would
        be made to make provision for this in the General Safety Certificate so as
        to obviate the need for the Special Safety Certificate procedure;

(h)    to avoid needless complication should a change of Club Secretary occur,
        the Certificate would be in the name of the Club with a nominated person
        being notified in writing to the County Council;

(i)    as regards the draft General Safety Certificate

       (a)    the definition of 'Holder" would need to be amended,

       (b)    paragraph 8 of Part 2 would need the words "of medicine" adding
               after the word ’'doctor",

       (c)    paragraph 12(3) of Part 2 would need amending by deleting the
              fir st liae and substituting the words "On the day of a Specified
              Activity and not le s s than three hours prior to its commencement
              the",

       (d)    the f?re warning system referred to in paragraph 13(1) of Part 2
               would be the subject of consultation between the Chief Fire Officer
               and the Club.

0)     the County Council would require the detailed information and plans referred
        to in the concluding paragraph of the le tter dated 13th September, 1378 from
        the Chief Executive to the Club before any formal progress could be made on
        the application.

At the invitation of the Club, the Working Party took the opportunity of carrying out
an informal inspection of the Stadium in company with the Club's representatives.
                           SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS             13.12.78
Preliminary Meeting attended by:-

                       Messrs. R. Whitehead, K.T. Addy, E. England (Sheffield Wednesday)
                       Dr. W. Eastwood (Consultant Engineer)
                       Messrs. D. Shirtcliff, D. Vaughan (Admin. Dept. - S.Y.C.C.)
                       Mr. Mullarky (Architects Dept. - S.Y.C.C.)
                       Supt. D. Hurst, Supt. W. O'Neil (South Yorks. Police Authority)
                       Deputy Chief Fire Prevention Officer B. Dunstan, Divisional
                         Officer K. Jones, Station Officer          (Fire Service)
                       Mr. Sherriff, Mr. Mills (Dist« Council Building Authority)

Mr. R. Whitehead in the Chair opened the meeting and apologised for the
absence of our Chairman, Mr. H.E. McGee»

Dr. Eastwood gave his views on what might be required to be done in
the different sections of the ground. It was thought it might not be
necessary to test all barriers to 400 lb, but the general feeling
appeared to be that it was essential to test them. Peak viewing areas
was debateable, and it might well cover all standing areas - a point
the police stressed. Entrances, Exits, Gangways, etc., particularly
in the Seated areas, were not 100% in keeping with the Guide Lines,
and it was thought the Fire Prevention Officer may insist on us con­
forming exactly with their suggestions or interpretation of the Code -
a lot that was said was in fact speculation as other than us , no-one
had knowledge of the ground lay-out. - The whole party did have a
tour of the Ground before leaving.

Dr* W. Eastwood would have plans available early in the New Year and
after these had been presented to the County Council, a meeting would
be arranged, probably with the Fire Prevention Officers and the
District Building Authority.

                      This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
   w h i c h is attainable.
                      It deals in broad terms w i t h the necessary strengthening
   and supplementati on of the crush barriers on the terraces,                                                                     and
   calculat ions are made of the theoretical exit times'.
                      Calculations of exit times are also made for each of
  the stands and reference is made to the observations ■which were
  made at the end of the third round cup-tie on 6 January,                                                                      1979.

 will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the

  fire officer and the police.

     Standing A c c o m mo dation
     (a)      Spion Ko p
                       The general layout of Spion K o p is good.          It
              has a very adequate number of gangways, w i t h spacings
             well below the m a x imum laid down in the guide.            The
              slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
              for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                       The only questions therefore are the adequacy
              of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
              permitted spectators,        and the capacity and nature of
              the exits.
                       Where the barriers are adequate in strength
              and spacing,     the guide recommends that the number
              of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m            of plan
              area.     Disreg arding the gangways the area of Spion
                                               2
              Kop is approxi mately 3120m          whic h would provide
              accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                        Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
              standards.       Category A must be able to withstand a
              test load of 6kN/metrewidth (400 lb/foot approximately)
              and Cat egory B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre          (290 lb/foot)
              In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
              and B r o c k leba nk Ltd.    Of the 101 barriers on Spion
              Kop,    21 failed to carry the test load of 4 0 0 lb and
              a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
              incipient defect wh i c h needed attention.          Most of
              those wh i c h failed the test,       failed so ba dly that they
              wo uld probably not satisfy category B standard either.
              On the other hand,       it w as sometimes only one part of a
              long barrier w h i c h was weak.       It should be emphasised
               that the general situation was satisfactory compared
              w i t h most grounds.
                        Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
                                                                     SHEET   3.

 barriers up to a uniform category A standard.                It
 should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
 the tests and there ma y have been some deterioration
 due to rusting.          Most of the barriers are made from
 2§" diameter tube whic h only has a thickness of 0.192
 inches wh e n new.        Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield's
 atmosphere,    but certain parts of the barriers are subject
 to more rusting than others and it is possible that
 there will be an increase in the number needing attention.
           Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/m,         the
 maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
 guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5             to 2.9m
 for slopes of 30°.          These figures apply to 'peak v i e w i n g ’
 areas.       Most of Spion Kop has a slope of about 17
 for whic h the recommended spacing is 3.6m.             The slope of the
 upper part      changes to 2 5° for which the spacing is
 3. lm.
           Whilst we believe it is arguable that parts of
 Spion K o p could be considered as not being          'peak
 viewing areas' we are prepared to accede to the police
 view and use peak viewing area standards for all barriers.
 This also applies to the stands at the west end of the
 ground.
           We propose that the existing barriers should be
 supplemented by new ones as shown in red on the attached
 drawing 1610/1X.          The green shaded area behind each
 barrier shows the area which can then be assumed to be
                                                          2
 available for spectators.           This area is 2958m        which
                      n
 at 54 persons/lOm         gives a capacity of 15,973.          It
 should be kept in mind that as many as 20,000 spectators
 have been admitted to the Ko p in the past.
                                                                           SHEET   4.

                    Spion Kop has three exits,    one near each
            end and one at the top.         The total width of
            these three exits at their narrowest points is 1 2 .5m.
            The guide assumes a m a x imum flow rate through such
            exits of 60 persons per minute for each 550mm of
            width.      Thus the theoretical time to discharge
            16,0 00 spectators from Spion Kop would be Ilf minutes,
            compared w i t h a m a x imum of 8 minutes indicated by the
            guide.      We do not consider this to be a serious
            matter.      Rapid evacuation (in say 8 minutes)       is very
            desirable for stands where there may be a risk due to
            fire,    or explosion,   or structural failure.       In the
            case of terracing it is only the impatience of spectators
            wh i c h might create danger.    We believe that for an
            interim period at least the evacuation time of I I 4
            minutes should be acceptable.
                       The exits at each end of the terrace are
            re asonabl y free from hazards,      except the one at the North
            end passes under a bridge with a headroom below the
            recommended value of 8 ft.       This defect could be
            removed by lowering the floor level, but we believe
            it is far from essential to have such a large headroom,
            and the cost of modification is not justified in an
            existing structure.
                       The exit at the back of Spion Kop would benefit
             from h andrails dividing it into lanes.          Some remodelling
             of the approaches to the ramp may also be thought
             desirable.

     (b)     The West Terrace    (Including Lower Level at Nor t h W e st C o r n e r )
                       The west terrace has a total area of 1480m           but
             there are no gangways.       We feel that some allowance should


                                                                              s/
                                                                        SHEET    5.

            be made for circulation space as spectators have
            to move      quite considerable horizontal distances
            to achieve good packing.             The full area would
            justify about 8000 spectators,           but we suggest it would
            probably be appropriate to allow 10% as the equivalent
            of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.
            The barriers should be designed to match this figure
            approximately.       Those barriers which cannot withstand
             6kN/m should be appropriately strengthened,          and extra
             ones provided where necessary.
                       The extra barriers required to achieve
             a pprox imately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
             attached copy of drawing 1610/2X.
                       The three exits have a total width of about
             11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
             to leave the ground.       Thus the terrace could be
             emptied in about six minutes wh ich is very satisfactory.
                       The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
             should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.           There are
             no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
             exit.      But we feel this is of no consequence as
             movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
             and quick.

      (c)    The N o r t h West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                       This area is also illustrated in the drawing
             1610/2X.      The gross area available (there are no
             gangways)    is about   565 m 2 .     Thus if the crush barriers
             were adequate and the whole area is included the number
             of spectators could be about 3,050.
                       Provided the existing crush barriers are
             brought up to standard and supplemented in red as


                                                                           S i

           shown on our drawing 1610/2X,   the area which can
           be used in calculating spectator capacity is that
                                                         2
           shown in green.     This area is about 535m       corresponding
           to about 2900 spectators.     This would bring the total
           standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                    The exits serving this part of the terraces
           are very adequate in width and there will be no
           difficulty in emptying in eight minutes.


    Seating Accommodation
    (a)    The North Stand
                    The form of construction of this stand is
           such that it presents a minimum fire hazard.          The
           exits are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy
           the recommendations of the guide.
                    The exits are very marginally below the
           recommended l*lm width, but we do not consider this
           to be of great consequence.
                    Gangways are only 640mm wide for much of their
           length (they widen round the exit).     This is well
           below the green guide recommendation.      However,     it
            is clearly appropriate to take into account the
           general nature of the stand, the number as well as
           the width of the gangways, and above all the ease and
            speed   with which spectators can evacuate the stand.
                    On 6 January we counted the number of spectators
           leaving in successive minutes after the final whistle.
           The figures were 71, 72, 80 and 73.     Thereafter
            the number fell off as the spectators were in no hurry.
           This established that in an emergency the green guide
            figure of 80 per minute (relating to a l*lm gangway)
            can be achieved.    With 18 exits for 10,000 spectators
                                                                 SHEET   7.

   the average is 556 per exit.          Thus the stand would
   empty in about seven minutes, which is within the
   recommended limit of eight minutes.
                 Our observations in company with the fire
   officer’s staff on 6 January showed that everyone
   had left this stand, apart from some people who were
   in no hurry,         in about six minutes, although we also
   counted about 40 per exit who left before the final
   whistle.           The overall picture appears very satisfactory
    and we suggest that this stand should be accepted
    as not needing any significant modification.

   The West Stand
          This stand is very similar to the north stand
    in its construction.          We were not able to accurately
    assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
    January because there were many seats which were unsold.
    However,         there is every reason to believe that there
    will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
    eight minutes also.          There should be no need for
    significant modifications.

    The South Stand
           The structure has been surveyed and appended
    are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
     show the plans and cross-section.          Also attached is
     a seating plan, drawing No. 1610/6.
            The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
     has 5710 seats.          These are served by 12 exits (excluding
     those serving the directors box) so that an average
     of 476 people need to pass through each exit.           The
     count by the fire officer’s staff on 6 January showed
     an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
     exit which corresponds to an emptying time of about
     seven minutes.         Indeed there were very few people
                                                                     SHEET

            still trying to get out six minutes after the final
            whistle.       A few had no doubt left early and a few
            were still standing around, but the stand had
            substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                    Having left the top of the stand the spectators
             have to make their way from the first floor landing
             via one of three staircases.      Two of these are 3.6m
             wide and the other 2.4.      This is equivalent to 17*
             ’lan es ’ of 550mm.    At 40 people per lane, 700 people
             pass per minute.      To discharge 5710 people (less
             those in the directors box) will therefore take almost
             exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.
                        At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
             almost straight to the open air,     through a compartment
             which is separated from the main part of the building.
             The third staircase passes through a wide lobby which
             will probably need three sets of self closing fire
             doors to separate it from the remainder of the building
             The club intends to move the paint store from the
              space behind this staircase.
                     The front, open-air part of the south stand is
              well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
              one passage.      This passage has a theoretical capacity
              of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.
              This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.      Because
              the stand is open to the air and there is very
              ready access to the pitch we do not think this rather
              long emptying time is of any great consequence.


       General R e q u irements
              The police and the fire officer, and possibly the
       Building Surveyor, will no doubt wish to discuss a number of
       matters.    Prior to holding a further formal meeting they
                                                                     SHEET   9.

    will probably wish to study the drawings and to pay a
     further visit.    We would like to be present when any
     further inspection is made and would appreciate contact
     being made with Dr. Wood during Dr. Eastwood’s absence
     which will extend to 15 February.
            If the police would like to suggest the kind of police
     post they would like,    this can be considered by the club
     and drawings prepared by us as a matter of urgency.
            A meeting to discuss all aspects of the application
     might be held around say 16 February.
            In the meantime Eastwood & Partners will be checking
     the various electrical services so that we shall be in a
     position to discuss these at the meeting.


     Future Ground Capacity
            Following the upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
     out of such other works as may be required it is hoped the
     ground capacity will not fall below 50,000 made up as follows
            Seating approximately                24,000
            Standing on Spion Kop                16,000
            Standing at Leppings Lane end
            (total including N.W.    corner)     10,100

                                                  50,100

            It will be recalled that in recent years agreement
     has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
     be admitted to the ground.      This involved of the order of
     19.000 - 20,000 spectators being on Spion Kop.        Indeed,   it
     is believed that in the days when crowds of approximately
     70.000 were accommodated in the ground,    the figure on Spion
     Kop probably approached 30,000.
            It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
     excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

Mr. H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the b est in Europe, Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and it was hoped to expand this side of the Club's a ctiv ities. The Club's
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

       necessary steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts
       before encasing in concrete for permanent protection.
             In inspecting the two b a s e s twaste paper, and shavings
       of wood together with cigarette ends were found in considerable

showing the proposed new crush barrier layout, including the two lines of radial
b a r r ie rs. This was AGREED in principle.

Para. 3 - A 16, 850 crowd capacity on the Kop a s existing would mean an unacceptable
evacuation time of som e 12^ m inutes. Larger and re-allgned gates in the barrier
and Improvement of the existing upper exit could reduce this tim e to som e 1 0 minutes,
but 8 minutes could only be achieved by installing a new exit of 3 m etre overall width.
This could be integrated into the proposed future schem e for enlarging and roofing the
Kop. The Club AGREED to give consideration to the proposals.


                                       1.
Para. 4 - The exploratory work regarding the Improvement of the headroom had
still to be carried out, b it was not expected to be a major item.

P ara. 5 - Because o f the difficulty in devising a suitable method of testing in places
(such as the top of the Kop), it was AGEEED that proposals should be formulated
after further discussion s between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

P ara. 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
structure should be looked at. It was AGBEED that the question of the height of some
of the crush barriers be considered again after it was seen which of them failed on
testing.

P ara. 7 - The Club str e sse d that their proposals for the improvement of the means of
e g r e s s would hopefully be carried out in the shorter rather than the longer term future.

P ara. 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush b a rriers, together with
the installation of the new crush barrier layout and alteration of the ga tes in the existing
barrier, could all be carried out in the clo se sea so n . Their aim was to achieve a
16, 850 crowd capacity.

2B     West T errace

Para. 2 - The Club accepted that in view of the c r o s s -fa ll on the north-w est corner
exit, the steps should be re-built. It was AGREED that the other m atters would be
considered again after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.

2C     North West Corner T errace

Para. 2 - Whilst accepting the need for the improvement or replacem ent of the
existing corrugated sheeting, the Club fe lt they wished to consider whether to carry
out more extensive works so a s to bring the existing unused area into use for an
additional 250/300 sp ecta tors.

3.     North Stand

Para. 1 - Dr. Eastwood, the Building Surveyors and the Fire Service had reached
agreem ent on a schem e which could be recommended to the Club. This would
involve the removal of 10 seats from each of the 9 gangways and 4 sea ts from in
front of each of the 9 upper ex its. The result would mean a lo ss of 126 sea ts
compared to the 225 in the original proposals. The Club AGEEED to give
consideratiai to the proposal.

p a ra . 2 - The word at the end of the fir st line should have been 'Tea' and not 'Team'.
It w a s AGEEED that Dr. Eastwood and the F ire Service would discuss in detail any
fire protection works considered to be n ecessa ry .
4.     W e s t Stand

The Club AGREED that additional exits o f simple ste el construction should be
provided from each end of the upper stand.

5,      South Stand

Para, 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor tim ber.
Whilst rusting was not e x c e s siv e , it was AGREED    that a ll bases would be exposed for
Inspection and, if necessary, s te e l plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
encasing in concrete for permanent protection. Eecause of the apparent accumulation
of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
Club also AGREED that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.

para, 2 - Provided the penning barriers were removed entirely, It was AGREED that
It would not be necessary to rem ove any seats for escape purposes in the upper part
of the stand (the covered area).

Para. 3 - It was AGREED that tim ber handrails should be provided down each of the
outer edges of the main staircase; that the existing Iron centre railing should remain,
and that a new handrail down the centre of each side of the stairway should be installed.
It was also AGREED that the brick sta ir ca se w alls should be buttressed where crowd
guige pressure could be generated.

Para. 4 - So far as the front open air part of the stand was concerned, it was AGREED
that on the west side a new exit through a new 1 . 2 m etre wide door adjacent to the existing
snack bar should be provided, with appropriate fire resistance m easures in the
surrounding area. On the e a st side, consideration was given to an extension of the
footway at the front of the stand and the rem oval of the wall, provided the new exit was
Isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service
should consider precisely what m easures could be considered satisfactory s o as to
avoid any loss of s e a t s .

 6.     Ground Exits

 The 1:500 site plan was in the p r o c ess of being circulated.

 7.     Communications

 The Club str esse d they were thinking in term s of an upgrading of the existing public
 address s ystem . It was AGREED that the Police should have an over-rid e facility
 from their P olice Room, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look into the possibility of
 achieving this through radio, rather than w ire, m eans.

 8.      Police and F ir s t Aid F acilities

 P aras. 1 & 2 - The P olice str e sse d that It was essential that there was no gap in
 the provision of Police F acilities when the temporary structure was replaced by
 the permanent structure. With this in mind, they were happy for the safety aspects
to receiv e fir st priority and to wait for the 1980 clo se season for the work to be
carried out. It was understood that Dr.             had not yet completed his investigations
into the first-a id and m edical fa c ilitie s.

9.     Any other Topics

The evening of the 27th April was agreed as mutually convenient to te st the existing
em ergency lighting equipment.

10.    Future Action

Mr. McGee str e s se d that it was essen tia l for decisions to be taken urgently if the
Club were to complete their plans, both from a financial and practical point of view.

The Club were to make application for financial a ssista n ce under the Football
A ssociation's Ground Improvement Scheme, and had to have over 50, 000 crowd
capacity if the aim of attracting international matches was to be achieved. The la test
proposals, if implemented, appeared to give a capacity of som e 50, 750.

So that they could be noted and returned for agreem ent, the Working Party asked for
2 copies of all plans (as revised) to be supplied by Dr. Eastwood, esp ecia lly to the
F ire Service and the Building Surveyor.

Mr. McGee requested that he be advised if it appeared that any undue delay was
occurring a s the Club wished to ensure that the certification procedure proceeded without
delay.

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

    Following approval by the County Council and clarification of certain
    structural aspects of the South Stand construction, I am new able to formally
    issue the attached General Safety Certificate in respect of the Hillsborough
    Stadium.

    As previously mentioned to you, the fee payable has yet to be determined by
    the County Council and I will, of course, contact you further on this point
    as soon as possible.

    I would particularly draw your attention to the following paragraphs of
    Schedule 2 of the Certificate:-

    8 (1) -    the existing First Aid facilities are accepted on an interim basis
               only pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1980
               close season;

    12(1) - the arrangements for Emergency Lighting in the South Stand (as set
            out in the letter from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners to the South
            Yorkshire County Fire Service dated 12th December, 1979) are
            regarded as acceptable only for the duration of the existing
            battery life;

    14    - the existing Police facilities are accepted on an interim basis only
            pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1980 close
             season;

    30    - use of the Stadium in excessively high wind conditions
                                  and
          - use of the Stadium in excessively high snowfall conditions.

    Perhaps you would also treat this letter as the formal notice of issue required
    by Paragraph 7 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976.




    Mr. E. England,                                             1           /Should you have....

Should you have any queries on the Certificate, Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff
will be happy to discuss them with you.

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity of recording the County Council1s
appreciation of the co-operation and goodwill which the Club and its Consultants
has extended to the Officer Working Party over the months of the necessarily
involved detailed investigations.

                                          Yours faithfully,

P.S.   Whilst it may be stating the obvious, the issue of the Certificate is
       of course, conditional on payment of such fee as may be determined by
       the County Council.

F o r the attention of Mr.D. Vaugha n


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                        Sheffie ld W e dn esda y Football Club Ltd
          I believe that the County Council wish to have one fifth
of the crush barriers te sted each ye a r so that they will all be
tested during each five year cycle.                                                          The first batch were
to be tested approxi mate ly seven months from the date of issue
of the certificate of ground safety.
          The Club has therefore asked us to carry out this years
quo ta of tests and it is our intention to carry out the work
commencing on Monday, 21 July.                                                          There are approximately 185
ba rrie rs in total and it w o u l d be possible to either test b arri ers
1,    6, 11 etc. or Nos.                                      1 - 3 7 .approximately.                     It woul d be v e r y
mu c h easier and q u i ck er to test one block of 37 barriers rather
than testing every fifth b a r r i e r throughout the ground because
the testing e q uip ment is ve r y h eavy and requires a considerable
amount of m an handling.                                                     There should be a considerable saving in
cost if all the barriers tested are in one block.
          We have disc usse d the m a t t e r wit h Mr. D. Sheriff of the
Sh ef f i e l d Building Surveyors depa rtment and he sees n o objection
to us taking the e as ier and therefo re cheaper course.                                                              Unless we
hea r from you to the contrary this is wha t we will do.

     Dear Sirs,

     Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 -
     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited

     I thank you for your letter dated 15th July.

     After consultations with the Building Authority and in view of the fact
     that all of the barriers were tested prior to certification, the County
     Council is able to agree this year with the course of action which you
     propose. However, I would stress that this agreement is conditional
     upon it being recognised and accepted that it is without prejudice as
     to what may be required in future years under the provisions of paragraph
     25(2) of the Safety Certificate.

     May I also mention the Certificates by:-

     (a)      a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer (as required by
              paragraph 24 of the Safety Certificate) as to all structural
              parts of the Stadium, excluding crush barriers and handrails;

     (b)      an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
              26 of the Safety Certificate) as to the electrical installation
              within the Stadium; and

     (c)      an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
              12(2) of the Safety Certificate) as to the condition of the
              Emergency Power Supply.

     I take it that if the Club has not already done so, they will shortly be
     requesting you to supply these.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

Confirming the recent telephone conversation which
Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff had with your Secretary in
your absence, a request has been received from the
Humberside County Council for a discussion on various
aspects of the above-named Act.

As discussed, it would be most helpful and very much
appreciated if representatives of the County Council's
Officer Working Party along with representatives of the
Humberside County Council could visit the Hillsborough
Stadium at 2 p.m. on Thursday, 11th September, 1980,
to enable some of the practical difficulties which were
encountered in the Certification process and the methods
used with the Club's co-operation to overcome them to
be pointed out.

                                        Yours faithfully

Dear Eric,
                                          Certificate of Safety 1980
                    The crush barriers which recently failed the test were
retested yesterday and I am now in a position to sign a
certificate concerning all 39 of this year's batch.                                                              I spoke
to David Vaughan yesterday and he requested that before I issue
my certificate there should be a joint inspection with Mr. Sherrif
of the Town Hall.                                   As Mr.                    Sherrif is on holiday this w ee k it appears
that we cannot complete the formalities for another week or so.


                                                                                       Yours sincerely,

Dear Eric,
                 inspection in Company wit h Licensing Authority Representative
                 As I told you, it was not possible to make the joint inspection
 in company with Mr. Sherriff last week as he was on holiday.                                                          He
has been catching u p in the office this week,                                               so we have arranged
 to look round the ground at 2.00 p.m. on Thursday,                                                 28 August.
We will call on you to pay our compliments but I wou ld not think
 it necessary for you to accompany us, unless you so wish.

  Dear Eric,
                       Annual Inspection and Certificates as Required in the
                           Conditions Attached to the Certificate of Ground
                                                                                      Safety
                       I            now have pleasure in enclosing two copies of my certificate
  relating to the structural aspects of the ground and two copies of
  each of two certificates signed by Tony Clough relating to the
  electrical installation in general and to his test of the emergency
   lighting system.
                       As you will see the I.E.E. certificate applicable to the
  various electrical works carried out in the last year under our
   control is for five years, this being the maximum time permitted.
   The certificate relating to the wiring of the North and West stands
   is limited to two years because of their age.
                       Also enclosed is a note of a number of points which I had
  noted or which were raised during the inspection by the local
   authority representatives.                                                          Some of them are maintenance items
  which should be attended to shortly and I will discuss these with
   you.                    Some of the points are ones which have been raised before
  by the local authority and which I have said we will attend to when
   convenient.                       The inspection of the roof steelwork and timbers
   of the south stand was you will recall the subject of rather
   difficult discussions which I had with the City Building Surveyor
    last December.                              We promised, as a compromise, to have a 'one day
                                                                 R e g is t e r e d in E n g la n d -   No. 1 1 3 4 5 3 1                             &

  inspection1 of part of the roof from a scaffold 'in a year's
  time'.   To keep faith we should obviously make that inspection
  round about the turn of the year.        After that we can make a
  decision as to whether or when a further part of the roof should
  be inspected.

                    ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED
                                    BY THE CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


                    On various dates in July I made inspections and had
  approximately one-fifth of the crush barriers tested by members
  of my staff under my control.                                                         A final inspection was made on
  28 August in company with Mr. D. Sheriff C.Eng., M.I.Struct.E.
  of the City of Sheffield Building Surveyor's Department, acting
  on behalf of the licensing authority.
                    In my opinion the various structures on the ground are in a
  satisfactory condition and appropriate for the stadium to be used
  to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of Ground Safety.
                    The crush barriers Nos.                                            1-39   (see our drawing No. 1610/63)
 were tested in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Guide
  to Safety at Football Grounds on 21-23 July.                                                                       Certain barriers
  suffered excessive deflection, generally on the second or third
  cycle of the test load.                                                In some other cases retaining clips had
  to be replaced.                              The barriers concerned were Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15,
  17, 18, 24, 26 and 34.                                                 After remedial work these barriers were
  successfully re-tested on 11 August.
                    I            am now able to certify that all 39 barriers have a satisf
  strength.
                    Certain items of maintenance work which it is suggested should
  be carried out at an appropriate time have been recommended to the
  club.                 A list is attached.

                     Items of maintenance which it is suggested should be carried
   out in the reasonably near future.


   1.                Some of the fencing posts at the top of the Kop need painting
                     near the base.


   2.                The fencing at the rear side of the gangway over the lower
                     exit from the Kop is becoming very corroded.


   3.                The concrete posts forming part of the retaining wall at the
                     foot of the bank, at the rear of the Kop (behind Penistone
                     Road turnstiles)                            are showing signs of spalling due to
                     corrosion of the reinforcement.                                           The cracks should be repaired
                     with either liquid epoxy or by epoxy mortar.


   4.                The Denso tape wrapping on some of the starter bars at the
                     back of the North West corner is coming loose.


   5.                Cracks running from the top to near the bottom of the concrete
                     terrace at the North West corner have grown more pronounced
                     in the past year with salts leached out of the concrete

                  ELECTRICAL INSPECT IO N




     The installation referred to in the attached
Inspection Certificate, has been examined and tested in
accordance with Section E of the Institution of
Electrical Engineers Wiring Regulations.

     The inspection was conducted without dismantling
any equipment or examining concealed wiring and is
intended only to provide an assessment of the electrical
safety of the installation.     It is not intended to
determine the condition or reliability of the
installation or the correct operation of equipment,
although we would comment on such defects when they are
apparent.

     The tests which involve disconnection of certain
circuits are electrical and provide a measure of
electrical safeness of the complete installation,
including concealed wiring, at the time of the test.
They would not however provide any guide to latent
mechanical faults in hidden cables due to lack of
support,   tautness, sharp edges and other physical hazards

     The Inspection Certificate shows our comments      (if
any) regarding apparent non-compliance with I.E.E.
Regulations and any failure to meet the Test requirements
We also indicate our recommendations when we consider
remedial action is necessary.

     Dear Sir,

     Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

     I thank you for the Certificates enclosed with your letter dated
     16th September.

     Whilst these are generally acceptable for the purposes of the Conditions of
     the General Safety Certificate, I would make the following points

     (a)   paragraph 12(2) of the General Safety Certificate requires a certificate
           from an independent Electrical Engineer as to the condition of the
           Emergency Power Supply at least once in each period of twelve months;

     (b)   certain additional points to those mentioned in the certificate required
           by paragraphs 24 and 25 have been taken up directly between the Building
           Authority and the Club's Consultants, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners;

     (c)   paragraph 26 of the General Safety Certificate requires a certificate from
           an independent Electrical Engineer not less than once in each period of
           twelve months as to the electrical installation within the Stadium; and

     (d)   paragraph 29 of the General Safety Certificate requires that the Stadium
           facilities and structures shall be maintained as existing at the date of
           the Certificate and that no alterations shall be made unless prior notice
           in writing is given to the County Council in accordance with paragraph
           5(2) (which requires at least 21 days written notice to the County
           Council before any proposal to carry out any alterations or extension
           of the Stadium or its installations is begun).

     An additional copy of this letter is attached in case you should wish to pass
     it to the Club's Consultants.

                                                   Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Further to your letter of the 7th November, all your
points are noted, and the additional copy of your letter
has been forwarded to Eastwood & Partners.

Under Paragraph *d’ can I point out what is happening
at the moment at Hillsborough:-

  We are presently building showers and changing
  accommodation attached to the gymnasium at the
  back of the North Stand. This in no way in­
  fringes on any part of the stadiuia nor does
  it impede or restrict any entrances or gang­
  ways. Planning permission etc. has all been
  granted by our local council.
  Our caterers in conjunction with ourselves are
  erecting a Chip Shop at the back of Spion Kqp.
  Here again, planning permission etc. has been
  granted by our local council, and the work is
  out to tender.
  Our present disco unit is now being used as a
  police control room, and the area below it is
  being built in and made into a new disco unit.
South Yorkshire County Council            11th November 1980


   In the erabryo stage we are considering extending our
   reception lounge, moving our kitchen area and building
   a new Directors* Rotaa. This, o f course, is all within
   our own domestic area, and in no way will it interfere
   with adnission or exit of the public; and the Leppings
   Lane end of the car park under the South Stand which
   is an open area, this particular area along with the
   rooms which axe behind it are being looked at with a
   view to constructing a social club.

If any further infornation is required, please do not
hesitate to contact me.

Yours faithfully,




Secretary

 For the attention of Mr. E. England


 Dear Mr. England.
                       Safety of Spotts Ground Act 1975
                    Thank you for sending me a copy of the letter from
 South Yorkshire County Council dated 7 November 1980.
                    In the letter Mr. Vaughan raises a number of points
 and our comments are as follows


  (a)              We did of course carry out the test of the emergency
                    power supply and this is covered by Mr. Clough's
                    certificate dated 11 August 1980.                                            The certificate
                    is headed "Emergency Lighting Inspection and Test
                    Certificate" which might have given the impression that
                    only the lighting circuits etc. were tested but it will
                    be seen that on sheet 2 we certified that the battery
                    system is working properly.                                      It is not unreasonable
                    that the batteries should have to be tested annually
                    and subject to your approval we w ill do this.


   (b)             I have not h ad any contact wit h the Building Authority
                    representatives other than the joint inspection which
                    was made on 28 August.                                    During that inspection the

             certificate dated 11 September were discussed.       The
             Local Authority representatives also mentioned
             possible rounding off of the steel cantilevering
             to form the emergency exit from the West stand,
             the possible hazard of the concrete step near the
             top exit from Spion Kop and the possibility of
             placing a rail in front of certain glass panels within
             the South stand.     It will be recalled that we
             indicated at the meeting prior to the semi-final
             in the spring that these three matters would be attended
             to in due course    (even though the fire officers
             did not consider the rail in front of the glass was
             necessary).      However we also indicated that in our
             view these were such minor matters that they did not
             need attention within the immediate future.        No
             doubt the Club can give consideration to carrying them
             out as part of the normal maintenance programme or
             alternatively,    of course, we can include them
             with any future works which are carried out under
             our control for the Club.


    (c)      I am a little at a loss to know wha t is meant by
             this particular paragraph.      It is absolutely normal
             for IEE certificates to be issued for periods
             which may be as long as five years for completely new
             installations.      Within our firm we carry out inspection
             work in many types of building including, for example,
             schools.      Where the electrical installation is
             completely new it is standard practice for the certificate
             to be valid for five years.      We have issued such a
              certificate for the wiring of the South stand which has
             been completely renewed under our control and also for
              the emergency lighting which has been completely rewired.
              In the case of the North and West stands, we have issued
              a certificate for two years, this period being based
/                                                                          SHEET



    EASTW OOD £r PARTNERS




                 on the results of the test which we carried out
                 and the known age of the installation.

                 We would strongly resist any suggestion that the whole
                 of the electrical installation should be inspected
                 every year and I suggest that the South Yorkshire
                 County Council be asked whether that is their
                 intention or whether they merely wish to see a
                 further copy of our two year and five year certificates
                 in 1981.'   Perhaps it is appropriate to point out
                 that because of the lengths of the various runs of
                 cable within the stadium and because of the complexity
                 of the electrical system,   the checking of the North
                 and West stands plus the various outside circuits
                 which was carried out during the summer of 1980 cost
                 approximately £1000.     It w o u l d be less costly on
                 future occasions because the routing of the various
                 circuits has now been established and recorded but
                 nevertheless if the whole stadium h a d detailed checks
                 every year it is likely that it wou l d cost a four figure
                 sum.


        (d)      This paragraph is merely reminding the Club of the
                 requirement that any proposed alterations must be
                 intimated to the County Council at least 21 days
                 before they are begun.

 Mr. E. England,
 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Ltd.,
 Penistone Road,
 Sheffield.

 Dear Sir,

      Further to our meeting, we have pleasure in quoting you for the
 following repair work, all as discussed.

 a.   West Stand - Concrete wall. Prepare and make good 2 No. areas
      of spalling concrete with 'Certite' EpoxyMortar...        £10.50 v
 b.   West Stand Terrace.                 Erect scaffold towers andcheck all ekposed
      reinforcement bars;                 re-wrap with Denso tape as required.
                                                                               £ 388.00                                               -

 c.   Boundary Wall.   Hack out and repoint approximately 100 sq.yds.
      of brickwork @ £5.50 sq,yd.                               £550*00 1
 d.   Ladies toilets.   Hack out and repoint approximately 20 sq.yds.
      of brickwork @ £5*50 sq.yd.                              £110.00
 y
 '    It is our opinion that the first length of the boundary wall will
 require 75^ of the brickwork repointing and the remainder of the wall
 will require pointing in isolated areas.   However, all of the brickwork
 can be remeasured on completion and be charged at the rate of £5 .5 0 sq.yd.
 as quoted above if you choose to reduce the areas that we ourselves feel
 require re-pointing.

      We trust that the above meets with your satisfaction and approval,
 and await your further instructions.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Sherrif




Dear Sir,
                                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                                              Grou n d Safety Certificate
           You w ill recall that at the time the certificate was
being issued in December 1979 there was some discussion
concerning the condition of the roof of the South stand
and in a telephone conversation with Mr. Stenton,                                                               Dr. Eastwood
undertook to recommend to the Club that an inspection of one
of the main trusses and the adjacent timbers should be
carried out in a years time.
           The Club have agreed to this proposal and a convenient
time would be the wee k beginning Monday,                                                     12 January which
avoids a clash with first team mid-week fixtures or cup
replays.
           Attached is a sketch 3008/1 showing the proposed form of
scaffolding and platforms which w e would erect around the truss.
As you will see the platforms are arranged so that all parts of
the truss can be inspected as well as permitting close inspection
of the roof timbers in that area.                                                       We   suggest            that the first
m a j o r truss from the Penistone Road end should be the one                                                             which
is examined b u t wo u l d of course gladly                                                  change this to any           other
truss which you m a y care to suggest.
                                                                                                                             Id/

EASTW OOD & PARTNERS




       Erection of the scaffold will commence on Monday morning
   and we would telephone Mr. Sherrif to let him know the
   approximate time when the scaffolding will be complete.
  We think this will be on the Tuesday or the Wednesday.
   In order to keep down the hire charge of the scaffold and also
   to have the stand cleared for the game on the Saturday, it
  will only be possible to leave the scaffolding up for one day
   and we would much appreciate your co-operation in making the
   examination with us during that period.
       It is going to be a fairly expensive exercise for the Club
   and one which cannot be regarded as a recurring feature unless
   this inspection shows that there has been some serious
   deterioration which merits a recurring programme.    For this
   reason it is rather important that we choose so far as is
   possible either the worst or the most vulnerable part of the
   roof for the inspection and it may be that you would like to
   look round the stand to make your own choice.     This will of
   course be acceptable to the Club.
       I am sending a copy of this letter directly to Mr. Vaughan
   at South Yorkshire County Council.

 trusses plus an area of the timber roof adjacent to it
 to be inspected at close quarters.                                                                   It is proposed that
 the inspection should take place during the week commencing
Monday,                  12 January, wh i c h is free of league fixtures and the
 possibility of cup replays.                                                                  I w i l l be reporting to you thereafter.

Dear Mr. England,
                                                     South Stand Inspection of Roof
       At the time of the granting of a Certificate of Ground
Safety in December 1979, it was agreed with the Sheffield City
Council's Building Surveyor that an inspection w o u l d be made
at about this time involving one panel of the roof.                                                           This
inspection has n o w taken place and I have pleasure in letting
you have a report.


The Inspection
       The attached Fig.                                 3008/1A shows a cross-section through
the stand and the form of the scaffolding and platform
w h i c h were erected to enable the various parts of the roof
structure to be inspected at close quarters.
       The columns at the front of the Stand are at 40ft. centres
w i t h the roof trusses at one third of this spacing, that is
 13ft.     4in.         Every third truss is carried directly by the
 c o l u m n , but the two intermediate ones are supported by a
 lattice girder spanning along the stand between the columns.
       In order to gain access to as m u c h of the roof as possible
we h a d the scaffold erected either side of a roof truss which



                                                                                                                        foS
                                                              Registered in England — No. 1134531
                                                                               SHEET   2 .

   rests on a c o l u m n .   We we r e thus able to inspect a
   complete truss,      the full he ight of a column and the
   end portions of two of the lattice girders, plus of
   course the roof timbers.
        I vis i te d the ground on 13 January just as the
   scaffolding and platforms ha d been erected to ensure
   that they w ere satisfactory,       and took the opportunity to
   make my own inspection at the time.          Mr. Sheriff of
   the Building Surveyors department made his inspection
   on the morning of 14 January in company with one of
   my assistants.


   The Condition of the Roof
        The steelwork was found to be in good condition.
   There has been a small amount of rusting, but the loss
   of metal is quite negligible despite the fact that there
   is very little p a i n t left on much of the steel.       We
   measured the thickness of the various steel angles
   forming the t r u s s .    The thickness was almost exactly
   ^/16" which is no doubt the original thickness.
        The connections of the truss and the two lattice
   girders to the column head were in good c o n d i t i o n .     I
   was interested and pleased to find that the steel box
   section forming the column is filled with concrete.                  This
   wil l add very significantly to the strength, and it also
   ensures that there can be n o rusting of the interior of
   the steel box, w h i c h cannot of course be painted.
        We had p urposely chosen to inspect a part of the roof
   where there was staining of the timbers thus indicating that
   wa te r has leaked through at some time in the past           (the
   column was the first one in f ro m the east gable,       at 40ft.
   from the end of the s t a n d ) .    A penknife and a nail were
   used to probe both the boardi n g and the purlins.            In one
                                                                         SHEET   3#

  or two places there was some ver y minor rotting of a
  thin surface slice of the timber at the junction of two
  boards, but there was no rotting of the joists.           The
  overall deterioration is negligible.
       It should be kep t in m i n d that the roof was re-slated
  a few years ago.       It is likely that m ost of the water
  staining took place before that time.
       A m in o r point w h i c h can be attended to as part of the
  maintenance programme concerns the purlins either sideof
   a trap-door wh i ch has been used to gain access to the roof.
  This door is near the back of the stand and about 20ft.
  nearer to the centre than our scaffolding.          The purlins
   are deflecting and at the next convenient opportunity a
   second purlin should be placed beside and well nailed to
   each of them.       These purlins can be 5" x 2" (the existing
   are 6" x 2\") .      They will add about 65% to the
   strength which will give an adequ&te factor of safety.


   Conclusions
       The inspection is very re-assuring.        We chose an area
   of roof w h i c h was thought to have been exposed to more
  wa t e r leakage than any other.      The deterioration has
  been remarkably little bearing in min d the age of the stand,           and
   is certainly not enough to be of structural significance.
       In the light of our findings and the cost of the
   inspection I reco m me n d that no further inspection is needed
   for five years.       This recommendaticn takes into acco u nt that
   if any part of the roof did beco m e weakened,     it would only
   be likely to fail under either a heavy snow load or in a
   very high wind.       E ach of these conditions would preclude the
   playing of a match so that spectators would not be endangered.


                                       Yours .sincerely,

                                       --------------------------------- \<n

           Dear Sir,

           Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

           As I think you are aware, the County Council has been attempting
           (through the Officer Working Parties) to advise all the League
           Football Clubs in South Yorkshire of the requirements of the Safety
           of Sports Grounds Act, 1975.

           Whilst it is appreciated that your Club is in a different position
           to the other four Clubs in South Yorkshire, the County Council feel
           it is desirable to introduce a twice-yearly regular programme of
           visits to all five of the grounds by the Officer Working Parties
           (namely, early in the year and also in the middle of the year) in an
           effort to maintain public confidence in their safety at football grounds,

           Subject to your agreement, the Officer Working Party would like to
           visit the Hillsborough Ground at 10.00 a.m. on Tuesday, 10th February,
           1981.

           The advice of the Officer Working Party is, of course, available at
           any time on request by contacting Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff (extension
           422) in the first instance.

                                                      Yours faithfully,

 Dear Eric,
                                 Cracks in Terrace at North West Corner
              As promised in our telephone conversation I enclose a
 copy of the tender received from V.A.                                                   Crookes      (Contracts)
 Ltd.          in the sum of £2,435.56.                                            This is an expensive exercise
 and you will need to make a decision as to whether to defer
 it for the m om e n t or whether to carry out by instalments.
 The cracks are not such as to make the stand unsafe and I
 expect it will be several years before there is sufficient
 rusting in the steel to cause spalling of the concrete and
  loss of strength.                                  If the deterioration is allowed to progress
  to the stage where spalling occurs,                                                  the cost of the repairs
 will of course rise significantly.
              I had hoped to discuss the matt er with you when I visited
 the ground yesterday but we can have a w o r d next time we meet.


                                                                                    Yours sincerely,

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

    I am obliged to you for your letters dated 11th and 17th November, 1980.

    I regret that I have been unable to reply to you earlier, but industrial
    action in the Fire Service led to a backlog of other than emergency work
    and a consequent delay in the provision of specialist fire prevention
    advice.

    With regard to the requirement of Condition 26 of the General Safety
    Certificate which requires the submission of an annual certificate as to
    the compliance of the electrical installations at the stadium with
    Section E of the I.E.E. Regulations, the opinion of Messrs. Eastwood and
    Partners relating to the period of time between tests (as set out in
    paragraph (c) of their letter dated 12th November, 1980) is in the
    circumstances considered to be reasonable and acceptable.

    As regards the testing of the emergency power supplies mentioned in
    paragraph (a) of the letter dated 12th November, 1980, of the letter from
    Messrs. Eastwood and Partners, I would point out that Condition 12 of the
    General Safety Certificate refers not only to emergency lighting but also
    to exit signs and communications systems which also require testing
    annually. The fire warning system would also need including since it is
    to be linked to the public address system. In this connection, I
    understand that the fire warning system has still not been finally
    completed because of the continued difficulty in obtaining parts. As
    this is a matter of some concern, I should be glad of your comments.

    An additional copy of the letter is attached for your use.

                                                      Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr. England,
                                               Safety of Sports Ground Act
          Thank yo u for sending me a copy of Mr. Vaughan's letter
of 27 January.
          W e agree with Mr. Vaughan that it is appropriate to check
that the exit signs and communication systems including the
fire alarm system are in good order annually.                                                           That is of
course very different from issuing a full IEE certificate
for the whole of the electrical installation in the ground.
A full IEE certificate test of everything would be very
expensive as well as being out of keeping wit h the normal
procedure in dealing with other public areas such as
hospitals, schools etc.                                             It is therefore appropriate to assure
Mr. V aughan that the checks which he requests will be carried out.
          With regard to the firm alarm system, the installation was
complete together with modifications to the public address
system by the start of the football season.                                                       It seems we omitted
to formally inform Mr. Vaughan of this at the time and for this
I apologise.                A query was raised by Mr.                                                    of the
County Fire Service in a telephone call on 14 January and Mr. Clough
wrote giving the appropriate assurance on 16 January.                                                             A copy of
his letter is enclosed for forwarding to Mr. Vaughan.
                                                                                                                          (if

Dear Mr. England,

                                           Safety of Sports Ground Act

               The Fire Officer has requested a demonstration of the
 fire alarm system and public address system to ensure that
 these operate satisfactorily under emergency conditions.
We have therefore arranged to demonstrate these to him on
Monday 16th February 1981 at about 11.30 a.m.
               We trust that this is satisfactory to you.




                                                                               Yours faithfully,




                                                                                                                       //t

           Note of a visit to the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield
                           on 10th February, 1981

                D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

    1.         Purpose of Meeting

    Mr. H. E. McGee, the Club's Chairman, welcomed the Working party.      *

    As had been explained in theChief Executive's letter dated 10th January to
    the Club, the County Council felt it was desirable to introduce a twice-
    yearly programme of visits by the Officer Working Parties to all five of
    the League Football Grounds in South Yorkshire (namely, early in the year and
    also in the middle of the Year) in an effort to maintain public confidence
    in their safety at football grounds. Additionally, at the other grounds,
    it was hoped that this procedure would obviate the real possibility of the
    Clubs carrying out works which might prove abortive or require additional
    work on designation. This was the first of such a programme of visits.

    2._____ Inspection of Ground

    Mr. McGee left to attend to other business, and the remainder of the
    representatives made a tour of inspection of the ground. It was agreed
    that the majority of matters revealed (detailed below) could be regarded
    as routine maintenance.

     (a)       South Stand

    The detailed inspection of a mutually agreed part of the roof structure
    had taken place on 13th/l4th January after the erection of scaffolding and
    platforms. Bearing in mind the age of the stand, relatively little
    deterioration had taken place. It had been agreed that the apparent
    deflection in the steel trusses should be monitored over a period of time.
    Whilst there were signs of water staining on the roof timbers, it was by
    no means certain if water penetration was still taking place. It was
    agreed that the area around the roof hatch should be particularly investigated,
    which would also give the opportunity of inspecting the roof tiles generally.

    It was also agreed that should any of the exterior windows in the Ladies
    Toilets below the stand be broken, they would be replaced by wired or some
    such safety glass.




                                                                                in
                                -2-

(b)     Spion Kop

Except for the continuing maintenance of the concrete terracing and crush       |
barriers, the only matter requiring attention was the infilling of a step       J
adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original exit at the top of         J
the Kop.                                                       ij

The Club had received Planning Permission and    Building Regulation approval
to the erection of a brick built chip shop at    the bottom right of the new
exit from the Kop (viewed when descending).     Thesiting of the chipshop
would not interfere with the egress from the    new      Kop exit.

(c)     North Stand

Expansion cracks had appeared in the wall of the North Stand(nearest     to
the Spion Kop) which required attention.

The Club were in the process of building showers and changing accommodation
attached to the existing gymnasium at the rear of the Stand. The public
did not have access to the facilities. Additionally, the Club were
investigating the possibility of acquiring property in Vere Road so as to
provide an alternative exclusive access to the gymnasium without using
the existing access through the ground.

Revised proposals for the facilities>tot'eNprovided in the new Police Post
and First Aid facilities had been agreed, ^nd it was intended to build
permanent accommodatiori-—in--v-i-rtua 11-y— the^ame position as the existing
temporary structures.                         'v"-—

(d)    North West Corner Terrace

The Club had received quotations for making good the cracking of the concrete
on the terracing, which the Board were to consider shortly.

(e)    West Stand

Some cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand required pointing and then
checking to see if the cracks re-opened.

Apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the steps at the rear
of the Stand required urgent attention, and attention ought also to be
given to cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs.

The weathering and corrosion in the base plate of the sheeting column in
the south-west c omer of the stand required attention, possibly by concrete
sheeting.

Finally, the steel supports to the new emergency exit (nearest to the
South Stand) still required to be rounded off.

(f)    Police Control Facilities

The Club pointed out that the police now had exclusive use of the box
(overlooking the whole of the ground) previously used by the disc jockey.
The disco unit had been re-sited underneath the original box.
3.      Revised Entrance Facilities

The Club outlined the consideration being given to the siting of caravans
outside the Penistone Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell
tickets. It was hoped that if this took place, increased entry flow of
spectators to the ground would result by reducing delays at the turnstiles.

4 ._____ Bar Facilities

The Club also outlined* the consideration being given, at the request of
the Police, to revised bar facilities at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground.

5 ._____ Future Developments

Whilst the proposals were in a very preliminary stage, consideration was
being given by the Club to the provision of an Executive Club at the
Leppings Lane end of the car park under the South Stand and the adjoining
store area. There was also a possibility of the existing office accomm­
odation being extended outwards. Additionally, the reception lounge
might be extended, the kitchen area moved and a new Directors' Room built.
It was stressed that these were long term plans and no firm proposafs existed
at the moment.

Dear David,

Many thanks for the notes of the visit to Hillsborough
of the working party on Safety of Sports Grounds.

Just one point I would   like to clarify and that is
under (C) North Stand.    You do say that we have
agreed with the police   on new accommodation for
them. This is not so,    we are still in the
discussion stage.

Yours sincerely,




Secretary.

           Note of a Visit to the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield
                             on 7th April, 1981


PRESENT: Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

          E. England (Secretary)
          J. A. Strange (Messrs. Eastwood and Partners)

          Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

                    (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
                    (South Y>rkshire County Fire Service)

          ET. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
          D.I. Vaughan ( South Yorkshire County Council)

1.     Purpose of Meeting

Bearing in mind the F.A. Cup Semi-Final which was to take place on Saturday,
11th April, 1981, it was felt it would be desirable for the Working Party to
visit the ground, especially as a small number of matters had arisen since the
last visit on 10th February, 1981.

2.      Inspection of Ground

(a)    South Stand

The previous comments relating to the roof structure and the exterior windows in
the Ladies' Toilets below the stand were still applicable.

The L.P.G. cylinders had been removed from beneath the Stand, and the batteries
supplying the emergency power supply for the police address had been enclosed in
a satisfactory fire resisting metal case. Whilst the provision of an automatic
battery charger would be a longer term solution, in the short term arrangements
had been made for the batteries to be charged before each game and for the public
address system to be checked relying only on the emergency battery supply. The
indicator for the batteries condition was presently in the Public Address Box.
It was suggested that it would be less likely to be overlooked if the indicator
was sited adjacent to the new metal case for the batteries.

(b)    West Stand

As previously agreed, the Club would round off the steel supports to the new
emergency exit (nearest to the South Stand) as soon as a grinder was next present
at the ground.

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand which required pointing, the
apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the steps at the. rear of the
stand, the cracks in the concrete at the top bo both sets of stairs, as well as t
the currently slight corrosion-in the base plate of the outer steel column        j
(nearest to the South Stand) had all been included in the maintenance programme
and would be undertaken shortly.■                                                 j

                                      l.
.J




     (c)    North West Terrace

     The cracking of the concreting had been attended to by injecting material from
     the top. The results had been satisfactory, except in two small areas where
     water seepage had obviously taken place and which would receive further
     attention.

     (d)    North Stand

     The expansion cracks which had appeared in the wall of the North Stand (nearest
     to the Spion Kop) had been included in the maintenance schedule and would be
     attended to shortly.

     (e)    Spion Kop                                                        i

     The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original
     exit at the top of the Kop would be given attention in the close season.

     Whilst the brick built chip shop at the bottom of the new exit from the Kop had
     been erected, it was not yet in use. It was noted that the siting of the
     chip shop had resulted in a possible danger to spectators in that a gap into        j
     which spectators .could be pushed, or possibly stumble because of the camber,had    t
     been created. As regards the F.A. Cup Semi-Final,

     IT WAS AGREED -

     that a temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes should be erected between the end
     of the new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
     Kop original exit steps. In the longer term, the existing barriers would need
     extending to fill the gap and ideally, the area between the bottom of the new Kop
     exit staircase and the original Kop exit steps should be levelled off.

     3.      Ground Evacuation Procedure

     Whilst the Club had been supplied with a Schedule on "Fire Instruction and Drills"
     on 9th April, 1980, consultations between the County Fire Service and the South
     Yorkshire Police had resulted in the production of an "Emergency Evacuation
     Procedure". The Club undertook to circulate copies of the procedure to all
     Stewards who would be on duty for the F.A. Cup Semi-Final.

                     Further to the meeting on Tuesday 7th April 1981,
              we enclose for your retention a copy of some notes we
              have made on the general operation e t c . , of the Public
              Address System together with schematic diagrams of the

                     We have positioned a copy of the notes and drawings
              on the side of the amplifier and we hope that all
              concerened will n o w have a much clearer picture as to what
              is required to keep the system operating satisfactorily.

                    For the attention of Mr. B. Harris




                    Dear Mr Harris,
                                     Sheffield W e d n es d ay Football Club Ltd
                                            Guard Rail adjacent to New Servery
                            As explained over the telephone last Thursday we
                    accompanied representatives                                             from the S.Y.C.C. working
                    party on an inspection of H i ll s borough earlier last
                    week.
                            We w e r e s urprised to see that the barrier alongside
                    the new servery had not been installed.                                                 This omission
                    was considered a danger to spectators leaving the ground
                    by the Spion K o p staircase and w e had to organise the
                    immediate erection of a temporary scaffold barrier in
                    readiness for the semi-final game last Saturday.
                            It appears that the servery has been moved slightly
                    down the exit ramp.                                         This leaves a gap about 700 mm wide,
                    through wh ic h spectators could find themselves being
                    pushed,    between the corner of the building and an existing
                    concrete post at the top of the adjacent staircase landing.
                    To add to this hazard there is a small upstand at ground
                    level over w h i c h people could trip as they pass through the
                    gap.


                                                                                                                                 its
                                                                     Registered in England - No. 1134531

                  As a matter of urgency would you please arrange to have
             the barrier installed.   There is every likelihood that the
             last few games of this season could attract very large
             attendances.   A ny danger to the public should therefore be
             removed as soon as possible.

                          In connection with the recent Working Party visit to
                 the Hillsborough Grounds on 7 April 1981 we confirm that
                 the following steps have been taken:

                          i)      the batteries                                       are installed in a fire resistant
                                  metal case.

                        ii)       the batteries are now kept fully charged by maintaining
                                  a continuous d.c. supply.

                       iii)       all amplifier changeover circuits have been checked
                                  and full sound level is available on standby.

                        iv)       instructions to                                      'operate'   'test' and       'leave' have been
                                  posted alongside the equipment and copies left with
                                  Mr. England.

      Note of a Visit to the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield,
                        on 8th June, 1981

PRESENT:   Representing the' Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

           E. England (Secretary)

           Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

           C. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
                      (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
                         (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

           D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
           D .I . Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1.      Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originaj-ly referred to
in the Chief Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981. The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2 ■_____ Inspection of Stadium

The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

(a)     South Stand

The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel
trusses referred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, in
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be given.

It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
be provided.

(b)     West Stand

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars supporting the steps at the rear of the
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
had been made good.

As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
(nearest to the South Stand).

Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand.
An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
when these had substance.


                                    -1-
(c)   North-West Terrace

The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take place after
treatment had now been satisfactorily treated.

It was also noted*that the tie bars through the upper level concrete
area to the rear had been 'protectively wrapped.

(d)   North Stand

The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
Kop) had been made good.

(e)   Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
original exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would     ^
be attended to shortly.

The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of the
new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.

(f)   General

It was noted:-

(i)    that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the
rear of the Butcher's Shop on Penistone Road required attention because of
corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall between the Spion
Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

   For the attention of Mr. D. Sheriff


   Dear Sir,
                                           Hillsborough Football Ground
                                Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                       I have received from Mr. England a copy of David
   Vaughan's minutes of your meeting at the                                                     club on 8 June 1981.
    In particular my attention has been drawn to the matter of the
    steel trusses in the roof of the South stand.
                       When we last talked about the trusses you will recall
   that I said I was not worried by the misalignment but I
    indicated that if some simple method of monitoring the situation
    could be devised so that there was no great expense to the Club
    I would make a recommendation that readings should be taken.
    I promised to look into the matter and write to you again.
                        I have made another inspection and it is clear that if
    any meaningful readings were to be taken it would be quite a
    costly exercise.                                   Access to the apex of the roof trusses is
    difficult because of the seating below and I think it would be
    necessary to erect scaffolding each time if the person taking
     the readings was to work in reasonable safety.
                        I am also now quite convinced that there is no element
     of danger.                    It seems highly likely that the trusses which are
     out of line have been in that condition since they were erected
                                                                                                                           (3 (q
                                                                 Registered in England - No. 1134531
                                                                         SHEET

        or possibly very shortly thereafter.     There is of course
        some steel bracing between the trusses at the East end of
        the stand at which location the trusses appear to be
        vertical. Presumably the erection bracing ensured that
        this was so when the roof was first built.      Progressing
        along the stand the trusses appear to gradually tilt and
        then towards the West end they straighten up again.      The
        trusses are joined to each other by timber purlins only
        except on the line of the columns where the spacing of
        the bottom chord of the truss is determined by the lattice
        girders .   The bolted connection between the timber purlins
        and the roof trusses is very adequate and it seems quite
        likely that the trusses were pulled towards each other
        at rafter level by shrinkage of the timber purlins.         It
        seems reasonable to assume that these timber purlins were fixed
        immediately following erection of each truss.      If the
        slaters then followed/working from the Eastern end,drying
        out of the purlins would result in the deformation pattern
        which is now apparent.
               This is of course only a hypothesis but even if there
        is someother reason for the tilting of the trusses, the
        plate action of the boarded roof will be such that there
        can be no question of instability.
               It should also be kept in mind that if there were some
        latent weakness, failure would occur under either extreme
        snow loading or extreme wind loading.      The stand will not be
        occupied by spectators under either of these conditions since
        it would be impossible for a football match to take place.
        With this as background and bearing in mind the cost of
        any monitoring exercise I have advised the Club that it is not
        in my view necessary and the advice has been accepted.

                                             Yours faithfully,

For the attention of Mr. D. V a u g h a n


D ear Mr. Vaughan,

                                          S heffield Wedne s da y Fo o tball Club
                       Mr. England has passe d to me a copy of the note
w rit t en following y o u r v i s i t to the ground on 8 June 1981
and has asked me to look into the two matters raised
in note 2a and 2e.

                       The first pa r ag raph-of note 2a implies that there
h a d been an agreement to mon it o r deflection of the steel
r oof trusses.                       This I think is a misunderstanding.                                           X
personally had undertaken to look into the possibility
and the Club is not aware that it had entered into any
commitment.                    I have looked at the roof again and have now
w rit t en a letter to the Bu i ld i ng Surveyor,a copy of which
is enclosed.

                         the second para g ra p h of this note there is a
reference to a m o n i t o r i n g device to be sited adjacent
to the batteries p r ov i di n g the emeigency power supply for
the publ ic address system.                                                        Mr.    Clough informs me that this
suggestion wa^ certainly mad e at themeeting on 7 April in the
course of dis c us s in g a number of ma t te r s but he was n o t under
the impression that the suggestion was being pressed.                                                                              loa

  There is already a w ar ni n g light within the public address
  cubicle together w i t h very precise instructions to the
  operator.        The light is checked at every home match.
  The batteries wo u ld take many weeks to run down following
  any breakdown of the charging system so thatprovided a
  check is made a d a y or two before the start of the season,
  there can be no q u es t io n of the emergency power supply being
  inoperable.        It w o u l d of course be possible to have another
  w arning light fitted adjacent to the batteries but it m u s t
  be kept in mind t h a t even simple matters such as this are
  quite costly. For example, the bill received for charging
  the batteries when they were found to be flat a few months
  ago was in excess of £100.           A similar sort of bill could
  be expected if we were to fit a war ni n g light system
  alongside the b a t t e r i e s .   There obviously comes a time when
  we have to resist belt and braces*requests of this kind.
           Turning n o w to the two items raised in connection
  w i t h Spion Kop,   it is expected that further work m a y be
  undertaken at the ground in the near future and the infilling
  step at the top of the original exit w ill be concreted at
  that t i m e .
           The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes and the
  bottom of the new Kop exit w ill be replaced by a perm a ne n t
  arrangement shortly.           We believe the responsibility lies
  w it h the outside catering contractor and the matter w i l l be
  raised as soon as John Strange returns fro m holiday next week.


                                            Yours sincerely,

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

    You will recall that you raised certain points in your letter dated
    18th June relating to the Hillsborough Stadium.

    So far as the deflection of the roof trusses in the South Stand are concerned,
    the Officer Working Party agree that the likely causes are somewhat
    conjectural but equally it is possible that the situation could worsen in the
    future.

    Bearing in mind that an acceptable monitoring method would be inconvenient
    and costly to the club, it is suggested that a visual inspection during the
    customary visits, and possibly after exceptional gale or snow loading
    conditions, would provide a practical monitoring system.

    You also referred to the suggestion that a monitoring device to be sited
    adjacent to the batteries providing the emergency power supply for the public
    address system should be provided.  This suggestion was originally made
    following a visit by the County Fire Service to the ground having revealed
    that the batteries were discharged and that none of the ground staff present
    at that time knew anything about the system. Access to the public address
    cubicle to check the monitoring light in there could not be gained.

    However, the procedures since introduced would seem to overcome this problem.

                                                           Yours faithfully,

      Dear Eric,

                                                             Safety Certificate

                      I have only had a re p ly in the last few days to my
       letter to the SYCC dated 18 June.                                        You will remember this
       ms        the letter telling them that "we did not intend to monitor
       the roof trusses in the South Stand and also that we did not
       think a second monitoring device was needed on the batteries
      for the public address system.
                     As you will see from the attached copy of David V a u g h a n ’s
       letter he accepts the position with regard to the batteries.
      He also suggests a visual                                         inspection of the roof trusses after
       any heavy fall of snow or any exceptional gale.                                                   We will
      probably carry out this latter request by changing cur
       season tickets from the N o r t h Stand to the South Stand next
       year.
                      I have replied suitably to David Vaughan (copy
       enclosed).

Dear Sir,                                     •tiUMWcod     6t P a r t n e r s
Safety of Sports Grounds Act, ^975.;.                 15 SEP1981
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

Referring to your letter of 9th September, the Officer Working Party
(Sheffield District) has considered the proposals referred to in your
letter of 2nd September and accompanying plans.

1.      Radial Barriers on West Terrace                                             !■
                                                                                     '

Whilst welcoming the increased control on the Terrace which should
result, concern was expressed as to the problems which could occur with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or at the entry/
exit gates. However, it was felt that only experience would show
whether this would prove to be a reality and, if realised, whether the
problem was of such a small scale that it could be easily coped with by
the police.

Accordingly, the Officer Working Party at this stage sees no objection
to the proposals to instal two 1680 mm high radial barriers, with 1.15
metre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject to:-

(a)     the further calculations required by the Building Authority being
        satisfactory (Mr. Sheriff to contact you direct);

(b)     confirmation that adequate headroom will be available at the rear
        of the Terrace after installation of the barriers and gates, and

(c)     the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being under police
        control.

2.      Security Gates around North Stand

The Officer Working Party fully recognises the Club's need to provide
security for the remainder of the stadium when only the gymnasium is in
use.

Provided that the gates and/or their supports, hinges, etc. do not
impinge on the existing critical ramp widths and the gates are secured
in the fully open position on match days, the Officer Working Party
sees no objection to the erection of security gates around the North Stand

3.    Other Matters

Two other matters were also raised by the Officer Working Party relating
to the Police and First Aid Facilities and the siting of certain of the
Lottery Ticket Boxes.

(a)   Police and First Aid Facilities

      It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first
      aid facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim
      basis on the understanding that the Club would provide purpose built
      replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

      It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are
      still continuing, but it is felt that the Club should be asked to give
      a firm indication when the new police and first aid facilities are to
      be provided.
(b)   Lottery Ticket Boxes

      Concern was expressed as to the blocked egress which could result if
      the timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps
      were to be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately

      The Officer Working Party felt that the Club should be requested to
      re-site the boxes in a less critical position.

I attach an additional copy of this letter for your use.

                                        Yours faithfully,




                                        Chief Executive.

Dear Eric,
                     Annual Inspection and Certificates as Required in the
                     Conditions attached to the Certificate of Ground Safety
                     I now have pleasure in enclosing two copies of my
certificate relating to the structural aspects of the ground.
                     Also enclosed is a note of a few remaining points
requiring attention which were raised during the inspection by
the local authority representatives last April.                                                               I consider
these to be maintenance items which can be dealt with in due course.
You have of course already seen to most of the items mentioned during
the visit.
                     I have sent a copy of the Certificate directly to David
Vaughan, and have sent a copy of a report on the barrier testing
to Don Sherriff at the Town Hall.


                                                                                 Yours sincerely,

                      ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM A S REQUIRED
                                         BY THE CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


                       On 23 September 1981,                                      I made an inspection of the ground,
 after having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
 and sections of the perimeter fence on Spion Kop tested by members
 of my staff under my control.
                       In my opinion the various structures on the ground
  are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate for the stadium
  to be used to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of
 Ground Safety.
                       In July,      crush barriers numbers 40,41,42,47,48,49,50,
  55,56,57,58,59,60,61,68,69,70,71,85,90,114,115,116 and 118 (see
  our drawing 1610/63) were tested in accordance with the procedure
  laid down in the Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.                                                                 Certain
  barriers deflected excessively and would not sustain the test load.
  In one instance a clip retaining the horizontal tube had to be replaced.
                       Remedial work was carried out on barriers 41 (one post)
  and 1 1 5 (one post and one clip).                                                     At the same time two corroded fence
  posts and four corroded fence post stays were replaced.
                       After remedial work the sections of barriers which failed
 were successfully retested on 9 September.                                                              I am now able to certify
  that all 24 barriers have a satisfactory strength.
                       The step at the top of the original stair flight at the
  back of Spion Kop has been filled in to give a safe landing.



                                                                                                                                 ’(<*4
                                                                   Registered in England - No. 1134531

          A permanent barrier has been installed adjacent
       to the servery at the bottom of the new stair flight
       leading from Spion Kop and a new concrete landing added
       in the same area.
          Certain items of maintenance work which it is
       suggested should be carried out at an appropriate time
       have been recommended to the club.   A list is attached.

              at the front of the South stand.


 2.         Replace the broken fall pipe shoe and fasten back
              the pipe to the wall between turnstiles 22 - 21
              (at the west end of the South stand).


  3.        Round off the corners on the steelwork of the
              underside of the exit at the South end of the
              West stand.                        (To be done next time a grinder
              is on site ).


  4.        Repair or replace the corroding stanchions
              supporting the fencing and sheeting above
              the boundary wall on the right hand side of
              gate 0.

                                  (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss>*the apparent difference of opinion
on certain aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
and the security gates at the top of the North stand ramps, as well as to
carry out the usual winter inspection of the Stadium.

2.    Ground Inspection

A.    West Terrace

Whilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches played since the
erection of the radial barriers indicated that generally they worked well and
satisfactorily effected the segregation of opposing groups of fans.

However, the police pointed out that in places the existing crush barriers
had been extended up to and, in some cases, completely through the new
radial barriers, which had the effect of making it relatively easy for anyone
who wished to do so to climb from one pen to another. Also, in the pen
nearest to the South Stand, a small length of existing crush barrier had been
left unsupported.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
prevent crowd surge by the existing barriers being extended up to and/or
through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
able to climb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of the
current season.

(ii) That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
be cut off.
B.    West Stand ■

One of the security gates which the Club wished to instal at the bottom of
the two staircases had now been erected.

IT WAS AGREED    that this could be regarded as satisfactory.

C.    North Stand

The Fire Service felt that the manner in which the security gates had been
installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available.

The Club's Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
applied in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the top
of the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or not.

IT WAS AGREED   that, as the point might well have been covered in the
initial consideration of the Club's application for a General Safety
Certificate, the point would not be pursued at the moment.

      NOTE - A search of the file subsequently revealed that, as
             suspected, the point had been considered at a
             meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.2.79,
             the relevant part of the Note of the meeting reading:-

                   "the construction and width of the ramps being
                    such that they could quite^properly be
                    regarded as elevated roadways".

D.     Spion Kop

•It was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on
 the left of the original exit at the top of the Kop had taken place;that
 the boundary fence at the top of the Kop had been reinforced, andthat the
 existing barriers had been permanently extended and the area at the foot
 of the new Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)
 levelled off as agreed.

E.     South Stand

The agreement to visually inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection
after exceptional gale or snow loading conditions was recalled.

F.    Items of General Maintenance      V J.


 IT WAS AGREED     that the following items of general maintenance required
 attention:-

 (i)   The rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
 theexit at the southerly endof theWest Stand     (tobe done that day), as
 well as the roundingoff ofthe brackets to    the North Stand securitygates.

 (ii) The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
 fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
 Gate "0".
(iii)    The cracks‘in the concrete terracing    of the Spion Kopto be filled.

(iv)   The wooden support to the electrical     line between thebrick built
refreshment point and the Owls Club to be fixed more securely.

(v)   The brick wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop (nearest
to the South Stand) to be pointed.

(vi)   The concrete supporting strut to the      wall between theSpion Kop and
the South Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop)       to be protected(cracks and
exposed bar).

G.      Temporary Structures

Concern was expressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability
of temporary structures, such as scaffolding used in connection wdth
television transmissions.

Paragraph 20 of the Club's General Safety Certificate required T.V. cameras
and portable equipment to be placed only in such positions as may be agreed
between the Police and the Club.    The Club also weregenerally required to
ensure that the Stadium complied with good engineering andbuildingpractices
and with the relevant British Standard Specification or Code of Practice.

IT WAS AGREED that the question of temporary structures should be kept
under review, and that the Club's Consultants should give advice to the
Club.

3.      Future Developments

A.      Police and First Aid Facilities

It was likely that, following continuing consultations with the Police, the
Club would shortly be in a position to formally notify the County Council
that the new Police and First Aid Facilities would be provided in the
forthcoming close season.

B.      Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate in Penistone Road

The Club hoped to formally notify the County Council shortly of their^
intention to proceed in the forthcoming close season with the demolition of
some of the existing toilets on the Penistone Road side of the Stadium in
order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate on that side of the
Stadium.

C.      Widening of Walkway and Erection of New Fence

Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the
rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Owls Club) had had to be removed.
When settlement was complete, it was intended to widen the existing
walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.

  Dear Eric,
                                                Annual Inspection for Safety Certificate
                      As you will know I had a look round the ground on 16 August
  preparatory to the meeting with the South Yorkshire C.C. Working
  Party next week.                              One or two minor matters came to light which
  are being put right by your own staff prior to the visit, but
  I thought I should write you a note concerning some of the
  reinforced concrete columns at the back of the South stand.
                      It is clear that at some time in the past (I believe you
   said just after the war) the columns were treated with sprayed
  concrete, often called gunite.                                                     The most likely reason was that
   the steel reinforcement had rusted and the consequent swelling
  had begun to spall off the concrete round the bars. The treatment
  which was applied was very appropriate and it has clearly had the
   effect of preserving the life for another 30 years.
                      It can now be seen that further cracks are developing.
   Sometimes these are vertical in the outer face of the gunite.
   In other cases the gunite is being pushed off the original
   concrete causing cracks in the sides of the columns roughly
   in line with the face of the brickwork (the gunite stands proud
   of the brickwork).
                      These cracks will be allowing dampness and air to get
   at the reinforcement so that rusting will now take place at                                                                |)C

                                                                      SHEET   2.

   an accelerating rate.    The loss of metal due to rusting
   will obviously reduce the carrying capacity, but more
   seriously those parts of the columns which are subjected
   to bending (near first floor level for example) may lose
   completely their bending capacity if the reinforcement
  becomes debonded from the concrete.
       Fortunately, the splitting is only taking place in the
  lower part of the columns which very much reduces the
  immediate problem.     I suspect that the rusting is taking
  place at this level due to rising damp, probably through
  the brickwork.      Alternatively it may be rain   is penetrating
  sideways from the brickwork into the columns.        There
  certainly seems to be a relationship with the brickwork
  because the last two or three columns at the west end
  are free-standing with no brickwork infilling and they are
  showing no signs of serious decay.
       The cracking is also beginning to occur on the inside
  face of the columns within the building. Most of the columns
  are covered on their inner faces by panelling or other
  finishes so the extent of the trouble on the inside cannot
  easily be determined.
       Something should be done fairly soon to prevent unacceptable
  deterioration.   You have made it clear that in the present
  financial climate there is no possibility of a ruthless
  treatment involving hacking off all the splitting concrete
  cover to fully expose the bars, cleaning off all rust, treating
  with a rust inhibiter, and then restoring the cover to the
  bars with either an epoxy mortar or gunite.        This would be
  too expensive.   Your Board would probably prefer to apply
  first-aid using the labour of your own staff, even though this
  will only last a year or two.
EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




       The simplest treatment which is likely to retard the
  decay significantly would be to fill all the cracks with
  an epoxy mortar which needs to be well packed to as great
  a depth as possible.   I attach a note giving details of
  a mortar which would be suitable.    The men carrying out
  the work will need to be quite painstaking in their efforts
  to fill the cracks as deeply as possible.
       There are a couple of places where small lengths of
  bars are exposed due to concrete spalling.     In these cases
  any loose concrete should be hacked off and the bar thoroughly
  cleaned of all rust with a wire brush before painting with
  a rust inhibiter.   The bar should then be covered with the
  epoxy mortar which should be well-packed into place,    and to
  sufficient thickness to restore the shape of the column.
       A brief specification is attached.     John Strange will
  also explain to your staff what is required.

              wire brushing.      B l o w out any dust and dirt
              in the crack.      Make sure existing concrete
              surface is dry before applying Reebafill mortar.


     b)    M i x the constituents as directed by the
              m anufacturer and using a trowel or knife press
              the mortar as far as possible into the cracks.


2.   Spalled Concrete
     a)       Hack away all loose concrete and thoroughly
              wire brush the    exposed concrete.


     b)       C lean all ex p o s e d reinforcing bars with a
              wire brush to remove all rust.


     c)       Paint the cleaned bars with Nitozinc in accordance
              with the m a n ufacturers instructions.


     d)       After the Nitozinc has dried apply a priming
              coat of Nitoprime S to all the surfaces.


     e)       Prepare sufficient surfaces of concrete to accept
              a full pack of mi x e d   Nitomortar HB,   to reduce
              waste.      M i x the Nitomortar HB as directed by

2______Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the usual summer inspection carried out of all Football
League Clubs in South Yorkshire (originally referred to in the Chief
Executive’s letter to the Club dated 10 January 1981).

2_____ Ground Inspection

A     West Stand

•It was noted that there was light surface corrosion at the foot of the
 steel supporting pillar nearest to the North-West Terrace. As there was
no enclosing wing to the stand, the pillar was open to the elements.

The possibility of spectators climbing onto the roof of the store shed to
the rear of the stand and adjacent to the boundary wall was discussed.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)    That the Club would arrange for the foot of the steel supporting
pillar to be cleaned and painted and possibly for the gusset plate to be
covered by a concrete haunch. »

(ii)   That the Club would consider whether any useful purpose would be
served by retaining the store shed adjacent to the boundary wall.

(iii) That the Club would investigate and make good the crack in the
concrete adjacent to stand entrances "W" and "X".

B      North West Terrace

It was noted that the cracks in the concrete underneath the Terrace had
been repaired and appeared satisfactory. However, there was seepage of
water between the North West Terrace atid the West Stand in heavy rain.

IT WAS AGREED - That the Club would make good the bitumastic sealing
between the Terrace and the West Stand.

C     North Stand

A crack in the concrete at the expansion joint adjacent to Stand entrance
"R" was noted.

IT WAS AGREED - That the Club would investigate and make good the crack.

D      Spion Kop

The Building Authority suggested that at some future date the Club should
consider giving attention to the original steps at the rear of the Kop
(at the bottom of the new staircase) so as to remove the slight downward
tilt and ensure a common height of risers.

IT WAS AGREED - That, whilst there had been n o reported incidents, the Club
would bear the suggestion in mind for attention at a future date.

E       South Stand

The Club reported that the gantry access to the Commentary Box on the top
of the Stand was not now used, except by ground maintenance staff.

IT WAS AGREED - That the Club would replace themissing rings in thechain
used as a handrail on the gantry.

F       Crush Barriers

The Club reported that the remaining third of the crush barriers on the
Spion Kop had now been tested. The only problem had been rusting of some
of the clips over the top tubes. These had been replaced or would be
replaced by the start of the Season on 28 August.

A visual inspection had also been carried out of the clips on^the crush
barriers on the West and North-West Terraces, and similar action taken.

G       Police and First Aid Facilities

The new police and first aid facilities under the North Stand were well
on the way towards completion, and would be utilised at the opening match
on 28 August.

H       Penistone Road Side

It was noted that the steel g i r d e r s a d j o i n i n g the wall at the rearof the
Butcher’s Shop had been satisfactorily attended to, and that the Folding
Exit Gates had had new tops and runners installed and the concrete made
good.

So far as the proposal to re-site an existing toilet block to the rear of
the Spion Kep to enable additional turnstiles and an exit gate to be
installed was concerned, the Club had reported to the Chief Executive
by letter that this had had to be deferred until the end of next season
due to the size of the problem and the possibility of creating hazards for
spectators.                                                       .
^      Television Camera Facilities

It was noted that the scaffolding Tower erected on the Spion Kop for
Television camera purposes had now been removed.

There did not appear to have been any progress with the Television
Authorities to date on the subject of permanent or semi-permanent
facilities.

J     Fire-Fighting Equipment

Whilst the Club were confident that all of the fire extinguishers, etc,
were still sited as originally required by the General Safety Certificate,
the County Fire Service felt that a routine inspection of the equipment
would now be appropriate.

K     Maintenance

Certain areas of spalled concrete in the Stadium required attention, and
the Club had the work in hand as items of routine maintenance.

ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED BY THE
                                          CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


                             On 16 August 1982,                                       I made an inspection of the ground,
after having                    had approximately                                       one fifth of the crush barriers
on Spion Kop tested by members                                                          of my staff under my control.
                             At the end of June,                                      crush barriers numbers 43, 44,            45,
46, 51, 52, 53,                             54, 62, 63, 63A,                             65, 66,   72,    73, 74,    75, 76,    78,
79, 80, 86, 87,                             88, 89, 91, 92, 94, 95, 97,                                  98, 99, 100,     101, 103,
104,                  105,   107,     108,                109 and 110 were tested                        in accordance with the
procedures laid                             down in the Guide to Safety                                  at Football Grounds.
All the barriers sustained the test load although in some instances
the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed.                                                                   These clips have
been replaced.                               At the same time, other clips and horizontal rails
showing signs of advanced corrosion were replaced.
                             I a m n o w able to certify that all 41 barriers have a

             Sharp corners on the underside of the landing of
  the   south exit at the front of the West stand have been
  ground smooth.
             Various minor items of remedial work to concrete
  and brickwork walls,   steps, terracing and the like have
  been completed as part of the maintenance programme.
             Certain   other items of maintenance work which it
  is suggested should be carried out at an appropriate time
  have been recommended to the Club.     A list is attached.
            I certify that in my opinion the various structures
  on the ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate
  for the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid down
  in the Certificate of Ground Safety.

     Dear Sir,

     Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

     Following the recent inspection visits to the Hillsborough Stadium, the
     Chief Fire Officer informs me that whilst the Fire Equipment, the Fire Alarm
     System and the Emergency Lighting System were all satisfactory at the time of
     inspection, there appeared to be problems with the Fire Routine and Emergency
     Evacuation Procedures.

     For instance, numerous stewards could not give correct or suitable replies
     when questioned about their responsibilities under Section 9 of Schedule 2
     of the General Safety Certificate. Many were not familiar with alarm call
     point positions in the immediate area of theirresponsibility. Others were not
     aware of or did not have the written instructions as to their general duties
     required by part (c) of Section 9.

     In view of staff changes, especially amongst the stewards, regular training
     of staff must be maintained in accordance with the standards laid down in
     Section 9. As you will recall, training exercises for Safety Stewards and
     Staff employed in the Stadium are required at least one*every three months.

     Part of the emergency evacuation procedure at the Stadium requires the playing
     of "code" records over the public address system. A check during a recent match
     revealed that:-

     (i)     the records in question could not be found by the disc jockey, and

     (ii)    the disc jockey was not familiar with the titles of the tracks to
             be played over the public address system as detailed in the emergency
             procedure schedule.

     I am sure it is not necessary to stress the importance of the persons responsible
     being familiar with the routines centering around the emergency evacuation
     procedures for the Stadium.

It may well be that you have already arranged for action to be taken to
remedy the problems with the Fire Routine and Emergency Evacuation Procedures
mentioned above. As in previous years, the County Fire Service will be
pleased to assist in the training of safety stewards and other staff
employed in the Stadium.

                                        Yours faithfully,

     Dear Sir,

     Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975.

     As you are aware, it is the policy for the Officer Working Parties to make
     routine inspections of the Football League Grounds in South Yorkshire twice
     yearly, roughly on a summer/winter basis.

     Confirming the 'phone conversation which Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff had
     with you yesterday, arrangements have been made for the Officer Working
     Party (Sheffield District) to visit the Hillsborough Stadium at 2.30p.m.
     on Monday, 21st February, 1983.

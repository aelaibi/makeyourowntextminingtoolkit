        Thank you for your letter of 23 January 1990 enclosing a copy of
        the report which you have prepared on the Hillsborough disaster.

        I am sure you will understand that operational matters relating
        to the conduct of a criminal investigation are for the police.
        In the circumstances, I have sent a copy of your letter and
        report to Geoffrey Dear, who will remain the investigating
        officer in the criminal enquiry until he vacates the post as
        Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police on 31 March 1990.

        I am grateful to you for providing this information, and have
        asked that your letter and report be considered by the
        investigating team in particular your offer to provide further
        details of your experiences on and after the 15 April 1989.

 THE POLICE WERE CONFUSED BY WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

 E^pNDS WAS NOT ORGANISED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO ALLOCATE IN AN ORGANISED M A N N E R .

 I ALSO THINK THAT THE SPACE BETWEEN THE BARRIERS ON THE TERRACES WAS TOO GREAT

 THIS COMPOUNDS THE EFFEC TS OF C R U S H I N G ,    BECAUSE OF   iHE SPACE AND NUMBER OF

 PEOPLE BETWEEN BARRIERS ALTHOUGH THIS POINT IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE DAY IN

 QUESTION PARTLY COVERED TERRACES ARE DANGEROUS ON A RAINY DAY BECAUSE PEOPLE

 TEND TO CRAM TOGETHER TO GET UNDER THE COVERED SECTION,             THIS CREATING CRUSH

 SITUATIONS.

 I WAS APPROACHED ON AT LEAST SIX SEPERATE OCCASIONS BY FANS WHO WERE TRYING TO

 BUY TICKETS,    THIS IS A LARGE NUMBER Oh          TIMES BY NORMAL STANDARDS,    WHICH MADE

 ME THINK THAT A LARGER THAN NORMAL AMOUNT OF PEOPLE HAD GONE TO THE MATCH

 WITHOUT TICKETS.

CHECKING FOR TICKETS PRIOR TO ARRIVAL AT THE GROUND WOULD HAVE ASSIS

 NO.


Q17
 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR                 IN THE D E A T H S , OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WERE TRAPPED UP AGAINST THE PERIMETER FENCING WITH NO WAY

 OF ESCAPE.

 ALSO THAT THE DIVIDING FENCES PREVENTED OUTWARDS MOVEMENTS OF THE CROWD AND

 ALSO THAT THE GATES IN THE PERIMETER FENCES WERE VERY S M A L L , AND THE GATES

 W E R E N ’T OPENED FOR WHAT SEEMED LIKE A LONG TIME.        THE OVERHANG ON THE TOP OF

 THE PERIMETER FENCING MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE AT THE

 FRONT TO CLIMB OUT ONTO THE PITCH,

        YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 I SAW A BLOKE COME INTO PEN 3 THROUGH A GATE IN THE PERIMETER FENCE.                       I THINK

HE BENT DOWN TO PICK SOMETHING UP OFF            \HE sERRACtS WHEN ALL 1Hfc. SUPPORi fc.RS

AT      1HE BACK RAN i-ORWARDS 10 G E I HIM, BUI BEFORE     IHEY       COULD SHe. POLICE WHO WERL

ON THE TERRACES TOOK HIM BACK OUT THROUGH THE GATE.

 I THOUGHT THE F*OLICE WERE VERY SLOW TO REACT TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE

TERRACES,      AT FIRST THEY JUST STOOD THERE TELLING PEOPLE TO GET BACK                  INSTEAD

OF DRAGGING PEOPLE OUT.

 I THOUGHT AFTERWARDS THAT IT WAS WRONG THAT NO EQUIPMENT WAS READILY

 AVAILABLE TO CUT DOWN THE FENCING.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THAT IF GATES WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE DIVIDING FENCES,    PEOPLE COULD

 HAVE BEEN MOVED OUT OF THE CENTRE! OF THE TERRACES INTO THE SIDES EASING    !HE

 CRUSHING QUICKER.

THERE WAS a DELAY BY THE EMERGENCY SE            TO RE-ACT QUICKLY ENOUGH TO THE

SITUATION    IN FOR EXAMPLE OPENIN^'H'tiE GATES TO THE CENTRAL PENS.

Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL    INQUIRY?

THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH EXIT GATES FROM THE PENS AND THE EXISTING GATES ARE TOO

NARROW.     LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED THE LARGER END OF THE GROUND.

ONCE THE PENS TO THE CENTRAL AREA WERE FULL THE TUNNEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED

 OFF .

  BE DONE VERY SLOWLY,    THE EMERGENCY SERVICES DID NOT GET TO THE GROUND VERY

  QUICKLY.    THE LINE OF THE POLICE STANDING ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE PITCH,

: APPEARED TO BE THERE FOR NO REASON.       THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELPING THE

  INJURED, WHEREAS THE FANS W^RE MAKING THE STRETCHERS.

B Q54

  IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

.JUDICIAL     INQUIRY?

  WHEN THE DECISION WAS MADE TO OPEN TH^ OUTER GATES,             I BELIEVE THAT IF

  STEWARDS OR POLICE OFFICERS HAD BEEN INSIDE, TO DIRECT THE FANS TO THE

  UPPER WEST TERRACE, THE       TRAGE0Y WOULD HAVE BEEN AVERTED.

  I^PELIEVE THAT THE FANS       WENT TO THE TUNNEL BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE              THEY ARE

  SENT ON NORMAL LEAGUE MATCHES.

  I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE TURNSTILES LEADING DIRECTLY INTO THE NORTH

  STAND WERE NOT USED AS THIS WOULD HAVE ALEVIATED THE CRUSH AT THE

  LEPPINGS LANE AREA.      ;

  THE POLICE CAME INTO THE HORSE V j O C K E Y PH AT ABOUT 20 MINUTES PAST TWO

  (1420) AND TOLD THE L I C E N C E E / o STOP SERVING, SO EVERYONE THEN WENT TO

  THE GROUND WHICH ADDED T O ^ m E CRUSH.

  I THINK THAT IT WAS THE       RIGHT DECISION TO OPEN THE GATE,             ITHINK   THAT IF

  THE GAME WOULD HAVE STARTED WHILE A LOT OF FANS WERE STILL OUTSIDE

  T ® t E WOULD HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS.

  THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS RIDICULOUS,         IF DID NOT/fAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE

  SUPPORTERS NEEDS.                                      /

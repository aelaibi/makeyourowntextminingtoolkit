             Dear

             Thank you for your recent letter to
             which has been passed to this department in view of our
             responsibilities for the Safety of Sport Grounds Act.   I
             apologise for the delay in replying to you.

             You express the opinion that, following Lord Justice Taylor's
             Final Report on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster, members of
             the lower divisions of the football league should be treated
             differently due to the size of their attendance and their lack
             °f ™°?ey compared to the bigger clubs of the First and Second
             Divisions. Lord Justice Taylor recognised these differences
             and recommended that clubs in the Third and Fourth Divisions
             be allowed an extra 5 years, that is until August 1999, to
             eliminate terraces from their grounds.

             In addition Lord Justice Taylor recognised that current
             attendances at many grounds of clubs in the lower divisions
             are well below the maximum capacity of the ground. He
             commented, in his Final Report, that a small scale
             redvelopment, possibly involving only part of the ground,
             might be sufficient in some cases.

                                                                       Yours sincerely

Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to
which has been passed to this department in view of our
responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I
apologise for the delay in replying to you.

You expressed concern that if football stadia provided seated
accommodation only, the resulting capacity reductions would
result in many stadia not being large enough to accommodate
all who wish to attend certain matches.  However,
Lord Justice Taylor points out, in his Final Report on the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster, that of all the teams in
Divisions One and Two of the Football League in the 1988/89
season only at Liverpool did the average attendance exceed the
projected all seated capacity of the ground.  In fact, at 21
of these 44 clubs the projected all seated capacity was not
exceeded at all throughout the season. Consequently the
problem of over demand for tickets may not be as serious a
problem as you envisage.

                                                              Yours sincerely

             Your view that all seated accommodation at football grounds
             will not solve the problems of crowd safety and control has
             been noted. However, it is a view which the government does
             not share and which does not equate with the views expressed
             by Lord Justice Taylor in his Final Report on the Hillsborough
             Stadium disaster.   He recognised that there was no single
             solution to achieve total safety and cure all the problems of
             crowd control.  However, he was satisfied that seating does
             more to achieve these objectives than any other single
             measure.  Furthermore this is in line with the policies of
             both FIFA and UEFA.

         apologise for the delay in replying to you.

         You express your concern that the recommendations contained in
         the Final Report of Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry into the
         Hillsborough Stadium disaster should not be applied to sports
         other than football and in particular
         The Report states that "crowd problems are directly related to
         the nature of the event and the numbers attending it." In
         circulating the Report to local authorities the Home Office
         advised that it would be consistent with the Report's findings
         for local authorities to take proper account of these factors
         when applying the recommendations to individual grounds.

                                                                   Yours sincerely

Thank you for your recent letter to                         which
has been passed to this department in view of our responsibilities
for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I apologise for the delay in
replying to you.

Lord Justice Taylor recognised, in his Final Report, that there is
no single solution to achieve crowd safety and cure all the
problems of crowd control.  However, he was satisfied that seating
does more to achieve these objectives than any other single
measure. He also considered that moving to all seated
accommodation was consistent with the policies of both FIFA and
UEFA.

I understand your feelings and those of many others who wish to
stand at football matches.  However, Lord Justice Taylor said on
his Final Report:

"I am not convinced that the cherished culture of the terraces is
wholly lost when fans are seated. ... The communal spirit is still
there and finds ready expression. To such extent as the seating
limits togetherness or prevents movement, that price is surely
worth paying for the benefits in safety and control."

This is a view with which the Government is in agreement.

Lord Justice Taylor also commented that it should be possible for
clubs to plan a price structure which suits the cheapest seats to
the pockets of those presently paying to stand. He pointed to
Ibrox where seating is £6 and standing is £4, which he did not
consider to be a prohibitive price or differential.  Therefore, the
fears of many spectators that they may no longer be able to afford
to attend football matches may be unnecessary.

                                      Yours sincerely




                                      MR S BILBE

                                       Planning Department)
        There is little which I can add to the very comprehensive
        analysis by Lord Justice Taylor in his Final Report.  He
        recognised that there is no panacea which will achieve total
        safety and which cure all the behaviour and crowd control
        problems at football matches. He was, though, of the opinion
        that seating does more to achieve these objectives than any
        other single measure. He also considered that moving to all
        seated accommodation was consistent with the policies of both
        FIFA AND UEFA.

        All seated accommodation is, we believe, a major step towards
        creating a better, safer environment in which all spectators
        can enjoy the game. That is the reason why we have supported
        Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation and why we propose to
        implement it.

        It has always been vital in the interests of spectator safety
        that admission is controlled and monitored in such a way as to
        ensure that the authorised capacity for any part of the ground
        is not exceeded.  The Final Report recommended that the
        maximum density at which spectators should occupy terraces
        should be reduced. The Home Office have therefore made it
        clear to local authorities that the reduced maximum figure
        should, where appropriate, be used until such time as the
        Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (the Green Guide) has been
        amended.

                 I am a single man and live at the above address with my parents.

                 On Saturday 15th April               1989 I a ttended the F .A . Cup Semi Final between

                 Liverpool F ,C . and Nottingham F .C . at the Hi Iisborough ground,

                 Sheffield.

                 I travelled with 4 friends                    in a car,



                 Albert ATKINS,                                                                and Peter McD O NN EL L, 'who

                 unfortunately died at the incident                           r    r   u   s


                 I had a si:< pound ticket for the Leppings Lane standing area ticket,

                 which I bought from Anfield,                      I am a Liveyfiool fan and have been for

                 We left Liver,poja4 at about J5* am                               travelled straight to ghefj^reld

                 arriving there at about               11.30 am.                  We were delayed as we left the Ml

       to enter Sheffield,      due to heavy traffic,        and some roadworks.

       We parked the car on a street opposite a large pub near to the ground,

       I can't remember     its name.

       We went over to that      pub but it was      completely full, we then walked

       further up the hill ;to the S p o / ^ i a r i l w e   all had a drink and

       something to eat.

       We all had 4 pints of lager , inc 1uding Peter McJEKfNNELL.             The       pub was

\C r   full of L i v e r p^aajr supporters and a few Nottingham fans,         b u t , the re was

       no drunkenness.

       We left the pub at about 2.30/m a nd all the people            in our group walked

       down to the ground together^            We recieved no Police direction or

       escort down to the ground.         Walking down to the ground I saw no

       drunkenness violence or disorder .. . .
                                                                          ‘      . . .
       I arrived at the ground at about 2,45pm,              It was absolutely nectic

       outside the ground,      it was just a crowd outside the ground with no

       organised queues o r anything.           As the time went on it got more and

       more crowded so much that you couldn’t move.              It was not clear,         which

       set of turnstile to use as there were no signpo st s.            We made our way

       to the middle set of turnstiles as it was totally crowded on the right

       and the wrought     iron gates there were shut and people were being

       crushed up against them.         P e t e r was right behind   me at this stage in

       fact he was hanging onto         me because he was quite      small and in order

       that we wo u l d n ’t be separated.

       Eventually I got right into the right hand corner of that area by the

       West Stand terracing and         next to a metal wall and by a drain pipe.

       The   crushing was intense       so I                         npipe and onto the

       wall and then stood in the £oof of the turprffiles.             A number of people

       were doing the same thing.

       I looked back into the crowd and saw some of the people in our group

       and assumed they were either going to climb over,             or get through the
                                                                                      PAGE    3
                                                                                      S3137

tur nstiles,       As far as I am aware Pe             was right b             hen I

climbed up and over,           but I    d i d n ’t see him again aft §/r that point

d o n ’t know how we got        into    the ground.

There were a number oJr Police Officers               inside J m e   g T - ^ f t l f n g

us to jump down a n / t h e y ’d        catch us, wJni ch^i s what I did.

The only Police directions              I saw outside the ground, were two          Police

horses o ne outside the terrace turnstiles was trying to push people

back with his horse,           but the one outside our turnstiles was just

sitting there doing nothing.

I remember one of my friends spoke                 to the officer who was trying to do

something and asked him what he was going to do                   about the crush and

the officer shouted back "If it w a s n ’t for you, Dickheads turning up

late this w o u l d n ’t be happening” .

After jumping down into the ground                 no one asked   me for my ticket which

I have still got.        I was the first           of our group   to get in and I stood

there watching for them.               Some came through the turnstile and others

climbed over the fence.

We all gathered together            inside the ground.       LaU^rar       I had gone into

the terracing and had been crushed in there and had been ^u^l^tTlIp

into the^Wjy^t^ S t a n d .     So this y e a r l / ^ c ided because of that fact and

that    it was obviously that theis^/was going to be a rush into that

area.        I decided to chance, it ajpd try and get into the West Stand,

This would have bee^t about 3 pm,

So with                                                              us into the West

Stand.             was grabbed by a              ewoman and was taken down the

s ta irs ,     I got to the top and                    and the other then came and

joined me.

On getting       into the Stand I could see it was crowded behind the goal

in the terracing and that people were trying to/climb out of the front

and the Police were           pushing them b a c k i n .
                                                                          PAGE      4
                                                                          S3157

I then went to the back of the West Stand.        I then saw an officer

trying to help people out of the terracing.       One fan went and spoke to

GROBBELAAR who told him to get off.

Shortly after that the match was stopped and large numbers of people

were getting out of the terracing.      I could see people lying on the

pitch and being treated,    but I couldn’t recognise any of them.

I stayed in the stand until an announcement saying the patch was

abandoned a nd we all   left shortly after that at about 4.30 pm.

We realised Peter was missing when       we got back to the car, we waited

for about an hour and then we made some enq^j^Tes       at the |H^i<fam

Hos^pi^^l^but we could n’t find anything out,    so   we made our way h o m e .         |

It w a s n ’t until the next day that I found out Peter had died.

Once    in the ground I did not see anything   I consider to be a criminal
                                                                                        |
offence or any consumption of alcohol.       I did not see the barrier

break   in Pen 3, but there were a number of surge in that area but I

d o n ’t know what caused it.                                                           j


I didn't sas the tun ne1 under the West S t a n d .

The Pol^fe at the front of 'Lhe terracing seemed slow tuGf'react to what

was happening,   despite ti^e fact that it was clear to everyone else

that there was crushi I

In fact some Officers just turn/d their b a c ^ " o n them.     The Police    put

a line across the halfway lVne but peoj^lre were running through them

with dead and injured, why didn't J^ey help and some didn't even

move out of the way for \tretcj?ers.

I don't think you can blame the Officer who opened the gate outside as

the same thing could have happened there.

I received no injuries as a result of the incident.

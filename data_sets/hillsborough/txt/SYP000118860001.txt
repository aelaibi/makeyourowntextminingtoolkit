              On S at u r d a y    13 April,         1989   (150489)        I paraded for       duty at D o nc as te r

              DHQ at 083 0 hours.               I was a member          of serial          no. 28,    w h ic h was

               super vi se d by PS 240 8 W i ls o n from A1.

              Our       duty as a serial was             to work      in L ep pi n gs L a n e , S h e f f i e l d mann in g

              the barriers w h ic h were               placed across          side    roads a long L e p pi n gs Lane

               I had been d e t a il e d to work w ith PC 2 6 4 4 Roberts,                      from A 1 , at         the

               location L e pp in gs Lane             j un ction F ar nd a le R o a d .

               Inspector S e lw o od of             * E ’ D i v is i on had overall         command of our           sector.

              After       the briefing at H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m we made our w a y to our

               point and at a bout             1145 hours       placed the        barriers acr os s         the m ou th of

               the      road.

               At this time there were                 persons who were           o b vi ou sl y a t t e n d in g    the

               m atch     in L ep pi ng s Lane        but they we re well            b e ha ve d and not      large        in

               numbers.

               Neit he r myself          nor PC R o be rt s     had a radio a n d to the best                 of my

               knowledge        only PS W i l s on had a radio w it hi n our s e r i a l .

               By about         1230 hours      large       numbers    of    persons were w a lk i n g        down

     L e p p i n g s Lane   towards     the stadium.         At this       time   it was a pp ar en t        that

     large a mo u n ts       of alcohol     were     being    consumed.        I saw m any       persons

     carrying       bags,     packs and      bottles    of alcohol.           It was a sight         that

     caused me       to feel      uneasy.      I w o u ld not     like to estimate            the   number        of

     people who were           drink in g    from 2    Itr bottles as well as               carrying other-

     full    ones w it h t h e m .      1 w ou ld say that        from where        I was     standing to

     the s t a d i u m gate w o u ld have       been a walk           of only 3 to 4 m i n u t e s , w h ic h

     in my view meant             that unless       they were going          to surrender        the drink

     at    the stad iu m g a t e s , people we re goi ng to               consume    vast a m ou nt s of

     alcohol      in a very short           space    of time and at this time               I feared for

     what may       ensue, although          the scale       of what was       to follow did not

     crass my mind.

     Some    of the     crowd began to drift            back from the stadium and                   1 recall

     being a s k e d    for d ir ec ti on s    to    pubs an d    clubs      nearby,   man y of those

     who a s k e d for d ir ec t io n s a l re a d y    smelled s tr on gl y of alcohol               and some

     were wa r n ed     that      should they drink an y more              they w ould most          likely be

     r efused a d m i s s i o n    to the game.

     directions        to the      "Club that       put on scran and beer for               us    last time".

     L ep p i n g s Lane     by this    time was a mass          of    persons,     no doubt most           had

     tickets      but m an y had       not and kept asking me              if 1 knew where          they

     could get one and sales                of tickets were           o b vi ou sl y taking      place with

     large     crowds       quic kl y g ath ering a ro un d anyone who had tickets                    for    sale.



                       an d the     lady from the house          came out to us to tell               us that

     in the      past she      had had problems wit h          persons       urinating

                               back    of her house.         Both her and her husb an d               then

     kept mak i ng      r ep eated     complaints      to us about         this   occurring.         Both

     my se l f and PC Robe rt s         turned from our          point     to w at ch for any such

     oc c u r rences    but    did not see      this    happening.

    By 2pm     (1400)      L ep pi ng s Lane was       full        and    the wall        of the house           I have

    just    referred to was           full    of people          drinking        from cans/bottles               like

    alcohol     was    going out of fashion,                as was        the

    surely tna-i'fied officers           of man y years              could have made              better    use of

    Some    time    just after 2pm           (1400)    I was         detailed        by a Chief         Inspector,

    who    I did not know to go and stand                                                                b ehind the

    lady's garden to stop persons                    urinating                                that     I have

    already mentioned.

    I did feel        that    this was       un ne ce ss ar y be cause with the sheer                      volume       of

    persons,       many,     many of whom were well                  intoxicated a PC on his own was

    vulnerable and a gain even more                   so without a radio and the                        crowds were

    so massed that had an officer                    got    into      trouble no one w ould have                   been

    able    to see th"e fact and             react accordingly.                  What     further made           this

    exercise       seem    pointless was that              the     lady who was doing all                  the

    c omplaining must          have had to have been w at ching                        from her        roof top,

    because had anyone              been urinating                                 they would have had

     their     back     to her house and were                 s hi elded from her house windows                              by



     D uring     the time         to now the only contact we had was s u pe rv is or y

     officers       paying what visits               they     could avid having a quick                        chat.

     At what       I w ould estimate              to be    perhaps S . 30          (1430)       to S . 35          (1435)

     there was a lull              in the        crowds and       I left     the                             and    reformed

     PC Roberts         in F ar nd a le Road.

     At about 2.45 pm             <1445)        Leppi ngs Lane       became        sheer hell as hoards                      of

     The    crowds who were               now filling        the area were              truely unruley and

     behaving        in a disgraceful              manner,     when     I tried to warn several

     persons as         to their          state    the    standard      reply was            "Fuck off" and had

     an arrest        tried to be made              X have      no doubt a serious                  public          order

     s it ua ti on w ould have arisen.

     During      this       period     I do honestly          feel    that the officers                      in Leppings

     Lane      were at great            risk from the mob who were filling                              the    road.

     Some      of the elderly             people from F ar nd al e Road were standing                               behind

     the barriers w at ch in g the mob and their                          comments were                 of disgust           that

     so    called football             fans      could behave        in such a m a n n e r .                 The     general

     behaviour         of these        people made me feel asha me d to think                                that should

     they follow their               team abroad we may all                 in E n gl an d be judge d by

     their actions a nd b e h a v i o u r .

     At kick off time               the    road was       still    a mass      of people            but we had been

     instructed             to take meals         in ones at this time                  so PC Robe rt s              set off

     for C l a y w h e e 1s Lane          to have his meal.

     He had been gone               some 5 minutes whe n several                       transit      loads o +

     officers went along Leppings Lane                    towards    the ground and PC Roberts

     reappeared.          I a sked him why he had            come back and he was            under    the

     impression that            there was a fight at          the ground.          We stayed at our

     point as some          Inspector      had told PC Roberts            so to do.

     S ho rt ly after       this an elderly        resident       of the area came          to us and

     told us that         she had just       heard on the         radio    that    someone had been

     killed at the ground.

     The    next    thing    I saw was e mergency service             vehicles of all          types

     heading       into L ep pi n gs Lane       towards    the ground.        W ith the      lack of

     communi c a t i o n s , it was a case of follow the                  last order       so PC Roberts

     and myself       stayed on our         point.     The   old lady then          reappeared and

     said that she had just               put her TV on and that several                  people were

     dead    in what      she    thought   had been a pitch          invasion.

     It was    then that         people    began to walk up Leppings Lane away from the

     ground    in mass       numbers and some of them at first stopped to tell                          us

     what    had happened.            But w ithin a few minutes           of this      the m ood of the

     crowd had become            very aggressive.         Bot h of us were          spit upon and

     verbally a b u s e d , some wanted           to fight w ith us but            commonsense

     dictated that we stood our ground and                       prevented them from entering
ft




     the    side    roads.       Of   those who    spit and ab us ed us we did not answer

     but tried to assist              the genuine    fans who were         shocked and wan t in g           to

     ring home to inform the               relatives      that   they were        safe.

     It must       have   cost    the   residents    of F ar ndale Road a considerable

     amount    of m oney        in a ll owing    g en uinely w o rr ie d fans the use          of their

     phones

     At one stage we had to let a man and his wife who was                                pregnant    into

     Farndale Roa d and           into one of the houses            because       the m in dl es s   drunks

     had    recognised that           they were    locals with the shopping               they were

     carrying and were            badly abusing      them.

     Although       1 had    reservations at the earlier              stage of the day           I felt as

         the    crowd    left the ground that we were at any time               likely to be

         assaulted.

         The worst       part of the departing          crowd for me was when a man           came to

         me artd said he had not            been able     to find his young     son.      I had to

         tell    him that       I had no radio arid could not directly assist                him irt

         contacting       the    g r o u n d , he was at first and u nd e rs t an d ab l y abusive        but

         then a po lo g is e d an d was at       crying    point.    F or t un a te l y there was a dog

         van over       the    road and    I took   him to this for help via the           radio.

         1 cannot       pass    comment   on the following      points    because   I did not         see

         or take    part       in them.

By    2 .0 0    pm    (1400)         Leppings             Lane         was    full       and       the    wall       of     the

house      I h a ve        just      referred             to was            full    of       people       drinking             from

cans/bottles               like      alcohol            was       going       out       of    fashion,          as      was      the

                                                 opposite.

Some      time       j u st     after       after         2 . 00       pm    (1400)          I was       detailed           by    a

Chief      Inspector,               who     I did         not      k n ow,     to       go an d         stand

                           behind          the     lady's          garden          to    stop       persons          urinating

                        that        I have         already             mentioned.

I did      feel       that         this     was      unnecessary               because             with    the       sheer

volume         of    persons,            m a ny,     many         of    whom       w er e     w e ll     intoxicated,                 a

PC    on his         own      was    vulnerable               and       again       even more             so w i t h o u t        a

radio      and       the      crowds        were        so m a s s e d        that       h ad      an    officer          got

into      trouble          no      one     would        have       been       able       to see          the    f a ct      and

react      accordingly.                    What      further            made       this       exercise          seem

pointless            was      that       the     lady        who       was    doing          all    the    complaining

must      have       had      to    have       been       watching            from       her       roof    top,         because

had      anyone       been         urinating                                       they       would       h av e     ha d      t heir

back      to    her     house        an d      w er e     shielded            f r o m her          house       windows           by




During         the    time         to n o w      the      only         contact          we    had was          supervisory

officers            paying         what     visits           they       could       and       having       a quick             chat.

At    what      I would            estimate          to      be    perhaps          2 .3 0      (1430)         to    2.35

(1435)         there       was      a lull         in     the      crowds          and       I left       the

and      reformed          PC R o b e r t s        in F a r n d a l e         Road.

At    about         2.45      pm    (1445)         Leppings             Lane       became          sheer       h e ll     as

hoards         of    drunken mindless                     'fans'            arrived          from       nowhere         heading

for      the    Leppings            Lane       end      of    the       ground.              There       is no       doubt        in

my m i n d      that       of      the     perhaps           2-3       thousand          people          who    appeared

f ro m    nowhere,            90    pe r    cent        were       drunk       an d      well       so.        I did        not

approach         of       these       fans.

Th e    crowds        who       were    now       filling        the       area          were       truly        unruly           and

behaving         in a d i s g r a c e f u l         manner,          when           I tried          to w a r n        several

persons         as    to    their       state,       the       standard              reply          was     "Fuck        off"

and     had    an     arrest          tried       to be     made       I have             no     doubt       a serious

public        order        situation          would       have       ar isen.

During        this        period       I do h o n e s t l y           feel that                the    officers           in

Leppings         La n e     w e re     at    great    risk            f r o m the m o b who               were         filling

the     road.

Some     of     the       elderly       people       from Far nd al e                    Road       were     standing

behind        the     barriers          watching          the       mob        and       t h e ir    comments           w e re         of

disgust         that       so    called       football           fans          could        behave          in    such        a

manner.          The       general          behaviour          of    t h ese         people          made        me    feel

ashamed         to    think       that       should       t he y     follow              their       team        abroad           we

ma y    all     in E n g l a n d       be    judged       by     their          actions             and     behaviour.

At     kick     off       time    the       road    was     still          a    mass           of p e o p l e    but     we        had

been     instructed              to    take       meals     in        ones at             this time         so PC

Roberts         set       off    for C l a y w h e e l s       Lane        to       have       his     meal.

He     had    been        gone    some       5 minutes           when          several           transit          loads           of

officers         went       along       Leppings          L a ne     towards              the       ground        and        PC

Roberts         reappeared.                 I asked       h im      wh y       he    ha d      come       back        a nd    he

was     under        the    impression             that     there          was       a fight           at       the    ground.

We     stayed        at    out    point       as    some       Inspector                 had     t ol d     PC    Roberts              to

do     so .

Shortly         after       this       an    elderly        resident                of    the       area        came     to us

an d    told     us       that    she       had    just     heard          on       the     radio         that        someone

ha d    been     killed          at    the    g r ou n d.

The     next     thing          I saw was          emergency           service              vehicles             of    all

type s        heading       into       Leppings       L a ne        towards              the     gr o u n d .         With        the

lack     of c o m m u n i c a t i o n s ,         it was       a case           of       follow        the       last        order

so PC       Roberts             and       myself         stayed         on    our       poin t.          T he      old    lady

then       reappeared                and      s ai d     that       she      had    j us t        put    her       TV    on     and

that       several            people          w e re     dead       in w h a t      she       thought           h ad     been        a

pitch       invasion.

It    was       then        t hat       people         began        to w a l k      up       Leppings           L ane     away

stopped           to    tell         us      what      h ad    happened.                But       within        a few m i n u t e s

of    t h is      the m o o d           of    the      crowd        had      become          very       aggressive.                  Both

of    us    w e re      s pit        upon       and      verbally            abused,          s ome      wanted          to     fig ht

with       us     but       commonsense                dictated           that      we       stood       our       ground        and

prevented              t h em      f ro m     entering           the      side      roa ds .            Of    those       wh o       spit

and      abused         us      we      did     not      answer         but      tried        to      assist        the       genuine

fans       w ho      w er e     shocked            and     wanting           to r i n g       h om e     to     inform          the          -

relatives              that        t he y     were       safe.

It m u s t        h av e      c os t      the      residents            of    Farndale             Road       a considerable

amount          of m o n e y         in      allowing           genuinely           worried             f ans      the    use        of

the ir      phones.

At    one       stage         we     had      to    let       a man       and      his       w ife      who     was      pregnant

into       Farndale             Road         and    into       one      of    the       houses          because          the

mindless             drunks          had      recognised               that      t he y      w e re     locals          with     the

shopping             t h ey     w er e       carrying          a nd     w er e     badly          abusing          them.

Although             I had         reservations                at      the    earlier             s t age     of    the       day        I

felt       as     the       crowd         l ef t    the       ground         that       we    w er e     at     any      time

likely          to     be     assaulted.

The      worst         p art       of     the      departing            crowd       for me            was     when       a m an

came       to me        an d       s ai d     he    ha d      not      been      a bl e      to    find       his       young        son.

I had       to       tell       hi m      t hat     I had        no     radio       and       could          not    directly

assist          him     in      contacting               the     ground,           he     was      at    first          and

understandably                     abusive          but       t he n    apologised                and   was        at    crying

I cannot        p as s      comment       on    the     following          points       because          I did      not

see or     take p ar t        in    them.

1.   The       actions       of     the   stewards,           or     the a c t u a l i n c i d e n t          and

         rescue operation             in       the    g r ou n d.

2.   As    for        the   breakdown           in c o m m u n i c a t i o n s    as at       No       8t here   was

         for   us     no    communications              at    all.

Eventually,            along       with    PC R o b e r t s ,       when    all     was     quiet        we   walked

with     PS    Pearson        f r o m A2       an d   other       odd   officers,           whom        I do not

know,      to C l a y w h e e l s    Lane       where        we   eventually           regrouped          a n d were

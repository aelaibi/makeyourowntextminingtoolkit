 Dear Sir

 Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield

 Your request to interview Chief Superintendent Duckenfield has now been
 considered.  Whilst Chief Superintendent Duckenfield would wish to assist
 the inquiry team and to answer the complaints made pursuant to the Police
 Discipline Regulations 1985, he has been firmly advised by his Solicitors
 and Counsel that in view of the possibility of prosecution, which has yet
 to be decided,    he should not do so at the present time.          Chief
 Superintendent Duckenfield has reluctantly accepted that advice.

 We trust this makes the position clear.

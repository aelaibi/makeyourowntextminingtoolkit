MESSAGE

Thank you for your fax of todays date at 2.18 pm asking whether the CPS would
object to disclosure of the advice to your clients dated 15 July 1998. I appreciate the
opportunity to comment.

At this stage I would prefer it if the advice were not disclosed. The reason is that
correspondence between the police and CPS is normally regarded as being privileged
and would not normally be disclosed, particularly where that correspondence contains
advice. My immediate concern is that disclosure of this document could lead to added
pressure to disclose other documents which also attract privilege, such as other
advices, including counselâ€™s advice. It may also cause problems if subsequent court
proceedings are taken in order to force disclosure.

Perhaps we can discuss this in more detail next week ,once you have had the
opportunity of taking instructions.

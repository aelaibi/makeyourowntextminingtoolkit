10 p m .

Our    journey was^-Cfuiet u n t i l             we    came off the M1 , we then got             in quite a
  O rr
large       traffic    jam,    this was          down to the supporters              travelling    to the

match.

I remember        signs      stating     football         supporters          this way.      It took    us

probably an hour and a half                      before we          parked the vehicle        to go to the

match.

On the way        I saw      people     kr i                          pubs but     no one    real ly drunk

or    causing any       problems.

We even tu al ly       parked     in a    large grass area between two side                      streets,       I

remember       it wasn't       far from B & Q .                We    had to    wait in alane      of

traffic       for quite       some    time before we                parked.

Whe n we got out of the vehicle we just followed a stream of supporters

down the       road,    we were       not given any directions.                    However a

bit    nearer the ground             I a sked a policeman w hi ch way to the Le ppi ng s

Lane     stand,   and he told u s .

There was       no disorder          or drunkeness             I saw on the        journey    to the

ground.        When we       reached L ep pings L a n e , I could see a large                    crowd

ar ou n d    the turnstiles and there                   seemed to be no o r ga ni sa ti on of this

crowd by Police           or s t e w a r d s .

I did see       two Police        horses,         one fay the blue            entry gates before    the

turnstiles and one over                 in amongst            the    crowd.

The Police Officer             on the horse             by the blue gates was a tt em pt in g            to

get    the supporters          in order          only    letting a few through at at time but

he was       not doing m uch good on his own,                        he d efinately needed       help.

My father and sister              got    passed this Police                horse but he then blocked

my    path,    and we got separated,                   however       I e ve nt ua ll y got   passed and

joined the        crowd at the          turnstiles.

Peo pl e     continued to stream               in behind me and            I was    caught    up in the

crush outside          the    turnstiles,             I was    near turnstile B w h ic h was           on my

                  about 2.45       pm.

5.0.£             The    crush then       really got quite          bad and            people were       being s qu as he d up
  Me              against    the wall       outside,      some     people were shouting and s cr eaming                          for

      ^eA > 3 ^   people    to move b a c k w a r d s .    E v en t ua l ly           people began to climb         up on a

                  metal    fence and then over            the wall       to get           in the ground the         only

                  reason    I w ould say they did this was                   to a void the          crush.      The

                  policeman on the horse             then shouted that                  they were       opening a gate

                  a r o u nd the   corner    by this time        I was a l re ad y          filing       back to    get    out of

                  the    crush,    I then f ol lo we d       the    crowd         ar ou nd past the turnsti les              I

                  :ould then see the open gate and                   I went              rough    it.
                                                                              i   s

                  but the re was         no o n e , the only jroliceman about was                       by the gate whi ch

                  had been opened           for us to go/through.

                  If the gate       had     not been yspened more             people w ou ld have           been    injured or

                  killed outside,           but th^re     should have been someone                   inside    to direct

                  you once     inside       the ground.       I saw no police or stewards                     from my entry

                  through that gate all             the way to the end of the tunnel                        leading       to the

                  pens „

                     then saw my father and sister waiting                             for me,   we all     then went        down

'CDrtbl£lJL^. ^ ,e funnel because we thought it was the only way t/"get to the ground.

                  As we got to the end of the tunnel                     my father          realised we were           right

C T               behind the goal,          we    couldn't    turn around be cause of the flow of                          people

                  behind us so we just             tried to file         in to the          left to get out of the

                  way.     I show myself          on the grid       (Ref No ____ |M)             (Ex No            ) from

                  point    1 on the grid          I got split up from my father and s i s t e r , it

                  couldnt    be helped the          crush of       people         just made       it impossible        to move

                  as you wanted.           I then got      pushed down the terracing                      diago na ll y

                  e ve n t u a l l y stopping at a crush barrier,                      knowing   the     problems     that

                  crush barriers          cause    I quic kl y ducked down so as to go under                          it but       iu

was    imppossible             to do so.        I then    put my foot on top of it and stood

up.

Some on e Jbretvind me then pushed me so                    I feji-on to the heads               of the

fans,     ia    they      lifted me up and^J^afiaed me down to the front                         fence.       I

took     hodd of the            fence a p Kf so me on e    else    pushed my foot up so               I could

get    over\.

The    game at~TThis time               had stopped and there were                only a few      people      on

the    pitch.

Onl y a couple            of    injured     people     had been bought           out   by this    time,    and

the gate at the                front    of pen 4 had not yet             been opened.

It was now about 3.1 0                  pm I was standing          behind the goal           feeling     very

dazed.         It was      then a pol ice wo ma n gave m e \ w o               young   children to       look

a fter    one who         had    lost     his dad and one who            had    lost his brother.

E v e n t u a l l y the    brother        of the one      lad turned up and took him.

A few minutes             later     the    father     of the other        boy turned up.

I then noticed the                gate     had been opened,         there       had been anoth er        surge

trapping        people         by the open gate by U fte ir waists,

I saw one        policeman,            who was    c         ely bald,          trying e x tr em el y hard to

pull     people     from the well              of tfie gate.       The    other     policeman just

seemed more         i nterested           in pushing      people    off the fencing.             When a few

people outside             the    pen began to         pull off     the fencing,         a

policeman stopped them from doing                         it.

But a few moments                later a nother        policeman     came along and started to

pull     the fencing            the s upp orters all        joined       in and the fencing           broke

a n d was      rolled up.

People were         then        pulled out from that hole by supporters.

I was     still     very        concerned about my father and sis/er and                        I began

looking        for them         in the     crowd e ventually        I saw Jhy dad waving and

pointing        that my sisters was w ith him.                     T h is /m ad e me feel       better,    and

                                across       the field for a tt e nt i on        by medical     staff.

        ^      back and helped another                 injurlid person with 3 other            lads,     a gain    I

               carried       his feet,        he serried to be screaming about               his    ribs.     He was

               placed over by the^flaye rs tunnel                   where a p ol iceman come over              to him,

wirt-r         I was about        to help a third             person when my father          took hold of me

ft T i t ' S   and took me back to the                 pen which u^as now nearly empty.

               About 4.00        pm K en ny D A L G L E S H ^ p o k e over the      loud speaker       told us to

               help anyway we              could and    help w/ith the e mergency services.                  A few

               momein^ s -*-a t er a police a nn ou nc e me n t       came over to stay where we

               were    that the m at ch had be/n a b a nd o ne d and to keep the ticket                        stubbs.

               We e ve n t u a ll y    left the ^ o u n d      about 4 .30       pm and we went       straight         to

               our    car.

               I consider        that a contrib uting            factor    to the    injuries was        that after

               to man y      people        came    into the ground,       the    police    c o u l d n ’t see what was

               happening,        and ignored          people wishing       to    come out.      The ones who           come

               on to the        pitch,       who   stay ed on the halfway          line,    should have helped.

   ^           It was stupid to              put the Liverpool       fans       in the smaller       end.

               People     say    its to do with segregation,                well all       day in the       pubs on

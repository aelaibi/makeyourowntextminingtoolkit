FA/HILLSBOROUGH

Telephoned Glen Kirton at the FA. I told him that the
Submission to the Inquiry could not be a joint submission
with the Football League.   I informed him that the FA
should write a separate letter to the Inquiry. He wanted a
copy of the Town & Country Planning Act 1971.


Subsequently phoned the FA and spoke to Glen Kirton's
secretary tell him that the Town & Country Planning Act was
500 pages long.

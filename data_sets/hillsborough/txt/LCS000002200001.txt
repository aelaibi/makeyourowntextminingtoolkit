           Dear Mr.Mason,


           Re:   Staffline

           Serqe Paul has shared with me the correspondence he has exchanged
           with you and I do appreciate the positive comments you have made
           about BASW's activity on Merseyside since Hillsborough, and
           Indorse Serges' appreciation of the quality of you and your
           departments response, along with the other Local Authorities.

           We now have a pressing need to address the, f:inancial 1oasis c>f oar
           operation. Although BASW had no reservations about making ttie
           investment necessary to constitute the 'Staffline' service you
           will recall that we never expected to be able to operate it on
           the basis of goodwill. We have always sought to create something
           which is a resource and support to the Local Authorities rather
           than additional pressure to _ them; we do need now to clarify
           formally the understanding hitherto implied.
            For our part, as you will know, we have engaged Jane Harper to
            ?orm5?ate and provide an appropriate service until
            can then be evaluated and reviewed. Our office base at Waterloo
            and administrative support are available for the duration.

            The costs we have incurred to-date are set out below, alongside
            projections as to the total cost of sustaining the project unti
            December   You will immediately note that we                     made
            substantial commitment in respect of the fees of the .,taffli '
            Co-Ordination ; this was a considered decision t a k e n staf f l i m and
            necessary quality and sensitivity continues in the Staffline and
            you will also note that the overall projection, jevised
            light of initial experience to date, remains within the figu
            of £26,000 previously quoted to you by Serge.

                                                                                               /continued.

These figures do not include sums of money we have obtained
access to from outside sources available for the benefit of users
of the Staffline Service, nor have we made any allowance for the
value of the premises we and our landlords, The Spastics Society
are assigning to Staffline, nor for the time devoted by our
professional staff and members.

I would be grateful to receive,        at your very earliest
convenience,an indication of the extent and process by which we
can anticipate recovering our commitment from the Local
Authorities involved.

Any of us associated with Staffline are available and willing to
discuss further any of the foregoing.

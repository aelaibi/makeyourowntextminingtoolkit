Dear Jonathan


I enclose clean copies of the evidence to be called on 15 May next lor you to copy to
the public and the press.

I feel th a t for this purpose all private addresses should be deleted, although they will
be retained in the Judge's and other formal copies.


                                       Yours sincerely



                                          0

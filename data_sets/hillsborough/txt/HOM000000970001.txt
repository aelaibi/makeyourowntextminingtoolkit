someone put 3 bodies in the ambulance, I didn't get out of the driver's seat so

I didn't see who put them in.    A uniform Policeman and two people in plain

clothes who I think were Policemen got into the ambulance; they were carrying

seme personal belongings from the bodies.    I drove around to the Penistone Road

entrance to the ground and reversed up to the gym.     Two County Ambulancemen took

the bodies into the gym.    I then went and parked in Penistone Road.   I later

returned to the ambulance garage in Psalter Lane.

LORD FERRERS MEETING WITH FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS ASSOCIATION AND
THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS CLUBS: 30 MARCH

1990


Introduction


1.     This meeting was requested by Football Supporters
Association (FSA)   and the National Federation of Football
Clubs (NFFC) originally directed to the Minister for Sport.

The two organisations both claim to represent supporters.

They are not connected.    Annex A attached provides brief

details of both organisations.


Issues for discussion


2.     The FSA have catalogued their interests in their letter
of18 March (Annex B ) . The NFFC's   particular interests are
less clear but they might focus upon the relationship between

the police and supporters clubs.     Mr Goddard will cover this

if necessary.


3.     General line to take:- acknowledge the value of
supporters views on issues which affect them and express our

general willingness to consider their views from time to time.



All seated accommodation


4.     Line to take:-   The Government have supported the
recommendation for football league grounds to become all
seated.    This is seen as a major step towards improving

conditions for the benefit of all supporters.


Background



5.   The views of the FSA and NFFC on this issue are not
known.     It is possible they may wish to retain some standing
accommodation at grounds.



Role of the Football Licensing Authority


6.   The new authority will:-


     (a)     keep under review the functions of local authorities
             under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975;


     (b)     issue licences under the Football Spectators Act
             which will, as necessary, contain conditions
             directed by the Secretary of State on seated-
             accommodation.



7.   Line to take: as above:- pointing out that consideration

is currently being given to the transfer of the FLA to the

Home Office now that the national membership scheme is not to
be introduced.


8.   If raised - membership of the FLA is still under

consideration and the views of the two organisations noted.
Involvement of supporters in health and safety matters


9.     Line to take: To support the general recommendation by

Lord Justice Taylor that safety advisory groups should consult
representatives of a recognised supporters organisation on a
regular basis.    Particular arrangements for individual grounds
will be a matter for local discussion and decision.

                                       t


Background


10.    Lord Justice Taylor recommended that local authorities
responsible for safety certification should set up an advisory
group consisting of different disciplines with safety

knowledge.    He further recommended that that group should
consult recognised supporters organisations on a regular
basis.


Supporters involvement in decision making processes in the
game



11.    Line to take: This is not strictly a Home Office issue.
In general we would support the aim of consulting supporters

but it is a matter which they would need to take up with the
football authorities.
Financial support to the FSA



12.   Line to take: This is not strictly a Home Office matter.
There is no provision for this Department to provide financial
assistance of the kind envisaged.


13.   Background: If there is any support to be given to the

football supporters organisations it would be more appropriate
for it to come from the Department of Environment.   They have

no plans to provide such assistance.   The football association
are understood to be providing their own advice centre in
Italy.

THE FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS ASSOCIATION (FSA)


1.   The FSA was established in 1985 following the Heysel
Stadium disaster.   Its slogan is ’Reclaim the game1 and its

primary purpose is to give a voice in the industry to the
ordinary football fan.   Membership is drawn from all 92 League

clubs and it operates on a regional structure, with 12
regional branches and the headquarters based in Liverpool.


2.   The FSA came to national attention during the passage of
the Football Spectators Act 1989 owing to their objection to
the national membership scheme.   It received widespread
coverage in the aftermath of the Hillsborough tragedy,

principally because of the considered and compassionate views
expressed by its then Chairman, Mr Rogan Taylor.




THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS CLUBS




3.   The Federation was founded in 1927.    Its aims are to

encourage, promote and develop support for football throughout
great Britain.   Its membership consists of individual
supporters clubs and is administered through six regional

divisions.   The Rt Hon Denis Howell MP, former Minister of

Sport, is patron of the Federation.   The organisation is,
generally, not considered to be as forward-looking as the FSA.

 be able to m a n a g e in the time, that said,                      yo u did ask;

 Finally, I can c o n f i r m that M a rtin J o n e s (National                       Secretary)      and

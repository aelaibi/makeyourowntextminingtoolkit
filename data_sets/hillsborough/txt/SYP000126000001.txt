THE MIDDLE PENS WERE VERY CROWDED BUT WHERE I WAS STANDING WAS NOT TO BAD. I
STILL FEEL TERRIBLE BECAUSE I AM A QUALIFIED FIRST AIDER AND I WAS UNABLE TO
DO ANYTHING BECAUSE OF THE FENCING AND I KNEW THAT IF I WENT DOWN THE TUNNEL

THE CALLER LIVES IN THE AREA OF THE FOOTBALL GROUND STATES THAT THE PUBS DID
HAVE PROBLEMS BUT WERE NOT COMING FORWARD BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED THAT THE
POLICE WOULD CLOSE THEM FOR FUTURE MATCHES.
ALL HIS NEIGHBOURS HAVE SIMILAR COMMENTS AND WOULD BE PREPARED TO GIVE
STATEMENTS.
CALLER HAS HEARD THAT IT IS A REGULAR OCCURANCE FOR FANS OF LIVERPOOL,
MANCHESTER UNITED AND NEWCASTLE TO ARRIVE LATE WITHOUT TICKETS AND SURGE
FORWARD AT THE LAST MOMENT SO THAT THE POLICE ARE OVERWHELMED AND LET THEM
INTO THE GROUND WITHOUT TICKETS.

THOUGHT THAT THERE MUST BE ANOTHER ENTRANCE INTO THOSE TERRACES OUTSIDE THE
GROUND WHICH I HAD MISSED.AFTER I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A GATE AT THE TOP TO
FACILITATE TRANSFER BUT THE GATE AT THE TOP WAS COMPLETELY OBSCURED BY FANS,
AND WE WERE PACKED LIKE SARDINES IN A TIN AND I COULDN'T HAVE MOVED IF I HAD
WANTED TO.THERE WAS NO SIGNPOSTING.THERE WAS AN UNNECESSARY SEGREGATION ON
THE TERRACE WHICH COMPRISED LIVERPOOL FANS.IF THERE HADN'T BEEN THE FENCES
DOWN THE TERRACES PEOPLE COULD HAVE MOVED OUT. THE BARRIERS ON THE TERRACES
SEjMED FURTHER APART THAN AT OTHER LEAGUE GROUNDS.IF THERE HAD BEEN MORE
BiBStlERS THE INJURIES MIGHT HAVE BEEN REDUCED.

WENT TO MATCH WITH FRIEND                    (NO ADDRESS) PHONE:

WHEN WE GOT TO OUR SEATS IT WAS OBVIOUS EVEN 20 MINUTES BEFORE THE KICK OFF
THAT THERE WAS IN EQUALITY IN HOW THEY WERE FILLING UP THE LEPPINGS LANE
TERRACES. THERE FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE CENTRE ENCLOSURES AND HARDLY
ANYONE IN THE END TERRACES. EVEN BEFORE THE GAME KICKED OFF, THEY WERE
PULLING PEOPLE OUT OF THE ENCLOSURE TO THE STAND ABOVE BECAUSE THEY WERE
GETTING SQUASHED.
I^HINK THE UNSUNG HERO OF THIS WAS THE POLICE OFFICER WHO HAD THE SENSE TO
RUN ON THE PITCH AND STOP THE GAME. IF ANYONE HAD SCORED EVERYONE WOULD HAVE
SURGED DOWN EVEN MORE AND FAR MORE POEPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IN MY
OPINION. THE POLICE WERE EXCELLENT INDIVIDUALLY WHEN THEY WERE HELPING PEOPLE
BUT OVERALL THE CO-ORDINATION WAS TERRIBLE, NO-ONE SEEMED TO BE IN CHARGE.
THERE WAS NO MEDICAL BACK-UP FOR AGES. EVEN THE FIRE BRIGADE GOT THERE BEFORE
THE AMBULANCES. KIDS WERE DYING IN FRONT OF MY EYES, AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO
HELP THEM. THERE WERE NO ANNOUNCEMENTS ASKING FOR ANY KIND OF MEDICAL HELP.
I'M SURE THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE OFFERED SOME KIND OF
FIRST AID HELP. THEY JUST KEPT TELLING EVERYONE TO CLEAR THE FIELD SO THAT
THEY COULD IDENTIFY THE DEAD AND INJURED.

INFO      »     THE BIG DOUBLE GATE ON THE NORTH STAND WAS OPENED BY THE POLICE
                AT ABOUT 2.40PM FOR BETWEEN 3 AND 5 MINUTES. JUST BEFORE THEY
                WERE OPENED I SAW A LOT OF MOVEMENT AS IF THEY WERE TRYING TO
                FORCE THEM OPEN AND SAW ABOUT 50 POLICE STANDING IN2 LINES SO THE
                SUPPORTERS HAD TO GO THROUGH THEM TO GET INSIDE. IT WAS THEREFORE
                OBVIOUSLY A DELIBERATE ACT BY POLICE TO OPEN THE GATE

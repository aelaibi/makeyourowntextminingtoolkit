                             states:-



     I am employed as an unqualified ambulance man for SYMAS.



2.   My date of birth is 24th August 1969.



3.   I have been with SYMAS since September                   1985, spending    my

     first two years in the cadets.



4.   I am based at Barnsley Ambulance Station.



5.   On Saturday 15th April I was on duty from                0900   to 1630.   On

     the   Thursday and Friday           I had    been on duty from 0800 to

     1630.     On 15th April I was on duty with qualified ambulance
     man                   in vehicle Bravo 1101.



6.   At about 1445 we received instructions to go to

     Day   Centre    to    take    someone   to   Barnsley    District   General

     Hospital.      We arrived at the day centre a little after 1500

     and whilst in there the television was on and I saw pictures

     showing     some     sort    of   disturbance   at   a   football   ground,

     although I did not know whether it was.                  When we went out

     and got into our ambulance I could hear on the radio control

     sending ambulances to Hillsborough.



7.   As we approached Barnsley District General Hospital, control

     asked us to ask when we would be green.              I was driving and I
told      them   that we would be             green    in    about      five minutes.

Control told us to come on green as soon as possible.                                 We

were using channel 3 at the time.                      We unloaded our casualty

at Barnsley and radioed green at about 1520.                             We were told

to report on red to Hillsborough Leppings Lane.



We   approached        Hillsborough           coming     from      the    north     down

Penistone Road and arrived at about 1700.                          The police told

us   to    cross    the central        reservation which we               did and we

drove straight into a yard.                  There was also one ambulance in

the yard with its doors open.                   We opened up our ambulance.

There were patients laying around in the yard;                           there were a

few people with each of the patients.                             We    loaded up    two

patients and attended to them in the rear of the ambulance

whilst another ambulance man reversed our vehicle out into

Penistone Road.            I then got out of the back of the ambulance

to drive.        My first patient was a male aged about 23 who had

crush injuries and asphyxiation.                      We gave him oxygen with

the help of a WPC.             The second casualty was a male of about

17   who    again      had    crush        injuries.        He    had    considerable

breathing difficulties.               His teeth were clenched and so we

could     not    get   a     tube    in.      We   put      him   in     the   recovery

position and gave him oxygen.                  There was a lad of about the

same age with him who was not injured but who accompanied

him to the hospital.                We left the ground at about 1545.                 I

drove.      I think that I radioed in.                 The radio was very busy

and we continued to use channel 3.                     We had asked control on
the way to the ground if we could use the ERC channel but

were told not to do so because of the amount of traffic on

that channel.



We were going       to   the Northern General       and    were   given an

escort of two police motorbikes.          We arrived at the casualty

department where there were already four or five ambulances.

We pulled up and unloaded both of our patients.                   There was

staff there ready to take the patients.                A doctor assessed

injuries and we took both patients into the resuscitation

area where the doctor had told us to go.               I had no idea what

happened to the 17 year old who was with the younger of the

casualties.     I gave a description of the condition of each

of the patients to the doctor in resuscitation.                 We unloaded

the patients onto resuscitation trolleys and then took our

own trolleys back to the ambulance.              We could hear control

sending other ambulances back to the ground and so we went

back there without instructions.



When we arrived back at Penistone Road there was a row of

about six or seven ambulances outside the ground and so we

pulled up at the back of that queue.             We stayed there for a

little while whist those in front were used.                   Someone came

to take our body bag from the ambulance.



When   our   turn   came   to   reverse   into   the    yard    there   were

probably already about three ambulances in the yard.                    I do
not    recall    seeing      any   police      horses   there    but   nor       do    I

recall seeing them there on my first visit.



As we opened the back doors there was a patient there.                                He

had a dislocated knee.             Another lad came up with slight head

injuries and I could smell alcohol on his breath.                           Then an

ambulance       man came     to    us with      head    injuries.      He    was       a

Liverpudlian, he was not badly injured but was badly shaken.

We put him into our ambulance.                   Mr Dale asked us for our

blankets and so we gave them to him.



I think it was about 1700 by now.                 I radioed in on channel 3

to say that we were leaving Hillsborough and giving details

of the patients which we were carrying.                    I said we would go

to    Northern        General      but    we   were     told    to   go     to    the

Hallamshire.       We received a police escort and made very slow

progress along Penistone Road because of the number of fans

in the road.



We    arrived    at    the    Royal      Hallamshire     at    about      1720    and

unloaded three patients.              At about 1735 we radioed green at

Hallamshire and control instructed us to go to the B road at

Hallamshire Hospital to clear patients from F Wards to King

Edwards Hospital on Rivelin Valley Road in Sheffield to make

room at the Hallamshire for the casualties which had been

arriving there.
15.   We were met on B road by Standards and Efficiency Officer

              [     We   took   our   two   stretchers   and   loaded    the

      ambulance.     I think we were the first ambulance to arrive at

      that area.     We took two patients to C and D Wards at King

      Edwards Hospital and finished there at about 1840.



16.   We then called in green at King          Edwards, again on channel 3

      and were told to go back to base at Barnsley and instructed

      to call in before going off duty.         We arrived at Barnsley at

      1910 and called in by telephone.          We then went off duty.



Dated this   ^     day of   fA^/.     1989.

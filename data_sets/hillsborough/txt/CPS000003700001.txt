          REQUESTS FOR STATEMENTS

          Since the West Midlands Police took responsibility for the investigation
          into the Hillsborough Disaster we received many requests from witnesses we
          had interviewed for copies of their own statements. Often the requests
          were made by solicitors acting on behalf of witnesses. I discussed the
          matter with Lord Justice Taylor and separately with Dr Popper, the H.M.
          Coroner and the agreed policy was that a copy of the individual witness'
          statement would be supplied.

          Now that the investigation has moved in to a new phase it seems appropriate
          to review that policy with you. My recommendation to you is that we should
          retain the discretion to release such statements on request. Where the
          progress/outcome of the investigation is likely to be adversely affected we
          would reserve the right to decline such requests. I would be grateful,
          however, to hear your advice/direction in the continuance of this policy.

          I have written an identical letter to the Police Complaints Authority in
          order to canvas their opinions.

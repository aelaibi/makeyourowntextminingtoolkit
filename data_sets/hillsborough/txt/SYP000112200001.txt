and     they were            shouting          threats        at    me.         I c o u l d n ’t u n d e r s t a n d w h y a n d

kept     thinking            what    ar e      they     blaming          me    for, .1 just                 couldn't          grasp

what     w as    happening.               I lifted           what    seemed           a    lot        of    people       out       and

some     stage        I saw a        body        of a y o u n g      man       being           passed         to me.          He    was

purple        and     as     we    lifted        him    he    hit    his       head        on t o p         of    the    wall.           I

shouted         "mind        his    head"        or    something          and      then         thought,           he's       dead you

i di ot ,     get     him     out    of     the       way.      I was         s t i ll     telling            officers         to

assist        the     i n j u r e d as      I moved away             from what                 ha d    no w      become       the     exit

from     the     terracing           and       I encouraged              fans      and         Police         officers         to     rip

the     wire     netting           away     from       the a r e a       of    the        exit        to a l l o w m o r e         room.

How     long     I carried           t he      bodies        I do    not       know        but        eventually          the a r e a

    the     grass        had    their        faces         covered and                were      obviously                    dead          but        I

    couldn't           accept        that       and       wanted       to      help        them.

    I eventually accepted                        that          I was       surrounded               with            dead          people          and          that

    the     r a d io     was    so    jammed          that          it w a s    impossible.

    I was       finding         it    difficult                to a c c e p t     that          these              people          had       to       lay

    there      and       was    angry        that         no    ambulances             had       been              sent       to       us.        The          one

    ambulance            that       was    there          moved       away      from         the          area       behind               the     goal            and

    I could         then       see    many       more          dead     and     injured                 on the           other            side        of       the

    The     next       thing        I recollect                is    supporters              running                up     to      me a n d           telling

    People         young          and     old     were        coming        up    to me        enquiring          as    to m i s s i n g

    because            he    had     insisted           he     came     to       the     match.        I almost            broke        d o w n at

             I was         engaged          in t h i s       duty        for    s om e     time      and when           the    Nottingham

             supporters               had     cleared          the       ground       and went         to    the        North       stand where

 I am a Detective Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police and am in charge of

 the Force Serious Crime Squad.

 On I believe the 8 April 1989 I received a telephone call at my home asking

 if I was available to perform duty at the Sheffield Wednesday Football

 Ground on the occasion of the F .A. Cup Semi Final the following Saturday

 15 April 193 9                    ’ .             It subsequently transpired that Inspector Brennan of 'C'

     division had been deputed but he for some reason was unavailable.

        agreed to work and at 9•45am on Saturday 15 April 1989 I attended

 th e North Stand of the football ground where I took charge of Serials 39

 and 40 and was briefed by the senior officers present.                                                                                                                        I then allowed

 both serials who eat their packed meals, and then briefed them myself as to

  our particular duties which involved the reception of coaches on Halifax Road.

  I made my way to Halifax Road near to Chaucer School and deployed one serial

  to actually receive the coaches and another spread out along that road back

     towards the ground to ensure where possible that the Liverpool supporters

remained in the coaches until they were parked.

We were not particularly busy until about 2pm when many coaches began to
                                                                                                           *

situated on Claywheels Lane.

We gradually as coaches arrived worked our way down Halifax Road closer to

the ground and there were no difficulties experienced, the supporters

appeared to be in good spirits and few of the coach passengers appeared to

have been drinking.                Other supporters who had arrived by private car and

vans also walked past us and a number of these appeared to have been

drinking but except for the odd word of advice, no other action was

necessary.

As the time moved towards kick off, I could hear radio messages reflecting

difficulties in the control of the crowd at the Leppings Lane turnstiles

 and I could understand such difficulties as I have previously been on duty

 at that location years ago and on big occasions arranging orderly queues of

 supporters who are inclined to arrive near to kick off time is a problem.

 I gathered the units together and walked the short distance to the junction

 of the main road with Claywheels Lane.                            My radio had not been working

 particularly well' and I listened in to my Sergeants radio.                                                   We were

 supposed to return to the Traffic Garage for meal but a message was

 received that all available Officers were to go to the ground.                                                         I walked

 with my units together with a number of others along Leppings Lane and on

 reaching the turnstiles I saw a number of Policemen lined up but few

 supporters.              I did not understand what was happening and the radio was a

 succession of unintelligible messages.                             I told both my Sergeants to gather

 their serials together and X went to try and find out what was happening.

 I walked towards the service road to the right of the turnstiles and saw an

 Ambulance                       were officers rendering first aid to two people lying

        on the ground and I could hear supporters shouting that it was my fault and

        similar comments were directed at other officers around me., I ran through

        a gate and down the tunnel that leads to the area behind the Leppings Lane

        go al . I wanted to know what was happening and I saw people milling about in

        front of me.       I don’t know how but I went forward onto the running track

        and saw people lying on the ground and a parked Ambulance with two persons

         inside.      I was stood at a door to the terracing and I then started shouting

         at officers round me to lift fans who were being carried towards me from the

         terracing to help me lift them out of the crowd.                     I helped both injured and

         uninjured fans off the terracing and told officers to lift them away from

         the track to allow others through.             I don't know how long this went on but

         I began to realise that to my left was a heap of injured.                     I was shouting

         at officers near to me to carry the injured away and render first aid.                         I

         then heard someone saying 'This ones alive' and it was then X thought there

         may be fatalities but I couldn't accept that the people I was struggling to

         lift out were dead.        There weresupporters o n t h e terracing throwing

         articles towards us and they were shouting threats at me.                     I couldn't

         understand why and kept thinking what are they blaming me for, I just

         couldn't grasp what was happening.             I lifted what seemed a lot of people

         out and some stage I saw a body of a young man being passed to me.                        He was

         purple and as we lifted him he hit his head on the top of the wall.                        I

         shouted "mind his head" or something and then thought, he's dead you idiot,

         get him out of the way.         I was still telling officers to assist the injured

         as I moved away from what had now become the exit from the terracing and I

         encouraged fans and Police Officers to rip the wire netting away from the

         area of the exit to allow more room .                How long I carried the bodies I do

         not know but eventually the area in front of me cleared and I had chance

                                          STATEMENT OF WITNESS

                         {CJ Act, 1967, s.9: MC Act, 1980, s.102: MC Rules, 1881, r.70)

        to look round at the playing area immediately behind me.                       Thinking about it

        now I presume that all except for two that I lifted out were dead.                       Those

        two showed signs of life but the others did not.                        Some of the people we had

        laid on the grass had their faces covered and were obviously dead but I

        couldn’t accept that and wanted to help them.

        I eventually accepted that I was surrounded with dead people and that there

        was nothing I could do.           I completely lost track of time and can not even

        guess how long I was involved in what I have described.                        I would estimate I

         entered the terracing between 3.10pm and 3.15pm.

         I then wanted the injured and bodies removing and tried to ask on the radio

         for ambulances but the radio was just a succession of messages.

         In retrospect I don’t know if I actually tried to get through or if the

         radio was so jammed that it was impossible.

         I was finding it difficult to accept that these people had to lay there and

         was angry that no ambulances had been sent to u s .                     The one ambulance that

         was there moved away from the area behind the goal and I could then see many

         more dead and injured on the other side of the goal area.

         The next thing I recollect is supporters running up to me and telling me

         again that it was my fault and some wanting to fight me.                       One in particular

         was dragged away from me by his friends.                    I was angry and frustrated that I

         couldn't do anything to help people and found it difficult to keep my

         temper.        I tried to calm down some Police Constableswho were also feeling

         the same way and then, for some reason the Liverpool supporters began to

         charge towards the Nottingham Forest supporters on the Spion Cop.                       I

         started to form a line across the centre of the pitch and as I was doing so

         a Superintendent came to me and said something like "Get a line of

         officers, keep them apart."               I said I was doing that and continued to do

 so.    I was joined at around this time or just before by Detective Sergeant

Morton who was working in uniform.and he stayed with me.                      Myself and others

eventually formed the line and I must admit that the prospect of a riot in

 front of the Spion Cop frightened me.                 I shouted at Officers to keep the

 line intact and then met Chief Superintendent Nesbit who told me to get a

 line of Police dogs in front of the Spion Cop.                       Detective Sergeant Morton

 used his radio to ask for the Police dogs and they were very quickly in

 position.     This made me feel much better as I felt that we were now to some

 degree at any rate controlling what was happening.                       There were several

 incidents of disorder around the Police                   line and I remember supplimenting

 one end near to the players tunnel                with officers that were stood behind the

 line.

 People young and old were coming up to me enquiring as to missing friends

 and asking if people were really dead.                   I lied to them.      I said I didn’t

 know and that although I knew there were injured, I was not sure if anyone

 was dead.     I was still finding theacceptance of                    the deaths almost

 impossible on a personal basis and                 that is why X lied to them.

 A young boy, probably eleven years of age came up to us and asked if any

 young people had been hurt.               I said I didn’t know and he said that his

  friend was missing and that it was his fault because he had insisted he

  came to the match.       I almost broke down at this stage but managed to

  reassure him as best I could, helped by Detective Sergeant Morton and he

  walked back towards the Leppings Lane terracing.

  This period of time is impossible to estimate but I kept enquiring if the

  match had been cancelled.           I felt very strongly that it should have been

  and I put this point of view to a number of senior officers who approached

  me.    Eventually this decision was made and I took half the line of officers

from the centre of the pitch to the Penistone Road junction with Herries

Road to supervise the Nottingham supporters as they left.                         ^Detective
                                !                                             :
Sergeant Morton remained with me for communication and there was a uniform

 Chief Inspector there but I c a n ’t remember who it was.

 I was engaged in this duty for some time and when the Nottingham supporters

 had cleared the ground and went to the North stand where officers were

 gathered.

 I searched for my two serials with whom I had lost contact since entering

 the ground and with the help of Police Sergeant Cloke who was in charge of

 serial 40 I located all                but   three Police ConstablesandtheSergeant                who

 was in charge of serial                3-

 I talked to two Police             Constables who were part of serial 39 who had

 obviously been present             at the incident and asked them to writedown                briefly

 what they had seen.            They went away to do that and some short time later,

 after a de brief from a senior officer in the stand I sent all my officers

 preesnt plus the two who had by then completed statements to Claywheels

 Lane for transport back to Rotherham.

 I then attended a short briefing of Inspectors and above in front of the

 Police Control Room by Chief Superintendents Mole and Nesbit and returned

 to Police Headquarters.

 I should add that I am confused as to my exact position in front of the

  terracing.        I at the time of the incident believe that I was lifting

  people from the terracing through a gate but it may have been a hole in

  the wire netting, which with my encouragement wasfurther torn                         away from

  its frame at some stage to enlarge the hole.

  I also pulled two police officers from the terracing and one of these I

  have since identified as Police Sergeant 758 Morgan, ’F ’ Division who

         dead and injured had been removed.

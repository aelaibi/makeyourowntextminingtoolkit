  NOTES

1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                     Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.
3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                           Re
     C.D. died from the industrial disease of

     C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
     on drugs.                                                                                   (
     C.D. died from want of attention at birth.

     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:
     "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                     Cause of death
     care/self-neglect').

   b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
     infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
     of the following forms be adopted:
      C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
      his/her mind was disturbed).

      C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
      induced abortion.                                                    Verdict
      C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.
   c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
     it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

     C.D. was killed unlawfully.
   d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
     complete the remainder of the form.

Dear Sirs,

Re: RESUMED INQUESTS^19th NOVEMBER 1990.


If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
submit.

         faithfully,
rui

Mgfe C. McEvoy,




 Lear Mrs. McEvoy,

 Se:       Marian Hazel MoCabe.
 As fax as I am aware, you are not legally represented in respect
 of the Inquest into the death of the above named.

 I am writing to let you know that although it has been in
 my mind to resume the adjourned Inquest on the 15th of January
 1990, I have had to review my thinking on this.

 You will be aware that the Director of Public Prosecutions
 has been asked to look into the circumstances, and I have
 decided that I will not be able to resume the Inquests for
 some considerable time as I will have to review the matter
 some time after the Director of Public Prosecutions has
 announced what action if any, he would want to take.

  I will be in touch with you again regarding this when I am
  able to do so, but you should anticipate that there will be
  some considerable delay before I am in a position to say
  anything definitive.

  Whilst writing to you, I have had numerous requests for copies
  of post mortem reports from solicitors representing other
  deceased persons.

  Whilst the release of the post mortem reports presents certain
  difficulties I have decided that subject to certain safeguards,
  I am prepared to release a copy to solicitors acting for the
  bereaved, or where that is not appropriate or convenient, to
  medical practitioners.

  Should you wish me to communicate with your G.P. (or other medical
  practitioner) with a view to letting him have a copy of the post mortem
  report so that he may be able to go throu^i it with you, I would
  be grateful if you could please let me know.

   It would also be helpful if you could set out clearly the name
   and address of the doctor involved.

   Finally, if you were to move house before the resumption of the
   Inquest, I would be grateful if you could please let me have a
   note of your change of address, so that I may be able to keep
   in touch with you as and when necessary.

   Yours sincerely,
                                                         S .L.Potyoer. H.M.Coroner«

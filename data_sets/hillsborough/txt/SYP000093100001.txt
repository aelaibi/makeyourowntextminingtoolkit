other          serials,     to fortrr a line           in front   of the North stand and face                    the

crowd.           Whilst     d c i v m this,     1 was aware of a considerable                       commotion

occurring          on tbs' pitch in front                of the West       stand.          People     in the

North          stand we*re clearly a g i t a t e d about           something,             and together with

other          officers     I was subjected to considerable abuse.                             After a couple

of minutes           the serial       was     instructed to go onto the                     pitch and    clear

the area of supporters.                     It was       now clear   to m e .that a considerable

number of           persons were       injured,         many   receiving         resuscitation on the

pitch.           Efforts     to clear       the    pitch    proved futile ^nd,                together with

other          officers,     I offered what assistance               I coyrld to Police and
                                                                            /

supporters           in aidinq       the treatment and            rernoy4i of             injured    persons.

During this           period     I saw several            persons Atha were o b v iously dead and

the enormity of the- situation was now clearly apparent.                                            This was

clearly not           so in the       case of a contingent             of N o t t i n g h a m Forest

supporters           on the Hop who ware                lou/ply cheering         every makeshift

stretcher           that    passed    in front          of the Kop and behind the stand,                   and

a brief          obscene     chant    sparked fury amongst             the ma n y Liverpool
                                                                                                     P Abh      3

supporters          now on the         pitch.        A number    of Liverpol       supporters started

to make          their way towards           the Hop and        it was    obvious a public order

s i tuation        could develop at               the Kop end.       T o g ether wit h other officers,

I prevented Liverpool                  supporters a p p r o a ching       the Kop,      eventually

forming a cordon across                   the w idth of the          pitch,     In fairness       to the

Nottingham          supporters who were               now becoming aware          of the disaster

taking          place,    there were        no further        ’baiting'    of Liverpool        fans and

 Hp
wiib    danger      of    confr o n t a t i o n    ceased.   After      several   more minutes BS 812
n     r tb is                                                                                   ------
S T U O H F I E L D i nstructed myself and other                 officers      to leave the ground

a n a assist        in f a c i litating access           of e m ergency vehicles,            I left the

ground via the S outh stand and took                          up a position       in Leppings Lane

behind the west stand and a s s i s te d                     clearing    the   route for     emergency

vehicles,           After a p p r o x i m a t e l y 30 minutes        I was    instructed      to a t t e n d

in P en is t o n e R oad and assist with the                    departure      of N o t t i n g h a m Forest

su pporte rs        concentrating           on the     public transport         lined up in P e nistone

Road.       Their        departure was            very orderly aria went almost without

incident.           Once     the ground and surrounding                 roads were      cle,ar I

a t t e nd ed at     the ce-briefin g

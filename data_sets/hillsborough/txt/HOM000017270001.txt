     Dear Lord Taylor,

     As the National Cornell member responsible for Travel and Crowd Control matters,
     may I just register with you Federation's wish to present evidence at an
     appropriate time to your inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.   We were pleased
     to be able to contribute to Lord Justice Popplewell's earlier report and are eager
     to play our part in improving the circumstances m which vast numbers of people can
     cn^knue to enjoy their favourite spectator sport.          Liverpool's, Nottingham
     Fewest!s and Sheffield Wednesday’s official supporters * clubs are members of our
     organisation and undoubtedly will have both general and specific first-hand
     experience which they may wish to contribute. Additionally, as your remit is wide,
     other clubs may have general proposals which you might find benefit in considering.

     Our member clubs have already been circularised by us prompting than to prepare any
     information which they believe to be of relevance. On the wider front, you may be
     interested to see a copy of a questionnaire I have enclosed which has been in use
     during this season and whose results we would be willing to make available to you..
     Although they are not being completed by all member clubs, since they are targetted
     on the manner in which visiting fans are treated,, taken together they provide
     information on almost all English League grounds. For example, they highlight the
     sort of differential treatment which causes at least perplexity, at most anger and
     which can therefore lead to highly-charged emotions - often even before the
     football starts!

      Sane first thoughts - (1) a national code of practice for policing so fans know
      before they set off how they are likely to be treated (e.g. why on a rainy day
      should visiting fans be refused admission with umbrellas because they might be used
      as offensive weapons when home fans all have theirs up on the terraces), (2) a
      voucher system to ensure equal distribution of fans on different sections of
      terracing and prevent overcrowding, and (3) it to became an offence except in
      emergency to encroach the field of play at any sporting event (as a trade off for
      the removal of fences).

      I assure you of our full co-operation, either directly or in contacting our         member
      clubs.

                                               Yours      sincerely
                                                       >r\

           0 n 15 1h A p r i 1 1989 (1304S9> | was sub sector two Inspector            in charge of j

           Serials 4, 5 and 6 and basically                in charge of the area at the rear of

            the South Stand from the Penistone Road end through to near Gats C on

           Leppings Lane end.

           Superintendent GREENWOOD was the Sector Commander,

           On 14th April          1989 <140489)    I am aware that there was a briefing for

            Inspectors and a b o v e .     In fact I d i d n ’t attend that briefing because oj

           other commitments — Sergeant 7E9 N O R B U R N E , I think, attended on               Swy


           behalf.     For my part I collected my serial             briefing notes from

           Hammerton Road Police Station during that day.

           Qn 15th April          1989 (150489)    I briefed my serials in accordance with the

           briefings      I had been given supplemented with information I had gleaned

           from the main briefing that day which was given by Chief Superintendent
                                                                        \

                                                                                         S12

         D U C K E N F I E L D , Superintendent MURRAY and Detective Sergeant C H A R LE S WO RT H .

         I received no separate briefing from Superintendent GREENWOOD a lt ho u gh

         obviously I did see him from time to time during the day whilst he was

         making supervisory visits.

         Although Sergeant NORBURNE also briefed me regarding what had been said

         at the briefing he attended on 14th A p r i l * 1989 (140489),           I cannot

         recall he making any m e n tion of the need to monitor            crowd capacities

         wit hi n the ground and not to allow Liverpool           supporters with tickets

         for the Spiori Kop to be moved from the Kop to Leppings Lane for safety

         reasons.    But then I wouldn"t have necessarily expected him to mention

         that because it w a s n ’t relevant to my duties that day.

                                                                             T HARVEY SIGNED

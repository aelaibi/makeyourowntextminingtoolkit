HILLSBOROUGH - DOCUDRAMA AND FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE


I enclose two letters which the Home Secretary has received from Hillsborough families,
coinciding with the McGovern docudrama shown last Thursday. You may already have
the letter from Mr Kilfoyle seeking a meeting with the Home Secretary.

2.     I would be grateful for advice as to the next steps which the Home Secretary should
be taking on this issue - out of which replies to the letters should fall. You should be
aware that the Law Officers Department (Mr Wooler) have expressed an interest in this,
not least because Mr Kilfolyle has asked to see the Attorney General as well.

3.    The Home Secretary hopes to have watched the video o f the McGovern programme
by the end o f the weekend.

                                                 7 December 1996
    Mr Michael Howard
    Home Secretary
    c/o House of Commons
    London SW1


    Dear Sir,

    We, the family of Graham John Roberts, killed at Hillsborough, 15
^   April 1989 - aged 24 years, are writing to you to ask if you will
    reopen the inquiry into this disaster? We feel that so far there
    has been no justice.  As well as the concerns already highlighted
    by the TV programme "Hillsborough", and the comments expressed by
    Mr Trevor Hicks, Chariman of our Support Group, we have a number
    of further points we wish to bring to your attention.

    This first information we received in April 1990 regarding Graham
    was "A Report into the death of.." which states Graham died at
    16.25 hours - the 3.15pm    cutoff time for information would mean
    that Graham was not dead    for his inquest. We received two
    conflicting reports from police constables who thought   they dealt
    with Graham.  One stated Graham was wearing a sleeveless T shirt,
    the other that Graham had no shirt on at all.    Neither of these
    descriptions fit with the clothing Graham was wearing on the day.
    We have no information what-so-ever regarding what happened to
    Graham on that day once he had been forced apart from his
    friends.

    In spite of phoning the emergency numbers continually, and,
    although Graham was identified by one of his friends at 2.00am on
    the Sunday, we were not informed of Graham's death until his
    friends had driven back from Sheffield at 6.00am.   In fact it was
    Graham's friends who had to break the tragic news    tous, even
    though they had pleaded with the Sheffield police    tolet us know,
    as they did not feel able to do so themselves.

    Please, please will you allow us and all the other bereaved
    families to find out what happened on that day?  I'm sure you can
    understand why we need to know the truth.  It is within your
    power to insist on the reopening of the inquiry, and we all
    sincerely hope and pray you will do so.

    Thanking you in anticipation for your attention to this letter.

    Yours sincerely.

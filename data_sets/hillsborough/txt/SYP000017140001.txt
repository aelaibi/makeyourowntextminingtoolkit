                             STATEMENT CONCERNING THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
                                            ON SATURDAY 15TH APRIL. 1989.



                We set of for Hillsborough at approximately              10.20®pi, and arrived

                at the Sportman Pub in              Sheffield   at around 1 pm.   We left the

                pub at 2 pm having drank two pints.              There wsre eight of us in a Montego

                Estate car, and we found parking space at about 2.20 pm which was

                a ten minute walk from the ground.              We reached the ground at

                approximately 2.30 pm; as we walked down we could see it was bedlam

                down there.



                It was obvious there was no organisation, no queueing, which we found
.....   ■   ■                      ■    %     .

                hard to believe for a crowd like this.              There was just a mass of

                people.     We encounted very few police on the way to the ground.               To

                our knowledge there was no trouble, and we had noticed very few with

                cans in hand going towards the turnstile.



                On reaching the ground it was obviously everyone for themselves, it

                was ridiculous; you could hardly move, arms were trapped in whatever

                position you stood.               On going through the turnstile at approximately

                2.40 pm, I said to the fellow collecting tickets that the situation

                outside was ridiculous, and if they didn’t do something people would

                be killed.       I admit I swore at him, so he called for a policeman

                to arrest me.          A copper came but told him to behave, and sent me

                t.hrnuch.    T   would mention        here that only some of us were asked to

                show tickets, the rest kept theirs intact



                Having got inside three of us met, so we waited for two others who

                were also in the ground with us, (three others were in the side stai

                I turned round and saw a policeman open a side gate at approximately

                2.MO pm, so we decided to move quickly, as you could see a rush was
                                               2



imminent.



We started walking towards the tunnel, as it was the only way we

could see, apart from stairs leading to the stand, so we decided to

see if we could get in there.                There were only two stewards and one

policeman who didn't seem interested, and we just walked past and

up into the stand.      Having squeezed onto seats with other people,

one person turned round and said the middle of the ground looked

overcrowded.   The teams were just coming out onto the pitch as we

got to our place.      At that time there was a sudden surge down

below.   Fro^oujg position approximately eight rows back in the

stand, we could c®ly see the front of the ground section by the

perimeter fencing, slightly left of the goal.                   We then saw people

climbing up on the front fence and lads were pulling people up

into the stand.     Some of the people climbing on the fence seemed

to be getting pushed or told to get back by the policemen at the

front.   Slowly though, some were getting over and pleading with

police to do something to help.                    At least one policeman was seen

to shrug his shoulders.              Eventually though, a policeman ran to

the referee to explain and to stop the game.                    It was obvious then

that something serious had happened and still the police were

 slow to move in, seeming more concerned about encroachment onto

 the pitch than what was wrong in the terracing.



 At one stage about one hundred police walked infront of the big

 main stand where nothing was happening.                   There was still nothing

 on the tannoy to    e x p l a i n   t h e   situation and the Nottingham Forest

 fans were getting agitated, believing it was hooliganism.                   The

 net behind the Leppings Lane end was pulled down by Liverpool

                                 chanting and yelling, not realising what was happening.                                                       It wasn't                                        -

                                 had ripped down the advertising boards to use as stretchers while

                                 the police on the halfwayline stood around watching, only moving

We make the following points



1.   Organisation outside - no proper queues or gates stopping

     people getting near the turnstiles.

2.   Organisation inside - no policing or stewarding to give

     instruction to people as to what direction it was safest

      to enter the terracing.

3.   ’Slow police reaction to what was happening.

4.   The manning of the police on the halfwayline and by the side

      stand was alot more than by where the tragedy happened.

5.   The Football Associations decision as to the choice of
                      tf-
     ground and the inadequate ticket allocations left alot

     to be desired.

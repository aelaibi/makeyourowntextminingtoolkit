TREVOR BICHARD
POLICE CONSTABLE 1370
33 YEARS(
HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION
HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD.
TEL: 852211

I am a police constable with South Yorkshire police at present stationed at Hammerton
Road police station, Sheffield. I am at the present time working beat duties on *B*
group but also have resposibility operating the static video system which is installed
at Hillsborough football stadium ^Sheffield.
On a personal level I have visited Hillsborough stadium on many occasions as a spectator
standing on the terrace at the Spion Kop end of the ground and the leppings Lane terrace.
I have also worked in all parts of the ground as a police officer during my past 8 years
service.
In September 1987 I took over duties relating to the video system working from the police
control box and since that time I have attended a 3 day course in relation to the use
of video systems for command and control and as a method of evidence gathering.
The original system installed at Hillsborough was laid out as a command and contol system
giving a basic all round view both inside and outside the ground. Whilst I have been invol­
ved with the duties the emphasis has shifted from command and control to evidence gathering
and with that end in mind several improvements have been made the most recent being a
survey of the Leppings Lane end camera, the intention being to move the camera from its
present position attached to the roof of the West stand bringing it down to a position
just above the turnstiles. The survey was carried out using a»band held video camera mount­
ed on the platform of a hydra&lie lift. Two positions were considered, the first mounted
on a pole at the far most corner of the Leppings Lane turnstiles the second position just
above gate *B*. It was defcMed 'that the best position would be above ’B* gate. This position
giving good all round views along Leppings Lane, to the turnstiles below and the court yard
at the rear of the Leppings Lane Terrace. The system installer Roger Holdsworth agreed to
complete a costing for the improvements and if the cash was available from the football
trust, he would attempt to install the camera in it’s new position in time for the semi­
final. Unfortunately the clerical side of this operation could not be completed quick
enough and the planned move for the camera was suspended untill the summer break.
On Saturday 15th April 1989 I commenced duty at 10am attending at the police room at
Hillsborough, collecting the hand held V.H.S. radio which I used to monitor transmissions
via X.S. (operations room). On this particular day channel 1 had been designatiflifor all
V.H.F. transmission relating to the semi-final.
After collecting the radio I made my way to the Leppings Lane terrace where I saw that
Roger Holdsworth was working on camera number 5 which over looks the Leppings Lane terrace
pens* The picture qualUyihad been substanded for a number of weeks and Mr Holdsworth was
earring out some last minute alterations to upgrade the picture. After he had completed
the work the picture was indeed better thai it had been although not upto the correct
standard# I then made ray way to the control box where I met with Sgt Goddard & P.C. Ryan
after a brief conversation I began to check the vidoe system operating each of the five
cameras in turn. We were later joined by Supt Murray and it was agreed between us that
Sgt Goddard would operate the personal radio, P.C. Byan- -the tannoy & telephone and I in
addition to m y duties as camera operator would moiitor the V.H.F. set using it if necessary.
These duties were no different to what would be carried out on a normal match day.
Around 10.55am that date Supt Chapman contact control regarding a group of Liverpool
supporters would were waiting outside the 5 Arches public house, there was at this time
no trouble but the information was passed just 3© that officer could be aware that groups
of supporters had arrived and were intent on getting a drink before the match. Several
other personal radio messages were then received regarding the same topic.
About 11.20am Sgt Goddard carried out radio checks some P.R.*s did not reply and the sector
Inspectors were asked to raake checks where appropriate. Throughout this time various
messages were coming in regarding traffic problems the City side of the ground, M 1 motor­
way , Parkway etc diversions were inforce. This indicated that the Nottingham supporters
were on route in numbers and could be expected at the ground for the turnstile opening time
of 12,00 noon.
                                    - 2 -
Just after noon I inserted the 2 V.H.S. video tapes in the two video recorders# The time
and date system was cheeked and set possibley using the ground clock mounted above the
North stand or by a time check with other officers in the control box* The tapes were set
to run at normal speed, my intention being that around 2*30pm the same date I would insert
2 new tapes which would then include the build up to the match throughout the game and
the supporters leaving the ground. Around this time it was noticed that persons had entered
the ground*
A short time later it was discovered that some of the Penistone Road turnstiles were not
manned due to an administr&tive error this was corrected by deploying one of the spare serials
Some time between 1*00pm and 2*30pm there was concern expressed regarding the Liverpool fans
purchasing Kop tickets from touts at Loppings Lane turnstiles. This would mean of course that
a mixture of fans would have to be supervised within,jthe Kop terrace.
During this same period problems bejfean arising in various public houses near to the ground
ones that spring to mind were the Horseand Jockey and the Royal* The complaints were that
fans were drinking heavily out on the street, urinating in gardens and being a genral
nuisance* Some time between 1.30pm and 2.00pm I began to notice that on the Kop several
Liverpooldfans had been placed in the triangle area near to the North Stand end supervised
by several police officers* I set Camera 4 to monitor the situation noticing that several
arrests were made and that manpower was getting low* I remembered that there had been
some trouble at last years match in the same location and I questioned Supt Murray re the
number of officers available for deployment on the Kop* Supt Murray then contacted Insp
Sewell regarding the manpower situation and he confirmed that 2 coaches each containing
40 men would be on stand-by in Penistone Road*
Around 2*00pm Supt Muri^Bmnd C/supt Duckenfield went to speak to the match referee*
Through the afternoon complaints had been expressed regarding the quaS£$fcrt»f P.R. trans­
missions* to the control staff*
Around 2.00pm I overheard on V.H.F. that Liverpool supporters had been spoken to on a coach
which had displayed a Nottingham forest supports parking ticket* The coach and supporters
were spoken to by traffic officers and      advised.
About the same time there was a report of troublesome Liverpool fans on a coach registered
number 9995 RU. This number was circulated and the coach checked by one of the mobile serials*
Around 2.20pm the ACC Jackson was in the control box when he noticed a man on the Leppings
Lane terrace South Pen* He dropped his trousers and began fooling about* His behaviour was
sueh that it was believed that he was drunk and the ACC asked for something to be done about
he* I set the camera to monitor his behaviour*
About 2.15pm all the control room staff discussed that it was apparent the Liverpool fans
had not begun to arrive as yet* The North stand had vast spaces although the Leppings Lane
terrace was filling up at a normal rate* Just after this the f.R. transmissions became
wors&f'and the civilian radio repair man came into the control box to attempt a repair.
About 2.3Qp« my attention was drawn to the large crowd outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles
I would estimate around 3,000 people and it was apparent that the number was increasing
by the volume of foot passengers in Leppings Lane itself*
C/supt Duckenfield asked about the large crowd and it was said that although it was more than
normal, its was no more than was expected for such a football match*
About 2.35pm the Civilian radio repairman stated that he could not fix the P.R. system and it
was necessary to resort to using the radios on a back to back systems *
About the same time S/Duckenfield came to the back of the control box and asked      meifthe
crowd scenes at the Leppings Lane were being recorded and I replied ’YES*.
A personl radio on Leppings Lane requested more man power to Leppings Lane turnstiles*
Sgt Sorsby dispa&ehed 2 horses from the South stand carpark.
A P.R. message then came in stating that the gates are being forced, they were bending and
buckling. In my mind I believed that the gates referred to were ’C ’ gate and I kept the
Leppings Lane camera set to that sort of area*
About 2.40pm S/Duckenfield & Supt Murray requested that I contact X.S. so that a traffic
car with P.A. system could attend in Leppings Lane and advised the crowd which were by
this time becoming apparently more hostile* I also remember around this time that Sgt
Goddard picked up the P.R. telephone stjcle hand set and after trying to use it threw it
down on to the desk because it was not working and the P.R. transmissions were very poor*
I can remember seeing about 5or6 officers stood on barrier duty just pasted the gate ’C*
towards the South stand*
About 2.40pm I remeber seeing 'C' gate open and a number of supporters enter the ground
I then said worfts like * THEY’VE BROKEN DOWN THE GATE*. At the same time I indicated to
the staff in the control box to watch the Leppings Lane Monitor, After about 20 seconds I
                                      3

noticed that the gate was closed, and itseemed that a mounted officer alone had prevented
a big rush of people through the open gate. I remeber seeing mounted officers trying to clear
space in the crowd •
The request for additional officers to be sent to Leppings Lane was made to Inspector Sewell
and I remeber him offering two serials one of which was the *F* Division crime and vandal
they were directed to the Leppings Lane end of the ground*
I saw Liverpool fans climbing the walls of the ground onto the turnstile roofs and I
in particular remeber several being sat astide Gate ’B ’ with police officers stood below.
I think at this time a P.R. message was sent regarding the climbers and an officer replied
that he could not reach them*
Around 2.45pm I remeber a P.R. message from Supt Marshall to the effect * HE MUST OPEN THE
GATES OR SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE KILLED, PLEASE OPEN THE GATES.*
At this time O/insp McRobbie is in the control box wearing civilian cliihing.
I remember seeing an officer on the top of the turnstiles at Leppings Lane end and C/supt
Ducenfield made enquries as to the officers identity. Another P.R. message was received
from Supt Marshall his voice was very distressed * YOU MUST OPEN THE GATES OPEN THE GATES’.
C/Supt Duckenfield seemed to pause for thought and tten said ' ’RIGHT IF LIVES ARE AT RISK
THEN OPEN THE GATES.* Sgt Goddard then transmitted ’OPEN THE GATES OPEN THE GATES.*
Just prior to this I reraebwr seeing officers behand ’A ’ gate, they were set out in two lines
forming a funnel. Sgt Higgins of *F’ C&V transmitted on P.R. * There are people being crushed
outside ’A* gate we must open ’A* gate.
I remember that about the time the gates were ordered to be opaa&d mounted officers out­
side Leppings Lane turnstiles had managed to create a void between the turnstiles and the
outer perimeter railings, in fact I believed that at one time the officers managed to
close the outer ^tes, however the crowd outside forced its way through the outer g^tes
and ran into the ground via *C’ gate at least. I remeber seeing crowds at the rear of
Leppings Lane terrace just behind the turnstiles, they were just stood about not doing
anything inparticular.
About 2.55pm C/supt Duckenfield told control room staff to get some man power to the North
stand to stop any possible rush onto the pitch. It was at this time that we began to notice
Liverpool fans climbing up into the west stand from the terrace area. They were assisted
by people in the stand and the same p»oblem had occured the previous year. The sole purpose
was so that fans with standing tickets could get into the seated area of the west stand.
A short tim later fani were seen to climb the perimeter track fence. Officers on the track
seemed to be telling the fans to get down from the fence. At this point the staff in the
control box and I thought that the situation was purely public order, no information was
coming in to the effect that people were getting hurt.
A crowd gathered on the perimeter track and 0/Supt Duckenfield ordered that they should be >
moved as quickly as possible to the wing sections of Leppings Lane teraace where it could be
seen that there was space. C/supt Duckenfield was angry about officers stood around the
tzack near to the Kop and the North stand. A P.R. message was sent to the officers and they
were directed to the front of the North stand. Around this time C/Insp Me Robbie was sent to
the pitch to get things sorted out. One problem was a W.P.C. stood on the perimeter track
just below the control box she did not appear to be moving people off the track and in fact
 at one stage open the perimeter gate to the track then walk off leaving the gate open.
C/Insp Me Robbie took charge of the police woman and began ushering people from the track.
By this time there were people on the pitch and the perimeter taraek gates were open allowing
people out of the center pens. Still at this stage no one in the control box was aware that
the problem was more than a pitch invasion situation.
Just after the match was stopped ACC Jackson was in the control box and he ordered me to
contact X.S. and call operation support. It was at this point that I decieded to concentrate
on operating the V.H.F. radio rather than the camera system. Very suddenly it became
apparent that there were injuries and at that time I contacted X.S. for ambulances to be
sent to the Leppings Lane end of the ground. There were people all over the pitch infront
of the goal mouth, persons were laid; across the floor with persons giving mouth to mouth
it was only then that we began to feel that there might be deaths. A P.R. message was sent
to control asking for bolt cutter® and Sgt Goddard contacted claywheels Lane asking if they
had cutters on the bri-mac transported. The reply was negative. He turned to me and I told
him that I would contact the fire service which I did via X.S. I made it clear that we
required cutting equiptment for the metal fences* I remember someone instructing P.C. Ryan
to use the Tannoy telling people to stay calm* I can remember seeing bodies being moved
towards the tunnel on the Leppings Lane Terrace from the center pens. I believe that it was
police officers who were moving the bodies from the area. Liverpool fans who were on the
, ?%
                                 •  - 4 -
‘pitch started to ran tpw&rds the K#p officers manage t© stop the charge and split up
 several groups of fans who were fighting. A line of officer® were then formed across the
 pitch just the Kop side of the center line.
 I recall the fire service arriving at Leppings Lane and their men running onto the pitch
 I then sekt a message to operations that we did have fatalities at the ground although
 when I sent this message no details had been passed by P.R. it was all done from observation.
 Further contact from X.S. regarding the number of ambulance required andthey     said would it
 be more than 20 and      I said something to the effect that we needasmanyaspossible.
 Traffic motor cycle were ordered to cover the routes to both hospitals and I made a request
 for the senior ambulance officer to attend the control box. He did not arrive. The senior
 fire officer attended at the control box and liased with senior officers and he too asked
 to speak to the senior ambiklance officer. Another request was made for that officer to
 attend the control box via X.S.
 About 3.35pm I checked the video tapes and discovered that one had stopped and the second
 had been switch to operate in the 18 hr mode which in effect speeds up the action of the
 scene being recorded. This I can only    think was caught by me whilst standing at the rear
 of the video control area. The videosare set at knee hA&ght and I believe that as I leant
 forward this is how      I altered the time mode setting.
 I installed two new      tapes and set them running at normal speed.
 Ma Clough and Mr Daiglesh entered the control box and offered their services once they had
 established that the match was off. Mr Daiglesh wanted to speak to the fens and he was asked
 to use the Tannoy system in the D.J.s control box below the police control.
 Supt Murray then later asked for details of transport so that preparations could be made
 for emptying the ground. I remeber some time after this Supt Murray saying to P.G. Ryan
 that he wanted a message passing over the Tannoy tee ling the Liverpool fans to stay calm
 and remain where they were untill the ambulances had left the stadium. Sometime later
 the ground was emptyed and around 5.30pm I removed the video tapes and made my way to the Gym
 to offer assistance. I was later sent    to H.Q. with thevideo tapes and I there saw C/supt
 Duckenfield, Sgt Booth, ACC Jackson and C/supt Denton* About 11.00 D/supt Mckay attended
 and he instructed me to return to Hammerton Road, book the video tapes into the property
 store and await the arrival of AYA, Sgt          was to attend so that copies of the video
 tapes could be made.
 About 11.30pm S g t a r r i v e d at Hammerton Roafl police station and I explained the
 faults on the video tapes. He asked if I could get hold of the video recorder used with
 the 18 hr mode setting so that he could transfer the tape action at the correct speed.
 I then went back to the ground and removed one of the video recorders from the poll
 control box taking it to Ecelesfield training school where I handed it to Sgt
 My immediate supervisor would by Supt Murray. I had no contact with the fans before/
 during or after the incident. I cannot relate any information regarding the stewarding
 of the ground, and I had no contact with the bodies.
 These 4 pages are not complete but are just a resume of the main points of the day.

Mr C l oug h and Mr Dalgleish entered the control box and offered

I am a Police Constable with South Yorkshire Police at present
stationed at Hammerton Road Police Station, Sheffield.                   I am at the
present time working beat duties on 1B ' group but also have
responsibility operating the static video system which is installed
at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield.
On a personal level I have visited Hillsborough Stadium on many
occasions as a spectator standing on the terrace at the Spion Kop
end of the ground and the Leppings Lane terrace.                   I have also
worked in all parts of the ground as a police officer during my
past 8 years service.
In September 1987 I took over duties relating to the video system
working from the Police Control Box and since that time I have
attended a 3 day course in relation to the use of video systems for
Command and Control and as a method of evidence gathering.                      The
original system installed at Hillsborough was laid out as a Command
and Control System giving a basic all round view both inside and
outside the ground.         Whilst I have been involved with the duties
that emphasis has shifted from Command and Control to evidence
gathering and with that end in mind several improvements have been
made the most recent being a survey of the Leppings Lane end
camera, the intention being to move the camera from its present
p o s i t i o n a t t a c h e d to the roof of the West                 Stand b r i n g i n g it down to

a position         just above the turnstiles.                      The survey was c a r r i e d out

using a han d h e l d v i d e o camera m o u n t e d on the p l a t f o r m of a

h y d r a u l i c lift.      Two p o s i t i o n s were considered,               the first m o u n t e d

on a p o l e        at the far most corner of the L e p p i n g s Lane turns t i l e s

the second p o s i t i o n         just above gate            'B ' .    It was d e c i d e d that the

best p o s i t i o n w o u l d be above            'B' gate.        This p o s i t i o n giving good

all a r o u n d views a long L e p pings Lane,                   to the t u r n s t i l e s b e l o w and

the c o u r t y a r d at the rear of the L e p p i n g s Lane terrace.                         The sys t e m

i n s t a l l e r Roger H o l d s w o r t h ag r e e d to c o m p l e t e a c o s t i n g for the

i m p r o v e m e n t s and if the cash was a v a i l a b l e                f rom the football trust,

he w o u l d attempt to install the ca m e r a in it's ne w p o s i t i o n in time

for the       Semi F i n a l .

U n f o r t u n a t e l y the c l e r i c a l   side of this o p e r a t i o n c ould not be

c o m p l e t e d q u i c k en o u g h and       the p l a n n e d m o v e     for the ca m e r a was

s u s p e n d e d until the summer               break.

On S a t u r d a y 15 A pril        1989,        I c o m m e n c e d d u t y at 10 a m a t t e n d i n g at

the po l i c e r o o m at Hillsb o r o u g h ,           collecting           the h and h eld V H S radio

w h i c h I used to m o n i t o r t r a n s m i s s i o n s via O p e r a t i o n s Room.            On this

p a r t i c u l a r day channel         1 had      been d e s i g n a t e d for all V H F

t r a n s m i s s i o n r e l a t i n g to the     Semi Final.

A f t e r c o l l e c t i n g the r a d i o I made m y w a y to the L e p pings Lane

terr a c e w here       I saw that Roger H o l d s w o r t h was w o r k i n g on camera

number      5 w h i c h o v e r l o o k s the      L e p p i n g s Lane terr a c e p e n s .   The

p i c t u r e q u a l i t y had been s u b s t a n d a r d for a number of weeks                 and Mr

H o l d s w o r t h was c a r r y i n g out some last m i n u t e a l t e r a t i o n s to upgrade

the picture.            A f t e r he had c o m p l e t e d the w o r k the pict u r e was
in d e e d better than it ha d been a l t h o u g h not up to the correct

standard.         I then mad e m y wa y to the Control B o x w h e r e                     I met w i t h

Sergeant G o d d a r d and PC Ryan.                  A fter a brief c o n v e r s a t i o n     I began

to c h e c k the v i d e o s y s t e m o p e r a t i n g eac h of the five cameras                    in

turn.      We were later           joined by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y and it was

a g r e e d betw e e n us that Sergeant G o d d a r d w o u l d operate the personal

radio,     PC Ryan the t a n n o y and t e l e p h o n e and I in a d d i t i o n to my

duties as camera o p e r a t o r w o u l d m o n i t o r the V H F set u s i n g it if

necessary.          These duties were no d i f f e r e n t to what w o u l d be carr i e d

out on a normal m a t c h day.

A r o u n d 10.55 a m that date,               S u p e r i n t e n d e n t C h a p m a n cont a c t control

r e g a r d i n g a g r o u p of L i v e r p o o l   supp o r t e r s wh o were w a i t i n g outside

the    5 Ar ches pu b l i c house.              There was at this time no trou b l e but

the    i n f o r m a t i o n was p a s s e d   just so that offi c e r could be aware that

g roups of s u p p o r t e r s had a r r i v e d and were intent on g e t t i n g a d r i n k

before the match.               Several other p e r s o n a l radio m e s s a g e s were then

r e c e i v e d r e g a r d i n g the same topic.

A bout    11.20 am Sergeant G o d d a r d c a r r i e d out radio checks                       some

personal       radios di d not r e p l y and the sector                    I n spectors were a sked

to mak e checks w here appro priate.                       T h r o u g h o u t this time various

m e s s a g e s wer e c o m i n g in r e g a r d i n g t r a f f i c p r o b l e m s the city side of

the ground,         Ml m o torway,        Parkway,        etc,    d i v e r s i o n s w ere in force.

This     i n d i c a t e d that the N o t t i n g h a m supp o r t e r s were en route in

numbers and c o u l d be e x p e c t e d at the gr o u n d for the tur n s t i l e

o p e n i n g time of 12 noon.
Just a ft er noon I i n s e r t e d the 2 V H S v i d e o tapes in the two v i d e o

recorders.           The time and date s y s t e m was c h e c k e d and set p o s s i b l y

u s i n g the gr o u n d lock m o u n t e d above the N o r t h Stand or by a time

c h e c k w i t h other o f f i c e r s in the control box.              The tapes were       set

to run at normal            speed,    m y int e n t i o n b e i n g that a r o u n d 2.30 p m the

same date       I w o u l d inset 2 ne w tapes w h i c h w o u l d then include the

b uild up to the m a t c h t h r o u g h o u t the game and the supporters

leav i n g the ground.            A r o u n d this time it was n o t i c e d that persons

had e n t e r e d the ground.

A short time later it was d i s c o v e r e d that some of the Pen i s t o n e

Road t u r n s t i l e s were not m a n n e d due to an a d m i n i s t r a t i v e error this

was c o r r e c t e d by d e p l o y i n g one of the spare serials.               Some time

b e t w e e n 1.00 p m and 2.30 p m there was c o n c e r n e x p r e s s e d r e g a r d i n g

the L i v e r p o o l   fans p u r c h a s i n g Ko p tick e t s   from touts at L e p pings

Lane turnstiles.             This w o u l d m e a n of course that a m i x t u r e of fans

w o u l d h a ve to be s u p e r v i s e d w i t h i n the Ko p terrace.

D u r i n g this same p e r i o d p r o b l e m s began a r i s i n g in v a r i o u s public

h ouses near to the g r o u n d ones that s p r i n g to m i n d were the Horse

and J o c k e y and the Royal.             The c o m p l a i n t s wer e that fans were

d r i n k i n g h e a v i l y out on the street,        u r i n a t i n g in gard e n s and b eing

a gene r a l nuisance.            Some time b e t w e e n 1.30 p m and 2.00 p m I began

to no t i c e that on the K o p several L i v e r p o o l            fans had been pl a c e d

in the t r i a n g l e area near to the N orth S tand end s u p e r v i s e d by

several po l i c e officers.             I set ca m e r a 4 to m o n i t o r the sit u a t i o n

n o t i c i n g that several arre sts wer e mad e and that m a n p o w e r was

g e t t i n g low.      I r e m e m b e r e d that there had been some trouble at last

years m a t c h in the same l o c ation and I q u e s t i o n e d S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

M u r r a y re the number of o f f icers a v a i l a b l e         for d e p l o y m e n t on the

Kop.
S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y then c o n t a c t e d I n spector Sewell   r e g a r d i n g the

manpower      si t u a t i o n and he c o n f i r m e d that 2 coaches eac h c o n t a i n i n g

40 men w o u l d be on s t a n d b y in P e n i s t o n e Road.

Around     2.00 p m S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y and Chief   Superin t e n d e n t

D u c k e n f i e l d went to speak to the m a t c h referee.              T h r o u g h the

a f t e r n o o n comp l a i n t s had been e x p r e s s e d r e g a r d i n g the qual i t y of

p e r s o n a l r adio t r a n s m i s s i o n s to the control    staff.

Around     2.00 p m I o v e r h e a d on V H F that L i v e r p o o l     s u pporters had been

spoken to on a c o a c h w h i c h had d i s p l a y e d a N o t t i n g h a m Forest

s upp o r t e r s p a r k i n g ticket.      The c o a c h and supp o r t e r s w ere spoken to

by t r a f f i c o f f icers and advised.

A b o u t the same time there was a report of t r o u b l e s o m e L i verpool

fans on a c oach r e g i s t e r e d number          9995 RU.       This nu m b e r was

c i r c u l a t e d and the c o a c h was c h e c k e d by one of the m o b i l e serials.

Around     2.20 p m the ACC Jackson was               in the control box whe n he

n o t i c e d a m a n on the L e p p i n g s Lane terrace south pen.                 He d r o p p e d

his t r o u s e r s and b egan f o o l i n g about.         His b e h a v i o u r was such that

it was b e l i e v e d that he was d r u n k and the ACC asked for s o m e t h i n g

to be done about him.                  I set the c a m e r a to m o n i t o r his behaviour.

About     2.15 p m all the control r o o m staff d i s c u s s e d that it was

ap p a r e n t the L i v e p r o o l   fans had not b egun to arrive as y e t .                 The

N o r t h Stand had vast          spaces a l t h o u g h the L e p p i n g s Lane terrace was

fill i n g up at a normal rate.                Just a fter this the p e r sonal radio

t r a n s m i s s i o n s b e c a m e w orse and the c i v i l i a n r adio re p a i r ma n came

into the control box to atte m p t a repair.
About    2.30 p m m y a t t e n t i o n was d rawn to the large crowd outside the

L e p p i n g s Lane turnstiles.            I w o u l d estim a t e around              3,000 people and

it was a p p arent that the number was                       i n c r e a s i n g by the volume of

foot p a s s e n g e r s   in L e p p i n g s Lane itself.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield asked about the large crowd and it

was said that although it was more than normal,                                   it was no more than

was expected for such a football match.

A bout    2.35 p m the c i v i l i a n r adio repair ma n stated that he could

not fix the p e r sonal r adio s y s t e m and it was n e c e s s a r y to resort to

u s i n g the radios on a b ack to bac k system.

About the same time Chief Superintendent Duckenfield came to the

back of the control box and asked me if the crowd scenes at the

Leppings Lane were being recorded and I replied                                    'Yes'.

A p e r s o n a l r adio on L e p p i n g s Lane r e q u e s t e d m ore m a n p o w e r to

L e p p i n g s Lane t urnstiles.            Sergeant        So r s b y d e s p a t c h e d 2 horses          from

the South Stand car park.

A p e r s o n a l r adio m e s s a g e then came in s t a t i n g that the gates were

b e i n g forced,      the y w e r e b e n d i n g and buckling.                 In m y m i n d I

b e l i e v e d that the gates r e f e r r e d to w ere                ' C 1 gate and I kept the

L e p p i n g s Lane ca m e r a set to that sort of area.

About     2.40 p m Chief         S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d and Su p e r i n t e n d e n t

M u r r a y r e q u e s t e d that   I cont a c t O p e r a t i o n s R o o m so that a traffic

car w i t h a P A s y s t e m could a t t e n d in L e p p i n g s Lane and a d v i s e d the

c rowd w h i c h were by this time b e c o m i n g a p p a r e n t l y m o r e hostile.                             I

als o r e m e m b e r a r o u n d this time that Sergeant G o d d a r d pic k e d up the

p e r s o n a l r adio t e l e p h o n e style hand s e t and after t r y i n g to use it,

t h r e w it dow n o nto the d e s k beca u s e              it was not w o r k i n g and the
pe r s o n a l radio t r a n s m i s s i o n s were ver y poor.              I can r e m e m b e r seeing

about     5 or 6 o f f i c e r s    stood on b a r r i e r dut y         just past the gate            'C'

towards the South Stand.

A bout    2.40 p m I r e m e m b e r     seeing      'C' gate open and a number of

s uppo r t e r s enter the ground.               I then said w ords like                  'They've

br o k e n down the gate'.             At the same time             I i n d i c a t e d to the staff

in the control box to w a t c h the L e p p i n g s Lane monitor.                             A fter about

20 seconds        I n o t i c e d that the gate was cl o s e d and it seemed that a

m o u n t e d offi c e r alone had p r e v e n t e d a big rus h of pe o p l e thro u g h

the open gate.             I remember       seeing m o u n t e d officers t r y i n g to clear

space in the crowd.

The requ e s t for a d d i t i o n a l o f f i c e r s to be sent to L e p p i n g s Lane was

m ade to I n s pector Sewell and I r e m e m b e r h i m o f f e r i n g two Serials,

one of w h i c h was the           'F' D i v i s i o n C rime and Vandal,              they were

d i r e c t e d to the L e p p i n g s Lane end of the ground.

I sa w L i v e r p o o l   fans c l i m b i n g the walls of the ground onto the

t u r n s t i l e roofs and I in p a r t i c u l a r r e m e m b e r several b e i n g sat

a str i d e gate     'B' w i t h po l i c e o f f i c e r s    stood below.            I t h i n k at this

time a p e r s o n a l r a d i o m e s s a g e was     sent r e g a r d i n g the climbers and

an o f f i c e r r e p l i e d that he c ould not r e a c h them.

Around     2.45 p m I r e m e m b e r a p e r s o n a l radio m e s s a g e          fro m

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M a r s h a l l to the eff e c t   'We m ust open the gates               or

someone      is g o i n g to be killed,           pl e a s e open the gates.'

At this time Chief             Ins p e c t o r M c R o b b i e is in the cont r o l box w e a r i n g

c i v i l i a n clothing.

I r e m e m b e r se e i n g an offi c e r on the top of the t u r n s t i l e s at

L e p p i n g s Lane end and Chief           S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d made
enquiries as to the officer's identity.        Another personal radio

message was received from Superintendent Marshall, his voice was

very distressed,   'You must open the gates, open the gates'.         Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield seemed to pause for thought and then

said   'Right if lives are at risk, then open the gates'.       Sergeant

Goddard then transmitted     'Open the gates, open the gates'.       Just

prior to this I remember seeing officers behind        'A' gate, they were

set out in two lines forming a funnel.         Sergeant Higgins of   'F' C&V

transmitted on personal radio     'There are people being crushed

outside   'A' gate we must open   'A' gate'.

I remember that about the time the gates were ordered to be opened

mounted officers outside Leppings Lane turnstiles had managed to

create a void between the turnstiles and the outer perimeter

railings,   in fact,   I believed that at one time the officers managed

to close the outer gates, however, the crowd outside forced its way

through the outer gates and ran into the ground via        'C' gate at

least.    I remember seeing crowds at the rear of Leppings Lane

terrace just behind the turnstiles, they were just stood about not

doing anything in particular.

About 2.55 pm Chief Superintendent Duckenfield told control room

staff to get some manpower to the North Stand to stop any possible

rush onto the pitch.     It was at this time that we began to notice

Liverpool fans climbing up into the West Stand from the terrace

area. They were assisted by people in the stand and the same

problem had occurred the previous year.        A short time later fans

were seen to climb the perimeter track fence.        Officers on the

track seemed to be telling the fans to get down from the fence.             At
this point the staff in the control box and I thought that the

situation was purely public order.     No information was coming in to

the effect that people were getting hurt.

A crowd gathered on the perimeter track and Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield ordered that they should be moved as quickly as

possible to the wing sections of Leppings Lane terrace where it

could be seen that there was space.     Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield was angry about officers stood around the track near to

the Kop and the North Stand.   A personal radio message was sent to

the officers and they were directed to the front of the North

Stand. Around this time Chief Inspector McRobbie was sent to the

pitch to get things sorted out.    One problem was a WPC stood on the

perimeter track just below the control box.     She did not appear to

be moving people off the track and in fact at one stage opened the

perimeter gate to the track then walked off leaving the gate open.

Chief Inspector McRobbie took charge of the policewoman and began

ushering people from the track.    By this time there were people on

the pitch and the perimeter track gates were open allowing people

out of the centre pens.   Still at this stage no one in the control

box was aware that the problem was more than a pitch invasion

situation.

Just after the match was stopped ACC Jackson was in the control box

and he ordered me to contact Operations Room and call operation

support.   It was at this point that I decided to concentrate on

operating the VHF radio rather than the camera system.     Very

suddenly it became apparent that there were injuries and at that

time I contacted Operations Room for ambulances to be sent to the

Leppings Lane end of the ground.     There were people all over the
pitch in front of the goal mouth, persons were laid across the

floor with persons giving mouth to mouth.        It was only then that we

began to feel that there might be deaths.        A personal radio message

was sent to control asking for bolt cutters and Sergeant Goddard

contacted Claywheels Lane asking if they had cutters on the bri-mac

transporter.     The reply was negative.   He turned to me and I told

him that I would contact the fire service which I did via

Operations Room.     I made it clear that we required cutting

equipment for the metal fences.     I remember someone instructing PC

Ryan to use the tannoy telling people to stay calm.        I can remember

seeing bodies being moved towards the tunnel on the Leppings Lane

terrace from the centre pens.     I believe that it was police

officers who were moving the bodies from the area.        Liverpool fans

who were on the pitch started to run towards the Kop.        Officers

managed to stop the charge and split up several groups of fans who

were fighting.     A line of officers were then formed across the

pitch just the Kop side of the centre line.        I recall the fire

service arriving at Leppings Lane and their men running onto the

pitch.   I then sent a message to Operations that we did have

fatalities at the ground although when I sent this message no

details had been passed by personal radio.        It was all done from

observation.     Further contact from Operations Room regarding the

number of ambulance required and they said would it be more than 20

and I said something to the effect that we need as many as

possible.

Traffic motor cycles were ordered to cover the routes to both

hospitals and I made a request for the senior ambulance officer to

attend the control box.     He did not arrive.     The senior fire
o ffi c e r a t t e n d e d at the control box and liaised w ith senior

o f f i c e r s and he to o a sked to s peak to the senior amb u l a n c e officer.

A n o t h e r request was mad e   for that offi c e r to at t e n d the control box

v i a O p e r a t i o n s Room.

About 3.35 pm I checked the video tapes and discovered that one had

stopped and the second had been switched to operate in the 18 hour

mode which in effect speeds up the action of the scene being

recorded.        This I can only think was caught by me whilst standing

at the rear of the video control area.              The videos are set at knee

height and I believe that as I leant forward this is how I altered

the time mode setting.

I installed two new tapes and set them running at normal speed.

Mr C l o u g h and Mr D a l g l e i s h e n t e r e d the control box and offered

t heir se rvices once t h e y had e s t a b l i s h e d that the m a t c h was off.

Mr Dalgleish wanted to speak to the fans and he was asked to use

the tannoy system in the DJs control box below the police control.

Superintendent Murray then later asked for details of transport so

that preparations could be made for emptying the ground.                    I

remember some time after this Superintendent Murray saying to PC

Ryan that he wanted a message passing over the tannoy telling the

Liverpool fans to stay calm and remain where they were until the

ambulances had left the Stadium.

Sometime later the ground was emptied and around 5.30 pm I removed

the video tapes and made my way to the gym to offer assistance.                       I

was later sent to HQ with the video tapes and I there saw Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield,          Sergeant Booth, ACC Jackson and Chief

Superintendent Denton.

About 11.00 Detective Superintendent McKay attended and he
instructed me to return to Hammerton Road, book the video tapes

into the property store and await the arrival of AVA,     Sergeant

         was to attend so that copies of the video tapes could be

made.

About 11.30 pm Sergeant)________(arrived at Hammerton Road Police

Station and I explained the faults on the video tapes.      He asked if

I could get hold of the video recorder used with the 18 hour mode

setting so that he could transfer the tape action at the correct

speed.    I then went back to the ground and removed one of the video

recorders from the police control box taking it to Ecclesfield

Training School where I handed it to Sergeant         ,   My immediate

supervisor would be Superintendent Murray.    I had no contact with

the fans before/during or after the incident.    I cannot relate any

information regarding the stewarding of the ground and I had no

contact with the b o d i e s .

points of the day.

I am a Police Constable with South Yorkshire Police at present
stationed at Hammerton Road Police Station,               Sheffield.   I am at the
present time working beat duties on            'B' group but also have
responsibility operating the static video system which is installed
at Hillsborough Football Stadium,            Sheffield.
On a personal level I have visited Hillsborough Stadium on many
occasions as a spectator standing on the terrace at the Spion Kop
end of the ground and the Leppings Lane terrace.                I have also
worked in all parts of the ground as a police officer during my
past 8 years service.
In September 1987 I took over duties relating to the video system
working from the Police Control Box and since that time I have
attended a 3 day course in relation to the use of video systems for
Command and Control and as a method of evidence gathering.                    The
original system installed at Hillsborough was laid out as a Command
and Control System giving a basic all round view both inside and
outside the ground.      Whilst I have been involved with the duties
that emphasis has shifted from Command and Control to evidence
gathering and with that end in mind several improvements have been
made the most recent being a survey of the Leppings Lane end
camera, the intention being to move the camera from its present
position attached to the roof of the West Stand bringing it down to

a position just above the turnstiles.        The survey was carried out

using a hand held video camera mounted on the platform of a

hydraulic lift.    Two positions were considered,      the first mounted

on a p o l e   at the far most corner of the Leppings Lane turnstiles

the second position just above gate      'B'.    It was decided that the

best position would be above     'B' gate.     This position giving good

all around views along Leppings Lane,        to the turnstiles below and

the courtyard at the rear of the Leppings Lane terrace.            The system

installer Roger Holdsworth agreed to complete a costing for the

improvements and if the cash was available from the football trust,

he would attempt to install the camera in it's new position in time

for the Semi Final.

Unfortunately the clerical side of this operation could not be

completed quick    enough and the planned m o v e    for the camera was

suspended until    the summer break.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I commenced         duty at 10 am attending at

the police room    at Hillsborough,    collecting the hand held VHS radio

which I used to monitor transmissions via Operations Room.               On this

particular day channel 1     had been designated for all     VHF

transmission relating to     the Semi Final.

After collecting the radio I made my way to the Leppings Lane

terrace where I saw that Roger Holdsworth was working on camera

number 5 which overlooks     the Leppings Lane terrace pens.       The

picture quality had been     substandard for a number ofweeks and Mr

Holdsworth was carrying out some last minute alterations to upgrade

the picture.     After he had completed the work the picture was
indeed better than it had been although not up to the correct

standard.    I then made my way to the Control Box where I met with

Sergeant Goddard and PC Ryan.    After a brief conversation I began

to check the video system operating each of the five cameras in

turn.   We were later joined by Superintendent Murray and it was

agreed between us that Sergeant Goddard would operate the personal

radio, PC Ryan the tannoy and telephone and I in addition to my

duties as camera operator would monitor the VHF set using it if

necessary.    These duties were no different to what would be carried

out on a normal match day.

Around 10.55 am that date,   Superintendent Chapman contact control

regarding a group of Liverpool supporters who were waiting outside

the 5 Arches public house.    There was at this time no trouble but

the information was passed just so that officer could be aware that

groups of supporters had arrived and were intent on getting a drink

before the match.    Several other personal radio messages were then

received regarding the same topic.

About 11.20 am Sergeant Goddard carried out radio checks some

personal radios did not reply and the sector Inspectors were asked

to make checks where appropriate.    Throughout this time various

messages were coming in regarding traffic problems the city side of

the ground, Ml motorway,   Parkway, etc, diversions were in force.

This indicated that the Nottingham supporters were en route in

numbers and could be expected at the ground for the turnstile

opening time of 12 noon.
Just after noon I inserted the 2 VHS video tapes in the two video

recorders.     The time and date system was checked and set possibly

using the ground lock mounted above the North Stand or by a time

check with other officers in the control box.     The tapes were set

to run at normal speed, my intention being that around 2.30 pm the

same date I would inset 2 new tapes which would then include the

build up to the match throughout the game and the supporters

leaving the ground.    Around this time it was noticed that persons

had entered the ground.

A short time later it was discovered that some of the Penistone

Road turnstiles were not manned due to an administrative error this

was corrected by deploying one of the spare serials.     Some time

between 1.00 pm and 2.30 pm there was concern expressed regarding

the Liverpool fans purchasing Kop tickets from touts at Leppings

Lane turnstiles.    This would mean of course that a mixture of fans

would have to be supervised within the Kop terrace.

During this same period problems began arising in various public

houses near to the ground ones that spring to mind were the Horse

and Jockey and the Royal.    The complaints were that fans were

drinking heavily out on the street, urinating in gardens and being

a general nuisance.    Some time between 1.30 pm and 2.00 pm I began

to notice that on the Kop several Liverpool fans had been placed

in the triangle area near to the North Stand end supervised by

several police officers.    I set camera 4 to monitor the situation

noticing that several arrests were made and that manpower was

getting low.    I remembered that there had been some trouble at last

years match in the same location and I questioned Superintendent

Murray re the number of officers available for deployment on the

Kop.
Superintendent Murray then contacted Inspector Sewell regarding the

manpower situation and he confirmed that 2 coaches each containing

40 men would be on standby in Penistone Road.

Around 2.00 pm Superintendent Murray and Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield went to speak to the match referee.     Through the

afternoon complaints had been expressed regarding the quality of

personal radio transmissions to the control staff.

Around 2.00 pm I overhead on VHF that Liverpool supporters had been

spoken to on a coach which had displayed a Nottingham Forest

supporters parking ticket.     The coach and supporters were spoken to

by traffic officers and advised.

About the same time there was a report of troublesome Liverpool

fans on a coach registered number 9995 RU.     This number was

circulated and the coach was checked by one of the mobile serials.

Around 2.20 pm the ACC Jackson was in the control box when he

noticed a man on the Leppings Lane terrace south pen.     He dropped

his trousers and began fooling about.    His behaviour was such that

it was believed that he was drunk and the ACC asked for something

to be done about him.   I set the camera to monitor his behaviour.

About 2.15 pm all the control room staff discussed that it was

apparent the Liveprool fans had not begun to arrive as yet.       The

North Stand had vast spaces although the Leppings Lane terrace was

filling up at a normal rate.    Just after this the personal radio

transmissions became worse and the civilian radio repair man came

into the control box to attempt a repair.
About 2.30 pm my attention was drawn to the large crowd outside the

Leppings Lane turnstiles.   I would estimate around 3,000 people and

it was apparent that the number was increasing by the volume of

foot passengers in Leppings Lane itself.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield asked about the large crowd and it

was said that although it was more than normal,   it was no more than

was expected for such a football match.

About 2.35 pm the civilian radio repair man stated that he could

not fix the personal radio system and it was necessary to resort to

using the radios on a back to back system.

About the same time Chief Superintendent Duckenfield came to the

back of the control box and asked me if the crowd scenes at the

Leppings Lane were being recorded and I replied    'Yes'.

A personal radio on Leppings Lane requested more manpower to

Leppings Lane turnstiles.   Sergeant Sorsby despatched 2 horses from

the South Stand car park.

A personal radio message then came in stating that the gates were

being forced, they were bending and buckling.     In my mind I

believed that the gates referred to were   'C' gate and I kept the

Leppings Lane camera set to that sort of area.

About 2.40 pm Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent

Murray requested that I contact Operations Room so that a traffic

car with a PA system could attend in Leppings Lane and advised the

crowd which were by this time becoming apparently more hostile.      I

also remember around this time that Sergeant Goddard picked up the

personal radio telephone style handset and after trying to use it,

threw it down onto the desk because it was not working and the
personal radio transmissions were very poor.       I can remember seeing

about 5 or 6 officers stood on barrier duty just past the gate          'C'

towards the South Stand.

About 2.40 pm I remember seeing      'C' gate open and a number of

supporters enter the ground.       I then said words like    'They've

broken down the g a t e '.   At the same time I indicated to the staff

in the control box to watch the Leppings Lane monitor.          After about

20 seconds I noticed that the gate was closed and it seemed that a

mounted officer alone had prevented a big rush of people through

the open gate.     I remember seeing mounted officers trying to clear

space in the crowd.

The request for additional officers to be sent to Leppings Lane was

made to Inspector Sewell and I remember him offering two Serials,

one of which was the     'F' Division Crime and Vandal,     they were

directed to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

I saw Liverpool fans climbing the walls of the ground onto the

turnstile roofs and I in particular remember several being sat

astride gate   'B' with police officers stood below.      I think at this

time a personal radio message was sent regarding the climbers and

an officer replied that he could not reach them.

Around 2.45 pm I remember a personal radio message from

Superintendent Marshall to the effect     'We must open the gates or

someone is going to be killed, please open the gates.'

At this time Chief Inspector McRobbie is in the control box wearing

civilian clothing.

I remember seeing an officer on the top of the turnstiles at

Leppings Lane end and Chief Superintendent Duckenfield made
enquiries as to the officer's identity.         Another personal radio

message was received from Superintendent Marshall,        his voice was

very distressed,   'You must open the gates, open the gates'.         Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield seemed to pause for thought and then

said   'Right if lives are at risk,   then open the gates'.     Sergeant

Goddard then transmitted     'Open the gates, open the gates'.       Just

prior to this I remember seeing officers behind        'A' gate, they were

set out in two lines forming a funnel.         Sergeant Higgins of   'F' C&V

transmitted on personal radio     'There are people being crushed

outside   'A' gate we must open   'A' gate'.

I remember that about the time the gates were ordered to be opened

mounted officers outside Leppings Lane turnstiles had managed to

create a void between the turnstiles and the outer perimeter

railings,   in fact,   I believed that at one time the officers managed

to close the outer gates, however,     the crowd outside forced its way

through the outer gates and ran into the ground via        'C' gate at

least.    I remember seeing crowds at the rear of Leppings Lane

terrace just behind the turnstiles,     they were just stood about not

doing anything in particular.

About 2.55 pm Chief Superintendent Duckenfield told control room

staff to get some manpower to the North Stand to stop any possible

rush onto the pitch.     It was at this time that we began to notice

Liverpool fans climbing up into the West Stand from the terrace

area. They were assisted by people in the stand and the same

problem had occurred the previous year.        A short time later fans

were seen to climb the perimeter track fence.        Officers on the

track seemed to be telling the fans to get down from the fence.             At
this point the staff in the control box and I thought that the

situation was purely public order.       No information was coming in to

the effect that people were getting hurt.

A crowd gathered on the perimeter track and Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield ordered that they should be moved as quickly as

possible to the wing sections of Leppings Lane terrace where it

could be seen that there was space.       Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield was angry about officers stood around the track near to

the Kop and the North Stand.       A personal radio message was sent to

the officers and they were directed to the front of the North

Stand. Around this time Chief Inspector McRobbie was sent to the

pitch to get things sorted out.       One problem was a WPC stood on the

perimeter track just below the control box.       She did not appear to

be moving people off the track and in fact at one stage opened the

perimeter gate to the track then walked off leaving the gate open.

Chief Inspector McRobbie took charge of the policewoman and began

ushering people from the track.       By this time there were people on

the pitch and the perimeter track gates were open allowing people

out of the centre pens.       Still at this stage no one in the control

box was aware that the problem was more than a pitch invasion

s i tu at i on .

Just after the match was stopped ACC Jackson was in the control box

and he ordered me to contact Operations Room and call operation

support.       It was at this point that I decided to concentrate on

operating the VHF radio rather than the camera system.       Very

suddenly it became apparent that there were injuries and at that

time I contacted Operations Room for ambulances to be sent to the

Leppings Lane end of the ground.      There were people all over the
pitch in front of the goal mouth, persons were laid across the

floor with persons giving mouth to mouth.        It was only then that we

began to feel that there might be deaths.        A personal radio message

was sent to control asking for bolt cutters and Sergeant Goddard

contacted Claywheels Lane asking if they had cutters on the bri-mac

transporter.     The reply was negative.   He turned to me and I told

him that I would contact the fire service which I did via

Operations Room.     I made it clear that we required cutting

equipment for the metal fences.     I remember someone instructing PC

Ryan to use the tannoy telling people to stay calm.        I can remember

seeing bodies being moved towards the tunnel on the Leppings Lane

terrace from the centre pens.     I believe that it was police

officers who were moving the bodies from the area.        Liverpool fans

who were on the pitch started to run towards the Kop.        Officers

managed to stop the charge and split up several groups of fans who

were fighting.     A line of officers were then formed across the

pitch just the Kop side of the centre line.        I recall the fire

service arriving at Leppings Lane and their men running onto the

pitch.   I then sent a message to Operations that we did have

fatalities at the ground although when I sent this message no

details had been passed by personal radio.        It was all done from

observation.     Further contact from Operations Room regarding the

number of ambulance required and they said would it be more than 20

and I said something to the effect that we need as many as

possible.

Traffic motor cycles were ordered to cover the routes to both

hospitals and I made a request for the senior ambulance officer to

attend the control box.     He did not arrive.     The senior fire
officer attended at the control box and liaised with senior

officers and he too asked to speak to the senior ambulance officer.

Another request was made for that officer to attend the control box

via Operations Room.

About 3.35 pm I checked the video tapes and discovered that one had

stopped and the second had been switched to operate in the 18 hour

mode which in effect speeds up the action of the scene being

recorded.   This I can only think was caught by me whilst standing

at the rear of the video control area.   The videos are set at knee

height and I believe that as I leant forward this is how I altered

the time mode setting.

I installed two new tapes and set them running at normal speed.

Mr Clough and Mr Dalgleish entered the control box and offered

their services once they had established that the match was off.

Mr Dalgleish wanted to speak to the fans and he was asked to use

the tannoy system in the DJs control box below the police control.

Superintendent Murray then later asked for details of transport so

that preparations -could be made for emptying the ground.    I

remember some time after this Superintendent Murray saying to PC

Ryan that he wanted a message passing over the tannoy telling the

Liverpool fans to stay calm and remain where they were until the

ambulances had left the Stadium.

Sometime later the ground was emptied and around 5.30 pm I removed

the video tapes and made my way to the gym to offer assistance.       I

was later sent to HQ with the video tapes and I there saw Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield,   Sergeant Booth, ACC Jackson and Chief

Superintendent Denton.

About 11.00 Detective Superintendent McKay attended and he
instructed me to return to Hammerton Road, book the video tapes

into the property store and await the arrival of AVA,       Sergeant

          was to attend so that copies of the video tapes could be

made.

About 11.30 pm S e r g e a n t )   ^ arrived at Hammerton Road Police

Station and I explained the faults on the video tapes.        He asked if

I could get hold of the video recorder used with the 18 hour mode

setting so that he could transfer the tape action at the correct

speed.    I then went back to the ground and removed one of the video

recorders from the police control box taking it to Ecclesfield

Training School where I handed it to Sergeant               My immediate

supervisor would be Superintendent Murray.       I had no contact with

the fans before/during or after the incident.       I cannot relate any

information regarding the stewarding of the ground and I had no

contact with the bodies.

These 4 pages are not complete but are just a resume of the main

points of the day.

TREVOR BICHARD
POLICE CONSTABLE 1370
33 XEARS(bn.
HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION
HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD,
TEL: 852211

 I am a police constable with South Yorkshire police at present stationed at Hammerton
 Road police station, Sheffield* I am at the present time working beat duties on 'B*
 group but also hare resposibility operating the static video system which is installed
 at Hillsborough football stadium ^Sheffield.
 On a personal level X hare visited Hillsborough stadium on many occasions as a spectator
 standing on the terrace at the Spion Kop end ©f the ground and the leppings Lane terrace,
 X have also worked in all parts of the ground as a police officer during my past 8 years
 service.
 In September 1987 I took over duties relating to the video system working from the police
 control box and since that time I have attended a 3 day course in relation to the
 of video systems for command and control and as a method of evidence gathering*
 The original system installed at Hillsborough was laid out as a command and contol system
 giving a basic all round view both inside and outside the ground. Whilst I have been invol­
 ved with the duties the emphasis has shifted from command and control to evidence gathering
 and with that end in mind several improvements have been made the most recent being a
 survey of the Leppings Lane end camera, the intention being to move the camera from its
 present position attached to the roof of the West stand bringing it down to a position
 just above the turnstiles. The survey was carried out using a'hand held video camera mount­
 ed on the platform of a hydraulic lift. Two positions were considered, the first mounted
 on a pole at the far most corner of the Leppings Lane turnstiles the second position just
 above gate *B*. It was detided ’that the best position would be above *B* gate. This position
 giving good all round views along Leppings Lane, to the turnstiles below and the court yard
 at the rear of the Leppings Lane Terrace. The system installer Roger Holdsworth agreed to
 complete a costing for the improvements and if the cash was available from the football
 trust, he would attempt to install the camera in it*s new position in time for the semi­
 final. Unfortunately the clerical side of this operation could not be completed quick
 enough and the planned move for the camera was suspended untill the sumner break.
On Saturday 15th April 1989 I comms need duty at 10am attending at the police room at
Hillsborough, collecting the hand held V.H.S. radio which I used to monitor transmissions
via X.S. (operations room). On this particular day channel 1 had been designattitd&for
V.H.F. transmission relating to the semi-final.
After collecting the radio I made my way to the Leppings Lane terrace where I saw that
Roger Holdsworth was working on camera number 5 which over looks the Leppings Lane terrace
pens. The picture quality-jhad been substanded for a number of weeks and Mr Holdsworth was
earring out some last minute alterations to upgrade the picture. After he had completed
the work the picture was indeed better tha* it had been although not up to the correct
standard. I then made my way to the control box where I met with Sgt Goddard & P.O. Ryan
after a brief conversation I began to check the vidoe system operating each of the five
cameras in turn. We were later joined by Supt Murray and it was agreed between us that
Sgt Goddard would operate the personal radio, P.C. 3yan ■the tannoy & telephone and I in
addition to my duties as camera operator would monitor the V.H.F. set using it if necessary.
These duties were no different to what would be carried out on a normal match day.
Around 10.55am that date Supt Chapman contact control regarding a group of Liverpool
supporters would were waiting outside the 5 Arches public house, there was at this time
no trouble but the information was passed just so that officer could be aware that groups
of supporters had arrived and were intent on getting a drink before the match. Several
other personal radio messages were then received regarding the same topic.
About 11.20am Sgt Goddard carried out radio checks some P.R.'s did not reply and the sector
Inspectors were asked to make checks where appropriate. Throughout this time various
messages were coming in regarding traffic problems the City side of the ground, M 1 motor-
way , Parkway etc diversions were inforce. This indicated that the Nottingham supporters
were on route in numbers and could be expected at the ground for the turnstile opening time
of 12,00 noon.
/      •                                 -  2 -
      Just after noon I inserted the 2 V.H.S. video tapes in the two video recorders.      -M i q
      and date system was checked and set possibley using the ground clock mounted above the
      North stand or by a time check with other officers in the control box. The tapes were set
      to run at normal speed, my intention being that around 2.30pm the same date I would insert
      2 new tapes which would then include the build up to the match throughout the g ,mo and
      the supporters leaving the ground. Around this time it was noticed that persons had entered
      the ground.
      A short time later it was discovered that some of the Penistone Road turnstiles were not
      manned due to an administrative error this was corrected by deploying one of the spare serial
      Some time between 1.00pm and 2.30pm there was concern expressed regarding the Liverpool fans
      purchasing Kop tickets from touts at Leppings Lane turnstiles. This would mean of course that
      a mixture of fans would have to be supervised withinjthe Kop terrace.
      During this same period problems be£an arising in various public houses near to the ground
      ones that spring to mind were the Horse and Jockey and the Royal. The complaints were that
      fans were drinking heavily out on the street, urinating in gardens and being a genral
      nuisance. Some time between 1.30pm and 2.00pm I began to notice that on the Kop several
      Liverpooldfans had been placed in the trian&le area near to the North Stand end supervised
      by several police officers. I set Camera 4 to monitor the situation noticing that several
      arrests were made and that manpower was getting low. I remembered that there had been
      some trouble at last years match in the same location and I questioned Supt Murray re the
      number of officers available for deployment on the Kop. Supt Murray then contacted Insp
      Sewell regarding the manpower situation and he confirmed that 2 coaches each containing
      40 men would be on stand-by in Penistone Road.
     Around 2.00pm Supt Muri^tand C/supt Duckenfield went to speak to the natch referee.
      Through the afternoon complaints had been expressed regarding the quality-of p.R. trans­
     missions, to the control staff.
     Around 2.00pm I overheard on V.H.P. that Liverpool supporters had been spoken to on a coach
     which had displayed a Nottingham forest supports parking ticket. The coach and supporters
     were spoken to by traffic officers and advised.
     About the same time there was a report of troublesome Liverpool fans on a coach registered
     number 9995 RU. This number was circulated and the coach checked by one of the mobile serials
     Around 2.20pm the ACC Jackson was in the control box when he noticed a nian on the Leppings
     Lane terrace South Pen. He dropped his trousers and began fooling about. His behaviour was
     such that it was believed that he was drunk and the ACC asked for something to be done about
     he. I set the camera to monitor his behaviour.
     About 2.15pm all the control room staff discussed that it was apparent the Liverpool fans
     had not begun to arrive as yet. The North stand had vast spaces although the Leppings
     terrace was filling up at a normal rate. Just after this the P.R. transmissions became
     worstoand the civilian radio repair man came into the control box to attempt a repair.
     About 2.30pm my attention was drawn to the large crowd outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles
     I would estimate around 3,000 people and it was apparent that the number was increasing
     by the volume of foot passengers in Leppings Lane itself.
     C/supt Duckenfield asked about the largs crowd and it was said that although it was more than
     normal, its was no more than was expected for such a football match.
     About 2.35pm the Civilia* radio repairman stated that he could not fix the P.R. system and it
    was necessary to resort to using the radios on a back to back systems r
    About the same time S/Duckenfield came to the back of tte control box and asked me ifthe
    crowd scenes at the Leppings Lane were being recorded and I replied 'YES'.
    A personl radio on Leppings I&ne requested more man power to Leppings Lane turnstiles.
    Sgt Sorsby dispafcehed 2 horses from the South stand carpark.
    A P.R. message then came in stating that the gates are being forced, they were bending and
    buckling. In my mind I believed that the gates referred to were 'C' gate and I kept the
    Leppings Lane camera set to that sort of area.
    About 2.40pm S/Duckenfield & Supt Murray requested that I contact X.S. so that a traffic
    car with P.A. system could attend in Leppings Lane and advised the crowd which were by
    this time becoming apparently more hostile. I also remember around thi« time that Sgt
    Goddard picked up the P.R. telephone style hand set and after trying to use it threw it
    down on to the desk because it was not working and the P.R. transmissions were very poor.
    I can remember seeing about 5or6 officers stood on barrier duty just pasted the gate 'C*
    towards the South stand.
    About 2.40pm I remeber seeing 'C' gate open and a number of supporters enter the ground
    I then said worts like * THEY'VE BROKEN DOWN TIE GATE*. At the same time I indicated to
    the staff in the control box to watch the Leppings Lane Monitor. After about 20 seconds I
 noticed that the gate was closed and ltseened that a mounted officer alone had prevented
 a big rush of people through the open gate. I remeber seeing mounted officers trying to cleaa
 space in the crowd •
 She request for additional officers to be sent to Leppings Lane was made to Inspector Sewell
 and I remeber him offering two serials one of which was the *P* Division crime and -vandal
  they were directed to the Leppings lane end of the ground.
 I saw Liverpool fans climbing the walls of the ground onto "toe turnstile roofs and I
 in particular remeber several being sat astide Gate *B* with police officers stood below.
 I think at this time a P.R. message was sent regarding the climbers and an officer replied
 that he could not reach them*
 Around 2.45pm I remeber a P.R. message from Supt Marshall to the effect * WE MUST OPEN THE
 GATES OR SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE KILLED, PLEASE OPEN THE GATES.*
 At this time C/insp McRobbie is in the control box wearing civilian        wg,
 I remember seeing an officer on the top of the turnstiles at Leppings lane end and C/supt
 Ducenfield made enquries as to the officers identity. Another P.R. message was received
 from Supt Marshall his voice was very distressed • YOU MUST OPEN THE GATES OPEN TIE GATES*.
 C/Supt Duckenfield seemed to pause for thought and then said * ‘RIGHT IP LIVES AHE AT RISK
 THEN OPEN THE GATES.* Sgt Goddard then transmitted ‘OPEN THE GATES OPEN THE GATES.*
 Just prior to this I remeber seeing officers behand *A* gate, they were set out in two lines
 forming a funnel. Sgt Higgins of *F* C&V transmitted on P.R. * There are people being crushed
 outside *A* gate we must open *A* gate.
 I remember that about the time the gates were ordered to be opantd mounted officers out­
 side Leppinfes Lane turnstiles had managed to create a void between the turnstiles and the
 outer perimeter railings, in fact I believed that at one time the officers managed to
 close the outer gates, however the crowd outside forced its way through the outer gites
 and ran into the ground via *C* gate at least. I reraeber seeing crowds at tterear of
 Leppings Lane terrace just behind the turnstiles, they were just stood about not doing
 anything inparticular.
 About 2.55pm C/supt Duckenfield told control room staff to get some man power to the North
 stand to stop any possible rush onto the pitch. It was at this time that we began to notice
 Liverpool fans climbing up into the west stand from the terrace area. They were assisted
 by people in the stand and the same problem had occured the previous year. The sole purpose
 was so that fans with standing tickets could get into the seated area of the west stand.
 A short tim later fani were seen to climb the perimeter track fence. Officers on the track
 seemed to be telling the fans to get down from the fence. At this point the staff in the „
 control box and I thought that the situation was purely public order, no information was
 coming in to the effect that people were getting hurt.
A crowd gathered on the perimeter track and S/Supt Duckenfield ordered that they should be
moved as quickly as possible to the wing sections of Leppings Lane tersace where it could be
 seen ; that there was space. C/supt Duckenfield was angry about officers stood around the
 track near to the Kop and the North stand. A P.R. message was sent to the officers and they
were directed to the front of the North stand. Around this time C/Insp Me Robbie was sent to
 the pitch to get things sorted out. One problem was a W.P.C. stood on the perimeter track
 just below the control box she did not appear to be moving people off the track and in fact
  at one stage open the perimeter gate to the track then walk off leaving the gate open.
C/Insp Me Robbie took charge of the police woman and began ushering people from the track.
By this time there were people on the pitch and the perimeter teack gates were open allowing
people out of the center pens. Still at this stage no one in the control box was aware that
the problem was more than a pitch invasion situation.
Just after the match was stopped ACC Jackson was in the control box and he ordered me to
contact X.S. and call operation support. It was at this point that I decieded to concentrate
on operating the V.H.P. radio rather than the camera system. Very suddenly it became
apparent that there were injuries and at that time I contacted X.S. for ambulances to be
sent to the Leppings lane end of the ground. There were people all over the pitch infront
of the goal mouth, persons were lai€ across the floor with persons giving mouth to mouth
it was only then that we began to feel that there might be deaths. A P.R. message was sent
to control asking for bolt cutters and Sgt Goddard contacted claywheels lane asking if they
had cutters on the bri-mac transported. The reply was negative. He turned to me and I told
him that I would contact the fire service which I did via X.S. I made it clear tint we
required cutting equiptment for the metal fences. I remember someone instructing P.C. Ryan
to use the Tannoy telling people to stay calm. I can remember seeing bodies being moved
towards the tunnel on the Leppings Lane Terrace from the center pens. I believe that it was
police officers who were moving the bodies from the area. Liverpool fans who were on the
 w                                 - 4 -
pitch started to run towards the Kep officers Manage to stop the charge and split up
several groups of fans who were fighting. A line of officers were then formed across the
pitch just the Kop side of the center line*
I recall the fire service arriving at Leppings lane and their awn running onto the pitch
I then sefet a message to operations that we did have fatalities at the ground although
when X sent this message no details had been passed by P.R. it was all done from observation*
Further contact from X.S. regarding the number of ambulanoe requiredandthey sft&d would it
be more than 20 and     I said something to the effect that we needasmanyaspossible*
Traffic motor cycle were ordered to cover the routes to both hospitals and I made a request
for the senior ambulance officer to attend the control box* He did not arrive* The senior
fire officer attended at the control box and liased with senior officers and he too; asked
to speak to the senior ambiklance officer* Another request was made for that officer to
attend the control box via X.S.
About 3*35pm I checked the video tapes and discovered that one had stopped and the second
had been switch to operate in the 18 hr mode which in effect speeds up the action of the
scene being recorded* This I can only think was caught by me whilst standing at the rear
of the video control area* The videos are set at knee M i g h t and I believe that as I leant
forward this is how     I altered the time mode setting*
I installed two new     tapes and set them running at normal speed.
M Clough and Ur Daiglesh entered the control box and offered their services once they had
established that the match was off. Mr Dalglesh wanted to speak to the fens and he was asked
to use the Tannoy system in the D.J.s control box below the police control*
Supt Hurray then later asked for details of transport so that preparations could be made
for emptying the ground. I remeber some time after this Supt Murray saying to P.C. Ryan
that he wanted a message passing over the Tannoy tee ling the Liverpool fans to stay calm
and remain where they were untill the ambulances had left the stadium* Sometime later
the ground was emptyed and around 5*3Ppm I removed the video tapes and made my way to the Gy*
to offer assistance. I was later sent to H.Q. with the video tapes and I there saw C/supt
Duckenfield, Sgt Booth, ACC Jackson and C/supt Denton* About 11*00 D/supt Hckay attended
and he instructed me to return to Hammerton Road, book the video tapes into the property
store and await the arrival of AVA, Sgt         was to attend so that copies of the video
tapes could be made*
About 11.3Qpm Sgt         Arrived at Hammerton Roaff police station and I explained the
faults on the video tapes. He asked if I could get hold of the video recorder used with
the 18 hr mode setting so that he could transfer the tape action at the correct speed.
I then went back to the ground and removed one of the video recorders from the police
control box taking it to Ecclesfield training school where I handed it to Sgt
My immediate supervisor would by Supt Murray. I had no contact with the fans before/
during or after the incident* I cannot relate any information regarding the stewarding
of the ground* and I had no contact with the bodies*

Un f o r t u n a t e l y the      clerical         side of this o p e r a t i o n            c o u l d not be

On Saturday            15 A p r i l     1989,      I commenced du t y at               10 a m a t t e n d i n g at

After     collecting           the     radio      I made m y way to the                 L e p p i n g s Lane

terrace where             I saw that           R o g e r H o l d s w o r t h w a s w o r k i n g on camera

indeed      better         than     it h a d     b e e n a l t h o u g h not u p t o the c o r r e c t

Sergeant         Goddard         a n d P C R yan.        A f t e r a brief         conversation          I began

to check         the v i d e o      s y s t e m o p e r a t i n g e a c h of t h e      five cameras            in

agreed      between         us    that      Sergeant       Goddard would operate                   the p e r s o n a l

out    on a n ormal m a t c h             day.

Around      10.55 a m that             date,      Superintendent Chapman                    contact control

regarding         a g r o u p of       Liverpool         supporters who were waiting outside

th e   5 Arches         public        house.        T h e r e wa s at t h i s t i m e        no t r o u b l e    but

th e   information was                passed       just s o tha t o f f i c e r c o u l d be a w a r e t hat

groups      of    supporters           had arrived and were                 intent       on g e t t i n g a d r i n k

before      the m a t c h .         Several       other personal           r a d i o m e s s a g e s were        then

received         regarding          the     s a m e topic.

About     11.20       am Sergeant            Goddard       c a r r i e d out r a d i o c h e c k s some

personal         radios      did      not    r e p l y a n d the s e c t o r       Inspectors were asked

to ma k e    checks         where      appropriate.             Throughout          t h i s time v a r i o u s

messages were              coming      in r e g a r d i n g t r a f f i c p r o b l e m s    the c i t y s i d e       of

th e g r o u n d ,    Ml   motorway,           Parkway,       etc,    diversions            were    in force.

This     indicated          that     th e N o t t i n g h a m s u p p o r t e r s w e r e    en r o u t e in

numbers      and      could       be e x p e c t e d at the g r o u n d          for the turnstile

opening time           o f 12       noon.
 Just af t e r     noon      I inserted           the    2 VHS video tapes              in t h e    two vi d e o

recorders.            The    time      and date         s y s t e m was c h e c k e d a n d se t p o s s i b l y

using      th e   ground      lock mounted above                  the N o r t h S t a n d o r      by a t i m e

check with         other officers                in the c o n t r o l     box.       The tapes were           set

to r u n at       normal      speed,        my    i n t e n t i o n b e i n g t hat a r o u n d    2.30 p m the

same     date     I would         inset     2 ne w tapes which would then include                            the

build      up t o the m a t c h         throughout          the    game an d the s u p p o r t e r s

leaving the           ground.          Around       thi s   t i m e it wa s n o t i c e d t h a t p e r s o n s

had entered           the ground.

A short       time      later      it w a s      d i s c o v e r e d that s o m e of the P e n i s t o n e

Road     turnstiles were               not m a n n e d du e to an a d m i n i s t r a t i v e e r r o r         this

was    corrected         by d e p l o y i n g     on e of th e s p a r e       serials.           Some time

between      1.00       pm and       2.30     pm there was           concern expressed              regarding

the L i v e r p o o l    fans      p u r c h a s i n g Kop tickets          from touts         at L e p p i n g s

Lane    turnstiles.               T h i s w o u l d m e a n of c o u r s e t h a t      a m i x t u r e of    fans

would      have    t o be s u p e r v i s e d w i t h i n t h e K o p t e r r a c e .

During      this     same period            problems        began arising            in v a r i o u s p u b l i c

houses      near     t o the       ground        ones    t hat    spring to min d were              the H o r s e

and J ockey and             the    Royal.         Th e c o m p l a i n t s w e r e   that    fans were

d r i n k i n g h e a v i l y out     on the       street,       u r i n a t i n g in g a r d e n s a n d b e i n g

a general         nuisance.           Some      time between 1.30 pm and                    2.0 0 p m I b e g a n

to notice         that    on th e       Kop several          Liverpool        fan s h a d b e e n p l a c e d

in t h e   triangle         area      near    t o the N o r t h S t a n d e n d s u p e r v i s e d by

several      police       officers.           I set c a m e r a 4 t o m o n i t o r t h e s i t u a t i o n

noticing      that       several       a r r e s t s w e r e m a d e a n d t h a t m a n p o w e r wa s

getting     low.         I remembered            t h a t t h e r e had b e e n s o m e t r o u b l e at l ast

years mat c h       in th e s a m e        location and I q u e stioned Superintendent

Murray     re t h e      number       of   officers available               fo r d e p l o y m e n t on the
 Superintendent Murray then                     contacted         I n s p e c t o r Sewell r e g a r d i n g      the

 manpower         s i t u a t i o n an d he c o n f i r m e d    that   2 coaches e a c h c o n t a i n i n g

 40 m e n w o u l d be on s t a n d b y         in P e n i s t o n e Road.

Around       2.00 pm S u p e r i ntendent M u r r a y and Chief Superintendent

D u c k e n f i e l d went     t o s p e a k t o th e m a t c h referee.            Through         the

afternoon          complaints        h a d b e e n e x p r e s s e d r e g a r d i n g the q u a l i t y     of

personal         radio transmissions               to the       control      staff.

Around       2.00     pm I overhead on V H F              that Liverpool supporters                   had      been

spoken       to on a coach w h i c h had d i s p l a y e d a Nottingham Forest

supporters          parking ticket.              The    coach and supporters were                    spoken       to

by traffic          officers       and advised.

About      the     same time there was              a r e p o r t of t r o u b l e s o m e L i v e r p o o l

fans    on    a coach registered number                    9995      RU.    This n u m b e r w a s

circulated          a n d the c o a c h w a s     checked         by on e of the m o b i l e         serials.

Around       2.20     pm the ACC        Jackson was         in the cont r o l         b o x w h e n he

noticed       a m a n o n the L e p p i n g s       Lane    t e r r a c e s outh pen.         He d r o p p e d

       trousers        and began fooling about.                     His b e h a v i o u r w a s    such      that

it w a s     believed       that     he w a s   d r u n k a n d the A C C a s k e d fo r s o m e t h i n g

to be      done     about     him.      I set t h e      c a m e r a t o m o n i t o r his    behaviour.

About      2.15     p m all    the control         r o o m staff discussed that                   it w a s

apparent       the Liveprool            fans had not            b e g u n t o a r r i v e as yet.         The

North      Stand     had vast        spaces     a l t h o u g h the Leppings Lane            terrace         was

filling      u p at a normal           rate.       Just    a f t e r t h i s the p e r s o n a l      radio

transmissions           became worse and the               civilian radio repair man                      came

into the      control         b o x t o a t t e m p t a repa i r .
About       2.30 pm my attention was                    d r a w n t o th e large c r o w d           outside        the

Leppings          Lane turnstiles.                I would       estimate around            3,000 people             and

 it w a s    apparent        that the        number was           i n c r e a s i n g by t h e    v o l u m e of

 foot    passengers          in L e p p i n g s    Lane     itself.

Chief       Superintendent           Duckenfield            a s k e d a b o u t the l a r g e      crowd and         it

was     said that although                it w a s m o r e      t h a n normal,      it w a s      no more         than

was     expected         for such a f o o t b a l l         ma t c h .

About       2 .35 p m t h e c i v i l i a n       r a d i o r e p a i r m a n st a t e d t h a t     he c o u l d

not     fix the personal             radio        s y s t e m a n d it w a s n e c e s s a r y     to resort         to

using       the    radios     on a b a c k t o b a c k system.

About       the    same time Chief            Superintendent              Duckenfield            c a m e t o the

back     of th e     control       box     a n d a s k e d m e if t h e crowd s c e n e s             at the

Leppings          Lane were       being recorded             and     I replied        'Yes'.

A personal          radio on L e p p i n g s         Lane    requested more m a n p o w e r             to

Leppings          Lane turnstiles.                Sergeant       Sorsby despatched                2 horses         f rom

the     S o u t h S t a n d c a r park.

A personal          radio message           then      came      in s t a t i n g that     the      gates were

being       forced,      they were         bending        and    buckling.          In m y m i n d      I

b e l i e v e d that     th e g a t e s    referred         to were       'C' gate a n d          I kept     th e

Leppings          Lane   camera set         to that         sor t of area.

About       2.40 pm Chief          Superintendent               Duckenfield and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Murray      r e q uested that         I contact          Operations         R o o m so t h a t      a traffic

car w ith a PA system could                       attend     in L e p p i n g s L a n e a n d      advised         the

c r o w d wh i c h were by this             time      becoming apparently mor e                    hostile.          I

also    remember around this                 time that Sergeant Goddard p i c k e d                         up the

personal       radio telephone              style       handset and after t r y i n g               to use         it,

t h r e w it d o w n o n t o t h e d e s k        because        it wa s not w o r k i n g         a n d the
 personal        r a d i o t r a n s m i s s i o n s w e r e v e r y poor.          I can remember            seeing

 about       5 or 6 officers             s t o o d on barrier duty              just p a s t      the gate          'C'

 towards        the     S o u t h Stand.

 About       2.40 pm I remember               seeing        'C'    gat e o p e n a n d a n u m b e r of

 supporters           enter the        ground.           I then said words             like      'They've

 broken down            the g a t e '.       At    th e s a m e t i m e    I i n d i c a t e d t o the s t a f f

 in t h e     control        b o x t o w a t c h the L e p p i n g s L a n e m o n i t o r .           After about

 20   seconds         I noticed that              the    gate w a s c l o s e d a n d it         seemed that         a

mounted        o f f i c e r a l o n e h a d p r e v e n t e d a bi g r u s h of p e o p l e            through

the    open      gate.        I remember           seeing m o u nted officers t rying to clear

space        in t h e    crowd.

The    request          for a d d i t i o n a l   officers         t o be sent       to Lepp i n g s Lane was

made     to    Inspector Sewell               and       I remember him offering two Serials,

one    of w h i c h w a s the          'F'    Division Crime and Vandal,                      t h e y wer e

directed         t o the L e p p i n g s     Lane       e n d of th e ground.

I saw Liverpool               f a n s c l i m b i n g the w a l l s of th e g r o u n d o n t o the

turnstile         roofs       and    I in p a r t i c u l a r     remember several             b e i n g sat

astride        gate      'B' w i t h p o l i c e     o f f i c e r s s t o o d below.        I t h i n k at     this

time    a personal            radio m e s s a g e was         s ent r e g a r d i n g th e     climbers        and

an officer          replied that           he     c o u l d not r e a c h them.

Around       2.45     pm I remember             a personal          radio message          from

Superintendent             Marshall        to the effect              'We m u s t o p e n t h e    gates       or

someone       is g o i n g t o be k i l l e d ,          please open the            gate s . '

At    this    time Chief          Inspector McRobbie                 is in t h e c o n t r o l     bo x w e a r i n g

civilian        clothing.

I remember          seeing an o f f i c e r on the                t o p of t h e t u r n s t i l e s    at

Leppings       Lane      end and Ch i e f          Superintendent            Duckenfield made
enquiries         as    to the officer's               ide n t i t y .    Another          personal     r adio

message was            received from Superintendent Marshall,                                his    v o i c e wa s

very distressed,               'You m u s t       o p e n the gates,          open     the gates'.            Chief

Superintendent              D u c k e n f i e l d s e e m e d to p a u s e    for    t h o u g h t a n d t h en

said      'Right       if l i v e s   a r e at risk,          then open the            gate s ' .      Sergeant

Goddard then transmitted                       'Open the gates,              open the        gates'.        J ust

P r ior   to this         I remember           seeing officers            behind       'A' g ate,       they were

set     out    in t w o l i n e s     f o r m i n g a funnel.            Sergeant          Higgins     of   'F' C & V

transmitted            on p e r s o n a l   radio       'There are p e o p l e        being crushed

outside        'A'     gate we m u s t         open     'A' gate'.

I remember           that about         th e    t i m e the gates w e r e o r d e r e d t o be o p e n e d

mounted        officers        outside         L e p p i n g s Lan e t u r n s t i l e s    had m anaged       to

create        a void between            the     t u r n s t i l e s an d t h e o u t e r     perimeter

r a i l i n g s , in    fact,     I b e l i e v e d t h a t at one t i m e           th e o f f i c e r s m a n a g e d

to close        th e    outer     gates,        however,        the c r o w d o u t s i d e    f o r c e d its w a y

least.        I remember          seeing        crowds      at the r e a r of L e p p i n g s         Lan e

terrace       just      behind the          turnstiles,          t hey w e r e      jus t    stood about          not

doing     a n y t h i n g in p a r t i c u l a r .

About     2.55       pm Chief       Superintendent              Duckenfield told control room

staff     to get        some m a n p o w e r      to t h e N o r t h S t a n d t o s t o p a n y p o s s i b l e

rush    ont o the pitch.               It w a s      at    thi s t ime t h a t w e          began to notice

Liverpool        fans c l i m b i n g       u p i n t o the West S t a n d           f r o m the     terrace

area.     They were         assisted         by people         in the s t a n d a n d the s a m e

problem had          occurred         the    previous        year.       A short       time     later       fans

were    seen     to climb the           perimeter           t r a c k fence.        Officers        o n the

track     seemed       t o be t e l l i n g      the      fan s to get d o w n        from the        fence.         At
 th i s    point       the    staff      in th e c o n t r o l    bo x a n d     I thought          that the

 situation was               p u r e l y p u b l i c order.       N o i n f o r m a t i o n w a s c o m i n g in to

 the e f f e c t       that     p e o p l e w e r e g e t t i n g hurt.

 A crowd         g a t h e r e d o n th e p e r i m e t e r t r a c k a n d     Chief Superintendent

 Duckenfield             ordered       t h a t t h e y s h o u l d be m o v e d       as    q u i c k l y as

 possible         to the wing            s e c t i o n s of L e p p i n g s L a n e    t e r r a c e w h e r e it

 could      be    seen       that    t h e r e w a s space.        Chief       Superintendent

 Duckenfield was                angry about         officers stood             a r o u n d t h e t r a c k near to

 the K o p a n d         the N o r t h    Stand.        A personal        r a d i o m e s s a g e w a s sent t o

 the      officers        and    they were         directed to the             front        of t h e N o r t h

 Stand.     Around           this    time      Chief    Inspector M c R o b b i e          was    sent to the

 pitch to         ge t    things       s o r t e d out.      On e p r o b l e m w a s      a W P C s t o o d on the

 perimeter            track     just     b e l o w the c o n t r o l box.         She      d i d not a p p e a r to

be m o v i n g        people     off     the    t r a c k a n d in fact       at o n e       s t a g e o p e n e d the

perimeter          gate       t o th e    track then walked off                 l e a v i n g the gat e open.

Chief      Inspector McRobbie                  t o o k c h a r g e of th e     p o l i c e w o m a n and began

ushering people                f r o m th e    track.       B y thi s     time    t h e r e w e r e p e o p l e oh

the pitch          and the p e r i m e t e r        track gates were             open        allowing people

out    of t h e       centre      pens.        S t i l l at this s t a g e       no one         in the c o n t r o l

box was      aware         that      t h e p r o b l e m wa s m o r e t h a n a p i t c h i n v a s i o n

situation.

Just      after       the match was            stopped ACC Jackson was                     in t h e c o n t r o l    box

a n d he    ordered me            to contact Operations Room and                           call    operation

support.          It w a s      at    this point        t hat I d e c i d e d t o c o n c e n t r a t e on

operating         t h e V H F r a d i o r a t h e r t h a n the c a m e r a           system.        Very

suddenly         it    became apparent             tha t   there we r e        injuries           an d at that

time      I contacted Operations                   R o o m for a m b u l a n c e s     t o be sent t o th e

Leppings         Lane     end    of t h e      ground.       There were people                 all o v e r     the
pitch    in f r o n t     of t h e g o a l m o u t h ,        persons were         l a i d a c r o s s the

floor with          persons       giving mouth to mouth.                     It w a s o n l y t h e n t hat we

began to feel            that     t h e r e m i g h t be d e a t h s .       A personal       radio message

was    sent    to control          asking      for b o l t      cutters and Sergeant Goddard

contacted        Claywheels          Lane asking           if t h e y ha d c u t t e r s     on the b r i - m a c

transporter.             The     re p l y was negative.               He t u r n e d t o m e a n d I t o l d

hi m that      I would          contact     the fire s e r v i c e w h i c h         I d i d via

Operations          R oom.       I made     it c l e a r      that    we requ i r e d cutting

equipment        for     the m e t a l    fences.          I remember         someone      i n s t r u c t i n g PC

R y a n t o us e     the tan n o y       telling people              t o s t a y calm.       I can remember

seeing bodies            being moved          towards         the    tunnel     on the L e p p i n g s L a n e

terrace       from the          centre    pens.       I believe          that    it w a s p o l i c e

officers       who were moving              th e b o d i e s    f r o m the a rea.         Liverpool          fans

who were       on the pitch            started to run towards                   t h e Kop.        Officers

managed       to s t o p the       charge      an d s p l i t       up several       groups       of fans w h o

were    fighting.            A line      of o f f i c e r s    were    then     f o r m e d a c r o s s the

pitch    just       the K o p side        of the c e n t r e         line.      I recall      th e fire

service       a r r i v i n g at L e p p i n g s L a n e a n d t h e i r m e n r u n n i n g o n t o the

pitch.        I then      sent     a message        to Operations             t h a t w e d i d have

fatalities          at   th e   ground although when                  I s ent t h i s m e s s a g e no

details       had    been passed          by personal           radio.        It w a s   all d o n e f r o m

and    I said som e t h i n g to the effect                    that we       n e e d as m a n y   as

possible.

Traffic motor            cycles were         o r d e r e d t o c o v e r t h e r o u t e s t o bot h

hospitals       and      I made     a request        fo r t h e       senior ambulance            officer       to

attend the control               box.      H e d i d not a r r i v e .         The    senior      fire
officer       a t t e n d e d at      the control         box and liaised with                senior

officers        a n d he t o o a s k e d t o s p e a k t o t h e s e n i o r a m b u l a n c e o f f i c e r .

Another        request was            made    for that officer to a ttend                   the control           box

via Operations              R oom.

About      3.35 p m       I c h e c k e d th e v i d e o t a p e s a n d d i s c o v e r e d      that o n e h a d

recorded.            This     I can only think was caught                      by me whilst          standing

at t h e     rear     of t h e      video control          area.        The    videos      ar e set at k n e e

I i n s t a l l e d t w o n e w t a p e s a n d set          t h e m r u n n i n g at n o r m a l    speed.

Mr Clough and Mr Dalgleish entered                             the c o n t r o l    box and offered

their      services         once      they had establ i s h e d that               t h e m a t c h wa s off.

Mr Dalgleish wanted                   t o s p e a k t o th e     fans a n d he w a s a s k e d to use

S uperintendent M u r r a y then                 later     asked      for d e t a i l s    of t r a n s p o r t   so

that    preparations               c o u l d be m a d e   for e m p t y i n g th e g r o u n d .        I

the    South Stand                onto       the    pitch.



P r i o r to      entering           the      stand?        I had       received           no    i n f o r m a t i o n as      to w h a t

was    happening             or    what       was    expected           of    me.          It w a s     o n l y as       I gained a

view    of     the      pitch        that        I realised         that       there        were       numerous          injured

persons        on      the    pitch          and    the    scene        which       f a c e d me       was       of a b s o l u t e

I was       still       not       informed          as    to w h a t     had      happened            but,       being     a   regular

football          supporter,             although          not     normally           at    Hi 1 1 s b o r o u g h , I r e a l i s e d

that    the       supporters             from       the L e p p i n g s      Ln     terraces           appeared          to    have

been    crushed.

As     I went         down        onto     the       pitch,       I saw a           line       of    policemen             stretching

across         the        pitch      from       the    South          Stand        to    the    North          Stand,       about     thirty

yards         away        from     the     back       line       at    the     Lappings             Ln    end.




Between         the         line     of    police          officers           and       the    perimeter             fencing     around

the        Leppings          Ln    terraces.                I could           just       see    a mass          of    people,       some

were        l y ing       down,      with       people          crouched           down       next       to    them    obviously

attending             to     the m .           Others       were       just        wandering             around       the     pitch,    some

appeared            to     be     in a s t a t e       of       shock     whilst          others          were       shouting       abuse

at     the     line        of     police        officers          and     photographers.



X immediately                   went      to    the    nearest           casualty,             a white          y o u th who     was

lying         motionless             on    the       ground       and     being          given       heart        massage       and    mouth

to m o u t h        resuscitation                by    two       men.          On e      of    the       two m e n     t o l d me     that

he     wa s    an     off-duty            fireman          from       L o n d o n who         had    come       to w a t c h    the    match

as     a    supporter             of L i v e r p o o l      FC.          He    wa s      also       wearing          a St     Johns

Ambulance             armband.




I felt         the        y o u t h ’s n e c k       but    could        find       no    trace          of    the    carotid       pulse.

I also         realised            that        the    two       men    were        well       trained          in f i r s t    aid and       so

I gave         them an a i r w a y              and    left       them        to    find another                casu al ty who         may

need assistance.



As     I stood            up a n d     walked         towards          the     area       of    the       goal       mouth.         I heard

a youth         standing             behind          the    perimeter              fencing          towards          the    centre     of

th e       Leppings          Ln    terraces           shout       to     some       police          officers          nearby.          The

police         officers            were        standing          doing        nothing,          basically             in a     line    as

though         they        were      expecting             to    control           a violent             situation.             There       was

certainly             a    lot     of a n g e r       being       vented           amongst          the       Liverpool

supporters,             both          on a n d     off     the    pitch       and         it wa s      basically             being

directed          at    t fte     police.




The    youth mentioned                      previously           shouted         something             to   the       effect        of        'Get

your    black          gloves          off    and    get     something               dons’.




As    far    as    I could             see    at    this     p oi n t      there          were    no    casualties             left           on

the    terraces,             although             there     was      still       a    large       number         of    supporters

behind       the       perimeter             fencing        but      the    danger          of    crushing            ha d    passed,

I d i d n ’t n o t i c e          if    either        of    the      gates       in the          fencing         were        open,       and        I

didn't       see       any      casualties            being       brought            onto       the    pitch.




1 saw       several          groups          of    supporters           no 1 d i n g       sections         of    advertising

hoardings          which          they       were     using       as    makeshift               stretchers            although            1

only    noticed             one       casualty        being       carried            a w ay.




At    the    time       my m i n d          was    concentrated             on       helping          the   casualties              who

were    lying          on    the       ground       and     I was       taking            little       notice         of     what     was

happening          around             me.         Before     I could          tend         to a n y     further            casualties

however,          station             Officer       ?■i...L iCHb.R     came      to me          and    told      me    to     return           to

the    tender          with       a    reguest        to    'Make       pumps         ten*.            (his      basically means

I immediately                left       the       pitch,     returning               through          the   South          Stand       to

where       the    tender             had    remained        I then         used          the    radio      on    the        appixa'nce

to m a k e    the       request             but    this     turned         out       to    be    the    confirmation                of an

earlier       request             from       Station        Officer         S W A I N E who           was   in a t t e n d a n c e          with

standing             nearby          and        asked         if    he       needed        me      to    do a n y t h i n g .              He a d v i s e d

me       to    return          to    the        pitch         to    see       what        I could            do.




As       I returned             through             the       South          Stand       to     the      pitch,          I could            see       that

the       amount          of    people             on    the       pitch          ha d    considerably               lessened.                       I was

then          informed          by S t a t i o n          Officer             FLETCHER             who       had    remained               on the

pitch          that       the       injured             had    been          taken        to a         casualty          handling               point        in

the       gymnasium.                     He     told      me       to    go       there       to       see    if    I could           help           with

first          aid,       so    I picked                up a       resuscitator                 pack         which       ha d    been           left        on

the       gymnasium             was       in       that       area.               However,             1 was       then     informed                 by a

policewoman                 that         th e      gymnasium             was       at     the      opposite          end        of     the       ground

so       I again          resumed               through            the       south        stand         to    the    pitch.

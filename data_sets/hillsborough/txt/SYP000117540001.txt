                          King.         I then         briefed           the S e r i a l      as      to    their    duties          and       instructed

                          them       to w o r k     in      pairs.          Our     initial           duties       were    football             supporter

                          In the m a i n           they     were         good     humoured,            although          some       groups          of y o u t h s

At    about       1.40      to      1.45pm,           my    last        pair       of    officers             were        a b o a r d a PSV.

There       were       a number            of    other          officers           still        in the            ar e a .     The PSV

middle        aged man           from Liverpool.                        We     discussed              the      various         methods              of

travel        to a n d      from         football           matches            and      the     older          man      stated        that          he

preferred          to     use       the     train and              commented             on     the         excellent

organisation              at     Hillsborough.                     He    said        that       he      had a t t e n d e d         the        same

fixture        the       previous           y e ar ,       by    tra i n ,      had      a    couple           of    pints         and        lunch

On    our     arrival          at     the       ground,          the     bus       stopped            in L e p p i n g s       Lane,           near

to    the     bridge,          before           the    g r o u n d at          about         2.10pm.              The     road was             very

busy with          pedestrians,                  both       on the           road a n d         on the            pavements.                  As    the

bus     stopped a           crowd          gathered             round        the     doors         a n d as         the      passengers

got     off    the      bu s     they       were       repeatedly               asked         if a n y o n e         had a ny        spare

tickets,          by m e m b e r s         of    the       crowd.            I eventually                   called        to all

passengers             still        on     the       bus,       asking         if a n y o n e         ha d a n y        spare       tickets,

and     received          no     positive             replies,           and       told       the       youths          at    the    bus

door,       asking        them        to    move       b ac k      to a l l o w         passengers                off.

We    then     got      off      the       bus       and walked              through          the       crowd        to      the    g ro u n d .

We   went        in t h r o u g h    a       gate ,         under          the    North          Stand       to    the          Gymnasium

area.        I there          tried          to       trace       the       remainder             of m y S e r i a l .                I found

At   about        2.45pm       I contacted                    the      match          control          room       by       telephone                and

spoke       to PC R y a n .          I told                him    the       strength             of m y S e r i a l             and asked                for

instructions.                 He    spoke             to    someone          else       and       t o l d me       to a d o p t            a    call

We   made        our    way    towards                Gate       A,    into       Leppings             L a n e .— O n           the    wav

several          people       stopped             me,       telling          me       that       the     crffw______________

outside          wa s   serious.                  At       Gate       A,    the       gate       man,     Jack         Stone,          refused

to    open       the    gate,       due          to    the       crowds          outside.              I glanced                through             the

small       window        in the         gate          and       saw       a sea       of    faces.           T he         crowd       waiting

at    the    turnstiles             wa s         obviously             packed          tightly           together               and    the

situation           looked         serious.                 I realised                that       I would          have          to    get

outside          through       another                gate.           I shouted             to    the S e r i a l           to       follow          and

ran a long          the    back      of          the       turnstiles.                 On    the       way    I was             stopped             by

supporters,             complaining                   of    the       situation             outside.              I went             through             a

gate       manned       by a       steward,                into       the    area       tojphind the              terrace             and West

Stand       and     then      through             a gate          in th e         wall       dividing             that          area.           The

gate       was    unmanned.              I then             turned          right       towards           Gate         C    leading             to       the

service          road,     intending                  to a s k        the    steward             to    open       it,       to       let       us

out.        I <saw t h a t         the       gate          was    already             open and           that, a s m a l l             number                of

people       were       coming       in.              I cannot             remember          seeing          a s t e w a r d at                this

g a te.

I    ran    through        the      gate          a n d as        I did          so    I saw          f o ur m o u n t e d           officers

outside,          apparently             protecting                   the    gat e .         As       I turned             right       into          the

service          road,     I saw         a       large        crowd         of    people          in the          compound             leading

to    the    turnstiles.                 The          people          were       packed          tightly          together.                -A

number       were       pale       and       looked           ill      and many             were       screaming                and    c rying.

It wa s     a    s e e t h i n g m a s s of         people.

My    first      t h o u g h t s w e r e to         stop      the       cr u s h .         Ita p p e a r e d      to me         that

people      were       pushing          from Leppings                   Lane.         The      barrier           between           this

compound         and     the       service         road       consists             of a s i n g l e           tubular           t yp e     rail.

I started            telling        people         to      come      out      of     the     compound            and       go     in

through         Gate     C.        They       w o u l d n ’t.        A few         shouted          t h at      they       h a d got

tickets         and    were        going        in,        I was        pleading           with      them        to       come     out.

Only      a f e w did,         but       it    d i d n ’t s e e m        to    relieve             the    crush.             I didn't

know      how    to    stop        t h em.        I considered                putting          a    cordon           into       the      crowd,

but    when      I looked I              only      saw       two     other         officers.              Th«& 'feituktion was

desperate,            I firmly           believed            that       people        were         going        to    be    seriously

injured.             I was     pleading            with       people          to     come      out       of     the       compound and

go    in t h r o u g h      Gate        C.    Suddenly            I saw        Gate        B opposite                me    open

slightly         and     then open wider                   to m a y b e        6 feet.              Almost immediately

the    crush         seemed        to    ease.          My    immediate              thought         was,        "Thank           f u ck     for

that."          At    the     same       time      other        people         in the          crowd          seemed         to

understand            what     I had          been      saying          about        Gate      C being           open and              came

under       the b a r r i e r .         After         a few       seconds            I saw Gate            8     cl os e .        The

crush       had been         eased        considerably.                      The     people         who        came u n d e r          the

barrier         began       queuing           towards         Gate       C,    being         marshalled               by    the        mounted

officers.             One     of    these         officers           put      hi s    h o r s e ’s f a c e           to    th e    wall       and

heard       him shout         words          to   the      effect            that     the      supporters should walk

under       the h o r s e s        between         it a n d       the        wall     and      in t h r o u g h t h e             gates.

Other      people        were       going         in t h r o u g h       the       turnstiles             normally              and

orderly.             Looking        to m y        left       I saw       two       mounted          officers'blocking                        the

gates      into       the     compound            from Leppings                Lane.           There          was     another            large

crowd      in L e p p i n g s       Lane,         waiting          to    come        towards         the       turnstiles.

After      a fe w      seconds           the      queues        at      the    turnstiles                were        small        and      the

mounted         officers           moved       to a l l o w        this       crowd        into      the       compound.                 Some

people      r an      in.      I shouted              to     them       to    slow     down.             By    this        time        I wa s

inside            the    compound.               Some      slowed and walked,                           others            ra n   past     me    to

the        turnstiles.                  I dealt        with       a few              queries           regarding           turnstile

locations               and    then          cleared       off a          number            of y o u t h s         who     were     still

standing               in the           compound. I a sked                   t h e m al l              individually, about                     8 or

10    in n u m b e r ,         if       they     had       tickets.                  Only      one      had a ticket a nd                 I moved

the        others        out       of    the     compound.

After         a    few       seconds          I heard          the     voice           of S e r g e a n t      Goddard            on the

radio,            he    said,       "We       are    going        to        have          to s t o p    the    game".             He then

repeated               it.     After          a short          pa us e ,       I heard            him       say,      "All       available

Serials            to    the       perimeter           track         at     Leppings             Lane,         the re a r e         supporters

on    the         pitch".I then                ran f r o m       the        compound                    and        into     the g r o u n d ,

through            Gate       C,        which       wa s s t i l l     o p en.              I ran       to    the        r i g h t to a g a t e

under         the       match       control           room.          As     I ran           past       the     rear        of    the    terrace

and        st a n d ,    I noticed an absence                          of        police         officers.                The     only

officers               I saw were             two    standing             at     the        foot       of     the     stairs        leading           to

the        West        Stand.           I momentarily                wondered               where       the        others        were.         When

I reached               the    gate,          the    remainder              of m y S e r i a l              ha d    j o i n e d me.          The

gate        w as       locked       and       had    to    be     unlocked                by a g a t e m a n .             We    ran

underneath               the       control          box,       along        th e       rear      of     the        uncovered           seating

and        then        left,       down an aisle,                 onto         the        pitch.            I remember            noticing

that        the        players          were    not       on    the         pit c h.         1 could          see     a     large       number

of    people            on    the       perimeter          track            at       the     rear       of    the     goal.            I ran

towards            them       and       as    I did       so    I could              hear       people        screaming,               moaning

and    shouting.                   I could          not    see       into        the        centre          south        pen,     but    people

were        waving           and    shouting           for      me     to      go     into       the        terrace.             Gate    No.       2,

leading            into       the       south       end    of    the        terrace            was      open.

I went            into       the    terrace          through           that          gate      and      moved        towards           the

centre            south       pen.           People       were       in f r o n t           of me       and        I c o u l d n ’t see         past

them.          Others          grabbed          me,       telling           me       to     go a n d        help.          I could       still

hear        people           screaming          from       the       centre           pen.         I remember               one    youth

saying          it w a s        my    fault        and     that       they        should         have        had    the     other         end,

obviously meaning                       the    Spion        Kop.           I got to the f e n c e s e p a r a t i n g the

pens       on      the     terrace.            Th e       fence       is     of      solid       ste e l      bars       and about          7 or

8    f ee t     high.           As    I approached               the       fence,          I could           see    people        crushed

up a g a i n s t          it.        Al l    the     people          I saw were                upright.

As    I reached             the       fence        a young           girl       was       handed       o v er      the    top,     she      wa s

unconscious.                    With        help     from a supporter,                         I caught           the    girl     as      she

was     passed            over       the     fence        and    I carried                her    back        to G a t e     2.     Sh e     wa s

in her          late       teens        and    I remember               she       was      wearing           jenas       and     had      long

hair.           People          were        still     stopping             me     and      telling           me    to h e l p ,        When       I

reached            the     gate,        I s a w a PC            dressed           in a full            yellow           jacket,

standing             at    th e      gate     on     the    tr a c k .          I think          he was           a Nottinghamshire

officer.              A man          was     trying        to    ge t      out       of    the    gate,           but    c o u l d n ’t

climb         up     the    wall.            I pushed           him     out       of      the    way and           handed        the      girl

to    the       PC    and       then        went     back       to    the       fence.           I then           helped       others       over

the     fence         and       helped        carry        them       back        to G a t e      2.         On    one    occasion           I

reached            the     fence        and    saw a        pile        of      people,          laid        on    the    terrace          at

the     fr o n t .         This       was     the     first          time       that       I had       seen        people        not      in an

upright            position.                Some     of    them       were        purple         or    blue        in the        face.           It

was     o n l y at         that       time     that        1' t h o u g h t       people         may     have       died.         1 was

shocked and                drained           both     mentally             and       physically.                  I radioed        the

control            room a n d         asked        that     officers              be      sent    to     the       rear     of    the

tunnel          to    stop        people       pushing.               The       reply was             that        this    had     been

d o ne™         I saw       that        people        on the          perimeter                track     were       unable        to      get

into       the       terrace,           due    to     the       security             fe n ce .        1't w a s     ovious        t ha t    the

fence         had     to    be       dismantled            quickly,             or     cut.       I again           radioed        control

room,         asking        for       bolt     croppers.                I did          not      hear     a    reply,        but    heard

conversation                on       the     radio.

O n my        next        return        to    t he    gate,          the? s a me          PC    asked        me    how    I was.           He

said       "Are       you       alright        Serg.",           I s a id,           " I ’m     fucked".            I was        tired      and

my mind          d i d n ’t s e e m      to    be       functioning.              He     said    "Come     out,      w e ’ ll       get

somebody           fresh         in".        I remember             thinking        that    was       a good      idea a nd           he

h e l p e d me      up o n t o         the    tra c k .

By    this       time       it    can    only       be       described       as     bedlam.           There     were       police

officers,           suppo r t e r s * first               aid       people      and      stewards,       milling           about.

People       were        being         carried          from    th e    terrace.           I tried        to    recover          my

breath and             composure             and    then       went     to    the       crowd    of    people      at      the      gate

of    the    centre           pen.       People          in a       collapsed           state    were     being       handed          out

from within              the      pen.        I helped          to     carry       one    man    onto     the     pitch and

laid       him     down,         his    eyes       were       wide     and    staring.           Inspector           Harvey         wa s

with       me.      He      began       to    prepare          th e m a n     for       mouth    to m o u t h .       I ripped

open       the m a n ’s s h i r t            and    began       chest        massage.            I remember          the     shirt,

was    an    off       white          colour,       with       a feint        brown       pattern.         We     tried

resuscitation                 for      about       S or 3 m i n u t e s ,          but    it, was      apparent           that      the

m a n was        dead.           As    I stood          up    I l o o k e d at      Inspector          Harvey,        he was

obviously            upset        and    distraut             and    so w a s      I.     Then     a young        man      came a n d

began mouth              to m o u t h        on    the       same    man.       I knew      the m a n      was       dead,       but

knelt       and again             tried       heart          massage.After             a minute          or t w o ,        I told

the    youth         that        the    man       was    dead.         He     s t a r t e d to    cry a n d w a l k e d awa y .

I f el t      so     helpless.               Some       other       people      came,      I don't know           who, a n d

carried          the     man      away.

All    around          me     people         were       being       carried        and    others       were     attempting

artificial             respiration.                 I c o u l d n ’t get           close    to     the    fence,          t h ere

were       too m a n y        people         in f r o n t      of    it.

I busied myself                   comforting              people       who    were       obviously        upset.           A number

were       nasty and             upset       and    forcibly           b l a m e d me     for    what     had     happened.                I

eventually             gathered          my Serial             together         and after          a   period        of    time       we

were       instructed             to    leave       the       ground and           we    were     to go    to     Penistone

Road North,              to      provide          PSV     escort       to    the    city    centre.            Very       few

people        used       the      PSV's       and       we    then     received          instructions           to    return          to

              the        ground,    which           was    now    quiet    and        totally       empty    of   supporters.

              In t h e m a i n ,     th e      fans        were    good    natured,           although       a few were       abusive.

              Outside        the    ground           before       the    kick    off,     I detected          fear a m o n g s t    a    lot

              of     them.

              I saw a number              of        stewards,       but    there        was    no    steward at       Gate    C.

               I was; not a w a r e         of a n y        break       down     in    radio    transmissions          at    any    stage

              during        the    policing           of    the    event.

               I feel       that    had     supporters             arrived        in g o o d    time    to    take    their    places

               the       build-up    of     people          in L e p p i n g s    Lane,       outside       the    turnstiles,

              would        not    have    taken           place    and    the     crush which          ensued       would    have       been

               prevented.           There           would    then       have     been    no    necessity          whatsoever       for

               either       gates    B or C           to    be    opened.

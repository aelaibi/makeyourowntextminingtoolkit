                   At   11am (1100)               serials 34 and 35 were briefed by our Commander,

                   Inspector Townend.

                   At   11.15am      (1115) we all took up our positions on C la ywheels Lane.

                   Each bus that arrived was met by officers                                    in our two serials they were

                   directed to drive to the end of this                             particular           road and there turn

                   around and return to park alongside                             our serials.

                   An officer from our serial                         greeted each coach and they were all

                   directed towards the football                         stadium.

                   These buses contained a wide                         cross section in ages of Liverpool

                   supporters and I cart state that from, this section, of supporters

                   whilst they were                   in this    location they appeared to be well behaved

              l'o cation»

              From this,position1you can see a good distance up this Halifax Road

              and as far as the eye could see              I saw that there was a continuous

              flow of Liverpool     supporters        in groups approx.              10 abreast on both

              sides of the carriageway.

              The majority of these were males                 in the      lower age bracket,        it was

              very apparent    to me that a large amount of alcohol                        had,been consumed

              by the vast majority of these men.

              A large number of them were still                drinking on their way towards the

              ground and a.large number of them were halted and asked to leave

              their intoxicants at this location.                   Some of them left their drinks

              others insisted on consuming them at this location.
                    -
              Generally they were all of good behaviour, they were drunk but not

              incapable or disorderly.

              From me and the Other officers taking up this position the thing that

              became most apparent to m e other.than their drunken states was how

              late thousands of them had Left it to go to get into the ground.

              This heavy mass of persons continued without any significant gaps

              appearing until about      1510 hours.

the -premiS'es.

Our serial       then >-et,iirned tq its static point.                At this time the

passage of fans Had now %Jiinned out but there was still a number                                   of

Liverpool     f;ans still makirug their way to th® ground.                                ’

About    1510 as -a result       of a r equest         by PS S h er r a t t we    r e tu rn ed    into

this    public    h ouse a n d there a s s i s t e d    in clearing        the   premises.

About    1315 we were able to resume from these premises and upon doing

so,    I was informed of radio, messages of trouble inside the ground.

At this PC Goss, returned to join us and informed us all to attend at

the ground.

Our serial       then proceeded to the ground and we entered via the large

gates adjacent to turnstiles 77 to 78.

It was there that         I saw two ambulances              parked in the corner close to

    e corner of the Spion Kop.

There were two persons being deposited beside these ambulances and I

saw that an attempt was being made at                    chest massage.          I observed that

this failed to revive this person.

We were then directed to the pathway into the Spion Kop and it was

there that       I was approached by a number of Notts.                    Forest     supporters

who offered their services.

With members of our serial             I    then went with these volunteers to the

passageway between the North                stand and the Spion Kop and it was there

where   I saw a number of bodies being carried up that passageway

towards the gymnasium area,             by supporters and also police officers.

At this I went with other officers onto the playing area.                                There      I
                                                                                                    PAGE          4

  saw bodies of,dead and injured laying all over the pitch.                                   The

  majority of t,hem were blue in the face and were dead.

  t h e r e were .Ib&ds of f#t»s running a bo ut                   the pitch,                           ‘         ';

  After        this I went ovtfr to the Leppings Larte en4 I saw that there were

  Still.piles of bbdies still trapped behind the fencing area. - I was

  unable to go and assist them any further due to the large number

  already in attendance.                           '

  A Superintendent then directed a number of us to go down the players'',

  tunnel and circumnavigate that area to assist                            in the rear of the .

  Leppings Lane terracing.

  With other officers                I went to the           rear of the Leppings Lane end of

  the ground,         by this time                I was   completely detached from all of my own

  s e r ia 1

   I- can recall       being       inside the. terracing at the Leppings Lane end.                           1

  am at this time unable t o . r e c o i l e d                  what 1 actually did in this area.

  I can recall         later being                in   another area in that same stand where                the

  ambulances had congregated this area was to the right of the West

  stand running parallel with the river.

  This was where a few bodies had been carried and laid.                               There was a

  number of persons               present who I took to be from the medical                    profession.

  They were all            busy trying to revive the injured.                   I know in my own

  mind that I assisted in the                          removal of a number of bodies,         I can

  recall that all of the ones                          I dealt with were deceased.       My

  recollection will               not at this time allow me to recall much more.

  Tf»is area was heavily -congested with emergency vehicles and large

  numbers of Liverpool                  s up p o r t e r s ;who did not assist the already

  the whole area was           a seethi ng mass of pe r sons , we f ound ,nof ight’

     taking place so we returned to the Leppings Lane end.                                                         ::

  E5y this time the ground was emptying further and we were getting

     similar hostile abuse from a large number of such persons.

     We stood our ground and accepted this abuse, we had no a l t e rn a t i v e ,

     crowd control was totally i m p o s s i b l e .

     As the crowds began to thin out we entered the ground via the

     concertina gates at the Leppings Lane end and made our way on standby

     into the North stand.

Our serial then returned to its static point.At this time the
p assage of fans had now thinned out but th® re               a number
of   Live r p oo l fans still making there way to the ground.

About 1510 as a result of a request by PS SHERRATT WE Returned           into                  -

that this failed to revieve this person.
We were then d i r e c t e d to the pathway into the Spion kop and it was

mind' that l a s s i s t e d in the removal of a number of b o d i e s ,I can recall
S a t all of the ones I dealt with were d e c e as e d . M y recollection ^        #
will not at this time           allow me to recall mu c h more.
This area was heavily congested with emer g a n cy vehicles and large
numbers of Liverpool supporters who did not assist the already                      .
chaotic s f t u il l o n . a large number of them .were obviously very drunk
and were v e r b a ll y abusing every police off i ce r present.
We had a diff i c u l t task in moving these persons to allow for the
movement of the am b u lances carrying away their injured.
None of these so called fans seemed c o n c e r n e d wit h assisting such
m o v e m e n t ,theyt seemed bent on abusing the police.
After a wh i l e a poli c e inspector ordered me into his police van and
we were d e s patched to attend a fight.                                        . ,■
The w h o l e area was a seething mass of p e r s ons,we found no fight taking
 place so we returned to the Lepping Lane end.
 By this time the groung was emptying further and we were                 getting
 similar hostile abuse          from a large number of such persons.
 We stood          our ground and accepted this abuse,we had no alternative,
 crowd control was totally impossible.

As the crowds began to thin out we entered the ground via the concerti
na gates at the Lepping s Lane end and made our way on stand by into

the north stand.
Ithen too k no further part in this i ncident.             ^

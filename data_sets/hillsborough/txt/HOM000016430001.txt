Dear    Lord    J ustice     Taylor


As the M em b er of P a r l i a m e n t for the area which includes
H i l l s b o r o u g h F o otball Ground and the N or th er n General
Hospital, I will                be passing on to you any inform at io n
or l etters which               I think might add to the vast amount
of i nf o rm a ti o n and comment you will receive.

I do b elieve it is important that ordin ar y men and
women have some form of access to the Inquiry, and not
only those who have a ccess to a pro fe ss io na l or organised
line of a p pr o ac h in s i tu at io ns of this sort.

I should w el co m e     your t ho ughts on how this might be done
as many of us w ould want those            in the community around
H il ls bo ro ug h, football s u pp or te rs and those who helped,
to be able to c o n tr ib ut e in ensuring that a similar
tr agedy never happ en s again.

Yours    sin ce re ly




DAVID B L UN K ET T
MP FOR S H E F F IE L D B R I G H T S I D E

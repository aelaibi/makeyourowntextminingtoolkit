    RE:          THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

    Thank you for your letter of 10 June 1997. I have now received a full report on this matter
    from the Chief Crown Prosecutor, CPS Central Casework.

    It may be helpful if I explain the role of the Crown Prosecution Service in relation to the
    Hillsborough tragedy. The Crown Prosecution Service examined a large quantity of
    documents and tapes, following both the inquest and the public enquiry. In addition, we
    have seen documents supplied by representatives of the Hillsborough Family Support Group
    in March 1997. The purpose of considering the material was to ascertain whether there was
    sufficient evidence to invite the police to conduct a further formal investigation.

    As you know, on 30 June 1997 the Home Secretory announced in the House of Commons
    the setting up of an independent scrutiny under Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

    The full terms of reference are:

    "To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium
    on 15 April 1989 which was not available:

                 (a)     To the inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or

                 (b)     To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the
                         purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or

                 (c)         To the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
                             disciplinary matters;




                                   Crown Prosecution Service • Working in the interests of justice
And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of such
significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home Department
of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their attention any
evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to their respective duties;
and to advise whether there is any other action which should be taken in the public interest."

At this stage, the Crown Prosecution Service takes the view that the material so far examined
does not justify asking the police to re-open the investigation.

The Crown Prosecution Service will, however, consider the matter again when the outcome
of the scrutiny is known. We will, of course, assist Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in whatever
way we can and will carefully consider his findings before making any further decisions.

I hope this explanation is helpful to you.

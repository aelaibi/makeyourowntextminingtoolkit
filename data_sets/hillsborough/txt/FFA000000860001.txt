Introduction

This report presents the findings of our investigation into the effects of ID cards on queueing at
Football League grounds.

The objective of the study was to simulate queueing delays in a typical difficult situation that the
scheme would have to deal with. We chose a mid-week evening match, the Arsenal v Liverpool
Littlewoods Cup replay on 9th November, 1988. The final attendance at this match was a capacity
crowd of 54,029 with three to five thousand people locked outside.

We concentrated on people arriving at the Clock end of the ground. Data was provided by Arsenal
F.C. for this area serviced by a total of 17 turnstiles.

We analysed the following scenarios regarding people arriving at the ground:

■   what actually happened (people taking 6 seconds to proceed through a turnstile)

■   the effects of an extra one or two seconds added to turnstile time to allow for card reading
    time

■   the effects of an additional delay of 20 or 40 seconds for problem cards (banned, expired or
    unreadable), assumed to be 4% of the total arrivals
Conclusions

Any delay caused by membership cards may Increase queueing times substantially and many
people may not be admitted until well after the scheduled kick ofF time.

■   The maximum queueing time, which occurs about 15 minutes before the scheduled kick off,
    would increase by between 6 and 25 minutes (Le. from 12 to between 18 and 37 minutes)

■   The extra time required to admit everyone would increase by between 16 and 48 minutes (i.e.
    from 11 to between 27 and 59 minutes)

The following table and graphs present the output for each of the turnstile times that were
modelled:

We cannot determine which of the above scenarios is most accurate until the procedures have been
decided and trials at matches have been carried out, but we believe the estimates above cover the
likely range of possibilities.

Appendix - Simulation Model

The m odel has been developed using the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet package on an IBM personal
computer. The inputs are as follows:

■    number of arrivals per minute

■    number of turnstiles operating

■    normal turnstile time

■   percentage of problem cards

■    problem turnstile time

The findings in this report are based on the assumption that the same number of people would
attend a similar future game, arriving at the same time as they do now, regardless of
implementation of an ID card scheme, Le. it ignores the possibility of lower attendances or earlier
arrivals.

We estimated the initial queue and the pattern of arrivals for each minute after the turnstiles
opened based on the available data, with a peak between 30 and 15 minutes before scheduled kick-
off. We assumed that the arrival rate is evenly spread between each of the 17 turnstiles modelled,
and that all of the turnstiles would be open when required.

We observed from the data that the turnstile time during the peak of arrivals was 6 seconds, Le. 10
per minute per turnstile. Hus figure has been used as the "normal" turnstile time, with no delays
when proceeding into the ground. We have simulated turnstile times of 6, 7 and 8 seconds, with
additional different delays of 0,20 and 40 seconds for problem cards, as we do not know which type
of card will be used and hence the time to admit someone through a turnstile. We have not
allowed for any possible congestion (e.g. when questioning potential offenders or from major
computer delays over and above the one or two seoonds)

Using the above inputs the model calculates the number of people arriving and served in each
minute and hence the number of people still queueing and the time spent queueing.

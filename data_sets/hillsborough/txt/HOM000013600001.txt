HILLSBOROUGH: PAYMENT OF SPECIAL GRANT


Thank you for copying to me your note for the record dated 4
September about the above.     Although the West Midlands Police
Authority are slow in submitting further invoices to South
Yorkshire in respect of the costs of their investigations and the
first tranche of special grant due to South Yorkshire is relatively
small, it seems to me imperative, due to the sensitivity of the
Hillsborough case, to defuse concern over the financial aspects by
making the special payment available as quickly as we can.

Secondly, delaying special payment until November is bound to
exacerbate the argument over interest payments particularly if
further invoices are sent to South Yorkshire soon.    West Midlands
are already threatening to refuse to fund further investigations by
the   fo rce  into   criminal   and   complaints   and  discipline
investigations   and this has been publicised       (eg to Police
Complaints Authority) and is likely to cause further alarm.     Our
best answer to West Midlands and South Yorkshire police authorities
or MPs would be that we stand ready to fulfil our part of the
bargain.    I would be grateful if, for these reasons, you would
press Treasury again for their agreement to make the special
payment available to South Yorkshire as soon as they pay the bill.

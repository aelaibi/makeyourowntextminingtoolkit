's t a t e m e n t        MP T HICKS - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
 Myself, my wife and 2 daughters obtained our tickets from Anfield

 with the 2 girls getting standing tickets on vouchers from their

 Kop Season Ticket.                My wife was allocated a seat ticket, and I

  myself was given a standing ticket, - by the allocation based on

  the Main Stand Season Ticket Serial Number allocation.



  We travelled together in my car to Sheffield making only 1 stop a.

  the Woodall Services just after Junction 30 on the Ml.                     We then

   proceeded along the M1 and followed the Police signs at the first

   junction, asking us to proceed to the next.               We encountered a long

   tailback          (1-2       miles   in nearside lane)but I continued in the

   centre lane towards the front of the queue, where I was able to

   leave the motorway down the dual carriageway section of the slip

   road. (Time approximately 12.10 pm).               We then followed the signed

    route to Hillsborough and when we got to the Ground, I travelled

    along the AST Penistone Road towards the city until I was able to

    turn round and return to the car park which was being provided in

    the corner of the large park between the A61 Penistone Road and the

    A616 Parkside Road.             *4e parked the car at approximately 12.45 pm

    and we had the picnic lunch which we had brought with us.



     At about 1 .40 pm we left the car, walked along Parkside Road to the

     Leppings Lane end and arranged to rendezvous with ray wife outside

     the small tobacconists to the left of the approach area.                    In the

     bridge          approach   area,   I would   estimate   perhaps   6 - 1 0   Police
Officers were present (no Police horses) and it was all fairly calm

with only small numbers of fans milling aroun<-.



Tistween the car and arrival at the turnstiles, we were asked by

about 3 people if we had any spare tickets - normal for such a big

game.


Other than in the approach area,         I only remember seeing Police

Officers (2 or 3) near a small Police kiosk on Parkside Road.              I

do not remember seeing any mounted Police at all.



 At about 1 .55 pm, my 2 daughters and I went through the turnstiles,

 our tickets being taken, split and the "retain” section returned.

 Upon entering the yard beyond, I remember small numbers of people

 milling around, with 1 Policeman near our turnstile and perhaps 1 -

 2 more in the yard area.     There were about 2 - 3 stewards in the

 general area plus 2 selling programmes to the left of the tunnel.



 The    "standing’* sign   above   the   tunnel   was   the   only   guidance

 visible/given to us and there was no indication that it was not the

  only way to the terraces.    My daughters proceeded down the tunnel,

  and I bought 2 programmes from the venders to the left of the

  tunnel.


  I wanted a-cup of coffee and observed a refreshment kiosk to the

  right of the tunnel - I believe under the stairway into the seating
area.    I queued for a few minutes and purchased my cup of coffee.

It was this act that enabled me to see it was possible to go around

the base of the West Stand into the corner Terraces between the

West and South Stands.      This area was sparsely occupied with a wide

choice of positions, 1 took up a position about 2nd barrier from

the rear in front of the floodlight tower and to the left of the

Police box. (See exhibit A).         I stood in this position drinking my

coffee, reading the programme and listening for Team news etc on

the small transistor radio I had in my pocket.



A little before the kick-off,         (approximately 14.50 pm, I noticed

there were large numbers of people in the centre sections (I now

understand these to be known as Pens Numbers 3 and                  4).    From im­

position on the terrace,          I could quite     clearly see the dividing

 fence and could see several people crushed against this side fence,

 many clearly in some distress.           One in particular, an old man, I

 believe wearing a light grey coat or possibly suit, had his eyes

 closed.   People were being pulled from the rear of the Pens up into

 the    seating area   of   the West      Stand.    People were      also being

 pulled/assisted    over    the    dividing   fence    and   some   youths    were

 scrambling     over    the       pitch    side    fence     but    were     being

 repelled/arrested by Police Officers on the pitch.



 A senior Police Officer was standing on              the landing ofthe Police

 Box, I would estimate some 10 feet away from my position and I

  called several times to him trying to attract his attention to t-he
crushing.    (I believe he had gold braid on the peak of his cap and
was wearing a light coloured anorak).            He ignored me completely and

continued to observe the scene for some minutes until he walked

down the steps and round the segregation barrier underneath the

South Stand.     (I believe he was the Officer who ran onto the pitch

and told the Referee to stop the game some few minutes later).



A television cameraman with a shoulder held video camera (I think

the one shown in Exhibit "A") took up a similar position but after

many shouts from the crowd (and possibly some coin throwing) he

then left the landing and went back under the South Stand.



Another Police Officer who I believe I can recognise facially (I

believe to have had black braid on the peak of his cap) took up a

 similar    position   on    the   s t e p s /landing.        I   again       implored him

 several times that people were being crushed and couldn t he do

 something to help.         He initially ignored me and then after say 3

 of   4 calls to him,       looked down at me and said "Oh,                      shut your

 fucking    rattle",   and     then    continued         to    look      in    the    general

 direction of Pens 3 and 4,


 Both   myself   and   the    man     standing    on      my      left   were        extremely

 concerned as I knew this was roughly where my daughters were and

  this man said he had a son in the same section.                             More and more

  people were beginning to climb out of the section and I became

  increasingly concerned for my daughtecs' safety.
The game had just kicked off and a Police cordon of 2 - 3 men deep

were put in an arc around the 2 central Pens behind the goal and

it was obvious that their purpose was to prevent anybody climbing

over    the   barrier.    It   is my    belief        that    several   people were

actually held back and *11 the signs were that the Police Officers

had been given instructions to contain the people within the Pen

area.    Officers along the fence appeared to be pushing people back/

whereas their colleagues standing in the arc were just standing

watching , many with their arms crossed.              I would estimate this took

place for some 5 - 1 9     minutes, bringing the time to approximately

15.05 - 15.10.



 It was during this time that the Officer m                     the light coloured

 anorak ran onto the pitch aivl spoke to the Referee, whereupon the

 game was stopped. (I know this to be 15.06).



 I also noticed a large number           (100 - 150 approximately)             Police

 Officers emerged from the opposite corner and they took up lines

 across the pitch at the "centre" and along the North Stand.



 X started to move down the terraces towards tne side fence oo try

 to find my daughters and to render what assistance I could.

 As I got approximately half way down, X saw the limp form O l my

 youngest daughter Victoria,           being passed over the barrier.                 I

 therefore      changed   direction    to       the   pitcA   access    gate   i.rom my

  section (which was manned by a Policeman) and pushed my way onto


                                            5
the pitch.


X came upon my 2 daughter-3 Victoria. niid. oarah, laid on the pitch

just at the touchline slightly to the right of the goal.              Sarah was

receiving    assistance   from 1 man and he,          myself   plus   2 others

started to render mouth to mouth resuscitation to both of them.

One of the men attending to Sarah called for suction {I have since

discovered that this was Dr C K FIsnley ), while we continued to

resuscitate my daughters X shouted my daughters names into uxieir

ears and called to Police/Medics several times for suction but none

was available.       We then continued taking turns at mouth to mouth

resuscitation.       One man was called away to help a friend and it

therefore     left    myself   and   1    other     giving   mouth    to   mouth

resuscitation on Victoria with Dr Flenley and a man in a cnequered

 shirt,   (who was apparently an off-duty Policeman from the crowd)

 rendering assistance to Sarah.          There was no medical equipment or

 assistance available to us througnout this time.              »Te continued to

 give mouth to mouth resuscitation, taking turns for some 10 minutes

 or more, whereupon the first ambulance (the one trapped behind the

 goal) tried to get past us catching my toes             I knelt and the foot

 of someone else laid on the pitch.



 This ambulance had taken up a ridiculous position with its movement

 onto/off the ground grossly impaired.            Presumably this was to avoid

 cutting up the playing surface.
We continued to attempt to resuscitate my daughters for a few more

minutes when a fireman cante over carrying an oxygen bottle, with a

face mask attached {smoke-inhalation device?) but this was no good

as we could not get the girls to breath unaided and the pressure

in the bottle/regulator was insufficient to force oxygen into their

lungs.


A second ambulance came onto the pitch area and stopped adjacent

to us*     We agreed to put Sarah and Victoria into this ambulance.

Two of us put Victoria into this second ambulance and were about

to turn around and lift Sarah into it, when a third group of people

put in a man who had to go onto the floor.      I then was faced with

the awful choice of leaving Sarah,      who I was assured would be

placed in the next ambulance which was apparently coming.



The ambulance started to move away so I rejoined Victoria and along

w ith al                       bontiaued to give mouth to mouth.



 In the ambulance was the ambulance attendant, a woman, myself and

                  There was a young man in his 20's on the floor, who

 did in fact have a throat tube in his mouth, but the ambulance man

 said was dead     within a minute or   so of   us driving off.    The

 Ambulance Attendant and the woman attended a person on the other

 seat, but he was also pronounced dead by the ambulance man.       The

 ambulance, man and myself continued artificial respiration w i t h __

              holding an oxygen bottle and we continued throughout the
time   it   took   us   to   reach the Northern General            Hospital.    The

ambulance man was of the opinion he felt a faint pulse on a couple

of occasions during this journey.



Victoria was then taken straight into the Casualty section and

because     they   thought    there   was       possibly    some   lj-fe,   received

immediate medical attention from a team of Doctors and Nurses aided

by                       I observed for some 2 or 3 minutes, whereupon

I was ask<3d to leave the area and was taken into a side room.

Obviously conditions were extremely hectic with people and bodies

arriving very quickly.          The Hospital was well equipped and I was

given the impression that all possible care was being taken with

people who were believed to have a chance.



After about 10 minutes,         I was informed by :                         that my

daughter had been pronounced dead.              I thanked                   for his

assistance and also apologised for the verbal abuse I had poured

upon him as a representative of the Police throughout our time in

the ambulance and at the Hospital.               Once I was told that Victoria

was dead, I then went around the Hospital trying to locate Sarah

on the grounds that I had been told she would be in an ambulance

 following closely behind.



 After some 30 minutes of futile searching,                  I was taken to the

 physiotherapy Department by a Psychiatric Nurse                                 who

 had come on duty to help with the problems.                  I was kept in this


                                            3
area for some half to three quarters of an hour and on a couple of
occasions                      tried to establish whether Sarah was indeed

at this Hospital or not.             Eventually, I was taken round to the

section of the Hospital where the bodies of the deceased were being

attended to.          I gave a description of Sarah to the Police Officers

on duty     and       it appeared    that   they had   "a young     un-identified

female" who could possibly have been the Sarah.                 A Police Officer

went into the room and brought out a Swatch wacca ymich I felt at

the time was the saiae as that of my daughter Sarah.                   After about

10 or 15 minutes, I was taken across to the Hospital Mortuary to

identify who I expected to be Sarah.               It is now a matter of record

that this was indeed Victoria who somehow had become detached from

her   label when I at first               identified her on admission to         the

Hospital.         Despite     the unnecessary      distress   this caused      to me

 personally       I    did   not   feel   bitter   towards    the   Hospital   as   I

 considered they were attempting to cope with the extreme pressure

 that was put upon them.



 Myself, Miss Bennett and a Reverend returned to the main Hospital

 building and I was retained for perhaps another half an hour or so.

 Throughout this time, I was trying to establish the location of my

 wife and Sarah.             I explained again      that Sarah’s condition was

 obviously        serious when      we were    on the pitch and       that she was

 supposedly "in the next ambulance” ,                I was then told that some

 casulaties- had been taken to the Royal Hallamsnire Hospital and

  that Sarah could be there (as could my wife).
Communications       were    difficult    and   everbody,   both   medical   and

administrative, were at full stretch and all telephone lines were

jammed.     I was     told    that 11    people were dead at the Northern

General Hospital and that no other females were there.                 Further

discussions took place and it was agreed that I should go to the

Hallamshire Hospital and if my wife arrived at the Northern General

Hospital,    I would be contacted and she would not be told about

Victoria's death until I returned to meet her.



At about 6 o ’clock,         I was taken by a young female Padre

            and                   to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.         Upon

arrival,    I gave a full description to the staff and they then

circulated it to see whether Sarah had indeed been admitted.                    I

had to wait in the general reception area for some time, attended

initially by I                   land nurses from the Hallamshire Hospital.

At one point, a man in a suit              stood on a desk and called         for

attention.        He read out a list of ’’patients" who had been taken to

the Northern General Hospital.            He called out Victoria's name and

as I knew she       was      dead, I broke down and began to         cry.



A nurse took        me into a side room and tried to console me               and

 assured me       they were attempting to locate Sarah and that some

 people had been taken to Barnsley Hospital.                I said I suspected

 the worst because of Sarah’s condition on the pitch.

 A Police Officer also took full details of the location of my car

 and my wife and assured me he would try to locate and re-unite me
with my wife before she was advised of the death of Victoria.



At about 19.45,         X received a message         to say that my wife had

arrived at the Northern General Hospital and I was then taken back

there by a "Cruse Councillor” (________________________ ^ her cac.

At approximately 20.00 hours, my wife and I were re-united in the

foyer ot the Northern General Hospital, where X was appalled to

find she had been advised of the death of Victoria had been refused

permission to see her body and had been told I was with a female

.it the Hallamshire Hospital whom she had assumed was Sarah,                      She

was distraught when I was unable to confirm Sarah's whereabouts.




 X made formal protests to both Hospital and Police Authorities and

 demanded our rights to see our child.               After some 5 or 10 minutes

 we were advised by the Assistant Matron that our daughter's body

 was no longer on the Hospital premises, and at police instructions,

 had been taken back to the Hillsborough Ground,



 I   protested        strongly   at   this      callous    and   unnecessary      act,

 especially as I had already identified her twice, latterly at rest

 in the hospfcial mortuary.               My    protestations were    met by      off­

 handedness      by    the   Police   Officer      (who   claimed   it was   at    the

 Coroners instruction) and sympathetically by the Assistant Matron

  {who had    tear     filled    eyes).        We were advised that     there were

  "several   an-   identified people at the ground” and we should return
there.


Nobody advised us how many casualties/bodies we could expect to

find, no transport was offereed and we were left to make our own

way there.



In the accompaniment of a                          m d Mrs

                            drove us back to Hillsborough in his car,

whereupon we arrived at the entrance to the Gynasium/Temporary

Mortuary at approximately 22.00 hours.           We were refused entrance

by an extremely callous, rude and unbelievably insensitive Police

Officer in charge on the gate.       He was a Ranking Officer (I believe

Inspector)    and   regretfully-   X did not take his name.            He was

totally callous to my wife and I and this can be borne out by the

2   independent     witnesses   aforesaid.      After   considerable   heated

argument with him,      I compromised,       agreed to go to the park and

collect my car, whereupon he would then allow us access upon our

 return.



 The 4 of us plus a Police Constable walked back along Penis hone

 Road to the corner of the park where I discovered the gate was

 still open and my Granada car was the only one remaining on the car

 oark.     We then drove back to the Ground gates and parked outside.




 Further remonstrations with aforesaid Police Officer took place and


                                      12
we were again refused admission.              In addition he upset my wife

further by saying we had no rights m             tn© matterr that the girls

were the property of the Coroner, and would have to undergo a Post

Mortem.    His attitude to us, and handling of us, was unbelievably

callous-       I wish to make a formal complaint about this Officer when

he can be identified.       I gave my business card to a Norwegian Press

Photographer who took photographs during my remonstrations with the

Police Officer.        Should I receive contact from him, then I will

make these available.        The best that the Police Officer could do

was to offer for us to sit in a Police van for 30 minutes.                This

I refused to do and said that I insisted that having been sent

there by the Hospital, knowing full well 1 daughter was dead and

suspecting the fate of the other, I demanded to be allowed access.

After a few minutes, two CID Officers {aged in their mid 30's             with

 one in a brown leather jacket) took charge            qj-   the situation and

 guided my wife, myself and our 2 Social Worker colleagues into an

 anteroom.       This Officer is to be commended for his handling of an

 extremely difficult situation.         He did explain that the formalities

 were not quite completed and he did so in a sensitive and caring

 manner.


 After some 10 or 15 minutes wait, wewere shown              into a room at the

 side     of    the   gymnasium   and   asked    to view     some81   Polaroid

 photographs which were pinned to a board.             My wife said "Oh, my

 God, how-can there be so many dead!" he replied               I m afraid that

  this isn’t the end       of it,       Love .

                                         13
We quickly    identified      the photograph of our              youngest     daughter

victoria/    bat    .Initially    were    unable      to   see    that   of     Sarah*

Naturally, we hoped at this time she may have been a survivor and

at one of the other Hospitals.            We were asked to look again and

whereupon we found what we beleived to be the photograph of our

elder daughter (Reference No C4).              Again the CID Officer in the

brown jacket asked us would we please wait for a few minutes and

would we prefer our daughters bodies to be brought out together or

independently.       My wife and I requested that they be brought out

together.     This    was   carried      out   with   a    reasonable degree        of

sensitivity   and    formal      identification of our           2 daughters      took

place.   During the identification/ my wife cuddled both and noticed

that Sarah's body was still warm - calling out "She's still warm -

 are you sure she's dead I".         I consolled her but also.noticed the

distinct difference between Victoria’s body and Sarah's.



After a few minutes to say our farewells to our 2 daughters we were

ushered to a series of tables set up at one end of the gymnasium,

whereupon we were interviewed by, I believe 2 male and 2 female

Police Officers, and I was asked to swear out a statement.                          We

also took receipt of the personal effects of Victoria which were

 in a white plastic bag from the Hospital.



At the same time, I gave a description of a brown leather jacket

 (American Flyer type) that Sarah had been wearing upon entry to the

 Ground but was not wearing when I last saw her on the pitch.                    After
some   10     - 15   minutes   delay,   (coinciding with     the time    I was

swearing out the statement) the jacket was retrieved and returned

to us.      upon examination of the pockets, all of Sarah’s personal

effects, money, cheque book, wallet, cards, bus passed and I.D.

appeared to be intact.         We therefore took possession of the jacket

and signed the necessary forms for the Police Officers.                 My wife

and I were given a cup of tea and the Social Workers escorted us

from the Mortuary.



We were given offers of accommodation from various Clergy and the

2    Social    Workers   but   expressed   a   desire   to   return   home   to

Middlesex.      A half-hearted promise of a Police driver to drive us

back was made but I declined and preferred to drive myself.                  My

wife and I returned home, arriving home at some 2.30 am Sunday

morning.       Following release at lunch time of the first casualty

list which contained the names of our 2 daughters -vnong 14 others,

we were inundated with telephone calls and visits from the Press.

It is questionable whether full address details should have been

given in that first casualty list.



I would summarsize my assessment o£ what I experienced as follows



1      The Ground/approach areas policing/stewarding was low key -

       even casual, with little guidance and control being excerted.

2      There are a limited number of turnstiles through which to go.

 3     Once through the turnstiles, the only sign visible was above
the tunnel, giving a natural inclination towards >;his route

in - especially if you were         in a hurry.

Police/Stewards failed to notice          the build up in thecentrax

pens.
They did not distribute the         fans to the side areas.

Senior Officer ignored (and         many others) pleas to help those

in the central pens.
It was obvious the Police totally misread events - believing

a     pitch   invasion/trouble      was   underway   and     mounted     a

restraining rather than rescue operation.
The rescue commenced some 10 minutes too late and was totally

dis-organised,      ~ The    death toll   being   much     nigher   as   a

consequence.
The     fences   were   such they    prevented    escape -   even   with

assistance ov«*r the top.

The single gate was of little use otherthan to those in the

 near vicinity and it was opened too late.

 Medical assistance and equipment was inadequate/non-existant.

 Ambulance/Fire assistance was far too late arriving.

                        DEFENCE OF THE FIRST DEFENDANT




1.   Upon Discovery of the Letters of Administration Paragraph

     1 will be admitted.



2.   Paragraph         2 is admitted.     The Police Officers    included

     members of the Merseyside            and Nottingham Constabulary.



3.   Paragraph         3 is admitted.



4.   Paragraph         4 is admitted.



5.   Paragraph         5 is admitted.
6.     Paragraph 6 is admitted.



7 &8   These Paragraphs are admitted.



9.     The allegations against the First Defendant of fault and

       causation and negligence and breach of statutory duty are

       each denied.     They are made with hindsight.   The plans and

       actions of the First Defendant were reasonable in the

       circumstances.



       PLANNING CIRCUMSTANCES



       (a)   The ground was chosen as suitable by the Football

             Association.



       (b)   A Safety Certificate granted by the Third Defendant

             was in force.



       (c)   On other occasions similar Police plans had been

             successful.



       (d)   The ground was in regular use which had proved to be

             safe with variable numbers of spectators.



       (e)   No adverse comment about the safety of Policing on

             other similar occasions had been made by any of the

             Second Third or Fourth Defendants or by the Football

             Association or Liverpool Football Club or Nottingham

             Forest Football Club.



                                 - 2 -
(f)    The introduction of pens after the 1981 crushing

       incident was believed by each of the Defendants and

       the Football Association to have solved the

       problem.



(g)    The system of "self-levelling" of spectators had

       been successful.



(h)    The Popplewell recommendations had been heeded.



(i)    Most spectators were expected to be good humoured

       and sensible.



(j)    The main Police function was expected to be the

       prevention of crime and control of disorder if

       necessary,



ACTION CIRCUMSTANCES



(i)    About 800 Police were deployed on the match

       operation.



(ii)   Experienced Officers were in charge.



(iii) Disorder would have been likely to result from an

       attempt to hold up the crowd at a point away from

       the ground.



(iv)   The decision to open Gate C was correct.
      (v)    The "self-levelling" policy was expected to work

             successfully as on previous occasions.



      (vi)   When the over-crowding emergency was recognised then

             the crush was relieved as quickly as possible.



10.   If the First Defendant is liable (denied) then

      contribution or indemnity is claimed against the Second

      Defendant and Fourth Defendants under Civil Liability

      (Contribution) Act 1978. on the grounds pleaded in the

      Statement of Claim.



11.   The injuries loss and damage are denied.



12.   On the ground of public policy this action does not lie

      against the First Defendant for the reasons given in Hill

      v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire 1988 2 W.L.R. 1049.



13.   Except as above the facts and matters in the Statement of

      Claim are each denied.

                                 DEFENCE OF THE THIRD DEFENDANTS


          Save that the Third Defendants make no admissions as to the existence

          nature and extent of the duty of care alleged in paragraph 5 of the

          Statement of Claim, paragraphs I to 8 inclusive of the Statement of

          Claim are admitted.
It is denied that the said accident and resultant injuries to and death

of the deceased were- caused by the negligence of the Third Defendants

their servants or agents whether as alleged in paragraph 10 of the

Statement of Claim-     Each and every allegation of negligence on the part

of the Third Defendants their servants or agents is denied.



It is expressly denied that any act or default of the Third Defendants

their servants or agents was causative of the death or injury of the

deceased.



The Safety Certificate applicable to the Hillsborough Stadium at the

material time did contain adequate provision for the reasonable safety

of spectators.   The events which preceded and caused the death and injury

of the deceased were wholly outside the control of the Third Defendants

and could not. have been prevented by any provision or stipulation in the

Safety Certificate which might reasonably have been foreseen by these

Defendants.



Without prejudice to the generality of the matters set out in paragraphs

3 and 4 of the Defence the Third Defendants will aver:




(a)     That designating crowd capacities for a pen which was not a

        self-contained area and in respect of which spectators would be

        free to come and go throughout an event would have no practical

        meaning or effect.




(b)     That any capacity that might have been fixed for the said pen could

        not have been enforced so long as spectators were free to move
                                       -

        between pens.
(c)   That the exit gates in the perimeter fences were adequate for

      their intended purpose.



(d)   That the Safety Certificate did make    adequate provision for

      stewarding.   The deployment of stewards and their proper areas

      of responsibility were matters for the Second Defendants in

      consultation with the First Defendant.



(e)   That meetings of the Officer Working    Party were regularly convened



(f)   That the provision of signposting to    control the directional

      flow of spectators within the stadium was a matter for the Second

      Defendants in consultation with the First Defendant.     Signposting

      which might be suitable for one event such as a normal football

      league match where supporters of the "away” team might

      conveniently be accommodated in only one pen might not be suitable

      for another event such as a semi-final game at which many more

      spectators might be expected to attend.     It is the responsibility

      of the ground managers (the Second Defendants) to decide in

      respect of each event the nature of the signposting controlling

      the directional flow of spectators within the ground that is

      best suited to that particular event.



(g)   The decision to remove barrier 144 was based upon the

      recommendation of the Fourth Defendants who in turn had

      considered and approved a suggestion advanced by the First

      Defendant, with regard to the removal of the said barrier on the

      grounds of crowd safety.    It was not reasonably foreseeable by the

      Third Defendants that such an influx of spectators upon an already



                                 -3-
        full pen might occur as happened on 15th April 1989.    It was

        reasonable for the Third Defendants to believe that the crowd

        levels within the said pen and the rate of ingress thereto would

        at all times be properly monitored and stewarded by servants or

        agents of the First and/or Second Defendants.   No adverse

        consequences of the removal of the said barrier had been brought

        to the attention of the Third Defendants from the date of its

        removal until the 15th April 1989 notwithstanding the fact that

        semi-final football matches had been played at Hillsborough during

        the said period and that the Fourth Defendants had provided a

        ground safety certificate during the said period.    Notwithstanding

        the matters aforesaid it is denied that the removal of barrier    144

        caused the death or injury of the deceased.


                                                                                N
The said accident was caused by the negligence of the First Defendants their

servants or agents and/or by the negligence of the Second Defendants their

servants or agents.

                       Particulars of Negligence
                of First Defendant His Servants or Agents



        The Third Defendants repeat herein sub-paragraphs 9(a) and

        9(c) to 9(w) of the allegations of negligence against the

        First Defendant in the Statement of Claim.




                       Particulars of Negligence
             of Second Defendants Their Servants or Agents



        The Third Defendants repeat herein sub-paragraphs 9(a) and

       9(b); 9(d) to 9(1) inclusivef^9(n) and 9(p) to 9(r) inclusive
                 of the allegations of negligence against the Second Defendants

                 in the Statement of Claim.



7.      No admissions are made as to the existence nature and effect of any

        injuries sustained by the deceased as a result of the accident prior to

        h.is death.   The nature and extent of the loss and damage sustained by

        the Plaintiff is not admitted; that such loss or damage was caused by the

        Third Defendants is denied.

                REPLY TO DEFENCE OF FIRST DEFENDANTS



1.     Save as in so far as the same consists of admissions, the

Plaintiff takes issue with the First Defendants upon his Defence
h erein .




2.          Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing the

Plaintiff expressly avers:



(i)         in reply to paragraph 2 of the Defence, that any such police

officers who were members of the Merseyside and Nottingham

Constabularies, were at all material times acting under the

direction and control of the First Defendant and/or under the

direction and control of the police officers who as members of the

First Defendant's Force were acting under the First Defendant's

direction and control;



(ii)        in reply to paragraphs 9(f) and (g) of the Defence, that the

introduction of radial fences and pens on the West Terrace in fact

exacerbated the problem of ensuring an even spread of spectators

throughout the Terrace so as to avoid crushing.       The Plaintiff

repeats sub-paragraphs (b) and (f) of the Particulars of Negligence

as against the First Defendant contained in paragraph 9 of her

Statement of Claim.       The Plaintiff avers that the First Defendant

and/or the police officers under his control negligently failed to

appreciate that by reason of the existence of the radial fences, the

projecting walls at the rear of pens three and four and the size and

position of the gates in the radial fences, the crowd required

assistance whether from the police and/or stewards or otherwise, to

enable an even spread to be achieved;



(iii)       that, in reply to paragraph 12 of the Defence, the reasoning

in Hill -y- Chief Constable of West Yorkshire has no application to
the Plaintiff's cause of action herein.        Hill concerns (as the

Plaintiff’s action does not) the existence or otherwise of a general

duty of care owed to individual members of the public by the police

in the course of carrying out their function of controlling and

suppressing crime, to identify and apprehend an unknown criminal;

and the reason why if such duty does exist, public policy requires

that the police should not be liable to anyone who suffers injury

through the activities of a criminal whom the police in breach of

such duty have failed to apprehend.

         MR. HYTNER: In this application, I appear for the Plaintiff
             with my learned friend Mr. King. The First Defendants -
A            the Football Club - are represented by Mr. Glasgow and Mr.
              Catchpole; the Second Defendants by Mr. Woodward and Mr.
              Payne.

         MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                    The Chief Constable is the First Defendant.

         MR. HYTNER:                Yes.

®         MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                   Would you like to     start again?

         MR. HYTNER: I think I must. The First Defendant - the police
              - is represented by Mr. Woodward and Mr. Payne; the Second
              Defendants - the Club - by Mr. Glasgow and Mr. Catchpole;
              the Third Defendants - the City Council - by Mr. Maxwell
              and Mr. Murray; and the Fourth Defendants - Dr. Eastwood -
p            by Mr. Fenwick, though as will appear, he is in the
              background led by Mr. Tilson.

                        I take it that your Lordship knows the background, and
                   although this is a hearing in open court, it is not
                   necessary for me to go through the whole of the background
                   facts.

 D        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                   Certainly not.

         MR. HYTNER:                Can I start with all the matters that I propose to
             raise?

         MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Are you going to from the order                                made by Mr.
             Justice Steyn, or from some other document?

 E        MR. HYTNER:   In the order ofthe directions made.  Can I deal
              with what I see at the moment as those matters thatare    in
              contention?

         MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                    Yes.

         MR. HYTNER: The first matter which exercises the Plaintiff
             very considerably is the date of trial. Can I make this
 F          absolutely plain because it may be that Mr. Maxwell has not
             fully taken this on board: there are four defendants.    The
             history of the litigation is simple. The Plaintiff
             initially sued the city council, and the police and, the
             statement of claim was actually served. We then came
             before Mr. Justice Steyn - the club and the police - and it
             was then indicated to us that Dr. Eastwood and the council
 r          were going to put the blame on one or other of the


                                                          1   .

         defendants, and that there were third party proceedings
         going to be instituted.

              My Lord, the view we took was that it would simplify
         the pleadings and would speed the litigation if we then, as
         it were, took back'our statement of claim and re-served it
         not in amended form, but in original form, adding the two
         further parties as primary defendants, and so that the
         pleadings could go from there.

              Everybody thought that that was a good idea, including
         Mr. Justice Steyn. But it must be appreciated that when
         you see those pleadings, which on the face of them make it
         appear as though the primary case of the Plaintiff is
         against four defendants cumulatively. On the alternative,
         that the thrust of the Plaintiff’s case is against the
         first two defendants, and what we wish is if the other two
         defendants are going to blame the second two, we adapt the
         allegations accordingly: that is our position as against
         the council and Dr. Eastwood.

              In those circumstances, my Lord, the view that we took
         was this: that without being over-confident or arrogant
         about our case, looking at the pleadings, thus looking at
         the defence and what the defence say, it is if not
         inconceivable, almost inconceivable, that the Plaintiff
         will lose altogether; that is that they will not succeed
         against one or more defendant. We therefore have the
         adopted approach from the outset that if there was one
         defendant, and there were no defence, we could go by way of
         Rule 111. There is no procedure if there is no defence.
         We could then go for our damages to be seized my Lord.

              It is a chink in the procedures of the court through
         no fault of the court, but through the fault of Parliament
         that where you have a Plaintiff who has a case against one
         of two or more defendants, there is no means of that
         Plaintiff getting his damages by way of order 14, or by way
         of summary judgment; and therefore, the view taken by the
         Plaintiff was this: that it would be a scandal if in those
         circumstances the procedures of the court are not enabling
         the Plaintiff to get this case on fairly quickly.

              My Lord, I have to say that when this view was
         initially put, there were only two potential defendants,
         and Mr. Glasgow on behalf of the Club made it perfectly
         plain, as I think it is only fair to say, that the Club had
         been indicating throughout the enquiry that they wished to
         co-operate to get a very speedy hearing, because the view
         taken by the Club, is that taken by the Plaintiff, that all
         the facts have now been ventilated --

   MR. JUSTICE ROSE: The situation is that before Mr. Justice
       Steyn Plaintiff - and the Second Defendants then joined -
       contemplated trial either immediately after Easter or very
       soon after Easter.

       MR. HYTNER: That is right. I start from there. Two things
           have now happened. The first is that      Well three
           things. The first is the date has been moved to June.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              By whom?

        MR. HYTNER: I do not know, but it is now said that it is not
            Easter; it is June

B       MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              By whom?

        MR. HYTNER:         I think the Court.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE: The Court has not said anything.               We are
            here to consider today.

C       MR. HYTNER:         I am grateful.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              The Court certainly never said that.

        MR. HYTNER: I am very grateful and pleased to hear that,
            because so far as we are concerned, we would still press
            for Easter.

D                  The two things, as I understand it, are now going to
              be said: one by the First Defendants, and one by the Fourth
              Defendants.

                   The Fourth Defendant wishes the case to be put over to
              next October.  I leave Mr. Fenwick to deal with that, and I
              leave Mr. Glasgow to put his case on that. I anticipate
              that he will support me in my application for a very speedy
E             trial.

                  My Lord, the next matter is rather more serious
             because it has been raised this morning for the first time
             by Mr. Woodward.  I make no complaint about him.  It is the
             first time, no doubt, that he has been able to raise it.
             He does not want the case to be put off until October. The
„            South Yorkshire Police do not want the case on at all.
             They wish to apply for a stay of the proceedings.

                   My Lord, I make no bones about this. One has to be
              very careful of using the term "the police" because that is
              a term which includes the police, for example, who did the
              investigative enquiry on Hillsborough. The policemen and
              policewomen --
G
        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Go on, Mr. Hytner.

        MR. HYTNER: The South Yorkshire Police through their
            representative, my Lord, if one reads the report of Lord
            Justice Taylor, it is perfectly plain that they have done
            nothing to speed enquiries; to assist enquiries; or
            anything of the sort. As I understand it, it is now going
H           to be said that their enquiries into this litigation - the


                                                  3 .

i




    A            civil litigation - are going to be hindered in some way by
                 the pending disciplinary proceedings, and the pending
                 criminal proceedings, if they are brought against one two
                 or more police officers in Sheffield.

                      My Lord, the submissions that I make (and I anticipate
                 they are going to be supported by Mr. Glasgow) are these:
                 firstly this is simply an extension of the obstructive
    B            attitude shown by the same party throughout the enquiry.
                 Secondly, all the relevant evidence has already been
                 collected; and indeed not only collected by the West
                 Midlands Police who investigated, but by Lord Justice
                 Taylor in public.   It is, in our submission, inconceivable
                 that it could now be said, unless South Yorkshire Police
                 will say they failed to produce relevant evidence to Lord
                 Justice Taylor, that there is no relevant evidence which
    C            cannot now be obtained because some police officers are
                 being investigated.

                       My Lord, the submission that I make, and think with
                  support, is this: that any investigation at the moment
                  being made will be to interpret the facts already
                  investigated publicly and considered by Lord Justice
                  Taylor.
    D
           MR. JUSTICE ROSE: In any event, questions from those can be
               put before whoever tries this case.

           MR. HYTNER: My Lord, what we would consent to concede is this:
                that if anything is going to be said, or might be said, in
               interlocutory proceedings which could affect the mind of a
               jury in the future hearing some criminal proceedings of
    k          which we do not yet know, so far as we are concerned, and I
               suspect so far as Mr. Glasgow is concerned, we should
                consent to interlocutory proceedings being in chambers
                rather than open court. We say it would be indefensible if
                the police can say now that the proceedings should be
                stayed with this caveat: if it is accepted realistically by
                those who are conducting the,litigation on behalf of the
    p          four parties that at the end of the day it is a question of
               who pays the Plaintiffs, and not whether the Plaintiffs are
                going to be paid at all, it would save a great deal of time
                and money in costs, and would be far better for the
                Plaintiffs, if the four defendants were jointly to say "We
                consent to summary judgment. The Plaintiffs can go away
                and we can then at our leisure determine which of us is
                liable, and in what proportions". But my Lord unless that
    G          is done, I propose a speedy trial.

                       My Lord, going on, because I think it is only right I
                  should indicate that in our submission it is possible for a
                  speedy trial in this case. Mr. Justice Steyn made a
                  suggestion. It was not a direction, and he was very
                  careful not to elevate it, but we now ask for a direction.
                  The direction that we seek follows his suggestion that the
    H            facts found by Lord Justice Taylor should be prima facie


                                            4 .

        A           evidence of these findings. Any party who disputes the
                    findings has liberty to do so. This is not civil
                    lititation, as it were, tried by Lord Justice Taylor in the
                    enquiry; but any party who disputes the findings of Lord
                    Justice Taylor must list these findings, and therefore each
                    party knows what is they are to be faced with.

                         My Lord, in those circumstances, it is anticipated
    B               that in the test case; in the two test cases relating to
                    deaths in pens three and four, the Plaintiff would actually
                    have to call very little if any evidence.

              MR. JUSTICE ROSE: If I may interrupt there. There was a
                  suggestion there would be a third test case.

              MR. HYTNER:   I am sorry, there is going to be such a test case.
    C             There are difficulties in selecting the right one. My
                  Lord, it may be that the test cases in relation to those
                   injured outside the ground will not play much part, as
                   further investigation seems to suggest that there were few
                  people injured outside the ground or any thereafter injured
                  within the ground very seriously.

              MR. JUSTICE ROSE:   If there is to be a third test, and if it
    D             has not been selected, and if it follows that the pleadings
                   are not before me, it is difficult for me to give
                  directions as to when that should be tried.

              MR. HYTNER: It was always hoped that would be tried
                  immediately following the test cases in relation to the
                  deaths inside the ground.

    E         MR. JUSTICE ROSE:             No doubt.

              MR. HYTNER:   I concede until we have selected the case and got
                   the pleadings before you, very little can be done, but what
                   I would say is that if there are test cases, a test case in
                   relation to injuries outside the ground, some evidence
                   would still have to be called by the Plaintiff.
    F
               MR. JUSTICE ROSE: I am not minded, frankly,unless you see to
                    persuade me to the contrary, to contemplate doinganything
                    in relation to the three test cases today.

               MR. HYTNER:  I agree. I am not asking for any directions in
                   respect of a case that has not been brought.

    G         MR. JUSTICE ROSE:             Very wise.

               MR. HYTNER:   It would not get very far; but in relation to the
                    two cases before you, we anticipate that it would not be
                    necessary if Mr. Justice Steyn's suggestion is now
                    converted into a direction that there would be much, if any
                    evidence called by the Plaintiff.

A       MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Have I got the power to give such a
            direction?

        MR. HYTNER: I am not sure without the consent of the parties
            that you can; and that is one of the problems now, my Lord.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE: What you mean is that without the consent of
            the parties, I have not got the power?
B
        MR. HYTNER: I think that is right unless somebody else can
            point to some procedure that I know not of. I anticipate
            that Mr. Glasgow and the Football Club will support that
            direction. In other words, they would consent. We clearly
            consent. The suggestion has been made by Mr. Fenwick that
            yes all right he does not really object to that, but he
            thinks it better for the Plaintiff to set out these
C           findings that he wants to be supported or wants to adopt,
            and then it is for the defendants to say whether they agree
            with those findings or not. That seemed to put it the long
            way round. If that were the only way of getting this
            agreed, my Lord, we would naturally agree as a second best;
            but Mr. Justice Steyn's suggestion seems to us to be
            sensible.

D                  There are those findings by Lord Justice Taylor. Have
             we really got to produce evidence? To take one simple
              example, my Lord, it was found by Lord Justice Taylor that
              a police officer, several police officers, made an error -
              and a material error - in ordering the gates to be opened
              to let in the influx of spectators without first closing
              off the passageway into pens three and four. Have I really
              got to produce evidence that that police officer admitted
E            doing that when he was giving his evidence? It is a
              pointless exercise, and it would be a great shame if the
              other three defendants did not support Mr. Glasgow in his
              agreement with us that this should be done. That is the
              first thing.

                   The second thing we ask, which I anticipate will not
p            be objected to by any of the parties, is that the
              transcript of the evidence at the Hillsborough Enquiry
              should be evidence of what was said at the Enquiry. That
              is a perfectly usual order made, and was made in relation
              to the inquest notes --

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Yes.   It is accepted as accurate?

G       MR. HYTNER:         A true record not of the truth of what was said.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Yes.

        MR. HYTNER:   Lastly, there are the pleadings. Now, the reason
             that perhaps, in greater detail than should have been
             necessary, I made it plain at the outset that the primary
             case of the Plaintiff is against the first two defendants
H           is this: that in his statement of claim Mr. King, in a
    D.L.SELLERS & Co. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND

(

                 manner which I would submit is perfectly usual and
                 professional in this case, has simply repeated and adopted
                 against in a proposed amendment, my Lord, which we have
                 here.

                      Gan I turn to the Chapman case. What Mr. King has
                 done is firstly he has adopted certain allegations made
                 against the First Defendant in the defence of the Second
                 Defendant which Mr. King has not changed. I have to admit
    B
                 my own had in case was to be included in the original
                 statement of claim. As far as I know, Mr. Woodward does
                 not complain about the manner of that pleading. My Lord,
                 what has been said is that the Second Defendant says that
                 yes he may have been an occupier but, in the circumstances,
                 the First Defendant was also an occupier. We had not
                 thought of that.

           MR.    JUSTICE ROSE:            Anyway, you are seeking leave   to amend?

           MR.    HYTNER: Yes, but if your Lordship goes on,you  see that in
                 paragraph J, which is the particulars of the negligence of
                 the Fourth Defendants that is --

           MR.    JUSTICE ROSE:            Which page is that?
    D
           MR.    HYTNER:       I am sorry.       Page 21.

           MR.    JUSTICE ROSE:            Page 21, paragraph J?

           MR. HYTNER: No. If you look at paragraph A, you see Mr. King
               has pleaded our own allegations against Dr. Eastwood, but
               we then see what is actually being said .against him by
               those who actually blame him, but now, turning to page 23,
               you see Mr. King has repeated and adopts --

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               Yes.

           MR. HYTNER: Now, it appears that Mr. King slightly jumped the
               gun, because the second Third Party Notice apparently had
               that difference, and it may be that this difference has not
               actually been served, but this is a draft that we have
               seen, and I understand that Mr. Fenwick objects to that way
               of pleading the case against him. My Lord, I am not going
               to make a great deal of fuss about this. If it appears
               that is an unfair way of pleading the case against him, and
               Mr. King has to sit down and write out all the allegations
               seriatim in the statement of claim, Mr. King will do so.

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Mr. King is entitled to know which version
               you are relying on and draft that.

           MR. HYTNER: That is not a problem. Mr. King that had been
               served. It has been served now.   I leave Mr. Glasgow to
               deal with the interesting problems relating to the inter
               parties pleadings. They are not part of my concern.

^       MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              It may or may not have been served?

        MR. HYTNER: I may have been served without leave. I think
             that is the situation* I simply say this: if at the end
             your Lordship is persuaded that this is an unfair way of
             pleading against Mr. Fenwick, we will, as I say, plead
             seriatim, but for the time being, all I need is to ask for
             leave to amend this statement of claim in the way in which
B           they have already been amended. That is really all I have
             to say on the directions for the trial.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:   Before you go on, what is your estimate of
             length of this trial? It depends on what happens in Lord
             Justice Taylor's report.

        MR. HYTNER:   Yes. If the findings in the report can be relied
C           on, the Plaintiffs' case should not last more than a day,
             day and a half, but the Defendants' case again depends upon
             how much oral evidence they propose to test over and above
             the findings they actually had in the report.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              I am not concerned just with the Plaintiffs'
            case.

D        MR. HYTNER:  I have to say bluntly, I hope I am not being over
             pessimistic about the First Defendant, but frankly, bearing
             in mind the way in they conducted the enquiry, bearing in
             mind the way in which they conducted themselves since this
             litigation started, my Lord, I have to say this: it depends
             on how far they are going to contest each and every finding
             in the repeort.

E        MR. JUSTICE ROSE: As at this stage, has there been any
             exchange of experts reports?

        MR. HYTNER: As far as we are concerned, we do not have any.   I
            do not know whether the defendants have exchanged reports
            or not.

P        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  I tell you unless by the time I have heard
             everybody, I have an approximate view of the length of this
             case, it makes it impossible to fix it.

        MR. HYTNER:         I agree, but all I can say is --

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              You are the one that wanted a speedy trial.

G        MR. HYTNER:  I know we wish the trial to proceed with some
             speed because what we say is the facts before the court.
             The findings are virtually incontestable unless one or
             other of the parties is going to stand up and say "We
             contest there is going to be a sort of technical issue in
             relation to the barrier", I cannot assist on how long that
             will take. There will be experts on each side talking
             about facts that we know of: on what happened inside the
H            ground. We all know.   If, as I say, the police will say

             "Oh well, we don't accept the gates were open and floods
A            people came in", the actual people in pens three and four,
             it could last a year.  But if what they are going to say is
             "Well, yes those are the findings and we accept this
             happened but it was not our fault, it was the fault ofthe
             club", I would have thought the case will not take more
             than two to three weeks.

g      MR. JUSTICE ROSE: The estimate that was given when the matter
           was before Mr. Justice Steyn by the parties appearing
           before him was six weeks.

       MR. HYTNER: Again, I do not know on what proposed evidence
           they based that estimate on. As I say --

       MR. JUSTICE ROSE:   I may be wrong, but I assumed         that was a
£          joint estimate.

       MR. HYTNER:         Oh yes, I was party to that.

       MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               That is what I thought.

       MR. HYTNER: But looking at it sensibly, the barrier will take
            a little time. It will not take any time for the Plaintiff
D          because we will not be taking any part in it.    My Lord, I
            anticipate that experts called by the three parties or four
            parties in relation to the barriers will have to give
            evidence of that, and this could take a week for the
            remainder. As I say, much depends on the approach of the
            First Defendants to the findings of Lord Justice Taylor.
            How far are they going to say he was quite wrong to find A,
            B, C, and D; or how far are they going to say "We agree
E          with that and we are not going to go through that again but
            it was not our fault it was the fault of the Club. It was
            the fault of Dr. Eastwood or the city council".   If that is
            their approach, I would have thought six weeks was a very
            fair and liberal estimate.

       MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               Thank you.

F      MR. HYTNER: Can I deal with one matter which does not affect
           my learned friends in any way. They may think that this is
           wholly ambitious thing to be raising, but as your Lordship
           knows, there has been a public fund for the victims of
           Hillsborough. The various Plaintiffs will be entitled to
           seek assistance from the fund, so that it follows that if
           any Plaintiff wins; if one Plaintiff wins they all win.
£         They will already have, or they may already have, if they
           are infants. A trust deed has already been drafted by
           Chancery Counsel for the proceeds of the fund.

                  What my solicitors were considering was this: that in
             the event of an infant Plaintiff succeeding in obtaining
             damages, an application would then be made on grounds of
             commonsense that since there is already a trust fund in
H           existence for that infant, the damages should be
D.L.SELLERS 8tCo. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




    ^       transferred to the trust fund rather than the court. Now,
            as your Lordship knows, there was a time not all that long
            ago when it was common both for infants and parents that
            trust funds were set up and judges, if they approved the
            trust deed, would agree to the transfer of the damages to
            the trust fund. As your Lordship knows, the practice in
            relation to parents has now been disapproved, but it has
            not been disapproved in relation to infants. Therefore,
B           there is no reason why the damages for an infant still
            cannot be placed in the trust fund.

                  My Lord, what I was minded to ask your Lordship was
            this, not today because it would not be right or fair to
            ask your Lordship to look at it today, but if your Lordship
            were say minded       Would your lordship agree to an
            application being made for approval of the trust deed
C           which, of course, relates to the trust fund set up under
            the bill that the approval of that be for the purposes of
            damages being transferred to it in the event of damages
            ever being recovered.   I only --

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE: I think it is hypothetical. I am
            sympathetic to the application you make, and it may be - I
            put it no higher than that - it will be, in the special
D           circumstances in this case, proper for any money which may
            be recovered to go into such a trust fund, but at the
            moment, I think there are several hurdles.

        MR. HYTNER: I appreciate that. I have made the difficulty
            plain. Obviously, in the ordinary way, it would be very
            wrong to go in advance. We wondered if you would approve
            the trust deed on behalf of this case, and the peculiar
k           circumstances are that it relates to a trust fund that is
            going to be set up. My Lord, it would be unfortunate if
             the fund were set up on the basis of the deed, and then in
            a years time your Lordship were to look at it and say well
             I would have agreed to transfer the damages to this fund
            but I do not like that --

p       MR. JUSTICE ROSE: I can follow that, but I doubt if the
            Court has power to deal with something which does not
            immediately arise from these proceedings.

        MR. HYTNER:   It would be not in relation to matters that are
            not affected by the proceedings, but yes if that were the
             trust deed. I can see no problems, but it is a matter for
             the trustees of this fund what they do with their money;
G           but if you are going to ask for evidence for the purposes
             of damages, I do not like thatparticular clause. We could
             then consider changing it. That is the point.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Mr. Hytner, all I shall say is that those
            responsible for drafting the trust deed must have in mind
            the possibility that monies may come into it from another
            source.

           MR. WOODWARD: We came to Manchester to deal with a pre trial
               review. On arrival at Manchester, we met with a problem
               that gives rise to the first application that I make on
               behalf of the First Defendant.  I am applying for a stay in
               these proceedings.
    C
                       Before coming to the detail of that, having listened
                 carefully to what my learned friend Mr. Hytner said, I
                 understand what he was saying concerning the conduct of the
                 police at the enquiry, I am perplexed at      what he   issaying
                 concerning the conduct of the police in relation to these
                 proceedings, because as far as we are aware, there has been
                 no dragging of feet, and no endeavour to      hold up
    D            proceedings at all until that which I     am   now about to deal
                 with.

                       It is no secret that there are criminal investigations
                  being carried out by the Director of Public Prosecutions,
                  and also there are investigations being carried out with
                  the Police Complaints Proceedure. Those investigations are
                  criminal investigations and are in the hands of the West
    k            Midlands Police. My Lord, in the hand of the Assistant
                  Chief Constable Mr. Mervin Jones, may I hand to your
                  Lordship a letter that those instructing me received from
                  Mr. Mervin Jones concerning that enquiry, dated 23rd
                  October 1989. Substantially, that letter deals with and
                  arises from questions and enquiries concerning the
                  investigation, or the facility for investigation, of an
    p            examination of the barrier; but my Lord, if one looks at
                  the first paragraph through to the second paragraph

                             "My Chief Constable's knowledge of the circumstances


                  in respect of the barrier is not yet determined".

                  Then we come to the final paragraph:

                          "On Thursday, 26th October, before Lord Justice Rose

                  nor a decision made by the Director of Public
                  Prosecutions".

                        Ordinarily, my Lord, the Chief Constable is entitled
    B             t0 call upon all his officers and require them to co­
                   operate in relation to any investigation. He may be
                   involved in the conduct of civil proceedings, and the
                   officers would be required to comply and give statements.

                        Those instructing me have been in touch with the
                   solicitors for the Police Federation; Messrs Russell Jones
                  and Walker. May I hand to you a letter which was faxed
    C             yesterday to those instructing me, although it is dated
                   24th October 1989,from those solicitors. The date and time
                  are at the top according to the fax.    That letter reads:

                                             (THE LETTER WAS READ)

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Presumably the statements have already been
                tendered to your good selves?
    D
            MR. WOODWARD: May I also add that almost immediately the
                Hillsborough Disaster occurred, the West Midlands Police
                were involved in an investigation. The whole of the matter
                was taken out of the hands of the South Yorkshire Police,
                and all the material and statements they had got was
                furnished to the West Midlands Police, whereupon the matter
                was investigated, and is still being investigated, as it
    E           would appear from Mr. Mervin Jones' statement by the West
                Midlands Police.

            MR.    JUSTICE ROSE:  I follow. The information was handed over.
                  Afe you saying no copies were kept?

            MR.    WOODWARD: No.   Statements were taken and the police got
    P              all they had as far as they could. There then came a break
                  in the matter, and the conduct of the investigation was
                  handed over to others, and it was not carried out by the
                  South Yorkshire Police. They did what they could, and it
                  would be unreasonable for them to have sat back and done
                  nothing. They did not do anything they got on with it as
                  far as they were able to my Lord. The consequences of this
                  is that having regard in particular to orders of Mr.
    G             Justice Steyn      Does my Lord have before him section A of
                  the order of Mr. Justice Steyn?

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Yes.

            MR. WOODWARD: Requiring the exchange of all statements of
                witnesses relied upon within six weeks after the close of
                pleadings. In so far as such statements already given,
    H           such exchange should be by reference to such statements.

              Now, the police officers did give evidence before Lord
A             Justice Taylor. Statements they had signed were available
              and all the parties were furnished with them.

                   The enquiry took place within about four weeks of the
              disaster happening. Police officers did give their
              evidence, and what they said I suspect is there recorded
              for ever. But given the situation, it is likely there are
B             officers who would wish to stand qualified and modify that
              which they have earlier stated.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              That happens in every civil litigation one
            can think of.

        MR. WOODWARD: It does; as in all civil litigation one can
            think of, ordinarily enquiries are made and the witnesses
            are seen, and the matter is taken up as a matter of
            procedure in order to deal with the points raised in so far
            as they can be anticipated, and deal with points as they
            emerge which have not been anticipated.

                   The effect of that letter from those acting for the
              Police Federation is an indication that these officers will
              not co-operate, and will not answer, and will not be
D             prepared to give statements. That severely embarrasses, in
              our submission, the preparation and presentation of the
              evidence of the First Defendant.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE: It goes further than that: it says they are
            not prepared to advise the officers to give oral evidence
            in a civil trial that might come in conflict with — -

E       MR. WOODWARD: There might be difficulties over that, but one
            would hope one would not have to wait until the officer had
            taken the oath before it was known exactly what he was
            going to say.

                    This touches upon another point Mr. Hytner raises, and
              that is the status of the Taylor Report, if I might call it
               that, my Lord. I will turn to our submissions in respect
*             of that in a moment, but it seems that what the Plaintiff
              and everybody ought to put their minds to is the
               identification of those facts and issues which will not be
              in dispute. That is a thing which we would support and
              would do our utmost to attend to.

                   The position is this: given the tone of that letter,
£             effectively the Chief Constable is unable to prepare for
              his case - for his defence - to satisfy those matters set
              out in Mr. Justice Steyn's order, being procluded from
              being able to approach those officers identified, and that
              is a serious embarrassment.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE: I do not follow that, Mr. Woodward, because
            the direction of Mr. Justice Steyn relates to the mutual

.            exchange of statements already given at the Lord Justice
             Taylor Enquiry.

       MR. WOODWARD: With respect, my Lord, I am not sure that is,
           with respect, the proper reading of it. The mutual
           exchange by parties' of all statements or witnesses of fact
           relied upon within six weeks after the close of pleadings.
           As I understand the case, in so far as such statements have
B          already been given at the enquiry such exchange be by
           reference to such statements.    In otherwords, they having
           given evidence, all you see is the statement he gave; but
           it is the first part of that order that we will not be able
           to comply with.

       MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                Yes.

C      NR*   WOODWARD: My Lord, that also affects the expert evidence.
             It does not touch so much upon the consultant engineer, but
             my Lord he will require to know, and does require to know
             certain details from certain officers.  It cannot touch
             upon metallurgists, but it does touch upon questions of
             safety. The third expert category allowed for in these
             circumstances. My Lord, it is unlikely that we will be
             able to comply certainly with the category C type expert
D            evidence, but my Lord, to a lesser degree with the
             requirement concerning the consultant engineer's evidence.
             There is another difficulty in relation to that which I
             will come to, which does not arise out of this predicament
             presented by the decision of the police officers.

                  My Lord, the application to stay, although that is
             important here in that the purpose is to protect these
^            police officers, that would be an application, having
             regard to the case, which if they thought they were in
             difficulty, they would have to make themselves. We do not
             have, on behalf of particular police officers, to make that
             application; but it is in relation to the preparation of
             this trial.

F                 The preparation of this is not entirely a D.P.R.
             Future Limited type case, found at 1989 1 W.L.R, page 7 7 8 ,
             when the court was concerned to deal with an application
             for stay by certain directors of the company who considered
             that they might be prejudiced in the criminal matters were
             were there to be a trial of the action.   In that case it
             was held they could be protected by other orders, by
             matters being dealt with in camera, giving orders
G            concerning confidentiality. It is in relation to the
             decision of the Chief Constable that we are finding
             ourselves embarrassed, and with the prospect of being
             unable properly to prepare our case, and unlikely to be
             able to comply with the orders of Mr. Justice Steyn.

       MR. JUSTICE ROSE: One problem is that there is no indication
           in either of the letters which you have given to me of how
H          long the enquiries may take.

             MR.     WOODWARD:   That is indeed right. That is a grave problem,
     A               my Lord. The director as written in part in relation to
                    the question of inspecting the barriers because there was
                    some concern about the integrity of that material on 25th
                    October 1989. Perhaps for completeness my Lord should see
                    that letter. It gives no indication of the sort of time
                    that these investigations may be expected to occupy.

     B       MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               Thank you.

             MR.     WOODWARD: It is really the first part of the letter if it
                   was possible,one might expect him to indicate it will only
                   be a matter of weeks, or it will be a long time, but he has
                   not. From the indication given by Mr. Mervin Jones, these
                   enquiries have a long way to go, so he cannot say there is
                    little prospect of this difficulty disappearing. We are
     q             embarrassed, and it is on that ground that we ask for a
                    stay of these proceedings.

                         I start with that application.  It is one that is
                    necessarily important because in the circumstances, we
                    cannot properly prepare the case, nor can we comply with
                    the orders that have so far been made.

     D       MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Just reverting for a moment to the question
                 of expert evidence in relation to safety; was any evidence
                 in relation to that advanced before Lord Justice Taylor on
                 behalf of the police?

             MR. WOODWARD: No, there was no evidence advanced; no positive
                  evidence advanced by any of those who are now before my
                  Lord. At the hearing, all the evidence was called by
     E           counsel to the enquiry, and the matter was dealt with very
                  quickly. There was no evidence put before the enquiry on
                  the question of barriers or safety, save to the best of my
                  recollection, Dr. Eastwood himself. There was material
                  from the Health and Safety Executive. Their investigations
                 were not, at the time the enquiry concluded, complete.
                  There was evidence put before Lord Justice Taylor
                  concerning the ordinary standard of care and the degree of
                  skill that should have been exercised.

              MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Yes.

              MR. WOODWARD: The Chief Constable wishes this matter to be
                   kept at that. No impediment has been placed by the Chief
                   Constable or those acting on his behalf, so far as we are
     G            aware, in the progress of this lititation until I rose to
                   my feet at this moment.

                         The statement of claim was served on 11th August.
                    Defence was served on 22nd September.  The reply, which the
                    Plaintiff asked for time to be extended, was served on 20th
                    October 1989, and so pleadings have not yet quite closed.
                    We have not sought to hold the matter up. We only make
     H             this application because of embarrassment and fear that we

            .           will not be able to properly present the case, or comply
                        with the orders. Would it be convenient if I went on to
                        deal with --

                MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Yes, we will have each counsel in turn on
                    everything.

                MR. HYTNER:  It may save a lot of time if I ask Mr. Woodward to
        B           explain his first application to this extent: is he saying
                    that the Chief Constable will be embarrassed in the
                    preparation of the case against the Plaintiff, or the other
                    defendants, or both?

                MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              He is putting it globally

                MR. HYTNER:  If he is saying against the Plaintiff, I wonder if
        C           he could assist us and your Lordship by indicating which of
                    the allegations that the Plaintiff makes against the Chief
                    Constable he is going to --

                MR. JUSTICE ROSE: I think you better let Mr. Woodward make his
                    application as he wishes to.

                MR. HYTNER:        Very well.
        D
                MR. WOODWARD: We make it globally in respect of the proper
                    presentation of the Chief Constable's case.

                             If I may,         with respect, draw your Lordship's attention
                        to Mr. Justice         Steyn's order. I have made the point in
                        relation to 4.          We would have hoped to be able to comply
                        with that, but         there is a difficulty about it on the expert
                        evidence. May          I shortly address your Lordship on that.

                             We anticipate a problem.  It may be that that problem
    i                    will be resolved. Accordingly, I am not asking at this
                        juncture for departure from the order made by Mr. Justice
                        Steyn concerning any exchange of written reports. My Lord
                        will see from the two documents before you part of the
        F               picture concerning the investigation and examination of
                        barriers. The barriers are in the custody of the Health
                        and Safety Executive. We applied to them for facility in
                        order for our experts to be able to carry out an
                        examination. My Lord, initially, the response was that the
                        Health and Safety Executive had been instructed by Mr.
                        Waly, secretary to the Lord Justice Taylor Enquiry, to
                        retain the broken barrier in it's present condition.
        G               Samples could be made available to the parties involved in
                        the civil action. I would refer such requests to Mr.
                        Mervin Jones. That gives rise to that, or part of that
                        letter, is from Mr. Mervin Jones concerning the barriers.

                MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Presumably that is a directional request
                    which is effective until such time the final report of Lord
                    Justice Taylor is made.

            MR. WOODWARD: My Lord, one might have thought that was agreed
                in relation to the Health and Safety Executive observation,
                but my Lord, there is a letter from Mr. Robert Waly,
                secretary to the enquiry which those instructing me have,
                dated 24th October 1989.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Thank you.

            MR. WOODWARD: This is part of the Health and Safety Executive
                whose letter I was reading but a moment ago:

                          "So far as the barrier is concerned...................

                  as further investigation of it may be necessary in respect
                  of this enquiry".

    C                  The tenor of that suggests that it is not in relation
                  to anything Lord Justice Taylor has said. The rest of the
                  letter deals with the enquiry made concerning the technical
                  report. Then, my Lord, the next document, in fact, is the
                  letter of 25th October which my Lord has, I think, from Mr.
                  Dor from the Director of Public Prosecutions.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Yes.
    D
            MR. WOODWARD: Laying down conditions, so it would seem.
                Looking at that correspondence, taking it as a whole, the
                official response was under no circumstances can anything
                be done to this barrier, and it would seem that we are now
                in a position, subject to certain conditions, and that
                requires some discussion because the director wishes to
                impose certain conditions upon making an examination.

                       The reason I am referring to this is that it is hoped
                  that by sensible discussion with the director, the position
                  can be made plain, and our metallurgist and engineer will
                  be able to make whatever examination in the proper frame
                  entitled, and not be made subject to terms and conditions,
                  for example, that all reports and date of supply to
    F             somebody else. Any other requirement or condition attached
                  to monitor the test, of course, would be reasonable because
                  it would be important to know exactly what happened to the
                  piece of the barrier.

                       I      mention that because of the time requirement in
                  relation to Mr. Justice Steyn’s order. We expect to be
                  able to comply with it my Lord, but there is a chance that
    G             we may not. That is in respect of the consultant engineer
                  and metallurgist as to the safety of them. We may be able
                  to substantially comply with it, but not in relation to
                  such tests as I have been referring to as to the safety
                  matter.

                       My Lord the controlling, the policing the organisation
                  and running of crowds. That is a matter in respect of
                  which it would be necessary to have the co-operation of the

           police officers; and if questions be asked of them and that
           is a difficulty.

                May I move on now, my Lord. There was an application
           before Mr. Justice Steyn asking for other actions to be
           stayed. We have nothing more to add in relation to that.

                May we move to 8. That, in part, is coupled with 11(1)
           of the order that in part is coupled with the rider Mr.
           Justice Steyn made, that the Taylor Report is not a matter
           that can come before the court and constitute evidence in
           the hearing. My Lord, the report is, of course, a set of
           facts that are known. It sets out inferences drawn from
           those facts; sets out matters and conclusions and matters
           all known.

                In relation to that report it would seem that the
           purpose that the Plaintiffs require it to be before the
           court is really as a sort of aide-memoire; a list of facts.
           Now, my Lord, in relation to that matter, I indicated at
           the beginning that is an end which all the parties, with
           respect, I think in one way or another would seek to comply
           with, having no interest in causing this trial to run on,
           and on, and on. They all have an interest in seeing what
           facts are common, and what can be agreed; so we respect the
           suggestion that the Taylor Report should go before the
           trial judge or it should be put in in evidence. In so far
           as it may not seem capable as a means by which one can
           identify facts and indicate whether or not we agree or
           dispute, that is the end which we would seek to assist and
           encourage in the report to go before the trial judge.

     MR. JUSTICE ROSE: What is it that you are suggesting? If it
         be the case that the First Defendants are anxious to
         identify as speedily as possible the material facts, and in
         in relation to which there is a dispute, is not one
         convenient way of doing that to follow the suggestion of
         Mr. Justice Steyn?

     MR.    WOODWARD: Not that the report should go in, but my Lord,
           the facts sought and the scale of the facts in the report
           may be taken as the scale upon which one may proceed to
           agree facts.

     MR. JUSTICE ROSE: What is it you are concerned about: that the
         judge who tries this matter will be improperly influenced
         by expression and view?

     MR.    WOODWARD: No, my Lord. In so far as any conclusion of
           facts before Lord Justice Taylor were cast upon evidence,
           that evidence will be there; but at the trial it is not
           inconceivable that other evidence - additional evidence -
           will be given that will not be the same.
D.L.SELLERS & Co. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




A       MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Of course that is what is contemplated in
           what Mr. Justice Steyn said; but each party should be at
            liberty to contradict any of the disputed facts.

       MR. WOODWARD:  But it would also seem by that proposal there is
           an indication, or the intention to reverse the burden of
           proof.

g       MR. JUSTICE ROSE: I do not view it in that way at all. I view
            it as being the Taylor Enquiry Report and the Taylor
           Enquiry being a convenient summary of relevant facts, some
            of which may well be in dispute.

        MR. WOODWARD: My Lord, if the purpose is to leave the trial
             judge untrammelled in so far as can be, by having agreed
             facts or identifying those facts which are not agreed, then
C           a list in some form or other will have to be prepared.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:   Yes. Is not the Lord Justice Taylor Enquiry
             a convenient starting point for such a list?

        MR. WOODWARD: It may be a convenient starting point for the
            purpose in order to prepare an agreed list, my Lord, yes.
             It is a convenient starting point for the purpose of
D           preparing their agreed list, or their list of undisputed
             facts.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE: And the advice so far as the judge referred
            to this is concerned.

        MR. WOODWARAD:          It is unnecessary that he should look at it.

^       MR. JUSTICE ROSE: If there are 200 facts found by Lord Justice
            Taylor, of which 180 are common ground and 20 are in
            dispute, is it said to be more convenient that they should
            all be picked out of the report, separately typed,
            separately considered, rather than that they should be seen
            in the report. Is that thought to be a more convenient
            course?
F
        MR. WOODWARD: My Lord, there are more than those facts in the
            Taylor Report.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Of course there are.           I plucked those
            figures out of the air.

        MR. WOODWARD:          Forgive me, I did not intent to ---
G
        MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Well, of course there would be expressed the
            view it would not only not bind, but would not influence
            the trial judge.

        MR. WOODWARD: My Lord, we would submit he need not be
            trammelled with them.

                My Lord, whilst on it, we submit the report has no
           status for the purposes of the proceedings. If it is to be
           taken as a whole by which the parties can identify issues,
           other considerations apply.

    MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Mr. Hytner says unless everybody agrees, it
        cannot have any. It would be very regrettable if time was
        spent by the trial just in this case investigating the
        outside facts about which there is no issue at all.

     MR. WOODWARD: With respect, if there were no issues, the trial
         judge would have told and no-one would have been --

     MR. JUSTICE ROSE: What is the procedure which you propose for
         the trial judge to be told of these facts which are agreed?

     MR. WOODWARD: By a list of them, the way as in a civil
         action one party may give to the other a notice of facts,
         and they will then be admitted or not admitted. This, with
         respect, seems to put it the other way round requiring a
         party to give notice of the facts it disputes.

     MR. JUSTICE ROSE:             Yes.

     MR. WOODWARD: When the list of facts is drawn and prepared and
         the facts shortly stated, perhaps all the facts might be
         conveniently put on two sheets of A4. It is not the
         objective that is challenged, it is the mode of seeking to
         pursue it.

     MR. JUSTICE ROSE:             Yes.

     MR. WOODWARD: My Lord, in relation to Mr. Justice Steyn’s
         observation 11(1), the transcript, there is no issue about
         that. It really is 11 (1), the last clause of that at
         which we have been looking.

     MR. JUSTICE ROSE.             There is no issue as to 11 (1) B

     MR. WOODWARD: No my Lord, none at all. We agree that is a
         true record of what was said at the hearing.

     MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Do I take it then that the First Defendant
         is prepared to agree to submit before trial a list of those
         findings of fact contained in the enquiry report contested
         at trial?

     MR. WOODWARD: We are prepared to participate in the
         preparation of an agreed list of facts, or an agreed list
         of disputed facts. The mechanics by which that may be
         reached by the parties should be unimportant. It might be
         by looking at the Taylor Report. It is the objective,
         therefore. May I move to the third party matter.

     MR. JUSTICE ROSE:             Yes.

    ^       MR. WOODWARD: Does my Lord have before him the third party
                notice. It is strictly speaking, whilst called third party
                notice given under order 16 third party in summary
                proceedings and they are in relation to matters between
                defendants.

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:                Just a moment.     Yes.

    B       MR. WOODWARD: My Lord, they have been prepared by my learned
                junior in addition to the matters set out within the action
                between the parties, my Lord, against the Football Club,
                adding to the matters set out within the Plaintiff’s
                pleading a further allegation that they did not provide
                sufficient means of escape for the crowd from the pens in
                case of emergency.

    C       MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Just a moment. I may not have     Oh yes, I
                see. It is at the end. I was not sure if I had the right
                document. It is a very short document.

            MR. WOODWARD:          Yes.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               I have it.

    D       MR. WOODWARD:  And my Lord, in relation to the Fourth
                Defendant Dr. Eastwood, recites and relies upon the matters
                pleaded within the Plaintiff’s pleading, and with the
                additional four or five points that are there raised.  We
                seek to raise these against our co-defendants, and that is
                properly done by the procedure.

    p.                 My Lord, in respect of these, we have asked for
                  directions. Does my Lord have that? I have not had an
                  opportunity to discuss that with my learned friends, and
                  what their attitudes to this third party notice are. No
                  objection has been given but, my Lord, that may be because
                  they have not had a chance to speak to me.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE: I will see what counsel say about that. At
    p           the moment, you are asking for an order in the form of the
                summons?

            MR. WOODWARD: Yes. They are fairly standard.                 We ask for
                these orders. Thank you, my Lord.

            MR. GLASGOW: There is very little I need to add on behalf of
                the Club. Is it convenient if I run through Mr. Justice
    G           Steyn’s order with your Lordship. The pleadings and the
                discovery ought to be dealt with. Might I advance to say
                that I hope your Lordship has not got the impression from
                any of the lawyers that there has been any delay.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               I have not got any impression at all.

            MR. GLASGOW:  There have been numerous efforts made,
    H           particularly by our juniors very substantial work, and


                                                         21.
SELLERS & CO. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




          there has been very considerable hard work and co­
          operation.

    MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              I do not doubt that.

    MR. GLASGOW: I hope you do not, my Lord, because many do. It
        is right that the Court should be aware of that, and that
        co-operation continues.

               My Lord, the pre-trial review was helpful, and that
          indeed has been co-operated with.

               So far as my learned friend's position on the stay is
          concerned, may I say that for our part we sympathise
          ourselves. We understand it is difficult if you cannot get
          your hands on statements, but we do wonder, although we
          have no forceful case to make of it, whether there is a
          little problem here other than one of professional
          difficulty with which one sympathises.

               We accept and understand that the junior officers may
          have been advised by their own solicitors not to provide
          any further statements.   Is it in the interests of justice
          simply to stay the whole of the action because of that?
          One would have thought that possibly the action could
          proceed on the timetable that we had all agreed, and that
          we all thought sensible on the last occasion, and the Court
          should look favourably at any late application to serve the
          statements from any quarter where there had been some
          acceptable and reasonable delay of the matters.

                I do not want to single anybody out by name or rank,
          but the fact that the senior officers who are clearly
          thought most directly concerned for not only giving their
          statements, but giving evidence, and there is no suggestion
          that they would seek either to be advised, or they be
          prepared to hide behind any procedural delay that might
          arise in the future.

               There can be no question of the criminal proceedings
          going on, or the investigation continuing into the end of
          next year, by which time we will know where we are going.
          I do not think anybody would be enthusiastic about the
          civil proceedings being embarked upon and people being
          compelled into the witness box at this stage, putting the
          matter at i t ’s lowest. Would it be right to address your
          Lordship on the basis that is a realistic prospect, and if
          that is so, perhaps all we know is understanding without
          any separate order: that the order that witness statements
          be exchanged within six weeks could be subject to the
          caveat there may be supplementary statements which will be
          served later, and that it should be a common understanding
          that none of us will take any issue where it is clear there
          has been no fault.
D.l_.SELLERS & CO. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




                    That is all we say about the stay. We would be very
               unhappy there should be a stay because it has always been
               the Club's case that the injured people ought to have their
               remedy against those responsible as promptly as possible.

                     So far as the exchange of reports is concerned, we are
                in the same position as the police, and I identify the
                parties by name; it is easier. We cannot get our hands on
g               the material and we very much like to. We understandthe
                Health and Safety Executive, and we bided our time. It is
                difficult, and we may be a little late with our actual
                service of the reports. If that is so, and everybody
                understands this is not through people playing games, but
                because of wholly understandable and proper reasons.   In
                the public interest, people have been prevented from
                examination or doing destructive tests. I suggest
C              everybody will understand; and if we are late with our
                reports, we can come to your Lordship, or whoever is
                appropriate, and explain that. One would hope it would not
                be necessary, because nobody will deduct points against us,
                but if it is, we will have to come back. At the moment,
                there are enough problems of this nature without looking
                for them.

D                    My Lord, so far as 8 my Lord I think there is nothing.
                The status of the report, again without criticism or
                improper comment, we simply accept reluctantly as a fact
                that if no consent is given the only procedure is for
                statements of facts to be served and for them to be
                distributed. We would regret it should be necessary, but
                we understand if on the professional and competent advice
                people think it is necessary to direct that. We would
E              accept that however regretable.     Our only wish has been
                toensure that when it does come to service of notice of
                agreed facts, that we all can exercise the measure of co­
                operation we have tried to give everything else. If we
                have to go through the laborious exercise, which the public
                may find very difficult to appreciate, for a second time -
                these matters over which there is no real or substantial
P              issue between us - one ventures to suggest that your
                Lordship or another trial judge would obviously convey your
                attitude towards that particular party in the form of costs
                with some enthusiasm.

                     We will co-operate in that exercise, and one would
                hope when the schedule of facts has been drawn, all
                defendants, any single one of us, can give serious
G              consideration to it, taking the lines considered helpful by
                Mr. Justice Steyn. I think your Lordship cannot order us
                to, but we welcome and do our best to make sensible
                compliance with it.

         MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Is it possible to give any indication as to
             what might be an appropriate time scale if there are to be
             statements of facts served?

        MR. GLASGOW: My Lord, I anticipate the document rather like my
            friend Mr. Woodward. The schedule of the notice to admit
             facts, which one would have thought could have been done on
             two bits of A4 paper, because the knife cuts both ways.   I
            am sure my learned friend Mr. Hytner would be the first to
            accept that it is wholly unnecessary from the Plaintiff's
            point of view to list every single fact laboriously and to
            go through the Taylor reports. One would expect Lord
g           Justice Taylor did; but to take out those facts that really
            matter, and to serve those. If that cannot be fitted on to
             two sheets of A4 paper, some of us particularly those who
            sit behind us, will be extremely disappointed. I would
            have thought that the exercise could be accomplished in 14
            days, and certainly in the time scale for the preparation
            of this trial.

C                   It would be sensible to allow a longer period because
               the question of what is relevant, and what is likely to be
              disputed is, to some extent, a reflection upon the view of
               the expert and when the experts have had an opportunity of
               looking at the barriers, they may tell us that there are
              matters in the Taylor Report that are no longer material,
              and it wouldbe for fear of missing something out. Surely
               the sensible   thing is to say in 28 days if it is to be done
D             this way round, then the Plaintiffs could draw a schedule
               of those facts clearly without prejudice them in any way at
              all. If they could make their list of what they regard as
               important facts, we can then consider them in the same time
               period. It might make sense to them, although my learned
               friend Mr. Woodward rightly reminds me that it might be
              better to do that after the expert's report. That is a
              matter for your Lordship's timetable when you have heard
E             us.

                    If this  exercise is to be embarked upon, then the
              service of the notice of admitted facts can probably be
              done. He has probably got it in draft already knowing Mr.
              Hytner,but it would be done within 28 days, with sensible
              co-operation, as soon as the reports are ready, probably
P             following the exchange.

                       My Lord, so far as 9 is concerned, nothing turns on
               that.     There has been --

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Forgive me. Before we go on to that, I am
             trying to calculate the numbers of weeks of the
            presentorder in relation to experts reports. They should
G           be exchanged within 10 weeks after the close ofpleadings
            pleadings have not quite closed, so we are looking at the
            middle of January.

        MR. GLASGOW:          Yes, my Lord.   It is 12th January.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Thank you. So 31st January for an indication
            facts which were in dispute?

       MR. GLASGOW:   It cannot affect anything that would alter the
A          length of trial at some time or anything like that.

       HR. JUSTICE ROSE:               Thank you.

       MR. GLASGOW:  I think there is nothing further. We all agree
           about the transcript, thatis the usual order.  I think
           there is nothing on 9. The only other matter on which we
B         had any views were the third party directions. Provided
           that it is clear and ---

       MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Forgive me.   Before you go on to that, have
           you got a view as to the length of this case?

       MR. GLASGOW:   We all have. We all gave it and we all agree
            five to six weeks. We could all be wrong, but we did think
q          about it before we said it. We all know there will be co­
            operation, and one or two people will be passive about one
            or two things. That is bound to happen; but five to six
            weeks is our estimate, and nothing has changed to alter it.

       MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Bearing in mind that the gap between Easter
           to the end of the first half of that term is barely five
           weeks, have you any view as to whether --
D
       MR. GLASGOW: Again, there is co-operation and may I make one
           thing plain: nobody was seeking to go behind your Lordship
           in trying to find out what the situation was. It was
           recognised that the Plaintiff's, on any view, would be
           extremely unhappy if my learned friend Mr. Hytner was not
           available. My Lord, we all recognise that the Plaintiffs
           have said right through this enquiry "Can we get on with
E          the action", and so now, it is of paramount importance, and
           therefore we are unclear of whether it was likely, given
           that estimate, that autumn would be available. We looked
           at the calendar for hearing the case at this court as to
           when it could be fitted in. It was against that
           background, I think the three who tried to look at the
           situation together with staff, recognised it was possibly
P          not realistic to fit in the sort of timetable which Mr.
           Justice Steyn quoted infront of us and asked for our view
           upon.

       MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               The first half.

       MR. GLASGOW:  Yes, and the danger of running into the vacation
           and or into problems with the break, and it made sense If
G          it looked as if it could be fitted in with the court, and
           Mr. Hytner, and it did, and the majority obviously to go
           for a safer date. That would allow for the sort of
           circumstances like the unavailability of the experts and
           material which we thought was likely to happen, even with
           the present hope with the speed we have shown so far, which
           is pretty commendable. That is why we thought of speaking
           to as many people as possible. Mr. Hytner’s suggestion
H          through his chambers is to have an early June fixture made


                                                    25.

    A            sense from the Plaintiff’s point of view. If we can co­
                 operate with it and it was apporpriate ---

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               Oh, clearly.

           MR. GLASGOW: We spoke of the five to six weeks we think it is
               likely to be that in any event.

    B      MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               Yes.

           MR. GLASGOW: The only other matter is the third party matter.
               Nobody is talking technical words, but we are talking about
               an order 16 rule 8 notice.

                      There is no new issue there is no third party notice,
                 and that is an important point because we all recognised,
    C           even before the hearing before Mr. Justice Steyn, that it
                 would be highly regretable if people started serving third
                 party proceedings in this case, because that would lead to
                 delays while third parties got involved. We wanted
                 everybody to be equal defendants so the timetable could
                 run.

                      Mr. Justice Steyn, when he heard our reasons, agreed
    D           with us to the extent of saying if third party proceedings
                 were issued, he would not give leave for them to follow in
                 this trial. They would have to take those at a later
                 stage; and we are most anxious that nothing should now be
                 done to upset the smoothness of that rhythm. If people
                 want to put their point later in the form of third party
                 notice, nobody can stop them. They are wholly unnecessary
                 and extremely unhelpful because they lead people to take
                 points on them; and when we look at what are called third
                 party notice, which ought to be set out in a letter is
                 provided for now rules, there  is no new issue between the
                 parties. They do   not require to know what our cases areas
                 pleaded in the Defence. Those are joint. Nobody has
                 sought to take the independent contradictory point. These
                 so called third party notices are a bit of a nuisance when
    P            you look at them; drafted.

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               What importance ---

           MR. GLASGOW: Just ignore them. They provide no useful
               purpose. What is the point in telling us that police want
               to be indemnified on the grounds of our negligence? It is
               not remotely helpful.  It was a good idea, but it will be
    G          ignored.

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               So your answer is to make no order?

           MR. GLASGOW: None at               all.

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE: If I am asked to make an order, I have to
               make an order of some kind.

            MR. GLASGOW: That is why your position is so much more
                difficult than ours; but we do not think there is any
                advantage to them, and they do not --

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               They do not add anything.

            MR. GLASGOW: They add nothing. They are potentially
                introducing a complication which we wanted to avoid. If
     B          there is some specific direction in relation to that my
                friend wants, he could ask; but it is a wholly unnecessary
                notice.

                       Unless I have missed something.             Those are our
                  submissions.

            MR. MAXWELL: May I deal with matters in the order in which
     C          they have been discussed.

                        The First Defendant application            to stay: we have no
                   observation on make on that.

                       Secondly, the Plaintiff application for a direction
                  that Lord Justice Taylor's report of facts should be prima
                  facie evidence of such facts, and anybody who disputes a
     D           finding must list them. We find that to be an attractive
                  direction, not least because it looks as though it will
                  save so much time. It is not a direction to which we feel
                  able to agree as matters stand, my Lord.

                       The reason for that is not that we wish to be
                  obstructive, but it is because we have not had a disclosure
                  of witness statements, and my Lord, we do not know,
     E            therefore, the  full extent to which any challenge of the
                  findings of fact may have to be made. We may know the hard
                  core of the challenge, but we do not know the full extent.
                 We find, therefore, that is not a direction to which we can
                  agree. On the    other hand, we will respond constructively
                  to a notice to admit facts of the kind envisaged, and if it
                  is agreed the timetable which was proposed, my Lord, which
     P           was talked about to have a response by the end of January.
                  That would allow us an opportunity to reflect upon
                  discovery witness statements and experts' statements.

                         So far as the transcript is concerned, we agree to
                  the direction which is sought; that that is proper evidence
                  of the facts.

     q                 As to the amendments, we have no objection to the
                  proposed amendments the Plaintiff seeks, but we ask for
                  consequent leave to amend the defence of the Third
                  Defendants if so advised.

                       May I turn to a part of the case where we are asking
                  the Court's assistance.  It relates to a request for
                  further and better particulars the Third Defendants have
     H           made and the Plaintiff's statement of claim.

(


                       May I draw your Lordship's attention to the allegation
                  made against the Third Defendants in the statement of
                  claim. I only have that in the original form, not the
                  amended form. It arises in paragraph 10, page 10 of the
                  pleading: the particulars of negligence of the Third
                  Defendants.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Yes.
    B
            MR. MAXWELL: Perhaps it would be better if I invited your
                lordship to read them, rather than for me to read them out.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              I have already looked through them.

            MR. MAXWELL: May I refer your Lordship to the answer which has
                been supplied to a request for further and better
    C           particulars.  I do not know if that is on the Court's file.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              No, I think I may have this.   I have not
                read it.

            MR. MAXWELL:         It was very recently served: 24th October.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Well then, no.
    D
            MR. MAXWELL: I am handing to your Lordship a copy of the
                identical reply received in the Rimmer case.

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Thank you.   Yes.

            MR. MAXWELL: Your Lordship will see the answer given at the
                very end of this document (This was read)

                       If your Lordship would refer to the defence of the
                  Second Defendants.  It is on the last page of the defence.

            MR.    JUSTICE ROSE:           Just a moment.     Yes.

            MR.    MAXWELL: Particulars of negligence of the Third
    P              Defendants set out at    A as against the    Third Defendants.
                  The Second Defendants will have answered adopting and
                  relying upon the allegations pleaded against the Third
                  Defendants in sub- paragraph 8 inclusive of the statement
                  of claim. It would seem not to be an open avenue, but a
                  cul-de-sac in the terms as pleaded, so we would like to
                  direct an impasse. The way is not for the Plaintiff to be
                  required to provide us with particulars, and for things to
    q             be put upon the Plaintiff to seek those particulars those
                  particulars by whatever route is available.

                       My Lord I am sorry to go back and forth, but when
                  I read to your Lordship the response to the request for
                  particulars which began with the Third Defendants. They
                  know the allegations are those initially made, and we do
                  not know what is being talked about, except having heard
    H             what has been said and seen the order made the last time.


                                                        28.

.             We now appreciate that there was some discussion as to the
              position of the Second Defendants in terms of blaming other
              parties. What we would like to know, and so we can prepare
              our witness statements, is the answer to the request for
              further and better particulars. We would like to have
              further and specific information so that we may then
              approach the relevant witnesses.

B                  That is the position, and we invite the Court to make
              an order in respect of that request for further and better
              particulars, if your Lordship thought that was a sensible
              idea. It is the consequential effect upon the order made
              in relation to the witness statements of fact and, my Lord,
              the disclosure there was to be within I think it is six
              weeks of the close of pleadings.

c       MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Yes, that is right.

        MR. MAXWELL: We think we would be able to make that and shall
            be complying with that; but the request for further and
            better particulars may produce information which requires
            additional evidence from witnesses, and we would like to
            add a further order to add this: that there should be
            liberty - at least for the Third Defendants - liberty for
D           the Third Defendants to serve additional statements of fact
            within 28 days of service of the further and better
            particulars and the statement of claim.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:  Is it necessary to do that, Mr. Maxwell?
            Could the case not be   left to the good sense of the
            parties? Nobody will   be critical if --

E       MR. MAXWELL:  I will rest content with your Lordship's
            observation which I am sure will not be gain sayed by
            anybody here. I do not think I can assist your Lordship
            further.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Thank you.    Yes, Mr. Fenwick?

p       MR. FENWICK: The first and most important matter is the
            question of the date of trial.

                   Clearly, we recognise the importance of getting on
              with these proceedings as fast as possible, and the last
              thing we want to do is to delay them unless it is
              absolutely necessary:but the context of   the claim made by
              the Plaintiffs, and as my learned friend Mr. Hytner has
G             indicated effectively at the behest of other defendants, is
              against a professional firm, and largely against one
              professional man: Dr. Eastwood.

                   These allegations against a professional man are all
              the more serious because of the very grave nature of the
              events that occurred. For that reason, in our submission,
              Dr. Eastwood and the Fourth Defendants are entitled to have



                                                    29.
D.L.SELLERS & Co. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




               a full and proper opportunity before of preparing their
A              case fully and of being properly represented.

                    My Lord, thedifficulty that we face in an early trial
               date is two fold.   First and foremost, and I accept it
               straightaway, there is a difficulty for my learned friend
               Mr. Tilson in attending. My Lord, he has other commitments
               throughout the summer until October.
B
                    On investigation, the one which at present it appears
               that he may not properly be able to return, is a six veek
               case on 30th April, which should leave him free to start on
               18th June. So my Lord, at the moment, having due regard to
               various commitments, unless released, or unless that case
               settles, it is unlikely that he would be able to attend to
               represent the Fourth Defendant if the trial began before
q             18th June. My Lord, it is possible that he might even then
               be embarrassed either by that or other case.

                    It is not simply a matter of the convenience of
               counsel. Dr. Eastwood and the Fourth Defendant effectively
               were involved in the enquiry at a relatively late stage,
               and others of those represented were present throughout
               from the outset. My Lord, Dr. Eastwood received an
D             indication by way of letter at a comparatively late stage,
               and appointed my learned friend Mr. Tilson for their part
               of the proceedings.  In other words, it was necessary to
               catch up, and those representing him not done and were not
               able to hear much of the evidence. It is on that occasion
               my learned friend Mr. Tilson alone represented Dr.
               Eastwood. He had no junior.

E                   My Lord for that reason it is a case where in my
               submission, it is particularly important that due regard
               should be had, if possible, of allowing the Fourth
               Defendant to be represented by my learned friend Mr.
               Tilson, but it goes further than that because of the
               difficulty of catching up with Fourth Defendant, but anyway
               because the Fourth Defendant was involved in these
               proceedings at a later stage. It was only after the last
               summons it was intimated that they were going to be joined.
               We did not attend, so my Lord, we have to catch up in the
               proceedings anyway.

                    If the effect of your Lordship's order as to trial
               date effectively means that the Fourth Defendants cannot
               rely on the attendance of my learned friend Mr. Tilson at
q             trial, during the preparation stage, as your Lordship vill
               imagine on an enquiry, one is very much working very
               closely with the client day by day, hour by hour. The time
               for somebody else to catch up would be all the greater.
               Your Lordship knows the difficulty and the ways that can be
               overcome.

                    My Lord, the other matters which in our submission
H             make it difficult for the Fourth Defendant to be able to


                                         30.
D.L. SELLERS & CO. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




              proceed towards trial with quite the speed of the other
A            defendants, apart from our late joining of them in the
              enquiry and in the proceedings, is the uncertainty as to
              the nature of the allegation against us, and what we are
              going to have to do by way of investigation, and reading
              the transcript, and reading the witness statements, and
              those parts of the evidence that we are not as yet familiar
              with. I say that for this reason: your Lordship has heard
g            that in the case of Chapman currently before your Lordship,
              we were joined at the end of July, beginning of August
              after the last direction.

                   It was intimated to us that at all times until, I
              think, about the middle of September, that although we were
              involved in that action, it was not expected by the
              Plaintiffs that we would be in the second action in
C            relation to pen A. In the event, for reasons which I
              understand may be similar, all those involved are joined in
              the Chapman action. We were, in fact, joined in that pen A
              action, but it was intimated to us that we were unlikely to
              be involved in the third action which has not yet been
              formulated against those, or relating to those injured
              outside the ground.

D                  As we now understand it, not at the behest of the
              Plaintiff, but as I understand it at the behest of one of
              the other defendants, it is likely we are going to be
              involved in that action also. At present we cannot, with
              great respect, for the life of us see what it is about Dr.
              Eastwood and his firm which could give rise to a joinder in
              that action. Clearly it has to be hoped that all the
              actions can be dealt with at the same time, but until we
E            know what is going to be said to us, even in the most
              general terms, it is very difficult for us to assess the
              time that it will take to prepare for trial.

                   My Lord, that, in my submission, indicates that our
              concern should be viewed sympathetically. It now appears
              (I hope I am right in saying this) that all parties are
F            effectively agreed that the trial date would be better in
              June than April or May. If it was April or May, in my
              submission we simply would not be confident of telling the
              court we could get there in time. In June my Lord, it is
              going to be difficult, but we do not want to hold the trial
              up. If your Lordship feels an October date is too late --

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               I do.
G
        MR. FENWICK: We would ask your Lordship to consider the
            estimate of length is five to six weeks. For our part we
            say nothing to suggest that is wrong. To start on 18th
            June would allow six weks before the end of term.

        MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               Only just.

SELLERS & Co. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




    MR. FENWICK: I accept that. It is possible for my learned
        friend Mr. Tilson to absent himself from week one, and
        attend thereafter; but if one is concerned with the proper
        presentation, in my submission the Fourth Defendant is at
        least entitled to that indulgence, provided your Lordship
        is satisfied he is not going to cause substantial hardship
        to the Plaintiff or other defendants. In my submission
        that type of adjournment is unlikely to do so. Of course,
        for our part would be content to undertake if any
        circumstances showed we could get there earlier, we would
        bring it to the attention of the Plaiantiff without delay.

               Unless I can assist your Lordship further, those are
          my submnissions as to the trial date.

    MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Thank you very much.

    MR. FENWICK: So far as the report of Lord Justice Taylor is
        concerned, we welcome the approach that this document
        should be before the trial judge and should, as far as
        possible, allow uncontested issues of fact to go before the
        court without the need to call oral evidence. Clearly a
        waste of time and resources that that should happen if not
        absolutely essential.  It may be that there is no need for
        me to address your Lordship at length in view of the lack
        of agreement from other parties, and lack of jurisdiction.

               May I make our position clear. We are sympathetic,
          and would like to be able to agree to this. We have two
          concerns, and we regard one as important and the other as
          sensible and convenient. They can both be resolved by
          organisation, and the Plaintiff indicating simply by
          underlining or sidelining passages in the report; those
          primary findings of fact on which they would seek to rely
          at trial.

               We are asking for that for two reasons, the first
          which I say is the important one, is that many findings of
          fact are quite clearly that; findings of fact. On one
          view, it could be thought a finding of fact, and on another
          view it could be seen as an inference, or indeed as a
          conclusion. We think that it is going to be important that
          any dispute as to what the findings of fact going before
          the court are are resolved before the trial, and not at
          thetrial, so there is no doubt, and the Plaintiff cannot
          say this is a primary finding of fact one or other of
          thedefendants wished to test; not it is a conclusion.   It
          seems to us that it does not take time, or any significant
          time,on the part of the Plaintiffs, and would lead to the
          simplification of the issues at trial.

               The second point is this: that             so far as the Fourth
          Defendant is concerned, I have made             clear our lack of
          familiarity.  In order to assist us             in arrive speedily in
          our preparation for trial, my Lord,             it would be helpful to
          us to know which of the matters the             Plaintiff seeks to rely
    D.L.SELLERS & Co. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




    A            on. This can be put against any defendant. I do not seek
                 to ask him to put which defendant he relies on those facts
                 for; just so we know which areas of the transcript we have
                 to look at closely; which witnesses we have to look at
                 closely; and can put to one side those matters which are
                 not going to be in issue at the trial. Subject to that,
                 our present view is that we would very much hope to be able
                 to consent in the present terms sought.
    B
                      My Lord, as far as the expert investigations are
                 concerned, we think it may be difficult to meet the date of
                 10th January which presently stands under the order.   I do
                 not make an application at this stage. I would very much
                 hope that at least we could say secure the evidence with
                 that exchange of expert report say not less than three
                 months before the trial, which would be a satisfactory
C                period in my submission. That would either, of course, be
                 about 2nd March or 16th March if your Lordship acceded to
                 my earlier submission.

                      So far as the pleadings and the further   and better
                 particulars (which are an issue raised by my   learned friend
                 for the Third Defendant) and the third party   litigation is
                 concerned, they are intertwined. May I deal    with them
D               together.

                      As your Lordship has heard on the Plaintiffs in their
                 first statement of claim adopted by anticipation the
                 allegations against the Third and Fourth Defendants which
                 they expected to be made not otherwise by way of third
                 party proceedings by the First or Second Defendants.   That
„               placed them in some difficulty as to particulars, and
                 clearly both the Third Defendant and the Fourth Defendants
                 are going to have to have these particulars by one means or
                 another.   I anticipate we will be in a similar position to
                 my learned friend for the Third Defendants where further
                 and better particulars we have add nothing. The statement
                 of claim is about to be amended so we did not serve two
                 documents.
F
                      The point that I sought to make with my learned friend
                 Mr. Hytner and his junior in relation to the pleadings was
                 this: if your Lordship would be kind enough to look at the
                 second Third Party notice which was just put before your
                 Lordship.

           MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               Yes.
G
           MR. HYTNER: May I save time. This is going to mean a little
               more work for Mr. King, but we give in.

           MR. FENWICK:  I am grateful for that. That being the case,
               once these allegations are properly pleaded in the
               statement of claim, we can plead to them by way of amended
               defence and I would seek the consequent order as my learned
H              friend has, and proceed to the particulars of the


                                                  33.
SELLERS & Co. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




          Plaintiff. Once that is in place, it becomes unnecessary
          for me to make a submission on the third party directions
          which I otherwise would have had to. Clearly they should
          be properly pleaded, because we are pleading to them as
          against the Plaintiff. It seems to us that once they form
          part of the Plaintiff’s case, then there is nothing new or
          additional in the third party notice, and therefore, no
          requirement for any pleadings; so once that is in place, I
          support my learned friend Mr. Glasgow’s submission, and
          there is no need for your Lordship to make any further
          direction.

                  Unless I can assist further, that is my submission.

    MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Do you want to say anything else about the
        wisdom of making an order on the third party proceedings,
        Mr. Woodward?

    MR. WOODWARD: I they are going to re-cast third party
        proceedings, it may be unnecessary. With respect the third
        party matter is properly brought despite the persuasive --

    MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Never mind that: why should I make the
        order?

    MR. WOODWARD: If the pleadings are re-cast in the form
        contemplated --

    MR. JUSTICE ROSE: They are going to be proper particulars given
        in so far as they are required.

    MR. WOODWARD: My Lord, if that is the order, then I am not
        making any application. I will not pursue it.

    MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Thank you. Mr. Hytner, what about the time
        scale so far as those further particulars are concerned?

    MR. HYTNER: Fairly equal.   Can I deal with the re-casting of
        the amendments to statement of claim?

                  To deal with Mr. Fenwick’s point, if he wants it
           done in that form, it will be. If he finds it easier to
           plead, we will do it. I have leave to amend the statement
           of claim; also the document in accordance with the
           amendment that has already been sought; plus the additional
           amendment, and both go on the amended statement of claim.

                As for the point made by Mr. Maxwell, I have sympathy
           with his application.  To make this absolutely plain, I
           have done this on the transcript now I think three times,
           but I do not want the Plaintiff to be involved in any
           argument on costs at the termination of this litigation.

                It is the Plaintiff's primary case that the First and
           or Second Defendants are liable to the Plaintiff. We would
           not have been bringing in the Third or Fourth Defendants
     D.L.SELLERS & Co. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND
7'




                  had we not been told that they were going to be made third
                  and fourth parties. It was by agreement with all parties
                  that it was accepted that we would re-serve the statement
                  of claim to effect third party proceedings in relation to
                  the Third Defendants. We were slightly bothered to find
                  the form in which they were blamed by the Second Defendants
                  because the words "if necessary" were inserted.

     B                 Now, it is perfectly clear, and we wish to make it
                  clear, that we will now seek from Mr. Glasgow the
                  particulars of the allegations sought by the Third
                  Defendants. My Lord, if the Second Defendants are not
                  serious in their allegations against the Third Defendants,
                  we will drop the claim against them. It is as simple as
                  that, and Mr. Maxwell will have his particulars by one
                  route or another.  If he does not, the case will disappear
     q            against him. That can be dealt with between whom there has
                  been total and complete co-operation for the last three or
                  four months; so there is no need for your Lordship to make
                  any further orders on that indication. Can I deal first of
                  all, if necessary, with the application for stay?

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               No.

     D      MR. HYTNER: Can I deal with the question of the form in which
                admitted facts; our notice to --

            MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               Yes.

            MR. HYTNER: Without consent, nothing can be done save for the
                procedures, the appropriate procedures to be gone through,
                and we will go through it --
     E
            MR. JUSTICE ROSE: I am minded                 to order statement of facts
                within 28 days, and notice                of those in dispute by 31st
                January.

            MR. HYTNER:         I see.        Now —

     P      MR. JUSTICE ROSE:               Are you seeking to dissuade me?

            MR. HYTNER:         No.

            MR.    JUSTICE ROSE: I do not             need to hear further comment.

            MR.    HYTNER: Just an indication so my friends know this: that
                  we will not be seeking to have facts admitted which will,
     G            as it were, improve on theliability of the Third and
                  Fourth --

            MR.    JUSTICE ROSE: You must put in your notice of fact, and               you
                  must tell Mr. Glasgow. You do not need to tell me.

            MR. HYTNER: Can I deal with one other matter; something which
                may cause a little bit of a problem if it is not dealt with
     H          early; and that is the status of Lord Justice Taylor's


                                                        35.

               report.   It clearly can not have, as it were, any
               beneficial status once one party objects, but my Lord,
               plainly; but is Mr. Woodward saying that there must be a
               pretence that it does not exist? Either the judge had read
               it, or he has not. If Mr. Woodward feels it is wrpng for
               the judge to have read the report, we have to find a judge
               who has not. The danger is this: you need only read the
               newspapers which is often very dangerous.
B
         MR. JUSTICE ROSE: Pretty unlikely he could remember what he
             read in newspapers.
         MR. HYTNER: Some of the headlines stay with some people for
             ever, but surely Mr. Woodward would agree even --
         MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              Mr. Woodward indicated he would not agree.
         MR. HYTNER: My Lord, that I accept; but are we to understand
             that it could never be referred to during the course of the
             hearing?
         MR. JUSTICE ROSE:              That is a matter decided by the trial judge.

                    There will be leave for the Plaintiff to amend the
D              Statement of Claim which will incorporate such amendments -
               apart from those presently before me - as are necessary to
               particularise the Plaintiff's case against the third and
               fourth Defendants. Leave to serve and make those will be
               made within 7 days. Leave to amend and serve any
               consequential amended defence within 7 days thereafter.

                    So far as the application for stay is concerned, I am
               not persuaded that the possibility of junior officers
               making further statements upon which the first Defendants
               may wish to rely is a sufficient ground for ordering a stay
               in this case.

                    So far as the conduct of the criminal and disciplinary
               investigations are concerned, they are investigating
               matters wholly different from those which will have to be
               determined in this litigation. Thereis no present
               indication as to when those enquiries will be completed,
               and I am not persuaded that such small theoretical
               prejudice is important, according to the first Defendants,
               as a jurisdiction in all the circumstances of this case for
               ordering these proceedings to be stayed.

                    The case will be fixed for trial on 11th June 1990 at
               Liverpool. I order that a Statement of Facts be served on
               the Plaintiffs within 28 days; that any party disputing
               those facts will serve notice of that dispute by 31st
               January 1990. I make no variation in relation to the order
               made by Mr. Justice Steyn as to the disclosure of expert
               evidence, it being accepted by everyone in these
               proceedings that some modest delay in the timetable there

                     result of bona fides.
                          So far as the transcript of the proceedings before the
                     Enquiry is concerned, I direct that that should be admitted
                     as a true record of what was said at the Enquiry. So far
                     as the third party proceedings are concerned, I make no

                     are concerned, I give liberty to apply either to myself, or

       Mr. HYTNER:  May it please your Lordship, in this case  I appear
           with my learned friend Mr. King on behalf of the plaintiffs.
 A         The first defendants are represented by my learned friend
           Mr. Payne;  the second defendants by my learned friends
           Mr. Glasgow and Mr. Davies;  the third defendants are not
           represented but the first defendant's solicitors have
           authority to give indications on their behalf;  and the
           fourth defendants are represented by my learned friend Mr.
           Fenwick.

 B                 My Lord, the first matter to be dealt with is that by
              consent there should be an order that the action by the
              plaintiffs against the first defendant should be stayed on
              terms endorsed in a letter dated 15th December 1989 wh ich
              has been exhibited before your Lordship, and a further
              letter dated 20th December 1989 which has not been exhibited
              but which merely relates to a matter of costs.

C      Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:                Yes.

       Mr. HYTNER:  The costs of the action, which include the costs
           incurred in suing the second, third and fourth defendants,
           to be paid by the first defendants.

       Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:                Yes.

^      Mr. HYTNER:    And the plaintiffs' costs.   The consequential order
            that I ask for is this:    that the action of the plaintiffs
            against the second, third and   fourth defendants should be
            discontinued, that I should have leave to discontinue, and
            I have instructions which enable me to give an undertaking
            that the plaintiffs, that is to say Mrs. Rimmer and Mrs.
            Chapman, will not bring further proceedings against the
E           second, third and fourth defendants, but I have no such
            instructions which enable me to give a general undertaking
            on behalf of all plaintiffs.    The position is that if a
            substantial number of plaintiffs are able to give that
            undertaking, none of the second, third and fourth defendants
           will seek costs against the plaintiff.     If not, they will seek
            an order for costs, and in such circumstances I would then .
            ask for an indemnity of those costs against the first
F          defendant, and in those circumstances I understand that
           what my learned friends are seeking is that the costs of
            the discontinued order shall be reserved and dealt with at
            a future date.

       Mr.     JUSTICE STEYN:            And you agree     with that course, do you?

       Mr.     PAYNE:     I am content with that           order,     my Lord.
VJ

       Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:                Very well.

       Mr. HYTNER:   My Lord, there are two other matters to be                         dealt
           with.   One of those matters, namely the question of                         the
            trust deed, I can deal with when my learned friends                        have
            gone.  They need not be here for that, and it would                        not be
jj         fair to keep   them.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:                Yes

     Mr,    HYNTER:   The other matter  concerns the date of the 19th
            June.   It was always anticipated that th ere would be
            remoteness of damage test cases heard at the conclusion
            of the existing actions, and I am now in a position to be
            able to tell your Lordship that there is an existing case
            of Stephen Jones v. The Chief Constable, the Writ having
            been issued yesterday, the 19th December     That is in
B           respect of one test action.   There are, I think, n i ne te en
            categories of remoteness of damage cases , and in five of
            them the first defendant has agreed to c ompensate, so there
            is no test case in those categories, but the remaining
            categories will the subject of test case s .

     Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN:             Yes

     Mr.   HYTNER:  The first defendant, the only existing defendant
           in those cases, has agreed for it to be said that the only
           issues which will be raised are remoteness of damage and
           proof of injury and quantum and proof of injury.  Q ua nt um
           will not necessarily be heard in the test case; the only
           issue is remoteness of damage, and there will be no n eed
           for pleadings.  It will be an Order 18 case and there should
           be no difficulty in getting those ready.
D
     Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:               Will there be any need for oral evidence
           in those cases?

     Mr.   HYTNER:       No, my Lord,         I should not think so.

     Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:              It is really legal argument.

     Mr. HYTNER:         Yes .

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:   It is not strictly a question of remoteness;
         it is duty of c a r e .

     Mr. HYTNER:         Yes, my- Lord - no duty of care and public policy.

     Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:              Yes.

     Mr. HYTNER:  I understand that there will be a disagreement
         between the defendants as to what should happen on the 19th
         June, and my situation is that if the 19th June is v ac a te d
         as a date for the consideration of the issues between the
         defendants, we would like the remoteness of damage cases
         heard on the 19th June.

     Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN:             Yes.

     Mr. HYTNER:  If, on the other hand, the 19th June is to remain
         as a date for the disposal of the third party proceedings,
         then we would not want to float behind those cases but we
         would then ask your Lordship to fix the remoteness of damage
         cases for the first week of the Michaelmas Term.

      Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  It seems to me that the sensible course is
A         to retain the date of the 19th June and deal with the points,
          and the other proceedings must go to a later date.

      Mr. HYTNER:  I am wholly neutral on that, my Lord, and I leave
          it for my learned friends to consider.

      Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:                So that is the point that I need to rule on.

B     Mr. HYTNER:          Yes, my Lord.

      Mr     JUSTICE STEYN:  Namely, that the nervous shock cases will
             go ahead on those dates.  Will there still be a hearing of
             six weeks?

      Mr. HYTNER:  No, my Lord, .in the nervous              shock cases,   five days
          at the most.

      Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:   I suppose it depends on whether there will
          be oral evidence.

      Mr     HYTNER:  I anticipate that no oral evidence will be given,
             my Lord, because the test cases will be taken from known
             instances of where plaintiffs were and where their relatives
             were, and where they saw it and heard it.  I doubt w he th er
D            oral evidence will be required for  the purpose of the test
             cases.

      Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  In relation to those nervous shock cases,
          I do not want to make a suggestion about how the hearing
          should be presented, but is that something which can be
          discussed later on today and w orked out? Is there something
          to be said for the plaintiffs in those cases putting in
          a skeleton argument, perhaps?

      Mr. HYTNER:  Yes, we anticipate that the facts on which each
          case is brought should be in the form of a letter which
          indicates the issue as well - and that is the sort of Order
          18 material - and I anticipate that there will be a skeleton
          argument in the end, which would help.

      Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  It would be helpful to the trial judge                 to
          have a bundle of photocopies of judgments.

      Mr. HYTNER:          Yes, my Lord.

      Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:                It will no doubt speed it up.

      Mr. HYTNER:    I have not yet done the research, and we may have
          to go back, but the leading case at the moment is M cL ough li n
          and O' Br ie n, and I think everything will start from there.
          It is a question of how the courts will apply the present
          known principles to modern circumstances that have not yet
          come before the courts, namely what happens when you see
          something on     television, or a re-run on television, and
          so on.

                                                             *6?




     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  In a case where there is so much involved,
A        I would not be surprised if counsel do not look at the
         Australian and American cases.

     Mr. HYNTER:  Yes,           I think there is going to have to be some      legal
         archaeology.

     Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN:              Yes,   I think so.

B    Mr.   PAYNE:   My Lord, the first defendant asks you to make an
           order in accordance with your provisional view, that is to
           say, we agree with the plaintiff that the date of the 19th
           June should be kept open, should it become necessary for
           litigation about any of the remoteness of damage cases, and
           so we agree with that.    In relation to the rest of the
           action, the question of the contribution between the
           defendants, we   agree and request that the date of the 19th
           June should be   vacated for that trial and that no further
           order should be made about the date of the trial.

     Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:  I am not so sure about that.  I do not think
           it would be terribly fair.  There is a date for it, and if
           I vacated that date, I think I would have to say the
           beginning of October, or whatever date turns out to be
           reasonable.

     Mr.   PAYNE:  We ask your Lordship not to fix a date at the moment.
           I understand that this is contentious, and I put before your
           Lordship the arguments which we think arrive at the
           conclusion at the moment that no date should be fixed for
           the trial of the substantive issues.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:                You are for the first defendants?

     Mr.   PAYNE:     That is right, my Lord.

     Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:              And you want contribution proceedings?

     Mr.   PAYNE:      Yes.

F    Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:  Your client's m in d has been concentrated by
           earlier orders, and if I fix a date, your client's mind
           will be concentrated on the contribution proceedings. W h y
           do you have an interest in not having a fixed date?

     Mr.   PAYNE.  My Lord, because the position has changed considerably
           since the matter last came before the court.   The great
           interest then was that the plaintiffs should be provided
           for by getting the case on at an early date, but the
           situation now is that the first defendant has taken what
           we hope your Lordship   will think is a responsible initiative
           in the case which involves a considerable amount of w o r k in
           dealing with the very large number of cases which will n o w
           be presented to us.   The only thing which now remains to be
           tried by the court is the question of apportionment of the
           money between the defendants.   So, with respect, it has
           moved from the position of being a case where it was v er y
           much in the public interest and a matter of urgency to put
           it before the court to the ---

D.l—'SELLERS & Co. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:             But what is your interest   in putting off that
         date?

     Mr.   PAYNE:  The principal reasons are that there are investigations
           proceeding at the moment which will eventually lead to a case
           being put before the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide
           whether there should be criminal proceedings arising out of
           this event, and your Lordship knows that those investigations
           are being directed against various officers employed by the
B          police authority.  This matter was canvassed before Mr. Justice
           Rose on the 26th October, the result being that at the
           moment the first defendant is bereft of any statements or
           means of investigation of the case, because naturally those
           who are under threat of criminal proceedings are not
           disposed to co-operate with those responsible for the c iv il
           action, and so this ser,ious handicap in the p re se ntation of
           the  Chief Constable's case was exercised before Mr. Justice
C          Rose on the last occasion in support of an application for
           a stay of proceedings or that a later date should be fixed.
           It did not work in front of Mr. Justice Rose, quite
           understandably, because of the overriding interests of the
           plaintiffs and the court thought it was better that the
           interests of the plaintiffs should be brought forward.

    Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:   Can you imagine the position that the club
^       would find itself in if there was an immense delay and an
         enormous claim hanging over them and they went to their
         bank manager asking for an overdraft?  They must have an
         enormous interest in finality.

     Mr. PAYNE:   Yes, my Lord, indeed, and we hope that your Lordship
         will look favourably upon the position of^ the Chief
£        Constable also, who is making provision for compensation
          to be paid not only to the plaintiffs but to many others
         who have not brought actions.   Your Lordship  has seen the
          terms of the letter.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:             Yes.

     Mr. PAYNE:    In our respectful submission, the voice of the Chief
p        Constable should be heard powerfully when he says that he
          should not be forced to conduct his claim for contribution
          against the defendants under the serious handicap that he
          does not have available to him essential evidence to run
          his case. That may not have worked when the court had to
          consider the interests of the plaintiffs, but when it n o w
          has to consider the interests of the person who has made
          provision for the plaintiffs, our submission is that the
G        point now has more weight than it may have had before Mr.                    i
          Justice Rose.

                 My Lord, on the merits point, perhaps I may deal w it h
            the other matters.  Your Lordship will probably know that
            the inquest has not yet been held.  The attitude of the
            Coroner is that he has not fixed a date and is waiting to
            hear the result of the investigations into the criminal
^          matter and the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions
            as to whether there is to be a criminal action.  In the

                                                 5.
D.L.*SELLERS & Co. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




            meantime, the Coroner has selected a significant amount of
             evidence which is going to be relevant to the question of
A           apportionment between the defendants.   We anticipate,
             regrettably, that one of the matters which may have to be
             canvassed in the trial is the whereabouts of the various
             people who died and who were injured in the pens, and we
             anticipate that this may be a matter which will have to be
             explored on the question of causation, because the barrier
            which failed is the subject of considerable interest, and
            we cannot get that evidence at the moment, my Lord, because
B           the Coroner is withholding information.

                  There is a letter here which, as your Lordship can see,
             is addressed to the Coroner which shows that we are not to
             be allowed access to that information.   (H a n d e d ) . Will your
             Lordship also be good enough to look at a letter which we
             have received from Mr. Mervyn Jones, the Assistant Chief
             Constable of the Hillsborough Inquiry team, which I can hand
C           up, which deals with the release of statements - it is the
             11th December - which m y learned friends have not seen, but
             it has been passing between us and Mr. Mervyn Jones.         May
             I say that it is written in response to our attempts to get
             hold of evidence in order to get on with the contribution
             proceedings. (Ha nd ed ) .

D     Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:              Yes.

      Mr.   PAYNE:    Your Lordship will see that he says that the decisi on
            of the Chief Constable is hoped to be by the spring of next
            year.  This is why we are in the slightly unusual position
            that it is we who wish to  pursue the contribution proceedings
            ultimately against the co-defendants but we are significantly
            hampered by not being able to correspond — -

      Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN:  Can you give any prediction as to the year
             in which those difficulties may disappear?

      Mr.    PAYNE:        We are in the hands of others,           as your Lordship can
             see.

      Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN:             Itcould be 1991     or 1993.

      Mr.    PAYNE:     The matter             is out of our hands, my Lord.

      Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN:             Yes.

      Mr.   PAYNE:  There are perhaps more matters whi ch we think are
            of importance, but since we have agreed to make provision
            for the plaintiffs, it is now we who will be proceeding
            with the claim for contribution, and therefore we wish to
            have the opportunity to present the claim in our own way,
            which is not necessarily the way in w hich the plaintiffs
            have presented their claim against the various defendants.
            Our understanding of the position between the defendants
            is that there is no live third party action between ourselves
            and the co-defendants.  We did i s s u e a T h i r d P a r t y Notice
            and a Summons for Third Party Directions, which was before
H           Mr. Justice Rose on the 26th October.      The matter was

                                                    6.
D.L; SELLERS & Co. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




            canvassed as to the state of the action and the upshot was
            that Mr. Justice Rose made no order on our application for
A          third party directions.  We understand, therefore, that our
            third party proceedings are described as a nullity and
            therefore there is no issue between us.

     Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN;               And what about the contribution proceedings?

     Mr.    PAYNE:   Perhaps I ought to call them contribution proceedings.
           That is what I mean by third party proceedings.    So at the
B          moment there is no contribution action on foot between ourselves
           and the defendants.

     Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN:          What about      the third party notice?   Was
            that served?

     Mr. PAYNE:        Yes, my Lord.

C    Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:             And did Mr.    Justice Rose make any order on
          that?

     Mr.    PAYNE:      No, my Lord.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  So it is still extant and I am still in a
         position to make directions on it, if appropriate.

^    Mr. PAYNE:   The position is that the matter was before the court
         on our application at that time, because it was our application
          for third party directions, and in the result the learned
         judge made no order.

     Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:  But Mr. Justice Rose was focusing on the
           main matter, the interests of the victims.
E
     Mr. PAYNE:   Yes.  We think that the result of the refusal to
         make third party directions is that the third party notice
          is a nullity.

     Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:  Is there anything in Mr. Justice Rose's                  order
           about the third party directions?  Does it say, "Third
           party direction refused"?   What does the order say?
F
     Mr.    PAYNE:    Mr. Justice Rose made no order on the third party
            dir ec tio ns.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:                 So they are still extant?

     Mr. PAYNE:   I wonder if your Lordship  would be kind enough to
          look at this authority - a decision of Judge Noone?  (Handed).

     Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:           Yes.      Here there was a refusal - is that
           right?

     Mr.   PAYNE:       Yes.

     Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:  There was an application for third party_
           directions and the learned judge declined to give directions;
           but until  somebody shows me an order, I assume that Mr.
           Justice Rose did not refuse.  He simply made no order.

     Mr.    PAYNE: Will your Lordship accept this copy?    (H a n d e d )

A    Mr.    JUSTICE            STEYN:     Thank you.

     Mr.    PAYNE: That is our position, my Lord, that there is no
           third party action at the moment on foot between ourselves
           and the co-defendants.   Now, if your Lordship ---

     Mr.     JUSTICE STEYN: If I am against you on that, you      are       not
g          asking to withdraw them?

     Mr.    PAYNE:     Yes, we will.

     Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN:          Will you?

     Mr.     PAYNE: Yes, my Lord.   We would much rather that the situation
            was observed on its merits and the Chief Constable be given
C          credit for the initiative that he has taken and be allowed
            to conduct the third party action in the way that he wishes,
            but if that is not so, then we will have to discontinue.

     Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:   And there will be an application for costs
           against you for striking out, presumably.

     Mr.     PAYNE: We are anxious not to have to reach   that position
D          unless we have to.

     Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:           I follow.

     Mr.    PAYNE:  The position in relation to the third party proceedings
            is that the third party notice is very short in form.    It
            does no more than repeat the terms of the Statement of Claim
            and to add one further point which it is possible to say is
k          already pleaded in the Statement of Claim.    It was thought
            that the point could be made more precisely, and therefore
            that is why it is stated in the third party notice.   No
            defence has been served to any of the third party notices
            and, as we understand the rules, until such a defence is
            served, those proceedings can be discontinued, and this has
            no effect on the position of the plaintiffs or in this case
P          the defendants commencing a new action; but, as I    say, we
            are anxious not to reach that stage, anxious not to do that.

     Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:  On that point, I appreciate it is in the
           power of those defendants to issue a process asking for
           declarations of non-liability, and you will be in the same
           position.

G    Mr.   PAYNE:  This is why we are anxious that the matter should
           be seen on its merits.  The action as it stands before the
           court at the moment, as your Lordship knows, is in the form
           of two separate actions, one by Mrs. Chapman and one by
           Mrs. Rimmer.  We do not think that within those actions
           all the issues which will arise in the contribution
           proceedings are included.  We think that if those actions
           had to proceed, the result would not be to produce a decision
H          which could be applied to all the cases which we have now
           taken the burden to discharge. We think the result wo ul d be

                                                8.
    D.L.'SELLERS & Co. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




                a fragmentation of the proceedings, and we think that a
                lot of the matters will not be covered and adjudicated upon
    A          in the present form of the two actions.

                      We agree with the plaintiffs that we should proceed
                as lead actions, but there is no corresponding agreement
                between the defendants, and we hope that this point can
                adequately be explained to your Lordship by me. Although
                it was agreed with the plaintiffs that Chapman and Rimmer
                should be treated as lead actions, that was an agreement
    B          with the plaintiffs, and the other defendants also made
                similar agreements with the plaintiffs, but when it comes
                to apportionment, quite different considerations apply.
                At the moment there is no agreement between the defendants
                that that should   be the case, and if the co-defendants
                offer to agree that these two actions should decide certain
               matters, we would be very glad to talk about it, but we
               have had no such approach made.    The kind of thing whi ch
               will be relevant in the contribution proceedings, we
               anticipate, is what was the cause of one death or batch
                of deaths or all deaths, because it is not necessarily going
                to follow that if one party can be blamed for having caused
               or contributed to a particular death, that would    nec es sa ri ly
                follow in the case of others.   These are points which we
                think are going to have to be adjudicated upon in the
j)             absence of agreement, and we do not know what our case is
               going to be, of course, because we do not have access to
                the information in the hands of the Coroner and the
                investigating officer, so we ourselves do not know the
               whereabouts or whether itis possible to establish    the
               whereabouts of significant numbers of people who died.
               This is going to be a relevant issue in the litigation on
                the question of the failure of the barrier and the question
E              of provsion of means of escape in the pens, and we are
               quite sure that the Chapman and Rimmer actions will not
               provide a sufficient vehicle to enable the points to be
               decided on the question of apportionment.

         Mr.     JUSITCE STEYN:             Yes.

         Mr.    PAYNE: There is one last matter that I would like to raise,
F               if I may, and it is a practical matter.    June is a short
               time away and the Chief Constable has undertaken the
               burden now of paying compensation to claimants who we
               understand may run up to about 1,000 in number.     The volume
               of work in dealing with those claims and in making sure
               that we are able to arm ourselves    with the evidence w hi c h
               we will need in our action for contribution against the
r              co-defendants will be very, very time-consuming, and there
               is only a certain amount of manpower that can be alloca te d
               to it;   the burden of w ork is probably going to be
               insupportable, and in our submission six months will not
               be sufficient time in which to deal with both aspects of the
               case.

                    My Lord, it is for those            reasons that we are taking
pj             the position that although we            want contribution, we also
               say that we ask for it not to            proceed in June and that no
               date should be fixed, for the             reasons I have sought to explain,

                                                   9.

           namely that matters are largely out of our control and we
           intend to get on with the apportionment proceedings because
A          our insurers will be anxious to recover some money from
           the others responsible , and we cannot tell your Lordship
           when we will be in a position to do so, but we have every
           intention of proceeding as soon as reasonably practicable
           with the apportionment actions.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:                Yes.
B
     Mr. PAYNE:        My Lord,         that is our position.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:                Yes,   thank you.   Mr. Glasgow?

     Mr. GLASGOW:     May it please your Lordship, on behalf of the
          club we have only two concerns.   The first is that nothing
          should be done by us to get in the way of the settlement
q        of the victims' claims, and that has been our priority
          throughout.    Our second concern is to proceed to the
          termination of any liability between all the defendants,
         and we recognise that we have no greater interest in this
          than anybody else, and we want to proceed with that as
         expeditiously and as promptly as is fair to all concerned.
         We have in mind that with the co-operation of all concerned
         we have all been working very hard - and that is not simply
D        the solicitors but solicitors and counsel - throughout the
          summer in order to meet a timetable which we had all agreed
          to and which we had thought was fair to all parties concerned.

                 My Lord, the club's interest in getting the matter
           determined is two-fold:    first the commercial one;  it is
           a serious commercial matter to have it hanging over us,
           but our primary concern is that we have employees and senior
E          officers who for wholly legitimate reasons still have
           hanging over them allegations that they have been negligently
           concerned in the deaths of 95 people, and some of them have
           been under great strain.    Suffice it to say that it is right
            that their fears and nightmares - and I choose the words
           advisedly - should be brought to an end as soon as possible,
           and the issue has been joined between the defendants and we
P          have pleaded our cases very fully.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:            When were the third party proceedings served?

     Mr. GLASGOW:  The third party notice was served on us by the
         Chief Constable on the 18th October, 1989.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:            Yes.
G
     Mr. GLASGOW;  And it is quite right that Mr. Justice Rose made
         no order on that, let it be said by my encouragement.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  The Summons for Directions was the 3rd November,
         so itwas a couple of days after the service that he was
         dealing with it, and before Mr. Justice Rose everybody
         treated them as extant third party proceedings, which the
H        order recites, and there is no order on those proceedings;
         it is simply that nothing has happened.

                                                    10.
D.L.‘SELLERS & Co. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




      Mr. GLASGOW:   I addressed Mr. Justice Rose on it to the effect
          that it did not serve any useful purpose - a n d Mr. Justice
A         Rose agreed - because we thought that the matter was
          sufficiently set out and no directions were necessary.
          But it is, with respect, a nonsense to suggest that they
          lapse or become a nullity, and, putting the matter b lu ntly -
          and I hope it does not sound offensive - we do say quite
          firmly on instructions that if the police do not wish to
          proceed with their third party proceedings, we d o .

B     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:                Yes.

      Mr. GLASGOW:  And we have taken the precaution of serving some
          ourselves yesterday in order to provide for that unhappy
          eventuality.

      Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  In which y o u would be claiming declaratory
          relief for non-liability.

      Mr. GLASGOW:  Yes, and your Lordship will appreciate that w e
          volunteered to pay our   own costs, but I stress that it is
          not about money.

      Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  If Mr. Payne says that they will discontinue
          and he says that they do not need leave - and I say nothing
j)        about the consequences of that discontinuance,  whether it
          has a divestive effect     or not --

      Mr. GLASGOW:  Those will be matters for me to raise, and I can
          only do it by suggesting an abuse of process if I believe
          that to be right, but we will continue, my Lord, and I say
          that in the light of the fact that nothing which we do will
          get away from the plaintiffs' interests.^ If the nervous
E         shock is tried first, then we will not get involved in that
          and Mr. Hytner will deal with that, and we have six weeks
          set aside for an action which is not going to take that
          length of time now because the obstructive attitude on the
          part of the police by the refusal to admit facts has no w
          thankfully evaporated from the scene, but we would like to
          use that time, and we believe that we can do so properly
          and helpfully to all parties concerned.  As far as the
F         difficulties about preparing for that trial are concerned,
          that matter was listened to with care by Mr. Justice Rose
          and ruled upon and not appealed.  Mr. Justice Rose was not
          impressed by the argument that the police were without
          instructions - and this is not meant to sound offensive
          b u t ---

       Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  This is the evidence of the police officers
           who testified at the inquiry?

       Mr. GLASGOW:          Yes, my Lord,     and cross-examined by me.

       Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:               Yes.

       Mr. GLASGOW:  And it is unhelpful, with respect, to submit that
           they have not made statements or that there is no access to
           them. It is unhelpful to suggest that the first defendant

                                                  11.
    D.L.-SELLERS & Co. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




                 is bereft of statements;  that is not right, my Lord,               as those
^               of us who participated in the inquiry know.

          Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  If I uphold Mr. Hytner's contention that the
              nervous shock cases should be determined in a week,
              administratively it causes difficulty to start your case
              immediately after, but do you have any objection to my
              adjourning those to October?

B        Mr. GLASGOW:           No, my Lord.

          Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:  May I qualify it in this way:   I had in mind
                to make a direction that it be heard during that particular
                term but leaving it for me to discuss the matter with Mr.
                Justice Rose as to whether it should be the first or second
                half.  How long do you think it will take?

C        Mr. GLASGOW:           My Lord, we have always        thought about   a month.

          Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:  What I have in m ind is simply to say that
                it will be tried in that term and the actual fixing of the
                date I will do after discussion with Mr. Justice Rose.

          Mr. GLASGOW:    If your Lordship will hear from those of us who
               are concerned at the time, I would be grateful, for the
^             simple reason that although I appreciate the interests of
               Counsel are of no consequence, when people have been in the
              matter for a long time, it places great strain on the people
               coming in.

          Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:                Of course.

g        Mr. GLASGOW:   And, of course, there is another matter, that the
              fixing of the Guilford Inquiry, which involves three of the
              Counsel appearing before your Lordship, is being re-arranged
             around this matter.

          Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:   So it would be of advantage to you                  if I
              were to make a decision today one way or another.

F        Mr. GLASGOW:   Yes, my Lord, because the people who are
             responsible for the listing of the Guilford Inquiry have
              said that the Hillsborough matter should take precedence,
             and I fully appreciate that we all understand ---

          Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  I will decide the issue today and make my
              peace with Mr. Justice Rose.

G         Mr. GLASGOW:          Thank you very much indeed.

          Mr.   FENWICK:  So far as the fourth defendants are concerned,
                your Lordship will already have very much in mind the
                concern of Dr. Eastwood and the firm with this litigation
                hanging over them, both as to commercial considerations and,
                rather more importantly, as to professional reputation, and
                we would certainly resist the going off into the indefinite
H               future of any contribution proceedings.

     Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN:   Have you also caused proceedings           to be
A           initiated for declaratory relief, non-liability?

     Mr. FENWICK:           No, my Lord, we have not.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN: . In the event that there is a discontinuance
         against you, is that a course that you would also be likely
         to adopt?

B   Mr.     FENWICK:    It is certainly a matter that we would have to
            consider most carefully, my Lord.    We are very worried,
            of course, because as we read the provisions of the Limitation
            Act, it would leave it open to the first defendant, at any
            stage up to two years after he finally agrees an assessment
            of damages with any plaintiff, to bring proceedings under
            Section 10(4) of the Act against us, which may be many years
            hence.   It is not a matter that we have decided, my Lord,
C          but we would consider it very carefully.

     Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN:  You would consider the implications of it
            and the possibility of initiating proceedings yourself?

     Mr.    FENWICK:  Certainly, my Lord.  As we see it, the first
            defendants have stated in a series of letters --- Does
P          your Lordship have the bundle?

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:                 Just give me a moment;   yes.

     Mr. FENWICK:     Can I invite your Lordship's attention to page 26
          of the b un d l e ,- which is the letter accompanying the offer
          of settlement, and in particular can I invite you to look
          at the last paragraph on the third page, "The plaintiff will
£        pursue action ..."?'

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:                 Yes.

     Mr. FENWICK:    And on page 30, on the 18th December the first
          defendant's solicitors write to those instructing me, again
          saying "In due course proceedings against your client will
          be issued."   So, my Lord, it is not as though there is any
F        doubt;   the police have stated that they intend to issue
          proceedings against us, and if that remains their position,
          it is in everybody's interests that the matter is determined
          quickly.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:   It seems to me that there are at the mome nt
         third party proceedings which have been served on your client.

G    Mr.    FENWICK:        Yes,   that is correct.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  Third party proceedings against your client
         served in October.

     Mr. FENWICK:    Yes, on the 18th October, and they repeated and
          recited or adopted the allegations ---

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  I assume you make the same submission as Mr.
.        Glasgow about the proceedings being extant, about them not
         having lasped and about wanting them tried.  Do you have any
         objection to October?

     Mr.   FENWICK:  I do not know whether leading counsel is available
           at that time, but it is quite clearly a matter that should be
           dealt with.

B    Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:          Yes.

     Mr.   FENWICK:  My Lord, there is only one more point.  The m at t er
           before Mr. Justice Rose on the last occasion was a Summons
           for Directions issued on the 19th October, in respect of
           which the first defendant sought a number of directions as
           to service of defence and discovery, which we took the v i e w
           were unnecessary in these kind of proceedings, as the
C          plaintiff was saying that he was proposing to amend the
           Statement of Claim to add in the extra allegations in the
           third party notice, and the learned judge dealt with it on
           that day on the basis of the Summons for Directions rather
           than the proceedings themselves;  but, quite apart from that,
           I entirely endorse what my learned friend Mr. Glasgow says.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:            Thank you.
D
     Mr.   FENWICK:   We certainly do not object   and we ask your Lordship
            to make directions with a view to a trial in June or October,
           and we do hope that it wo ul d follow on after the nervous
            shock cases, but we clearly understand the administrative
            difficulties that would be involved.   However, what we do
            say - and we have given notice in correspondence to the
            first defendant about it - is that in giving directions today,
k          we would   invite your Lordship to make an order that the
            first defendant provide us with Further and Better Particulars
           which we have requested against the plaintiffs.    It is an
            unusual request, but we do it for this reason ---

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:   Well, I am not going to get bogged down in
          this at the moment, Mr. Fenwick.  What I suggest is that
p        Counsel should discuss that matter and I will deal with it
         on another occasion.

     Mr. FENWICK:         Yes, as your Lordship pleases.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:   I will not be involved in that at the moment.
          Is that your submission?

G    Mr. FENWICK:         It is, my Lord.

     Mr.    PAYNE:  My Lord, may I reply shortly?    As to the con tr ibut io n
            notice issued by the first defendant, it has not in fact
            been issued;  it is not stamped by the court.         I have copies
           which I can hand to your Lordship.    (H a n d e d ) . Your Lordship
           will see that the two actions are in the same form, and they^
            are not asking for any declaration but for orders for indemnity
H          or contribution in the ordinary way, and so those notices are

                                                14.

            a vehicle which would be appropriate if an award of damages
^          had been made against the second defendant who was trying
            to recover against us ---

     Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN:  It is a mere technicality, because Mr. G l a sg ow
            can cause his solicitors to issue the necessary process for
            a declaration of non-liability.

     Mr.    PAYNE:      Yes.
B
     Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN:  And declarations are a discovery matter.
            Isn't this shadow boxing?

     Mr. PAYNE:   I hope your Lordship will not take that view, because
          we think there are serious points of substance involved here.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:   Yes, all the points you have made are
C        different matters, but I am not terribly impressed with
          your submission that the existing proceeding is a nullity.
          I am against you on that.  It seems to me in any event that
          it is open to Mr. Glasgow to ask for a declaration of n o n ­
          liability.

     Mr.    PAYNE:  So far as the vehicle for the case is concerned, on
            the points of substance, we feel that if these actions
D          proceed   with a view to trying to get a decision of a p p o r t i o n ­
            ment of liability, the decision will not be achieved because
            we are making settlement with about a thousand people, w h i c h
            will inevitably cover wider issues.   That is the first point.
            The second point is that we have not got access to our
            witnesses, and your Lordship already has that point.      There
            is then the point about the criminal investigation, and there
            is no agreement between the defendants as to the significance
11         of any findings of the court in the Chapman and Rimmer case.

     Mr. JUSTICE        STEYN:          But on the matters of substance ---

     Mr. PAYNE:    On the matters of substance, your Lordship has hea rd
          our submissions.

p    Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  Yes, thank you very much.                 Mr. Hytrier,   do
         you want to say anything in reply?

     Mr. HYTNER:  No, my Lord, but in relation to the remoteness
         cases, at some stage it may well be that your Lordship
         thinks it right to say that there ought to be orders pursuant
         to Order 18. At the moment there is only the case of Jones
         where the Writ was issued yesterday, and I suspect that if
G        I ask for an order under Order 18 where the Writ  has not
         been served, your Lordship may think it is premature.

     Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  Yes.  When I have given my ruling, can I
         ask you to draw up a Minute of Order so that I can sign it
         and then if there are any outstanding issues on it, the
         matter can be mentioned to me by juniors again tomorrow
         morning?
H
D.L.-SELLERS & Co. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




      Mr. HYTNER:  Yes, of course, and may I at 2.15 deal with the
          Trust Deed?
A
      Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  I was going to ask you if you could do       it
          at quarter-to-2.

      Mr. HYTNER:          Certainly, my Lord.

      Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:    Then it remains for me to give my ruling.
            I direct that what I will loosely describe as the nervous
B           shock issues, in relation to the listing of cases, be
            determined as from the 19th June, with an estimated durati on
            of five d a y s .

                 There then arises the question of what is to hap pe n in
            relation to the proceedings between the Chief Constable and
             the second and fourth defendants.  A number of arguments
            have been placed before me to the effect that there ought
^           to be no fixed date, some of which I can deal with shortly.

                 It is argued that those proceedings are a nullity.     I
            have been referred to a case of Courtney-Evans -v- Passey
             (1986) 1 All England Reports, 9 3 2 , where there was a refusal
            to make directions, but in this case there was no refusal;
            the learned judge was saying that he made no order on the
j)          third party proceedings and he was treating them as extant
            proceedings, and there has been nothing to convert those
            proceedings into a nullity.   In my judgment, there is no
            merit in that argument whatsoever.

                 I then come to the points of substance.  It is arg ued
            that the police are under a tremendous handicap in conducting
            their investigations, and the Coroner's documents have not
E           been released, and it is said that there are all sorts of
            matters which are not covered by the existing lead cases.
            As against that, I must bear in mind that the particular
            defendants with whom I am concerned, the second and fourth
            defendants, have a real commercial interest in having the
            proceedings terminated, and a very, very real interest in the
            case of the fourth defendants in having allegations of
            professional negligence determined, and in the case of the
F           second defendants in having these allegations against their
            employees determined.

                 Balancing these matters against one another,in my judgment
            they tilt strongly in favour of fixing a date.   I make it
            quite clear that I do not accept that the police are as
            hampered in their investigations in this case as has been
r           suggested.   It seems to me that they have had the benefit
            of a great mass of statements and all the evidence that was
            given at the Taylor Inquiry, and I do not accept the v i ew
             that justice requires that I ought to put off this case
            until some undisclosed date, a date which cannot be indicated
            even in the vaguest terms, whether it be 1991, 1992 or 1993.
            In my view, justice requires that a date be fixed.   On a
            previous occasion a date was fixed and it concentrated the
pj          mind of the Chief Constable, and I believe that if it is
             fixed now, it will concentrate the mind of the Chief Constable.

                                             16.
 D.L.SELLERS 8cCo. /W. LLOYD WOODLAND




                  I fix that date for the beginning of the term in October
              next year. What will be tried then are the extant third
              party proceedings which were served on the second and fourth
              defendants on the 18th October last year.  If, in a dd i ti o n
              to that, there are any proceedings for declarations of
              non-liability, I would  apprehend that there will be
              applications that those proceedings take place at the same
              time,  and at the moment I cannot see why that should be
              resisted.
 B
                  So, for all those reasons, I make the order which I have
              indicated, and I will be happy to deal with any consequential
              orders to be made either later on today, if the time is
              available, or otherwise tomorrow morning.    What I w o ul d like
              to see is if counsel will work out a form of order today
              in relation to the third party proceedings which provides
              for a detailed timetable for the resolution of those
,q            particular disputes and a timetable providing for the service
              of Defence and Reply and all the other consequential orders
              which are appropriate in a case like this. If it turns out
              that it is impossible for counsel   to agree on those matters,
              I shall be happy for the matter to be mentioned to me
              tomorrow morning for those orders   to be made.

        Mr.   PAYNE:  Would your Lordship grant             me leave   to appeal the
 D            order fixing the date?

        Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  I refuse the application for leave to appeal
            on the basis that it has no merit whatsoever.  Is there
            anything else arising?

        Mr. GLASGOW:   Only to thank your Lordship for fitting us in.
            We hope your Lordship did not get the impression that there
 E          was discontent at the bar.   It was disappointment rather
             than discontent.

        Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:            Thank you very m uch indeed.

                                               Later

 P      Mr. HYTNER:   May I now revert to the case of Rimmer and Chapman?
             What we are asking your Lordship to do - obviously not
             today, because your Lordship will not have had an opp or tu ni ty
             to consider the documents fully - is this:   we would like
             in due course to have approval of two specimen forms of
             Trust Deed. The idea is that there is at the moment, as
             your Lordship knows, a very large Trust Deed set up for the
             benefit of the Hillsborough victims and the trustees of that
 G          fund only retain money in order to pay it to the beneficiaries,
             and where the beneficiaries are under a disability they
             ensure that trusts are set up.   Now, there are two a pp ro ve d
             forms of trust as set up by the trustees for infants.     One
             form is where there is one child (or alternatively w he re
             there is more than one child but for some reason the parents
             wish a separate trust to be set up for each child) and the
             second form is where there is more than one child, the
 H          difference being that where the benficiaries are more than
             one child and one dies, the money accumulates for the second.

                                                  17.

                  What has happened is that in order that there may be
              flexibility - because there is never going to be any
 A            compulsion about this - in order that the next friends
              in the Hillsborough actions can consider the ad vi sability
              of putting children's money into trust, whether the child
              is a child under the Fatal Accidents Act case or a personal
              injuries case, what has now been done is that amendments
              (as I would call them as a common lawyer) to powers of
              appointment have been drawn up in the case of each of the
 g           trusts to enable moneys from damages to be paid into the
              same trust as the Hillsborough trust, but, because of one
              matter which I shall mention, the two funds will be kept
              separate within the same trust.  The reason for that is
              that under the Hillsborough form of trust the child only
              gets the money at the age of 25 and if the child dies at
              between 18 and 25 years, the trustees will dispose of the
              money in some other way, and that clearly cannot be a pp rov e d
ic           by a court by way of damages, and there will be a power of
              appointment to enable the trustee to keep the damages fund
              separate but the child will have a beneficial interest at the
              age of 18.

       Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:               Yes.

       Mr. HYTNER:   When this matter was m en tioned before Mr. Justice
 D         Rose, his view was that the matter was premature because
            there were no damages to be considered.    In the case of
            Rimmer, which your Lordship has heard this morning is to
            be stayed and damages paid, there are two infant children
            and we feel that we can now ask your Lordship for the
            approval of the Trust Deed.

       Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN:            You are not actually asking for an order
 E           this morning?

       Mr. HYTNER:   No, because I do not know w hether the next friend
            will want the money to come into the trust. That is a m at t e r
            that will have to be considered.

       Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN:  So there will be another appearance before
 p           me in the New Year?

       Mr. HYTNER:   Yes, and what we would like your Lordship to do is
            to look at the documents to see if, in the event of an
            application being made in this case or any subsequent case
            for the money to be paid into a trust fund, there will be
            no longer any need in an individual case to say that the
            judge has to approve the trust, because it will have b een
 G         approved by the court.

        Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:   I find myself an innocent abroad here.     Is
             there any mechanism whereby I can appoint an amicus c u r i a e ?

        Mr. HYTNER:   With respect, there is an easier way than that.
             These trusts have been drafted by Counsel and what we can
             do - and this was something which was suggested to me before
 H          but I said that it should not be done before Mr.- Justice
             Rose because it would  be a total waste of money - we can
             bring Counsel up who has drafted them.

       Mr.    JUSTICE STEYN:            Yes, that would be      a useful way of doing it.

       Mr.   HYTNER:   It would be more useful to me, because if your
             Lordship asked any awkward questions, I am not quite sure
             that I could deal with them!

       Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:               I would feel much more comfortable w i t h that.

       Mr. HYTNER:         May I ask will your Lordship be here next term?
B
       Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:  For the first half,                  until the end of February.
           It depends when I can slot it in.

       Mr.   HYTNER:        Does your Lordship want to see the documents            in
             advance,       in any event?

       Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:   Yes, if I may, and if there are any advices
C            by counsel, that would be of help, or if the counsel w h o has
             advised on it has not prepared an advice which can be shown
             to me, he can write a note which would certainly help me.

       Mr.   HYTNER:   Yes.  In the drafts there are two notes explaining
             two oddities, and it was helpful to me to see those,
             because otherwise I would have been puzzled.
D
       Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:  I am in your hands, Mr. Hytner.  I will
             be here from the 11th January.  It is simply a matter of
             fixing it with the Listing Officer, and I will read the
             documents beforehand.  How long do you think it will take?

       Mr.   HYTNER:   Once your Lordship has read the documents and if
             counsel is here to deal with any difficult questions w hi c h
             may arise, I would have thought about 20 minutes at the most.

       Mr.   JUSTICE STEYN:  In that case, the Listing Officer can be told
             that it can be slotted in on any day.

       Mr. HYTNER:   I am sorry, I am applying to your Lordship without
           actually reading the Summons.   In fact, we have instructions
           in the case of Rimmer that the damages for the minor
           beneficiaries,       land      should be paid into the trust
           fund so that that can be dealt with as an application in the
           New Year.

       Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:               Yes,   I see.

       Mr. HYTNER:  So if your Lordship will                   simply adjourn the
           Summons — -

       Mr. JUSTICE STEYN:   Yes, I will adjourn the Summons and it
           will come before me on the same date as you appear generally.

       Mr. HYTNER:  And I will pass on to those who instruct me your
           Lordship's suggestion that counsel should be asked to w r i t e
           an explanatory note to be given to your Lordship.

Steyn J.

       The C h ie f C on stable o f South Yorkshire P o lic e s e ek s an order:-

       (a)        declaring that N o t ic e s of D iscon tin u an ce o f contribution p roceed in gs
                  w ere valid and e f f e c t i v e ;

       (b)        a lte r n a tiv e ly , granting lea v e unconditionally (save as t o c o sts) to
                  discon tinue the contribution proceedings.

Rival sum m onses from tw o other parties are also b e fo re t h e Court. In su b sta n ce

they se ek r e lie f to an o p p osite e f f e c t .

       The m atters before th e C ourt arise from the Hillsborough Stadium D isa ste r

which took p la c e on 15th April 1989. That disaster, as w ill be recalled , led t o an

e xh au stive inquiry con d u cted by Lord J u s tic e Taylor, who issued an Interim

Report on 4 August 1989 and a Final R eport in January this year.                              In the

m ean tim e, and in July 1989, a S teerin g C o m m itte e was form ed to c o -o r d in a te

litigation by v ic tim s o f the d isa ster.           Writs w ere issued in tw o sep arate a c tio n s

by the widows o f tw o men, who w ere killed in tw o s e p a r a te areas o f the stad ium .

These a ctio n s are r e s p e c tiv e ly c a lle d the Chapman and R im m er a c tio n s. On 26th

July 1989 in L iverpool, in my c a p a c ity as a Presiding Judge o f the N orthern

C ircuit, a fte r hearing C ounsel, I issued d eta iled d ir ec tio n s which included a t im e

tab le for th e progress o f th e a c tio n s . A t that s ta g e th e r e w ere tw o D e fe n d a n ts

only, nam ely        the C h ief C o n sta b le and the S h e ffie ld Wednesday F ootb all Club.

On behalf o f th e C h ie f C on stab le it was made clear th a t he would want t o issu e

contribution p roceed ing against th e Club, and third party proceedings a g a in st

Eastwood <5c Partners, en g in e er s who had been e m p lo y e d in resp ect o f t h e

stadium .     The P la in tiffs a ccord in gly applied for an am en d m e n t o f the Writ and

S ta te m e n t o f Claim to join th e E ngineers as Fourth D e fe n d a n ts. I granted t h a t


                                                        1
am en dm ent.      In the     am ended      S ta te m e n t   of     Claim      the P la in tiffs pleaded

n e g lig e n c e and breach o f sta tu to r y duty against th e Club, and n e g lig e n c e a g a in st

the E ngineers.     In making the d irection s I referred to the action s to be trie d as

lead action s.     A t that s ta g e I indicated that I had in mind a hearing in the

sum mer of 1990 but I made no form al order.

       In Septem ber 1989 the D efe n d a n ts served d e ta ile d D e f e n c e s . The D e f e n c e

o f the C h ief C onstable m ade clear that, if                     held   liable,   he would s e e k   a

contribution or in d t     nity from th e Club and the E n gineers. On 18 O ctober 1989

the C hief C on stable issued Contribution N o t ic e s against the Club and                          the

Engineers.      Both N o tic e s are s k e le ta l and refer t o the grounds pleaded in the

S ta te m e n t o f C laim , to g e th e r w ith som e additional grounds in the c a s e o f th e

Engineers.

       On 3rd Novem ber 1989, and in M anchester, th e m a tte r c a m e for p r e -tr ia l

review before Mr. J u s tic e R o se , the other Presiding Judge of the N orthern

C ircuit. The C h ief C on stable sought a stay. This w as refu sed . Mr. J u stic e R o s e

ordered the tw o a c tio n s to be lis te d for trial in June 1990. N o order was m ad e in

r e sp ec t o f the contribution proceed in gs. It was further ordered that a tran scrip t

o f the Taylor Inquiry        be a d m itte d as a true record o f what was said at th e

enquiry.

       On 15th D e c e m b er 1989 the C h ief C onstable announced, without a d m ittin g

liability, an undertaking t o c o m p en sa te the                 v ictim s.    That l e f t for fu tu re

adjudication or a g reem en t issues regarding nervous shock c a s e s , causation, and

quantum.      And there rem ained t h e C h ief C onstable's contribution p roceed in gs

against the Club and the E ngineers.

       On 20th D e c e m b er 1989 the m a tte rs c a m e before m e in M anchester fo r a

further pre-trial review . On b eh alf o f the C h ie f C on stable it was subm itted t h a t

th ere should be no fixed d a te for the contribution p roceed in gs.                     Counsel m ad e

clear that he could not say w h eth er it would be p ossib le t o have a hearing in


                                                     2
1991, 1992 or even 1993.        Having heard the rival argum ents I d irected that the

hearing o f the contribution p ro ceed in gs should be fix e d for O ctober 1990. L e a v e

t o appeal was sought and refused on this point.            No application for lea v e w as

made to th e Court o f A p peal.       I further ga v e supplem ental d irection s, the only

one th at I need m ention being a d irection that the D e f e n c e s o f each party t o the

Am ended S ta te m e n t o f Claim shall stand as d e f e n c e s to the Third Party C laim s

and shall be d eem ed to be served as such D e f e n c e s on 2nd January 1990.

      On 15th January this year th e C h ief C on stable purported t o give N o t i c e s of

D iscontinuan ce under Order 21, rule 2, in th e Chapman and Rim m er a c tio n s .

Those n o tic e s have led to the sum m onses now b e fo re th e Court.

      The first question is whether, th e C h ief C on stab le was e n title d as o f right

to serve N o tic e s o f D iscon tin u an ce.   R e lia n ce is p laced on Order 21, rule 2,

which reads as follows:

      2. - (1) Subject to paragraph (2A), th e p la in tiff in an action
      begun by writ m ay, w ithout the lea v e o f th e Court, discontinue
      the action , or withdraw any particular claim m ade by him
      therein, as against any or all o f the d efen d an ts a t any tim e not
      later than 14 days a fte r s e r v ic e o f the d e f e n c e on him or, if
      there are tw o or m ore defen d an ts, o f th e d e f e n c e la st served,
      by serving a n o tic e to th at e f f e c t on the d efen d an t concerned.

It is con ced ed , and rightly c o n c e d e d , on th e basis o f th e wording o f Order 21,

Rule 2, read alone, that it does not authorise th e d iscon tinuance as o f right

within a stipulated period o f third party or contributions proceedings.                 The

reason is, o f cou rse, th at Order 21, rule 2, r e la te s only to "an action begun by

writ". Order 21, Rule 2, can th e r e fo r e only apply t o third party or contribution

proceedings if th ere is so m e provision in Order 16 which m akes Order 21, rule 2,

applicable m u tatis m utandis to contribution and third party proceedings.              And

th at is e x a c tly what is conten ded on behalf o f the C h ief C on stable.      Order 16,

rule 8, is the provision governing cla im s and issues b e tw e e n a defendant and

another party. Sub-rule 8 provides th at the sam e procedure shall be adopted fo r

the determ in ation b e tw e e n the d efen d an t by whom, and the person on w h om ,


                                                3
such a n o tic e is served , as would be appropriate if the person served w ere a third

party. This provision, it is said, brings into play Order 16, rule 3(4) which r ead s

as follows:

       (4) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this rule, the follow ing
       provisions o f th e s e rules, nam ely Order 6, rule 7(3) and (5),
       Order 10, Order 11, Order 12 and Order 7 5 , rule 4, shall apply in
       relation to a third party n o tic e and to the p roceed ings begun
       thereby as if -

              a)      the third party n o tic e w ere a writ and the
                      proceed ings begun thereby an action; and
              (b)     the d efen d an t issuing the third party n o tic e w ere a
                      p lain tiff and the person against whom it is isssued a
                      d efen d an t in th at ac tio n :

       provided th a t in th e application o f Order 11, r .l( l ) ( c ) le a v e may
       be granted to serve a third party n o tic e outside the jurisdiction
       on any n e c e ssa r y or proper party to the p roceed in gs brought
       against the defen d an t.

The words which I have underlined are em p hasized on behalf of the C h ie f

C on stable. It is argued th at, in applying Order 21, rule 2, one is for th a t purpose

e n title d to tre a t third party and contribution p roceed in gs as if they were begun

by writ.      N e ith er the "foregoing provisions" in Order 16, rule 3(4) nor th e

provisions s p e c ific a lly   m entioned a ssist.    Order 21 is not m entioned.           The

d eem ing provision d e fin e s its own sc o p e , and Order 21, rule 2, is outside it. This

is the only foothold in Order 16 on which Counsel sought to fa ste n , and it yield s

no support. It is also im portant to bear in mind th a t th e re is no gap.             Order 16,

rule 6 provides:

       "Proceedings on a third party n o tic e m ay, at any s ta g e o f the
       proceed ings, be s e t aside". (My emphasis)

       By virtue o f     Order 16, rule         8(3), this provision also applies to p roceed in gs

b e tw e e n defen d an ts.     Any party, who seek s d iscon tinuance of           contribution

p roceedings, may th e re fo r e apply to th e Court for appropriate r e lie f which is in

the     d iscretion o f the Court and             may be granted on term s, including a t e r m

requiring an undertaking not t o r e -c o m m e n c e proceed in gs.       For th e se reason s I

hold th a t the n o tic e s o f d iscon tinuance, purportedly given as o f right under O rder


                                                 4
21, rule 2, are invalid.

       That brings m e to the a lte r n a tiv e argum ent advanced on behalf o f the the

C h ie f C on stable, nam ely th at th e Court should now grant le a v e under Order 21,

rule 3, to discontinue the Contribution proceedings.                  Order 2, rule 3(1) reads as

follows:

              3. - (1) E xcept as provided by R ule 2, a party may not
              discontinue an action (whether begun by writ or
              otherw ise) or co u n tercla im , or withdraw any particular
              claim made by him therein, without the le a v e of the
              Court, and the Court hearing an application for the grant
              o f such leave may order the action or counterclaim to be
              discontinued, or any particular claim made therein to be
              struck out, as against any or all o f the p arties against
              whom it is brought or made on such term s as to c o s ts , the
              bringing of a subsequent a c tio n or o th e rw ise as it thinks
              just.

There was an issue as to w hether Order 21, rule 3 c o v ers t h e present c a s e .                This

does not s e e m - to m e to be a very important point.               The Court ce rta in ly h as a

d iscretio n , in e f f e c t , under Order 16, rule 6, to au th orize discon tinuance a lb e it

by the m eans o f se ttin g aside the proceed ings. And for p resen t purposes it s e e m s

to m e th at the e x e r c is e o f the d iscretion would proceed along sim ilar lin es,             and

involve a similar balancing of countervailing consid eration s, under the                            tw o

provisions. In so far as it m ay be relevant I hold th at Order 21, rule 3(1) is on i t s

wording not applicable; th a t it is not brought into play by any part o f Order 16+

and th at only Order 16, rule 6, is applicable.                  But, I em p hasise again, in th e

c ir c u m sta n c e s o f this c a s e it ought not to m a tte r w h ether the Court e x e r c is e s its

discretion under Order 21, rule 3(1) or under Order 16, rule 6.

       Turning now to th e rival c o n ten tio n s o f the parties, the position o f th e

C h ie f C onstable is c lear.       He w as disappointed by the s tr ic t t im e ta b le s, and

early hearing d a te s, imposed by Mr. J u s tic e R ose and m y se lf.                   He tried     to

e x e r c is e what he b elieved to be a right to discon tinue.             I have held th at th e r e

was no such right.           Now he w ishes th e court to e x e r c is e its d iscretion               to




                                                    5
discon tinue or s e t aside the contribution proceedings, su b ject only to an order as

to c o s ts against him.   It is his c a s e that he should, as counsel put it, be in th e

position o f dominus lit is , in c on trol o f the proceedings, and be fr e e to c o m m e n c e

p roceed ings afresh at any t im e within th e lim itation period.        For this subm ission

he relies on a number o f grounds which are s e t out in an a ffid a v it o f Mr.

M e tc a lfe . If that means a hearing only in 1991, 1992, 1993 or la te r , counsel sa y s

th a t is the price of ju stic e.     On behalf o f the E ngineers and th e Club, it is

su b m itted the fixed d a te ought to be m aintained, and th a t th e Court ought only

to   allow     discontinuance,   or   order    the   se ttin g   aside   of     the   contribution

proceed ings, subject to an undertaking not to bring subsequent contribution

proceed ings.      In reality the issue is whether, on the inform ation p r e sen tly

availab le, the pending contribution proceedings in th e Chapman                 Sc R im m er c a s e s
can fairly be tried in O cto b e r and N ovem ber this year, or w hether ju s tic e

requires that those proceed ings should be put o f f for an in d e fin ite period.

       Many o f the points advanced on behalf of the C h ie f C on stab le have already

been considered by Mr. J u s tic e R ose and m yself at e arlier hearings in O cto b e r

and D e cem b er last year but I a c c e p t that th ere is s o m e further r e le v a n t

inform ation. In any e v e n t, I a c c e p t th at I must reconsider th e m a tte r afresh .         I

th e r e fo r e turn to the grounds advanced on behalf o f the C h ie f C on stab le. F ir st,

C ounsel said that justice is more important than d e sp a tch .              That is, of c o u r se,

right but it must be borne in mind that unn ecessary d elay may it s e lf work

in ju stice.   T hese general propositions are not in issue.                  Secondly, C ounsel

su b m itted that the C h ie f C on stab le is dominus litis in th e proceed ings under

consid eration , and ought to be able to control th e p a c e of t h e relevant litig a tio n .

H ere w e are talking about litig a tio n which may involve s o m e 900 claim s - in all

or m ost o f which th e C h ie f C on stab le will s e e k a contribution from th e Club

and/or Engineers.       It is c o m p le x m ulti-party litig a tio n . In such litigation t h e

sporting theory o f ju stic e, or what P rofessor Wigmore c a lle d th e "instinct to g iv e
th e g a m e fair play" ought to have no p la c e.             In such litig a tio n , in the public

in te r e s t, the con cep t o f a party being dominus litis ought, as far as possible, to

be   subordinated      to   case    m anagem ent        techn iqu es con trolled      by the C o u rt.

Sub ject to preserving the p r o tec tio n s o ffe r e d by th e adversarial sy ste m , t h e

C ourt ought to control th e p a ce o f the litigation . The r e c e n t observation o f Lord

Donaldson o f Lymington the M aster o f th e R olls in Horrocks v. Ford Motor C o .

2 / / 2 / 1 9 9 0 provides am ple authority for this approach. Thirdly, it was su b m itted

th a t th e Chapman and R im m er a c tio n s are not lead a c tio n s in any proper s e n s e

of th e word.      A t all tim e s sin ce th e m atter c a m e before m e in July la st y ea r,

everyb ody has tr e a te d the Chapman and R im m er a c tio n s as lead a c tio n s, not on ly

as lik ely to be d e ter m in a tiv e o f m ost issues o f primary liab ility to th e v ic t im s

but as also likely to be d e te r m in a tiv e o f issues in the contribution proceed in gs.

A review of the pleadings, correspond en ce, and other d o cu m en ts, has only served

to r e in fo rce that view . But, it w as argued on behalf o f th e C h ief C on stable, t h e

f a c t is th at the Chapman and R im m er a c tio n s are unlikely to be sa tis fa c to r y lea d

a c tio n s. It is said that a trial of th o se a c tio n s will le a v e unresolved many issues.

O f cou rse, som e issues 'may be l e f t unresolved: th at is inherent in the c o n c e p t of

a lead c a s e as opposed to a r e p r e s e n ta tiv e a c tio n . But I am fully s a tis fie d t h a t a

d eterm in ation o f the tw o lead a c tio n s will by and large dispose of the issues on

liability b etw een the C h ie f C o n sta b le , and th e Club and E ngineers.                  And, I

b e lie v e , that a relitigation o f th o se issues in other c a s e s will on p e r f e c t ly

orthodox principles not be to le r a te d e x c e p t t o th e e x t e n t t o which th ere a r e

m aterial d iffe r e n c e s b e tw e e n the lead c a s e s and oth er cases: s e e Arnold v.

N ational W estm inster Bank P L C , [1990] 1 All E .R . 529; N.W. Water A u thority v.

Binnie   Sc Partners Independent 2 4 /1 1 /1 9 8 9 . In my view th e final d eterm in a tio n

o f th e lead c a ses, one w ay or th e o th e r, is likely t o result in th e u ltim a te

resolution o f all, or virtually all, o f th e disputes b e tw e e n the C h ief C o n sta b le

and the Club and Engineers.             But, in any e v e n t, the C h ie f C onstable is in no


                                                    7
position to com plain about th e unrep resen tative c h a ra cter o f the lead c a s e s .                        If

th e point had any su b stance, it would have been p r e f e c t ly possible on                                  an

application by the C h ief C on stab le to add other c a s e s , or other issues, t o th e

lead c a s e s .     That procedure is by now well understood.                         It is in my view c le a r

that th e C h ie f C on stable was s a tis fie d with th e tw o lead c a s e s as likely to

resolve m ost issues but he was disappointed about th e t im e ta b le s imposed by Mr.

J u s t ic e R o s e and m y se lf.            In my judgment he has no valid c au se for co m p la in t

about th e r e p r ese n ta tiv e nature o f th e tw o lead c a s e s .               Fourthly, it was argued

th a t   th e      C h ie f     C onstable        is    seriously    impeded     by   the    fact   th a t   Inquest

P ro ceed in g s have not been com p leted ; th at disciplinary proceed ings may be

taken       a g a in st       P o lic e    O ffic e r s;   and    that   crim inal    proceed ings     are    under

c onsid eration .         With regard to Inquest proceedings, a le t t e r d ated 26th February

1990 from th e Coroner in d ica te s th a t he may resume th e Inquests on the lim ite d

basis of taking th e e v id en ce o f th e m ovem en ts o f th ose killed or injured on 15th

April 1989, as w e ll as e v id e n c e o f the cau se o f d eath . That largely r e m oves t h e

basis o f this argum ent, w hich, in any e v e n t, was not a s u f fic ie n t basis for t h e

C h ie f C on stable's c o n ten tio n .               It is sp e c u la tiv e w hether disciplinary p roceed in gs

w ill in f a c t ta k e p lace.            In any e v e n t, it provides no good reason for granting an

order o f the ty p e sought by the C h ie f C on stable. The c e n tr a l plank o f the C h ie f

C on stable's application is, h ow ever, th e argument that th e re may be crim in al

p roceed in gs against p o lic e o f f ic e r s who w ere on duty at the stadium on th a t

p r e sen tly under way.                  No probability has been d em onstrated th at th e re w ill be

such crim in al proceedings.                    If crim in al proceedings are in s titu te d , it d oes not by

any m eans fo llo w that c ivil p roceed in gs will be sta y e d .                          The principles to be

applied w ere laid down in J e ff e r s o n v.                    B hetcha [1979] 1 WLR 898.            The C ou rt

has a d iscr e tio n , as Lord J u s t ic e M egaw put it in th e J e ffe r so n c a s e at page 9 0 4

"to sta y th e p roceed ings, if it appeared to th e Court th at ju s tic e - th e balancing
o f ju stic e b e tw e e n the parties - so required, having regard to th e con curren t

crim inal p r o c e e d in g s     " Som e indication as to th e way in which th e d iscr e tio n

is to e x e r c is e was given by Lord J u s tic e Megaw in th e follow ing passage in his

judgm ent (at p. 905 D-F):



                  O f cou rse, one fa c to r t o be taken into ac c o u n t, and it may
        w ell be a very im portant fa c to r , is whether th ere is a real
        danger o f th e causing o f in ju stice in the crim inal proceed ings.
        There m ay be c a s e s - no doubt th e re are - w here th a t d iscretion
        should be e x e rc ised .          In m y view it would be wrong and
        undesirable t o a t te m p t to d e fin e in th e ab stra c t what are the
        r e le v a n t fa c to r s . By w ay o f exam p le, a relevant fa c to r tellin g
        in favour o f a d efen d an t m ight w ell be the f a c t th a t th e civil
        a c tio n , or som e ste p in it, would be likely to obtain such
        p ublicity as might sensibly be e x p e c te d to reach, and to
        in flu e n c e , persons who would or might be jurors in crim inal
        p ro ceed in g s. It may be t h a t, if th e crim inal proceedings w ere
        likely to be heard in a very short t i m e                 it would be fair and
        s e n sib le to postpone th e hearing o f the c ivil a c tio n . It m ight be
        th a t it could be shown, or inferred, th at th e re was so m e real -
        n ot m erely notional - danger that the disclosure o f the d e f e n c e
        in the c iv il action would, or m ight, lead to a poten tial
        m iscarriage o f ju stic e in th e crim inal proceed ings, by, for
        e x a m p le ,     enabling     prosecu tion    w itn e sse s to prepare a
        fa b rication o f e v id e n c e or by leading to in te r fe r e n c e with
        w itn e sse s or in som e other way.

A t p resen t th e re are no concurren t crim inal proceedings, and th ere may n ever be

any concurren t crim inal proceed in gs.              If crim inal p roceed in gs are in stitu te d , and

an application for a s ta y is m ade, such application will be considered on its

m erits.    But on behalf o f his C h ie f C onstable it was su b m itted that in a broader

s e n se the C h ie f C on stab le is being impeded in the preparation o f his c a s e

b e c a u se understandably p o lic e o f f ic e r s have been advised not to c o o p e r a te w ith

th e C h ie f C onstable's s o lic ito r s until the sp e c tr e o f a crim inal prosecution has

been rem oved.          This is c e rta in ly a r e le v a n t fa c to r .   On th e other hand, it is

a c c e p te d th a t th o se o f fic e r s have made s ta t e m e n t s , which are available, and

g a v e e v id e n c e b e fo re th e Taylor Inquiry, and the transcript o f th at e v id e n c e is

ava ila b le.   Their a tte n d a n ce to g iv e e v id e n c e can also be ensured by su b p oen a.

I a c c e p t th a t th e sp e c tr e o f crim inal proceedings does to s o m e e x te n t c o m p lic a te

the p r e sen ta tio n o f the C h ie f C onstable's c a s e .      But I do not a c c e p t th a t th e

re le v a n t issues cannot fairly be tried in 8 m onths t im e .              Such a su g g e stio n is

indeed c o n tro v e r ted by th e form al proposal by which th e P o lic e agreed not to

discon tin u e th e contribution proceedings if their conditions w ere m et.                          Not

surporisingly th o se conditions, which involved tre a tin g th e results o f the lead

a c tio n s   as con clu sive in r e sp e c t o f all c a s e s ,   w ere not a c c e p ta b le to     th e

Engineers.        The point is th a t the P o lic e clearly thought th a t the lead a c tio n s

could be fairly tried in O ctob er and N ovem ber this year.                    That in ou tlin e is a

r e c ita l o f the main points p resen ted on behalf o f th e C h ie f C on stab le w h ich I

have tried to p la ce in p e r sp e ctiv e.

         N ow I turn to the position o f th e Club and th e Engineers. The in t e r e s t s of

the Club are im portant. The Club runs a business, but is also an im portant lo c a l

in stitu tion ,   making a consid erable contribution to the                  w elfare o f th e lo c a l

com m u n ity.     It is, I a c c e p t , o f g r e a t im portance th a t th e shadow o f th e pending

c iv il proceed ings should be rem oved from the Club as soon as possible.                       P u ttin g

o f f th e c a s e for a long tim e will be m ost d etrim en ta l to th e a ffa ir s o f th e C lub.

The Engineers are also m ost c on cern ed about any decision which will p o stp o n e

the trial date.       The person involved is Dr. E astwood, a 65 year old e n g in e er .               He

is a partner in a firm which has 8 partners.                        They have hanging over th e m

a lle g a tio n s o f professional n e g lig e n c e , which p o te n tia lly r e la te to hundreds o f

c la im s. T hey have a substantial in te r e s t in knowing where th ey stand.

         Trying to stand back from th e m inutiae o f th e c a s e , as b e st I can, it is my

v iew th a t, on th e inform ation p resen tly available, th ere is no reason why a fa ir

hearing o f the issues could not ta k e p lace in O ctob er or N ovem ber this y e a r .

M oreover, in my judgment an e arly resolution o f th e t o ta lit y o f this c o m p le x

m ultiparty litigation is in the b e s t in te r e sts o f the adm inistration o f ju s tic e

generally, and more s p e c ific a lly th e orderly disposal o f legal business on th e

Northern C ircuit.

           C onstable's undertaking not to bring further proceedings against th e Club and t h e

Mr. J u s t i c e S t e i n , one o f th e q u e s t i o n s t h a t was r a i s e d was

           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: And d i t t o i n j u r i e s ?

                MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: But, o f c o u r se , Mr. Fenwick, one
might say - I d o n ' t know because I have not t r i e d the c a s e y e t -
one might say o f an in ju r e d person who was a t the b a r r i e r , i f
th e r e was n e g l i g e n c e on the p a r t o f the Engineer, th at
n e g l ig e n c e was so h i g h l y c a u s a t i v e th a t he bears 85% o f the
blame, whereas i n r e s p e c t o f someone e l s e a good d e a l f u r t h e r

P o l i c e or a g a i n s t th e Club, then n e g l i g e n c e becomes g r e a t e r .
That i s why I j u s t wondered w hether, lo o k in g at i t com m ercially
because I have no doubt t h e r e are in su ra n ce companies a t the

d i v i d e i t between Pens 3 and 4, what are the sh ares of

w ith my judgment, but e i t h e r f e e l s he cannot appeal i t or doubts
he w i l l appeal i t s u c e s s f u l l y , s a y s , "Well, th at was a judgment
on th o se c a s e s but not th o s e two c a s e s . I w i l l go back f o r
another few weeks b e fo r e another judge" and t h a t , r e a l l y , would
be an a p p a llin g s t a t e o f a f f a i r s and I would not imagine any

        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I am only sorry that the matter has

        MR. FENVICK: Well my Lord, one of the natters which I
hope will assist is this, that until now the Police have been
unable to say where Mr. Chapman was l a s t s e e n . We very much
hope th a t the p r o v i s i o n o f th e document which the P o l i c e propose

             MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: What i s wrong w ith the sw ings and
roundabouts approach, j u s t a s a m atter of good commercial common

                MR. FENWICK: My Lord, in g e n e r a l terms, n o t h in g . One o f
th e reason s why we have been w a it in g to g e t the in fo r m a tio n i s
b ecau se, i f i t looked as though i t was a tru e swings and
roundabouts c a s e , as my Lord, at th e end o f the day, one
a n t i c i p a t e s t h a t i t w i l l , then o f co u rse t h a t i s som ething which
makes i t - much more s e n s i b l e f o r t r e a t i n g i t as a t e s t a c t i o n .
           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I suppose common sen se would s u g g e s t

                MR. FENWICK: Well my Lord, one can s e e t h a t as a c l e a r
i n f e r e n c e . May I l e a v e i t t h i s way, my Lord, I and th o s e behind
me have heard what your Lordship has had to say. My Lord,
c l e a r l y t h i s i s a m atter which can u s e f u l l y be d i s c u s s e d and we
w i l l c e r t a i n l y do e v e r y th in g in our power t o a s s i s t in

t h a t i n v o l v e s a c c e p t in g sw ings and roundabouts, then t h a t i s
c e r t a i n l y som ething which w i l l be c o n sid e r e d very c a r e f u l l y and
I can undertake t h a t what your Lordship has s a id w i l l be
co n sid e r e d extrem ely c a r e f u l l y .
            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I d o n ' t know how many thousand
pounds a day an a c t i o n o f t h i s nature i s c o s t i n g ,        I would not

now have a few weeks more a t £ 70,000 a day." I t looks as
though, whether i t i s your p a r t i c u l a r c l i e n t s or t h e i r i n s u r e r s ,
they are the ones a t th e moment who perhaps do need to lo o k at
th e commercial r e a l i t i e s .
            MR. FENWICK: My Lord, they w i l l be informed.
          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I t i s a matter fo r them, hot fo r me,
but i t r e a l l y would be d e p lo r a b le i f s i x weeks of court time and
a l l the probably hundreds of thousands of pounds c o s t s were n ot,
a t the end of i t , to produce a r e s u l t which le a v e s everyone
clear as to where they stand.

            MR. FENWICK: Oh my Lord, c e r t a i n l y .
             MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: There i s r a th e r a d i f f e r e n c e between
a le a d a c t i o n , where th e r e i s o n ly one Defendant, and a lead
a c t i o n where th e r e i s a number o f D efendants. There i s a very
sig n ific a n t d ifferen ce.
             MR. FENWICK: Indeed. My Lord, c e r t a i n l y i t would be our
hope t h a t a l l th e m atters which were n e c e s s a r y to r e s o l v e a l l
the i s s u e s could be canvassed b e fo r e your Lordship, w ith your

             MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I am not very keen on d e c i d i n g more
than the i s s u e s i n the a c t i o n r e q u ir e me t o d e c id e . Moreover, I
thin k th e o th e r p a r t i e s would be q u i t e e n t i t l e d to say; "We do

                      just a little disinclined to start flinging lists of authorities
                      around for nearly two weeks before trial and would simply seek
                      to preserve our position in the ordinary way, whereby w e keep
                      our opponents, obviously, informed of any authorities and
                  B   principles of law.

                              HR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I shall expect you to exchange
                      lists of authorities by 22nd September. That will not, though,
                      preclude you from bringing up other authorities later, but you
                      must do your best to make sure that the lists are comprehensive.

                              MR. DAVIES: My Lord, of course. My Lord, subject to that
                      observation which causes me to withdraw the qualification I had
                      in relation to 7, your Lordship is right, they are all subject
                      to consent.  Can I rise later to deal with outstanding matters?

                              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Yes.

                              MR. FENWICK:   We agree.
                  D           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   So be it. Then that Order is made.

                              .MR. DAVIES: My Lord, there are two matters on wh i c h I
                      want, if I may, to address your Lordship. The first relates to
                      the List of Issues which was the subject of discussion between
                      your Lordship and Mr. Woodward right at the outset this
                      afternoon. And the second is in relation to the proposed
                      judicial inspection of the ground.   Dealing with it in that
                      order, my Lord, I don't want to burden your Lordship w i t h
                      history but the question of a List of Issues, and certainly our
                      understanding and appreciation of what that list was
                      contemplated to be, first appeared in the discussion and the
                      Orders made by Mr. Justice Stein back in March, and then was
                      further the subject of discussion and an Order made by Mr.
                      Justice Rose in May.

                              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   Certainly I know, which was not in
                      Mr.  Justice    Rose's contemplation, that there was going to be a
                      list which was simply a List of Issues raised by the Plaintiffs.
                      What I want is a List of Issues which tells me what the Claimant
                      is blaming which Defendant over, and what each Defendant is
                      blaming either the others or the Claimant. It is a matter for
                      discussion between Counsel on which way that List can be best
                      presented; whether as three separate documents or, I suspect, as
                      one comprehensive document, for this reason, it may be, for
                      instance, that two parties on one issue are blaming the third,
                      and it is going to be much more helpful that one sees: there is
                      the issue - A and B against C - rather than having to turn up
                      another List.

                              MR. DAVIES: My Lord, I want tc  keep it brief, if I may,

                        hoped clarifying and therefore concentrating upon the real
                        issues in the case.

                   B            HR. JUSTICE JOWITT: So that one is not, all the time,
                        darting back to Particulars.

                                HR. DAVIES: Yes, subject to this point, my Lord, that my
                        learned leader on the occasion before Mr. Justice Stein in March
                        rose and made submissions which were - and I can take your
                        Lordship to the paragraph in the transcript - crystalclear that
                        it was never intended, nor were we to be understood as
                        consenting to the List of Issues in some way forming a real
                        substitute for Pleadings. In other words, the four corners of
                        the List of Issues were, themselves, to be defined by the
                        pleaded case.

                                MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: May I say this to you, Mr. Davies,
                        there are several score of issues. I really do think it
                        desirable and I hope it is possible to have a List of Issues
                   D    which tell me, without the need to go"back to the Particulars in
                        the Pleadings and the Further and Better Particulars, what it is
                        I have to decide.  Having d e c i d e d whether A is at fault in this
                        respect, I then have to look at the overall picture and say how
                        blame is to be apportioned.       I would hope it is really n o t going
                        to be necessary to go back to the Pleadings or Particulars.

                                MR. DAVIES: My Lord, I had not, I think, with respect,
                    E   sufficiently developed what I wished to say.   The last thing I
                        want to have, or we want to have is to have the judicial left
                        arm bent by a very weighty set of Pleadings to do this constant
                        cross-referencing.  But my purpose in referring to Mr. Glasgow's
                        submissions to Mr. Justice Stein in March was simply this, that
                        he made it very clear on behalf of the Club that our consent to
                        this procedure, called a List of Issues, in no sense
                        contemplated somebody being able thereby to replead his case in
                        a different fashion, and we were very mindful of this, that at a
                        number of interlocutory stages in these proceedings the Police
                        have been quite open, and they have done nothing in any w a y to,
                        disguise their earnest desire that they in fact be allowed, in
                        effect, to tear up the original Pleadings and begin the whole
                        thing again as Claimants in contribution proceedings.     N o w my
                        Lord, when your Lordship comes to look - as you have indicated
                        you have had the opportunity to do - at the List of Issues
                        so-called delivered by the Police, your Lordship will hav e seen
                        in addition, if I may suggest, to the observations a l r e a d y made
                        that it does not, in any sense, amount to a List of Issues that
                        contemplates the role and, if it be the case, the culpability of
                        the Police and responsibility of the Police in contribution
                        proceedings.

                       task. It is not their whole task because a Claimant in
                       contribution proceedings is in a fundamentally different
                       position from the Plaintiff who is complaining against the
                       Defendant of a tortiously-done wrong because, although the
                B      Claimant in these contribution proceedings has - and it has to
                       be noted - never admitted liability, he has simply a g reed to
                       compensate, the procedure - and we are, of course, aware of the
                       fact that the 1978 Act invites, even directs the Court to have
                       regard to whether, if certain facts were proved or true, a
                       person would be liable, nonetheless, the procedure which, with
                       respect, we would say has to be contemplated is, first of all,
                       an assessment of whether the Claimants to contributions
                       proceedings would, themselves, have been liable to the
                       Plaintiffs. Secondly then to go on to consider whether the
                       Defendants to those contribution proceedings would be liable, or
                       are liable to the Plaintiffs, and third, in the event of both
                       those questions being answered in the affirmative, an equitable
                       assessment - whether one does it on a minute basis or the broad
                       brush or swings and roundabouts basis is irrelevant for present
                       purposes - an equitable apportionment of the levels of
                D      contribution.  My Lord, in the light of that, what the List of
                       Issues, in our submission, in truth amounted to -

                               MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Forgive me. Is it necessary that a
                       Defendant - I refer now to one of the Third Party Defendants -
                       is it a pre-requisite of his liability to the Claimant that he
                       would have been liable to the Plaintiff?  Let me give y o u this
                       example; suppose the Claimant is undoubtedly liable to the
                       Plaintiff but he has contractual rights against a Third Party
                       which enabled him to recover the whole or part, it does not
                       necessarily follow that the Plaintiff would have any right of
                       action against the Third Party.

                               MR. DAVIES: No. That, my Lord, is absolutely correct, if
                       I may say so respectfully. But, in the particular circumstances
                       of this contribution action it ignores the fact that wha t on the
                       pleaded case is being sought from us is tortious contribution
                       under the 1978 Act.  I have not sought by way of counterclaiming
                       in contribution proceedings against the Police on the grounds
                       that there was or almost certainly was a contractual
                       relationship between the Police and the Club in respect of
                       policing.  Secondly, although I have made criticises and
                       allegations by way of adoption against the Club's Engineers,
                       Eastwoods, there are no contractual indemnity proceedings there
                       and these contribution proceedings are, as I understand it, and
                       I shall be corrected if I am wrong, purely and simply under the
                       1978 Act.

        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: So that, there again, even if one is
considering negligence, the liability of a Defendant in these
proceedings to the Plaintiff is not a pre-requisite of any
liability to the Claimant.

        MR. DAVIES: My Lord, the pleaded case is absolutely and
firmly on that basis; it is saying, "You the Club and/or you the
Engineer would, if you had been sued by the Plaintiff..." - and
of course, we originally were, the Plaintiffs dropped o u t when
the accommodation was reached - "...you would have been liable"
which is, in my respectful submission, at the heart of the
assessment of contribution under the 1978 Act.

        My Lord, be that as it may, the real purpose and the
real sting of the criticism, we hope and believe a well
conceived criticism, is that the List of Issues should have read
as issues; an identification of what from the respective pleaded
cases are the issues which the judge has got to decide, and
then, in broadly speaking Scott Schedule form, should have gone
on to say what each of the parties' observations are. In truth,
as we submit, the List of Issues delivered by the Police, to
which we were due to respond on 15th July, in fact reads more
like a series of counts on an indictment and pays no r e ga r d to
the Police's own case on what, if anything, their responsibil ity
is in relation to issues A, B, C and D, and that was the
fundamental objection we took.

        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: What did Mr. Justice Stein say about
that?

        MR. DAVIES: My Lord,  Mr. Justice Stein said this during
argument, and this is on page 144 Bundle 4, it is in the course
of submissions by Mr. Glasgow on behalf of the Club, y o u r
Lordship sees just below letter D what the Club's leading
counsel had to say and it is a passage to which I have referred
and Mr. Justice Stein says by way of reply:

             "... and the Memorandum and Counter Memorandum
              which we now call the List of Issues ought not
              to travel beyond the issues..."

My Lord, when I embarked on this submission that is all I had in
mind, and your Lordship will see in due course, because you have
not yet had the opportunity of seeing the Club's responses, and
will see in further due course what the E n g i n e e r ’s responses are
in the making, that we do seek to do what your Lordship
envisages, of making our own case by way of defence and attack,
but have had to draw attention to the fact that the connection
in the case of many issues is pretty tenuous, if at all, with
the pleaded case as it in fact exists, and my Lord, your
Lordship has made it very clear to us that you have not yet
waded through what are substantial and voluminous pleadings,
that it may assist to know that the Police make their case
against the Club and the Engineers by very substantial reference
to and adoption of the Plaintiffs own pleaded case against us in
the Amended Statement of Claim.  We similarly do that b y way of,
in a sense, a defence that is set off against the Police and
likewise, so it is within the pleadings in the main action, with
very few, if any, substantive additions thereto by the
commencement of contribution proceedings, that one finds the
issues.   My Lord, a lot of agonising went into it. We h a v e
delivered. We delivered two days late, on 20th July, b ecause we
were given an extension but, my Lord, it is desired simply to
say this on behalf of the Club, that although it has d o n e its
best to respond to what we believed to be both the letter and
the spirit of the previous Orders, we do not accept, a n d indeed,
we say plainly, we think that the extent to which your Lordship
will be helped by that List of Issues, as opposed to the
Pleadings, is very limited indeed, and that that, my Lord, is
our position on it.

              MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: You say because it goes too far?

        MR. DAVIES: Because it goes too far. It is prolix,                                                it     is
repetitive, it is long, it is burdensome, it is sometimes
difficult to work out what has been said. Those are all
responses by u s .

        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:  Insofar as it goes beyond the
Pleadings, the Plaintiffs or the Claimaints will have to make up
their mind whether they are going to ask for an amendment, and
if it is opposed, whether the application will be granted.

        MR. DAVIES: My Lord, I hope, to the extent that we have
touched on vital List of Issues, your Lordship will plainly and
I hope clearly see that it was thought right, and it has been
the subject of much discussion, that that response and reaction
to the List of Issues should be stated.

        My Lord, on the other matter which is not in any sense
to be controversial, may I simply preface anything said b y way
of submission on the proposed judicial visit, I call it a
proposed judicial visit because the decision is ultiaately
yours; my Lord, first of all, nothing I am about to say in terms
of what constitutes the C l u b ’s reasonable and legitimate desires
is in any sense intended to or wished to create any handicap or
obstacle or obstruction tothe proper progress        of this
litigation.   The physical       state and condition of the P ens at
the Leppings Lane end remain, with one or two exceptions
consequent upon what the Engineers have all been doing, in
substantially the same condition as they were at the end of that
afternoon in 1989. My Lord, Lord Justice Taylor on his vi s i t to
the grounds at an early stage was sympathetic to the Club's
desire, even then, physically to change the layout as s o o n as
possible, not least because it was recognised to constitute for
some people a daily, and for others a weekly re.ninder of what
had happened on that day.      Until very recently -

              MR.    J U S T IC E   J O W IT T :   A re     you,   in   s h o r t, s a y in g   t h a t   fo r

ground, both out of a legitimate concern for those who come to
watch and out of a concern for their own future liability, and
will I come and look as soon as possible?

        MR. DAVIES: My Lord, yes. Your Lordship should - or
perhaps it is still in London - have seen the letter which those
instructing me sent to your Lordship's Clerk I think on 16th of
this month informing you, through your Clerk, that a visit at
short notice was available at any time, and of course that
letter was copied to both my learned friends.

        HR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I am quite happy to go and                look at
the Club if all the parties think it is desirable that                I should
as soon as possible. That is once I have done what the                parties
think is the requisite homework so that the visit will                be
useful.

        HR. DAVIES: My Lord, there there m a y be something of a
disagreement because it would follow from the proposed timetable
that your Lordship would not have even had the opportunity to
grapple with the expert engineering evidence that is about to be
exchanged until some time well into September, the month
preceding the trial.

             HR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Can't it be done sooner?

        MR. DAVIES: That may be extremely difficult, gi v e n the
timetable - we imposed it upon ourselves - in relation to
preparation of expert engineering evidence. My Lord, it is
perhaps worth reflecting that although it now seems perhaps
quite a long time to some since this disaster occurred, a very
great deal of time has already been taken up in the preparation
of this litigation and the parties have got on at a g ood crack.
My Lord, the Club's desire - and it is only a desire for the
reasons I have stated - would be to take down the barriers and
what remains of the perimeter fence before the commencement of
the new season.

        MR JUSTICE JOWITT: I would have hoped. Mr. Davies, that
without it being necessary to prepare the Engineers evidence in
its entirety, enough would have been put on paper to enable roe
to see what are the principal things I need to look at, and why.

            MR. DAVIES: My Lord, my difficulty is this, I neither
understand nor, therefore, am in any sense persuaded by the
proposition that your Lordship has to have familiarity w i t h some
aspects of the engineering evidence to derive benefit from a
site visit. My Lord, a site visit would permit your L o r d s h i p -
and the geography is essentially familiar f r c a your Lordship's
reading o f Lord Justice Taylor, Mk I - t h a t y o u w o u l d wish t o

             A


                          MR. DAVIES: My Lord, that was going to be No. 4 in n y
                  list.  And your Lordship will want to stand and walk through the
                  tunnel, and be on the terraces themselves.   Now all the Club
                  needs to know, if 1 m ay be bold enough to ask it, is w h e n in
              B   fact, without in any sense obstructing or interfering w i t h the
                  progress of the litigation, it can reasonably confidently expect
                  it will be able to take down the barriers and the perimeter
                  fence.

                          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: If someone says, "Look, there is
                  this particular feature of the barrier we think you should look
                  at and note this, that and the other about it" that should be
                  quite possible to put into writing, without the whole of the
                  engineering evidence being prepared. The Engineer will k n o w that
                  there are these aspects about the barrier, for example, or about
                  some other feature that may be important in his evidence and so
                  it may be thought that I should be asked to take a look at that.
                  I don't see any great difficulty about that.

                          MR. DAVIES:   I hope I did not suggest there should be
              D   any.

                          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I do not think it is going to be
                  necessary to have, as at one point I thought it might be
                  desirable, to have all the Engineer's evidence prepared. I
                  understand that time is of the essence.

                          MR. DAVIES: If valid reasons are deployed to say that
                  the removal of the barriers cannot occur until after this trial
                  begins, so be it, that is what the Club will do.

                          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Mr. Davies, it would be quite wrong
                  for me to try and delay the removal of the barriers or the
                  alterations required unless there are very very strong reasons.

                          MR. DAVIES:   I am obliged to hear it, my Lord.

                          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT:   I have no intention of doing that.

                          MR. DAVIES: My Lord,' may I repeat so that nobody is
                  under the least apprehension, the facilities are there as and
                  when, albeit your Lordship chooses to avail himself of thes. I
                  don't think there is any further submissions I would make.

                          MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Yes M r . Fenwick.

                          MR. FENWICK: My Lord, can I mention two things in
                  relation to the inspection.  Certainly so far as the Engineers
                  are concerned, if your Lordship were minded to make a visit and
                  indicated when it would be, we would make sure that we provided
                  by way of a letter to the other parties those aspects w h i c h we
              H   thought might be of assistance for your Lorcship to look at. We
                  would be quite prepared to do that, whatever your Lordship
                  wanted to inspect.

obvious r e a s o n s . Now, i f I were to say F rid ay, 3rd A ugust,
would th a t c r e a t e problems f o r anyone? I t would have t o be

               MR. FENWICK: My Lord, i t depends s l i g h t l y on whether

                MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Yes. I do not s e e why, i f th e
P l a i n t i f f s f e e l a need to amend the P lea d in g s because i t i s s a i d
t h e i r i s s u e s go o u t s id e them, why th e amendment needs t o be

            MR. DAVIES: My Lord, do we understand from t h a t t h a t the
Club having answered t h e i r s , may wish t o put in a column of

            MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: What I want i s a L i s t o f I s s u e s and
I would l i k e - I think i t w i l l have to be the P o l i c e who d ea l

            MR. DAVIES: My Lord, i t was not c l e a r when th e E ngineer

I d o n 't make any order about t h a t but I i n v i t e the p a r t i e s to

                 Mr. Woodward?
                         MR. WOODWARD: My Lord, my lea rn ed j u n io r s a y s , "Of

                         MR. DAVIES: I have g o t n o th in g to add t o what Mr.
                 Fenwick has s a i d .
                           MR. JUSTICE, JOWITT: Very w e l l . I t w i l l be h e l p f u l t o me.

                                There are one or two t h i n g s I want t o say about th e
                 u n d e r l i n i n g s . I am lo o k in g a t , f o r example, page 25 o f th e
                 Interim Report, paragraph 147. I t r e a d s, and i t i s u n d e r lin e d so
                 t h a t i t i s n ot admitted:

                 does th e t r a n s c r i p t show t h a t Dr. Eastwood d id acknowledge that?

    - I Harpharr _;a

                                                                          26
                           MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: Now, there is another matter I would
                   like counsel to think about, and it is obviously not something
                   on which one can make decisions today. But I suppose, in the
                   end, there are going to be several scores of issues here. We can
               B   either keep them all in the air and resolve all at the end of a
                   several week hearing, or it may be that there are some groups
                   which could be isolated so that they can be decided by, if you
                   like, a series of mini-judgments simply saying, nA has been at
                   fault here" or "A has not been, B has been at fault" and then,
                   in the light of those and other findings, at the end of the day,
                   see how overall liability should be apportioned. I hope the
                   parties would think about that and see whether there are issues
                   of that nature which can be isolated because, if one can, it is
                   certainly helpful to me and I dare say it is helpful to counsel
                   as well so that we are not having to keep all those matters on
                   the go or unresolved until the moment of judgment.

                           One matter which strikes me as being something which may
                   be capable of- decision on its own, as an example, is whether the
                   Police were in de facto control. That may be quite an important
               D   issue to resolve.

                          ••May I just say this about the Taylor Report; obviously,
                   if I consider that the uncontested matters of the Report justify
                   a criticism which is made in the Taylor Report, of course, I
                   shall bear in mind any additional evidence and arguments
                   submitted to me and, of course, I shall feel quite free to reach
                   the same conclusions as Lord Justice Taylor, if there is the
                   material there, either admitted or established, which in light
                   of submissions seems to me to be „the right conclusions to draw.
                   I say that because, so far, at all events on a preliminary
                   reading, it has seemed to me that there is evidence upon which
                   Lord Justice Taylor draws a conclusion, evidence which is not
                   contested and, if I may respectfully say so, the conclusion
                   seems to me to be redolent of commonsense, but it is underlined
                   in one colour or another.   I hope matters like that will be
                   considered.

                    (      Now the last matter I wish to raise is this; I hope
                   before the trial, a week or two before the trial, the parties
                   will be able to agree upon a Reading List for me so that I can
                   then tackle the reading. Are there any other matters?

                           MR. PAYNE: My Lord, I am about to rise to make my small
                   contribution. I ask for an Order for costs in the cause and, on
                   this occasion, on these interlocutory proceedings, a certificate
                   for two counsel, please.

                           MR. WOODWARD: My Lord, I oppose neither.

                           MR.   JUSTICE JOWITT: So be it.
               H
                           MR. WOODWARD: My Lord, one of the matters that is raised
                   is the filing of transcripts of the interlocutory proceedings,
                   of which this will be one. I don't know how soon that transcript

can be obtained. It may be that the filing of bundles might not
contain a transcript if it has not yet been received.

        MR. JUSTICE JOWITT: I would not worry about that. I do
not think I shall want to refer to the transcript of today,
unless I think that people have not tried to do as I have asked,
and I am sure that will not arise, or someone says "You have not
done so-and-so and should have" and I hope that will not arise.

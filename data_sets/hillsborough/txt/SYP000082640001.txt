              the serial.

              Being aware            that    tra n s p o r t was      being    p r o vided from Mai n St Police

              S t a t i o n to H il ls bo r o u g h ,     I went       on duty at R o t h e r h a m at 8 . 3 0 am                (0830)

              and was         t ra ns p o r t e d to the ground          for    b r i efing        in the N o r t h S t a n d .

              After      briefing and a packed meal,                     the serial          was        divided      into      pairs     in

we    commenced           patrolling         the area.       I am aware           that Herries          Rd    is a

main     road that          carries a variety of traffic                       to and from the

H i l l s b o r o u g h area and,        as    the day developed,              traffic was            constantly-

t r a v e ll in g    down Herr i e s Rd towards              the     ground.           This    consisted of

cars,        vans and buses and every t h i n g                  s u g g e s t e d that these         v e h icles

c on t a i n e d Notts F or r e s t          s u pporters as        the    club favours were              being

displayed.            Whilst     p atrolling         the area        I became aware             that the Five

torches Public House was                     very busy a l t h o u g h      it a p p e a r e d to be very

orderly.            For our serial            the order stated             that       on commencement          of the

game we were              to meet at Gate           "G*                           ~     ■                    meet

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 4 5    pm    (1445),     m y s e l f an d POL P G r ROYLE were

i n s t r u c t e d by the Serial             Sergeant      to make        our way down to Gati?               *0* an d

this     we did.          Numerous       persons were            still     in the Five Arj?fies Public

House and there were                   still     fans walk i n g        down He r r i e,4 Em. t owar ds the

ground.         Some      had   clearly had a drink.                    Some   fans      enquired       how far       it

was     to the ground and when                  told      it was a good 20 minutes                    walk,    some

h a i l ed    down    passing H ac k n e y Cabs.

On arrival           at Gate     90 9 , I could see that                  the general a r e a was             clear       of

fans,        a l th ou gh there were           one or two hang i n g a r o u n d and as we got                       to

the actual           gate we were            i nstructed to go            inside       the    ground as       there

was     "some       sort of bother".              N u m erous     officers,           including       our serial,

ente r e d the ground and made                    our way along            the side          of the    pitch near

the N o r t h S tand and as              I looked         into    the     pitch       I could see       the    piayers

being        lead from the        field.          I looked towards             the L e p p i n g s Ln end and

near     the a rea of gate 2 on the diagram                          I could see what only a p p e a r e d

to be a public order                   situation.         Pers o n s were         on the       pitch a nd      persons

wer e    climbing over           the     fence     onto     the    pitch.

I looked to an area               d i r e c t ly behind the goal and                    could see       persons

being        lifted from the            terrace a rea        into       the stands above.               On arrival
                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                              S2690

at     the L e p pings        Ln end        i took     up a position           to the    right    of the goal

an d    in this area            people were           screaming       that     they wa n t e d to get         out

because        people were             getting       crushed.      As    I looked       I could see a body

on the floor a ga i n s t               the    concrete      in w h i c h the        fence was    embedded.

Pers o n s     in the       crowd were          trying      to hold back         people     so that      this       body

could     be lifted           but the         crowd kept       pushing        forward.      I went      to the

fence and helped                people        over   the    fence onto         the    pitch and then

officers and fans s ta r t e d to                            the fence         backwards and forwards                in

order     to break          it.        I did not see the fence                 give .way because I was

                                                                                     them onto    the    pitch       in

a n orderly manner.                    I do not       recall    when this        gate was opened.

Persons        were     by this         time    climbing       over     the    dividing    terrace       fence       in

order     to get out thro u g h gate 4.                      1 helped         people    onto    the   pitch and

the m aj o r i t y were s w e atin g and breathing                       heavily.        Some    just    fell       to

the     floor on the            pitch to        recover.        The majority*           after a few seconds,

sat     up after        they had got their                 breath.       None    that    I saw a p p e a r e d

injured.

A fter a short while,                   1 became aware          that     the -Fence that was            being

rocked too and fro had been broken an d bent                                   back    such that      it a l l o w e d

persons        to get off             the   t e r racing    onto   the    pitch.        This area was

g r ad ua ll y    clearing and              I then became aware               of a large       number    of

officers and fans                 to the       left of the goal           in the area of gate 3 o n the

d ia gr am and        I then be came a ware                of bodies      being       brought    onto    the

pitch.         Im m e d i a t e l y    I r e a lised that these were                 dead bodies and

a l t h o u g h officers an d fans were                    carrying      out m o u t h to m o u t h     I knew

this     was     futile.          I thought a bout           going      over    to this a r e a but        I could

see     that     it was a l r e a d y an over crowded are a and                       I decided to

concentrate           on the area             in front of rne; this             being    the broke n fence.

By     this    time     it a p p e a r e d     to be    clearing and           I saw a man on the
                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                             S269D

terracing           obv i o u s l y    in a daze with some minor                   facial     injuries.       I

shou t e d for him to                 come onto    the      pitch but he kept shaking                  his   head.

Eventually           the man          came towards me and             1 he l p e d him onto the          pitch.

He smel l e d s t r ongly of              intoxicants.           As    I w a l k e d him on to the           pitch,

two officers,             one male and one             female,        took him off my hands and                   lead

him a wa y for medical                 treatment.           I could now see           numerous       dead bodies

on the      pitch and fans and officers were                           carrying       them away on

advertising            hoardings.          E v e ry th in g    seemed       to slow down and all             I did

was    console         people aro u n d me,           tried to as s u r e          people     that   friends       they

were     looking         for were all          right.         Noth i n g more       could be done.           People

were w a n d e r i n g a r o u n d the         pitch and        I was a p p r o a c h i n g    them,   just

reassuring           them.                                       /

I was     then R e t a i l e d        to go    to the/^half-way             line      I presume w ith a view

to stop L i verpool              fans    going     towards       the Notts Forrest              end.     Some     of

the Liv e r p o o l       fans were        clearly       incensed and a n g r y and             I had to

p hys i c a l l y    restrain a few fans from going any further.

At about ft .30 pm              (1630),       1 was    d e t a i l e d to see       that    the fans     from the

L e p p i n g s Ln e nd left           in an orde r l y manner              and    I together with other

officers wa l k e d down L e p pings                  Ln.      The    fans    left    in an o r d e r l y manner.

At 5 . QQ     pm     (1700)      returne d to North S t a n d where                  I was     i n structed     to

Dear Mr Layton


HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY


I enclose herewith a video tape taken by my officers at
Liverpool, Lime Street Station upon the return of the
Liverpool supporters from the FA Cup Semi Final at
Hillsborough.  It would be noted that Everton supporters ae
also shown on the film returning from their game at Villa
Park.

I trust this will be of some assistance to you in your
enquiry.


Yours faithfully




B F King      \/

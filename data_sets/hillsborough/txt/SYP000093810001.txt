               At 9.30am    (0930)   on Saturday 15 April         1989 (150489)    I attended at

               Midland Station,      Sheffield,      My duties there were the escort of the

               Notts Forest ians from the station to the ground.                   I was part of

               At 2.00pm    (1400)   that day I left the station by, bus to attend the

               football ground.



               bus.   2.20pm      (1420) arrest of                       runk whilst attempting to

               enter football ground.

               mouth,    first aid and crowd control.



               At 3.06pm    (1506)    on duty in gymnasium doing reports when there was a

               request for officers to attend on the pitch due to crowd trouble.

               Exit gym and enter on to the pitch via entrance by the Kop.            At this

               stage there appeared to be a pitch invasion.         I made my way to the

               penalty area.         At this stage it became apparent that people were

               injured and crushed being held behind the fencing.          Lins of officers

               were in front of the stand unable to assist them.          I b^gan to move

               the people brought out from the pens to the side l i n e s / .     These

               efforts were hampered by the large numbers of hysterical and drunken

               fans who were injured.        The fencing was pulled down by hand by a

               number of officers and fans.         Other officers were at this time

               visable    in the crowd inside the pen and stands attempting to give

               assistance.      Fans were being passed out of the pens,       some were

               unconscious and others dead.         These were laid on the floor near to

               the touch line.



               I attempted to give artificial       respiration and heart massage to two

               fans with the assistance of another PC.         The Fire Brigade arrived and

               firemen attempted to assist us,       decided that the man we were

               attempting to revive was dead.         Other people checked in area became

               apparent they were also dead.

               stretcher and on hoardings.         Help to carry stretcher with person on

        tjy>   it towards gym.  My place was taken by a fan.  I began yto make my way
JrO ^                        -
               back to the goal area, at this stage a charge was mad/ up the field by

               the Liverpool    fans towards the Notts Forest sup port^rs,
                                                                     PAGE           3
                                                                     S 3S 07



I made attempts with other Officers to control      these fans and move

them back towards the other end of the pitch.       This was done,, large

numbers of these fans were    in a drunken state,   several were having to

be restrained by Officers,    and other fans for further attacks on the

Forest supporters.



A cordon was then formed across the half way line,      on/i/tstruction from

Mr NESBIT.   This   cordon was split into two cordons. V/he second was

sent out of the ground.     I stayed in the first cordam for a while

then moved forward to the goal area.     By this time most of the pens

were empty at the front.     Numbers of drunken and hysterical fans

milling about they were aggressive to Police and towards Forest fans

They would not leave area of ttye fence,


                          ISi
At this stage a Police Photographer entered into the pens where he was

attacked.  He then came onto* ft,he pitch and he was again attacked. I
                                    Co^r
ran over and restrained a fai^ who was lashing out with fists and feet.

I moved him away from the area and released him after      1-2 minutes.        He

then became very upset and was comforted by another fan.       Attempts

were made to clear the area.



Following this I left the ground with other Officers and escorted

Notts Forest fans back to the train station by Bus.

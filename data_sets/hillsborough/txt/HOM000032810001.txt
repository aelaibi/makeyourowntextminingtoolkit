HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY

I am writing to ask your consent to the release of material considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in
his scrutiny of evidence about the Hillsborough Disaster.

When the Home Secretary announced the outcome of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny of
evidence, he undertook to release as much of the material considered in the course of the scrutiny as
possible, by placing copies in the House of Commons Library.

I would be grateful if you would let me know whether you are content for your letter of 18 August
to Mr Bone, Secretary to the scrutiny, to be released. If there are any objections, it would be helpful
if you could let me know what they are so that we may advise the Home Secretary accordingly.

                                             Yours sincerely

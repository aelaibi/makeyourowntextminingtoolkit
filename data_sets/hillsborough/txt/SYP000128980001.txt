               Dear Sir,                                                     -           ..

               SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

               Thank you for                      your letter of the 21st August, and I apologise
               for the delay                      in replying, but we have been very carefully
               into the work                      schedule with Eastwood & Partners with
               regard to the                      completion of all the necessary work.

               It is expected that all work will be completed by early
               December.  A lot of progress has been made and many areas
               have been completed. Apart from the new staircase at the
               back of Spion Kop all outside work is finished, and this
               new exit along with work in the South Stand we hope to
               complete by the end of October.  I understand that the
               electrical scheme is the one that may be a little tight
               in completing but, nevertheless, all being well December
               seems to be the right date for completion.

               I am asked to suggest to you the 7th, 9th or 12th
               November as possible dates for a meeting and inspection
               at which perhaps any contentious points could be dis­
               cussed.

               May I on behalf of my Directors thank you for your
               sympathetic consideration re the issue of the safety
               certificate, and I do assure you that all efforts
               have been made and will continue to be so to meet
               all the requirements that have been put to us.

   For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


   Dear Sirs,
                                                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                                                             Emergency Lighting Installation
                       Further to our discussions with Mr. K. Jones, we would
   like to set down in detail our proposals for the upgrading of
   the emergency lighting facilities at the above Club.
                       At present there is a large central battery system
   providing 240 volts D.C. which is arranged to serve the West
   and South Stands, and adjacent areas.                                                                            This is achieved by an
   automatic changeover on mains failure, from AC mains to the
   DC battery supply for those circuits providing the essential
   tungsten lighting.                                                           For the North Stand and adjacent areas,
   there is available a second YEB supply to act as a back up in
   the event of a loss of the normal supply.
                       We are proposing at this stage that new emergency circuits
   and fittings be installed to serve the Penistone Road exits,
   Spion Kop, the North Stand, the North-West Terrace, the West
   Stand, the South-West Terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.
   The existing normal lighting for the West Stand will be excluded
   from the battery load, and the spare battery capacity made
   available will serve the new emergency installation.

                                                                                    Registered in England -   No. 1134531
EA STW O O D £r PARTNERS




           The duration of the battery supply will be substantially
    unchanged by this redistribution of load, and will give more
    than adequate time for clearing the ground.      As these are
    existing grounds, we would not recommend to the Club that
    their installations should comply in all respects with the
    standards set for new premises, especially as the 3-hour
    duration recommended for emergency battery capacity is quite
    inappropriate to the particular needs of safety.
           We are not proposing at this stage to recommend improvements
    to the South Stand emergency lighting.      Subject to approval,
    we would suggest that the system be reviewed when the time
    comes for replacement of the central battery.      At this^Ttime
    the load reduction which could be achieved with a new emergency
    lighting layout would permit a considerable saving in the battery
    replacement cost, and this would offset the cost to the Club of
    the new emergency lighting installation.
           We are enclosing a set of drawings corresponding to
    these proposals (1610/101 to 106) for which we are now seeking
    tenders.      We would look forward to your comments and suggest
    that it may be appropriate to arrange a meeting with the Fire
    Prevention Officers concerned if further discussions are required.
           We would also wish to have their comments on the proposed
     locations for the Fire Alarm call points shown on the drawings.


                                         Yours faithfully,

our Mr. Strange on Thursday 13 September we have pleasure enclosing
three copies of our A4 size drawing 1610/48A - North Stand Barriers.
                This has been revised to show the top of the barrier reduced
 in height to 1000mm from the top of the existing landing.                                                                                  Also
we write to confirm that as agreed the present arrangement of
 steps and landings around the exits are to remain as they exist.

following specific m atters -

(i)     the strength and num ber of hinges on the exit gate
        os the south side of the Spion Kop, which should open

        kept c le a r on its outside;

(ii)    the step arrangem ent on the vomitories, to the North
        Stand;

 Dear Sir,
                                                  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 197 5
                                                  Sheffield United Football Club L t d .
                We are presently involved in the design of a new security
 fence around three sides of the pitch at Bramall Lane.                                                                                        We
 have today received a copy of your letter dated 10 May 197 9
  addressed to the Club Secretary suggesting we consult with you
 on proposed improvements.
                For this purpose we have pleasure in enclosing four copies
  of our preliminary drawings 1917/1, 2, 3 and 4.                                                                                 Perhaps you
 would be kind enough to add any comments to one set of the
  prints and return them to this office.
                We will of course be pleased to discuss our proposals
  preferably at the ground if you so wish.
                Our client has stipulated that the fence should be erected
  by mid December 197 9.                                                                 The site work will probably take eight
  weeks           and   we would therefore expect to issue tender documents
  at the beginning of September.                                                                          Your early comments would
  therefore be welcomed.


                                                                                                                Yours faithfully,

                I report that I attended a further meeting of the Working Party on 12 July
                1979. The purpose of the meeting was merely to note the progress of the
                contractors and it was agreed that this was satisfactory. A further meeting
                is to be held before the commencement of the next football season so that

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

I thank you for your letter dated 20th December, 1978.

Whilst accepting the principle, I feel that the suggested joint officer survey could not be
undertaken satisfactorily without plan drawings, and I intend to p ress the Club to submit them
as soon as possible (see copy le tte r attached).

I would agree that it is essential for all officers involved in the certification procedure to
act in unison. Following receipt of the plan drawings, I would suggest that the officers meet
to agree on identification procedures. In o rd er that each officer is able to identify parts of
the ground in a uniform m anner, I think it will be necessary to have stands and te rra c e s clearly
identified, exit rou tes, passag es, gangways, gateways, doors, etc. , numbered in a consecutive
manner and stairw ays lettered.

I also think it will be essential for a copy of the re p o rt of each service involved to be provided
to the other services involved to enable any problems to be discussed and determined on the basis
of a single rep o rt being form ulated for subm ission to the Club. This rep o rt, together with that
of Dr. Eastwood, would then form the basis of a fu rther meeting with officials of the Club to
discuss any differences of opinion.

In this way, I would hope that we could avoid being in a position of having consultations with the
Club with insufficient or limited information for the County Council to r e a c h proper decisions.

I have passed copies of this le tte r to the Chief Constable and to the Chief Fire Officer and will,
of course, keep you informed of developments as reg ard s subm ission of the plan drawings by the
Club.

                                                                        Yours faithfully,

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

 I re fe r to paragraph 3(j) of the Note of the meeting held on 13th D e ce m b e r,
 1978. If the County Council a re to commence formal consideration of the
 Club's application, it is essential that the required plan drawings a t the v e r y
 least a re submitted as soon as possible.

 This need not, I think, await the completion of Dr. Eastwood's comprehensive
 rep ort, which I appreciate will take a little time.

 Can you kindly let m e know when it is envisaged that the plan drawings will be
 available.

                                       Yours faithfully,

1.   On behalf of the Club, M r, Whitehead welcomed the Working P a rty and gave the
     apologies of the Chairman, M r. H. E , McGee, Mr. Whitehead stre s se d that the
     Club wished to see the Stadium used fo r big m atches as regularly as possible.

2.   F o r the County Council, it was em phasized that the aim of the meeting was purely
     exploratory so that any possible points of misunderstanding could hopefully be
     cleared before the form al p ro cess began.

3.   During the course of the discussion, the following points w ere m ade:-

     (a)    the Stadium had been used for many capacity m atches over the years and
             its safety reco rd was the equal of any m the country;

     (b)    if the Code of P ra c tic e w ere to be applied literally , then th ere would
             probably be minor discrepancies such as in the width of the steps on the
             Spion Kop and in the width of the gangways and exits in the Stands;
(c)    in o rd e r to fo rm a base fro m which to w ork, all of the c ru sh b a r r ie r s
        would re q u ire to be te ste d initially, w ith up to 20% te s te d annually
        th e re a fte r;

(d)    it w as likely th at the fire ris k in the N orth and W est stands would be
        m inim al, but the m ain stand would probably re q u ire m o re detailed
        attention: how ever, only a detailed inspection by th e F ir e Service would
         reveal the tru e position;

(e)    the police would be happy w ith the ex isting position of the P o lice Control
        C entre, but felt the p re s e n t s tru c tu re would not m eet th e ir req u ire m e n ts;

(f)    the N orth and W est Stands w ere m o d e m s tru c tu re s , but the m ain stand
        had o rig in ally been built som e 50 y e a rs ago and th e re w e re now no
        re c o rd s, which would m ean th a t a com plete su rv ey of th is would be
        n e c e s sa ry ;

(g)    the only activity w hich n o rm ally took p lace a t the Stadium o th e r than
        football w as the Annual Jeh o v a h 's W itness R ally, and an endeavour would
        be m ade to m ake prov isio n fo r th is in the G eneral Safety C ertific a te so as
        to obviate the need fo r the Special Safety C ertific a te p ro ced u re;

(h)    to avoid n e ed less com plication should a change of Club S e c re ta ry o ccur,
        the C ertificate would be in the nam e of the Club w ith a nom inated p e rso n
        being notified in w ritin g to the County Council;

(i)    as re g a rd s the d ra ft G eneral Safety C ertificate

        (a)     the definition of ’H o ld e r" would need to be amended,

        (b)     p a ra g ra p h 8 of P a r t 2 would need the w ords "of m edicine" adding
                 a fter the word :'doctor",

        (c)     p a ra g ra p h 12(3) of P a r t 2 would need am ending by deleting the
                 f i r s t line and substituting the w ords iTQti the day of a Specified
                A ctivity and not le s s than th re e h ours p r io r to its com m encem ent
                th e",

        (d)     the fire w arning sy ste m r e f e r r e d to in p a ra g ra p h 13(1) of P a r t 2
                 would be the su b ject of co nsultation between the Chief F ire O fficer
                 and the d ub*

(j)    the County Council would re q u ire the d etailed inform ation and plans re fe rre d
        to in th e concluding p a ra g ra p h of the le tte r dated 13th Septem ber, 1978 fro m
        the Chief Executive to the Club before any fo rm al p ro g r e s s could be m ade on

At the invitation of the Club, the Working P a rty took the opportunity of carry in g out
an inform al inspection of the Stadium in company with the Club's rep resen tativ es.

(i)    as re g a rd s the d ra ft G eneral Safety C e rtific a te :-

        (a)     the definition of ’H o ld e r” would need to be am ended,

        (b)     paragraph 8 of P a r t 2 would need the w ords "of m edicine" adding
                 a fte r the w ord "doctor",

        (e)     paragraph 12(3) of P a r t 2 would need am ending by deleting the

                SUBJECT:   SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975

               With regard to the attached correspondence, I attended a meeting of this
               Working Party with Superintendent Hurst, at Fire Service Headquarters,
               Division Street, Sheffield, on 7 November 1978.

               The majority of the discussion was taken up by members of the Building
               Section who were concerned with defining in detail the types of structures,
               buildings, etc. to which the Act applied. The only point of interest so
               far as we were concerned was the testing and inspection of -the crush
               barriers at Hillsborough.

               Following discussion and representations from Superintendent Hurst and
               myself, it was agreed that all crush barriers should be tested before ther
               certificate was issued and thereafter all inspected annually. Also, that
               a representative sample amounting to not less than 20% of the barriers
               to be tested annually. This has the effect of ensuring that all barriers
               are inspected annually by a qualified person and all are tested, i.e. by
               pressure devices, at least once every five years.

               This report is submitted for your information and it is anticipated that a
               further circular will be issued in due course containing the amendments
               carried at the meeting-;'— ---------- — ----------- — ........ ......... .

  SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUND ACT 1975

   I refer to your letter of '27 July 1978 and the copy draft: Safety
   Certificate, and wish to comment as follows:—

   Schedule Part I.                                         INTERPRETATION

   The Chief Constable — means etc. suggest this should read "means the
   Chief Constable for xhs time being of the South Yorkshire Police or,
   as the case may require, the Police Officer having charge- of the Stadium
   on the occasion of a specified activity.'’                           -

   Schedule Part I. INTERPRETATION

   The Specified Activity — Suggest the word ’’Association" be omitted.

    Schedule Part I - INTERPRETATION

    Spectator - Consideration be given to physically disabled persons and
    their carriages.

    Schedule Part II Paragraph 5(1)

    The time factor should be 21 days and no ’’get our” factor.

    This is very important when football matches are ’’all ticket affairs”.

    Schedule Part II Paragraph 6

    The time here should be 21 days to fall in line wita paragraph 5
    (see previous entry).

     Schedule Part II Paragraph 11(3) First Sentence Onlv

     This period of time would not be practicable as. for certain large
     matches, the public are encouraged to enter t h e crc-in d e a r l y so as to

                                                                                                                                                            /Continued ....

Schedule Part II Paragraph 17

Suggest that the words "unless otherwise approved for emergency purposes
by a Police Officer in uniform” be added after the word "Plans'1* -•

 Recognended-Additions to the Certificate     '‘             --^Tuy —

(a) A public address system which can be heard within all parts of
the ground shall be provided and maintained to the satisfaction of the
jLocal Authority and the Police,

 (b) The Police, should they so wish, have the unrestricted right to
,ks@ the address system for Police purposes and such purposes will have
priority over the Specified Activity.              ~J   - :per.Uit..e..^ent

 X not® in Part II, Paragraph 2 of the certificate th&tth© hold«sr shall
•not allow spectators to be admitted to the stadiua unless a specified
 activity is taking place* I think consideration should be given to the
if&ct that this would preclude the club from opening th«f ground to sell
(tickets, for example, when a football match is not taking place or to
•use the premises for other purposes than during the football, season,
>which is often the case with Sheffield Wednesday,

*il would also like to draw your attention to Paragraph 9 \ofPart II of
 ,;the proposed certificate, which deals with fire exit dot^rs and other
 • matters and allows for gates to be locked,,provided that\ each door or
  gate is manned at all times by a steward who has a key. X am not
 |altogether happy about fire exit doors being allowed to be locked, although
 |ther® may be very good grounds for allowing this practice* ^asc-,-

:Finally, I would draw your attention to the fact that there does not
,appear to be provision fn the certificate for laying down the maximum
 number of people who may be allowed to attend specified activities, and
 I would expect that tl;e capacity of the ground should be stated and the^
 numbers that are allowed to be in particular parts of the ground. A guide
 to this was done in 1970, when the Hillsborough stadi.ua was examined and
,a report on crowd capacity was prepared by Husband & Co., Consulting
.Engineers, and the conclusions in that report were agreed by the then
 Chief Constable, Mr. Barker, the overall capacity being 55,000.    c j

 Yours faithfully

    I note in Part II, Paragraph 2 of the certificate that the holder shall
    not allow spectators to be aitaitted to the stadium unless a specified
    activity is taking place. I think consideration should be given to the
    fact that this would preclude the club from opening the ground to sell
    tickets, for example, when a football match is not taking place or to
    use the premises for other purposes than during the football season,
    which is often the case with Sheffield Wednesday.

    I would also like to draw your attention to Paragraph 9 o f Part II of
    the proposed certificate, which deals with fire exit dodprs and other
    matters and allows for gates to be locked,,provided that\eachdoor or
    gate is manned at all times by a steward who has a key. I turn #>t
    altogether happy about fire exit doors being allowed to be locked, although
    there may be very good grounds for allowing this practice.

    Finally, I would draw your attention to the fact that there does not
    appear to be provision fn the certificate for laying down the maximum
    number of people who may be allowed to attend specified activities, and
    I would expect that the capacity of the ground should be stated and the
    numbers that-are' allowed to be in particular parts of the ground. A guide
    to this was done in 1970, when the Hillsborough stadium was examined and
    a report on crowd capacity was prepared by Husband & Co., Consulting
    Engineers, and the conclusions in that report were agreed by the then
    Chief Constable, Mr. Barker# the overall capacity being 55,000.

    Yours faithfully

    D ear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds A ct, 1975

    I thank you for your le tte r dated 5th Septem ber, 1978.

    So that any points of difference may be fully discussed before subm ission
    of the d raft Safety C ertificate to the forthcoming m eeting of the F ire Service
    Com mittee, I propose to call a m eeting of the O fficers’ Working P a rty . This
    w ill be held a t 10.30 am on Thursday, 21st Septem ber, 1978, in the Conference
    Room a t County F ire Service H eadquarters, Division S treet, Sheffield. I
    apologise that I was not able to contact you by 'phone before writing this le tte r,
    but it would be appreciated if, despite the com paratively sh o rt notice, you
    could arran g e to be rep resen ted . In the hope that it w ill a s s is t you, I attach a
    copy of the Chief F ire O fficer’s observations.

    Also attached is a copy of the application received from the Sheffield Wednesday
    Football Club Ltd for a General Safety C ertificate under the A ct for the
    Hillsborough Stadium, together with a copy of my reply and of the le tte r dated
    23rd August, 1978 (received today) from the Home Office. I would hope that
    prelim in ary consideration can be given to this application on the 21st September,
    1978. As you a re aw are, it is usual for the Chief Superintendent (or his
    representative) of the relev ant Division to be p resen t when any discussions take
    place covering ground(s) in th eir a re a .

                                               Y ours faithfully,

D ear Sir,

pa.fety_of Soorts:Grounds Act, 1975

I have received the Club’s application, sir-net] by the Chairman, for a General Safety
Certificate under the Safety of Gporto Grounds Act, 1975.

For your information, the County Council bed heard nothing from the Home Office
sines early August and the receipt of the 0? tab's application prompted a telephone
enquiry of the Horae Cface who revealed th.o existence of th e ir lelter dated 23rd August
to both C'.ube end Local A??.t-horitiea, A.o '"'kin hod evidently been received by the
C!”b but net by the County Council, I aclred for 0 ecpy to bo forwarded on, and this has
been received today.

It is hoped that a meeting of the Officer ' 0 Working P arty (involving the Police, the
Eire Service, the D istrict Council Building Surveyor) will be held shortly to give
p relim inary consideration to the m a tter, after which I will get in touch with you. In
the m eantim e, you will recall that I en.c’ored with my le tter of 20th July, 1978, a Note
on the type of detailed information and planr. which the County Council will require for
consideration of the application,

                                                  Yc’ir s faithfully,

D ear Sir,

Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975

F u rth e r to my le tte r of 27th July, I have now received the Chief F ir e O fficer’s
observations on the d raft safety certificate and I intend to call a m eeting of the
O fficers’ Working P a rty to d iscu ss the d ra ft certificate before it is submitted
fo r approval to the F ire Service C om m ittee.

It would obviously be helpful if com m ents could be received from a ll p a rtie s
involved before the m eeting of the Working P arty is held. Accordingly, I shall
be grateful if you w ill let me have your views on the d raft certificate within the
next 10 days. If I do not h ear from you within that tim e, I shall assum e that
the d ra ft certificate is acceptable to you in its p resen t form .

                                                     Y ours faithfully,




                                                     Chief Executive

      Dear

      In the absence of Mr Barratt, who is enjoying a short period
      of annual leave, I am pleased to reply to your letter of
      17 May 1978 respecting the designating of Second Division
      Football Clubs in the terms of the Safety at Sports Ground
      Act.

      As you know, the only Club in this area which currently has
      Second Division status is Sheffield United, and, as last
      season they attracted on a number of occasions larger crowds
      than those at some First Division grounds, I would strongly
      support the view that they should be incorporated within the
      scope of the Act.

      At present Sheffield Wednesday do not enjoy the same league
      statue, but Hillsborough is frequently the venue for Semi-
      Final Cup matches when there are crowds in excess of 50,000.
      The Chief Constable has been in contact with the Under
      Secretary of State at the Home Office requesting that they
      be specifically designated under the 1975 Act, but as yet
      this has not been conceded.

      Yours sincerely

                                                            A l"V

                          MINUTE SHEET

                          Subject    SHEFFIELD ^



To
             DCC       It is my view that all stadiums, irrespective of which division
                       of the Football League they are in, where large crowds are
                       likely to congregate, should be designated under the Act. As
                       you will know, we have written to the Home Office about Sheffield
                       Wednesday as a separate issue on the grounds that it has staged
                       international matches, Cup Finals and Cup Semi-Finals. We have
                       been told that there will be an opportunity to consider Sheffield
                       Wednesday when the question of designation of Second Division
                       Clubs arises. As I believe you also know, Sheffield Wednesday
                       are not averse to being registered but there is a question of
                       time and the flow of finance from the League.

                       I believe that Sheffield United should be designated. They had
                       several gates last year in excess of gates experienced at many
                       First Division Clubs, and for that reason alone merit consideration.
                       It is also fair to say that their performance towards the end cf
                       the season was improving and the more successful a club, the
                       bigger the gates attracted to it.

                       I would say that all Second Division Clubs should be considered
                       and there is no reason to exclude Sheffield United from that.

                       I attach copies of the correspondence about Sheffield Wednesday.

         ground of Sheffield Wednesday F.C ., should be designated under the

      2.            As you know the basis of the present range of designation is
     •that it should cover all First Division grounds plus those regarded
      as "international" grounds, i.e. regularly used for international
      matches.          Although Hillsborough is not of course in the-First Division
      and does not technically fall under the second category either there
      seemed to us to be a case for regarding it as of comparable status by
      reason of its regular use as the venue for semi-finals of the F.A.
      Cup an d f o r Cup F in a l r e p la y s .       I n a c c o r d a n c e t h e r e f o r e , with t h e
      r e q u ir e m e n ts o f s. l8 ( 4 ) o f t h e A c t w e h a v e c o n s u l t e d the interested
      b o d i e s , including t h e Football League and the Football Association.
      The latter have however made the point that there is at present no
      certainty that Sheffield Wednesday will be invited to stage a semi­
      final of the F.A. Cup in the next year or two, and that in these
      circumstances it is questionable whether i t 'would be justifiable to
      insist on bringing the club within the ambit of the general require­
      ments of the safety certificate procedures.                             The Club itself is averse
      to being designated.' While the. latter is n'ot, of course, in it self a
      sufficient reason not to designate their ground, the point made by the
      Football Association is a fair one:                      the case for designation is hot.
      overwhelmingi            In these circumstances therefore- tie are not minded for
      the time being to press for^designation in the face of the reservations
      expressed by the Association.

      3*    We shall however have an opportunity to(   i ook at the matter again
      next year when we are likely to be considering the extension of
      designations to the grounds of the Second Division.       In the meant?ma

  Dear Mr Barratt,

  SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

        Thank you for your letter of 30 March about Hillsborough Stadium,
  the ground of Sheffield Wednesday F C .

       We are looking into your suggestion that Hillsborough should be
 designated under the 1975 Act as requiring a safety certificate and
 will write to you as soon as a decision on this matter is reached.  At
 this stage I would wish only to make the point that in so far as
 Hillsborough Stadium is not alone in being a ground that is occasionall
 used for important games, although the clubs is not itself in the
 First Division, we shall have to look rather carefully at any case for
 exceptional treatment.

                                        Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

HOME 0FFIC3 CIRCULAR NO.130/76

I refer to the above Circular which was issued on 26 August 1976 in
connection with the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, and also to
SI 1976 Ho, 1264 which -designated.under the Act, with effect from
1 January 1977, the International Association of Rugby Union Football
Grounds and those of the Clubs in the First Division of the Football
League.

As you will be aware, the replay of the final of the Football L e a g u e
Cup was 'staged a t Hillsborough Stadium, t h e home of Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club currently playing in the Third Division. As
you will also know, the FA Cup semi-final between Manchester United
and Leeds United"is to be staged at the sane venue on the afternoon
o f. 2 3 A p r i l 1 9 7 7 . Ir v ie o d -, f o r . many y n a r s it lia s b e e n custon,Tory t o
stage important games of this n a t u r e a t t h e Hillsborough Stadium.
For the League Cup Final there was a crowd of 55,000 and it is
expected that the sane.number of .'.persons w i l l attend the natch on
°3 April.

Whilst I            t.’~ ■ ro.ij;-;-; r,t thi 5 for onl/ .
                                                         ’asi'j r.ti:;.;
grounds in the First ^Division of the Football League, it does seo-.i to
me that consideration ought to be given to designating other grourls
having regard to the nature of the matches which are likely to be
played there rather than the Division of the Football League in which
a Club currently plays.

Perhans you " r i l l b e kind enough t o t a k e int.o. account my observ r.t-: o ris

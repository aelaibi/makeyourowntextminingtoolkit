                                   of

         will say as follows:-




                                                                                      I have been

involved with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club for over twenty years.                             I

have always worked as a gateman.                    I worked on 0 Gate for a short while

then was transferred to A Gate where I have worked for the last twenty-

two years.         "A"     gate    is    also    manned   by                                     and

another man whom I know as                          I assumed charge on A Gate because of

my long service with the club.                   We are also responsible           for manning the

perimeter gate which provides access between the West Stand compound and

access passage to the North Stand.




Our role is to ensure that these gates are manned at all times.                            We must

only allow access to police and Club officials and we are responsible for

the opening of A Gate before the end of a game.                            We are also responsible

for opening the gate in the event of an emergency.                             We have developed a

practice whereby all four gateman are in position at the kick-off.                               ____

         and   I     man    A     Gate    itself    and                                    man    the

perimeter gate.            Once    the game starts we          operate a rota       system whereby

the two on the perimeter gate go to watch the game and, after a period of

time, they return to their positions and                                      and I go to watch the

match.      Shortly before half-time we are all back in position behind our

gates    and   the    same      process     is    repeated     for   the    second half.    Shortly

before the final whistle A gates are opened fully to enable supporters to




                                                                     signed

leave.        The perimeter gate remains                       shut    at all      times unless            the police

wish    to be           let   through    it.       The    purpose          of    the    perimeter       fence       is    to

segregate supporters in the North and West Stands.




An annual meeting is held before the start of each season.                                             There are two

sessions, one for the stewards and one for the turnstile men and gatemen.

It   is      not    compulsory         to    attend      but     the meetings            are    a l w ay s ' very     well

attended.                At   the     meetings            a    briefing is             given    by     a      number      of

representatives from the police and fire brigade.                                         Someone from the club

also speaks to us.                  Doug Lock is always                present at the meetings                  so that

any problems can be addressed to him.                               The meetings operate very much on

a two-way basis.                 If I notice          that anything needs doing I simply report

it to Doug Lock               and he sees that the problem is rectified immediately.                                       A

briefing           is    given   as     to   emergency         procedures,             and    the     codes    would      be

announced           for an emergency           over      the public             broadcast       system.        The       fire

brigade        talk       to us about        the    type       of     fire extinguishers               in use at          the

ground and where they can be found.                              We are also given direction on how

to     use    such        fire   extinguishers.                If     we   hear     the       coded    message       being

broadcast           over      the   tannoy     we        are    to make our            way     immediately       to       our

positions and wait there for further instructions.                                           We are to ensure that

the gate is open.                In the event of an emergency the gate in the perimeter

fence is also to be opened.




The fire brigade also talk to us very briefly about first aid.




                                                                                 signed

The pre-season meeting                  is   also        a    chance         to    sign on and             obtain           our    ID

passes    for    the    season.              For     this          purpose          I    take       two    passport             size

photographs to the meeting and am issued with my ID pass and a booklet of

match    receipts.            I    am    also       given           a       leaflet       relating           to    match          day

instructions.




At a normal league game I will report to the ground at about .12.30 pm.                                                             I

report    to    the    office       underneath               the    North          Stand       and hand           in    a   signed

receipt from my booklet to the chief steward,                                                                 I am given a

stewards' vest at the beginning of the season and I bring                                                    this with me.

I tend to keep my vest and take it home with me after each match.                                                                 The

chief steward checks off my name on a sheet.                                        He checks off each steward

and gateman as they arrive in order that he knows which position has been

manned.




I work permanently at A Gate with                                                       and    the other           two,

                              who work on the perimeter gate.                                       The first           person      to

arrive collects         the bunch of keys from the office.                                          He will        then unlock

Gate A.         The    keys       are    kept      by        us    for       the    duration          of     the       match       and

returned to the office afterwards.                                The perimeter gate is also unlocked.

There     is    also    on    the       same       key       ring       a    key    to        the    small    gate          between

turnstile 8 and 9.                This gate is not always used in that it is sometimes

opened and a barrier put across                          the gap between the perimeter                                  fence and

the     turnstile.       In       this       way    the       club          can    decide which            turnstile              will

admit supporters             to the North Stand and which into the West                                                Stand.       It




                                                                                    signed
                                                      -4-




allows     the     Club    a     certain     amount    of     flexibility.           This   gate    is       not

generally manned by stewards unless a very                           large    gate    is expected        at a

big match.         Generally,        at a small game,         the gate        is shut and the police

keep an eye on it to prevent                  supporters           climbing    over between        the West

and North Stands.




A Gate is kept shut until the police tell us to open it.                                 For example, if

a person is arrested outside the ground we will open the gate so that the

police can bring him through to the police room.                              If someone is arrested

in the West Stand compound the perimeter gate will be opened to allow the

police     to     take    that    person     through     to    the    police     room.      We   also have

caterers coming through from time to time.                            In the first instance anyone

wishing to come through the gate                      will have to show their ID.                Once in the

ground the caterers do not need                      to show their ID passes in order                   to get

through the perimeter gate as they often have large trays to carry.




A Gates are a double concertina type gate.                           There is a small glass window

in   the    gate    through which we           can     see    the area directly outside                 of   the

gate.




Once     the game starts we operate               the       rota    system referred         to earlier         in

the Statement.            At some stage during              the game our money will be brought

around to u s .          I am given a packet containing all of our                       wages andI hand

these      out.      Our       pay   tends    tobe     delivered       when      convenient       and        not




                                                                        signed

necessarily at the end of the match.                        At     the end of the game               somebody,

usually Jack, will          take      the key back          to    the office.          The    gate    is    left

open and I presume it is closed and locked                            sometime later.             We are then

free to go home.




I now turn to my involvement in- the events which                             took place on the 15th

April 1989 at Hillsborough.




I arrived at        the ground at about           11.30 am.                                       had already

arrived.       I reported        to   the office       and went           down to A         Gate.     All    the

stewards were       there and         some of the gatemen                 (the others had           to stay on

the gates).         A   police     inspector     gave       the briefing.             I do not know his

name.    He told us what to expect at the Semi-Final, and what to watch out

for in the crowd.            The briefing was very similar                         to the briefing          given

before      last    year's       Semi-Final.            I        do    not    recall        him     mentioning

specifically        the    different      types        of    tickets         which     had    been     issued.

However, when I went into the office to sign on I noticed                                     that a poster

had been put up           illustrating     all    the different               types    of    tickets       issued

for   the   game.         I noticed      that    there       was      a   different        colour     for    each

stand.




After    the   briefing      I went       down    to    A    Gate.           The    gate    was     closed    but

unlocked.




I noticed that there were already police standing inside the turnstiles.




                                                                          signed
                                                   -6-




At a normal game there are usually a couple of policemen standing inside

the   turnstiles      to    search       supporters      as    they     come       through.         On     this

occasion    there     were    about       six    policemen.           There       were   also      policemen

outside    the ground,       some    standing near            the    turnstiles       and    some      further

back by    the wrought        iron gates.           They were         also    involved       in    searching

supporters as they arrived.




I noticed    that    there were          two    stewards      assigned       to the barrier between

the turnstiles.          One of the stewards was

but I do not know the other one.                  They had          been stationed there in order

to stop supporters who had tickets for the West Stand jumping over to the

North Stand side.           These two stewards were not part of my usual team.




The police inside the turnstiles can see right through to the                                     outside of

the ground.        It was    therefore possible for                 them to search any            supporters

coming through who had been missed by the police outside.                                   I noticed that

there     were    more     policemen      outside     than      usual        as   well    as      inside    the

ground.      However,       at a big       league    game      I would       expect      a larger        police

presence and also at Semi-Final matches.                            There were also         two policemen

stationed inside A Gate to assist us.                      I did not recognise                 them.     At an

ordinary league game we do not have police assistance directly although

police are usually available if they are needed.




The     turnstiles       opened     at    about     noon       and     everything        proceeded         very

quietly.         I remember    that      at    2.10 pm a police          inspector          came up       to me




                                                                       signed
                                                    -7-




with a policewoman and asked me how I was getting on.                               I replied "it's a

normal league game".           By that I meant that everything was very quiet and

good.       Up to 2.10 pm we had just been letting the police through the gate

when necessary.        About ten minutes later I noticed that there was a crowd

of    people    waiting     outside        A   Gate    to    get   in     through    the        turnstiles.

The crowd appeared to have arrived all at once.                           Ten minutes earlier they

simply were not there.               People were coming            through the turnstiles and I

could see through the window in A Gate that it was becoming very crowded

outside.       A second police inspector came by at about this time.                                 I said

to him "if I were you I should clear this                          lot out because          they haven't

got tickets".        He told me that he did not have the manpower to do so.                                I

knew the crowd did not have tickets because they were waiting outside and

waving £20 notes in front of my window hoping                           that I would        let them in.

Neither I, nor any of the other gatemen opened the gate in order to admit

any fans.




The     atmosphere    outside        the   gate was         becoming     tense     and    the    supporters

were     threatening      to   smash       the    gate      in.    They    were     becoming       verbally

abusive.       The crowd outside the gate was solid.




During this time Liverpool fans were coming up to me at A Gate asking to

be    let    out.    They      had    come       through     the   turnstile       with     full    tickets

because       the - turnstile        operators        did    not   have     time    to     tear     off   the

counterfoil.




                                                                       s igned

We are     instructed     that    if   someone      has   to    leave     the ground      to use      the

telephone or if the police call him                  out to his car the procedure                is    for

the gateman to take his           ticket     and    to let him out of            the ground.          The

supporter will return via A Gate and will be given back his                               ticket upon

his return.      This is the approved Club procedure.




Sometimes supporters try to trick their way into the ground.                               The system

is for a number of people to get in through the turnstiles.                               One person

will    then collect      their   tickets     and approach            the gateman      to be     allowed

out.     The gatemen is not allowed to search that supporter for tickets so

will not know how many tickets               he is holding.            One ticket is offered to

the gateman to be         allowed      out   and the gateman will              let him out.           Once

outside the supporter would distribute the tickets he is holding amongst

his friends and they will gain entrance.                       The supporter will         then return

to   the   ground    himself      through     the    gate      to    request    his    ticket.        This

practice is popular with certain teams but only really tends to happen at

Semi-Finals.        As I have explained we were wise                   to these       tricks and were

doing    our best    to   prevent      it    from happening.             In any    event,      once    the

crowd was building, up outside we were not opening Gate A.




The turnstiles were becoming very busy. The police                            attached to us would

be helping to search         supporters as they           came       through the turnstiles.             I

recall     one   specific    incident.       I was        facing       out     looking through         the

window when,      all   of   a    sudden, some       people         started    running towards         the




                                                                     signed
                                                          -9-




gate.       Whilst we had our backs turned they had run up and clambered over

the gate from the inside.                    Two people made it over the gate and I am not

sure about the third, a girl.                      Someone later told me that she had managed

to get over.          We did not see them in time to be able to stop them.                                      The

gate    is   some     twelve       to    fourteen         feet high.        I believe       that     these      fans

must have known            the set-up- and were attempting                     to pass      tickets back to

their friends on the other side.




It    was    at     about       this    time       that    I     noticed    people       climbing     over       the

turnstiles in order to get into the ground.                                The police were occupied in

dealing with these supporters.                       It was       at about this time that we could

see C Gate being opened.                     I then recall          somebody saying that C Gate has

been opened.           We were just able                  to see it from where we were                standing.

The     policeman         came     over      and    told    us    to    open   A    Gate.                 who    was

holding the keys,               refused to do so because of the crowd outside pressing

on the       gate.        Throughout         the whole of          this    time we were being              offered

money to let fans in.                   I noticed that the whole of the gate was beginning

to move       from    side       to    side.       It was       swaying very noticeably.                  I looked

through the glass window and could see no                                tools,     hammers     or bars being

used by the supporters to break the gate down.                                 The whole of the gate was

moving       because       of    the     pressure         being    placed      on   it   from   outside.           It

appeared       to    me     that       the   supporters          were   rocking      the    gate     on    purpose

trying to break it down.                     A police sergeant then came up to us and told

us that he now had official authority to open the gate.                                         On   that basis

Jack handed the keys to him.                       However,       the only assistance we had at that




                                                                            signed

stage    were     the        two   police      officers    assigned     to    us   originally.           I

therefore       told the police sergeant             that there was no way           that       the   gate

could be opened without extra help.                      He went away and shortly thereafter

he came back with about thirty policemen.                         He had been in charge of the

keys    to the        gate   as    soon as|_______ |iad given       them to him.          He    lined   up

about half of the policemen along by the wall and the other half forming

a row away from the turnstile number 1.                      Then the policeman stood at the

end of the line facing the gate.                   I stood behind a coloured policeman out

of the way by the wall as I had a very good                          idea of what was           about   to

happen.        Jack and the others stood on the other, side but also out of the

way.     The policeman gave the order to open the gate.                        The police had the

key     and    they    opened      it.    There    was    then    a massive    influx      of    fans   in

through the gate.              However,     there was nowhere for them to go.                  There were

stewards at the stairs to the aisles leading to the North Stand who would

refuse them entry because they did not have the correct tickets,                                  or more

likely, had no tickets at all.




There was a great deal of noise at this time and there was a lot going on

around me.        I recall that there were people trying to climb over the wall

from Vere Road and from behind a shop on Leppings Lane.                             I lost count of

time because there was                so much going on.           I do not recall having heard

the kick-off.




After     the    initial       influx     of   people     there   was   no-one     left    outside      the

gate.         However, we left the gate open.                I knew that there was              something




                                                                     signed

wrong when an ambulance arrived.                          A policeman came by and said                 that the

match had been cancelled.                     We   therefore decided to leave the gate open.

Those who had run               into     the ground had               to stay where      they were       because

they    could      not     go   up     into    the       North    Stand       because    they   did    not     have

tickets.           People       then    began       to    drift       out.      The    police    stopped       them

leaving the ground for a while in order to leave the roads clear for the

emergency services.




I remember         seeing an ambulance                   arrive    a n d ______[went     off    to direct       the

ambulance round to the pitch where it was needed.




I must       say    that    the conduct            of    the     fans was very bad,         both before and

after Gate A was opened.                   I noticed that many of them had been drinking.

The crowd in general were very difficult to control.                                     They were ignoring

all commands given to them by                        the police.             I recall that at one            stage,

although I cannot remember exactly when,                               a St John's Amulance man wanted

to     get   in     through      Gate     A.        This       must    have    been     sometime      before    the

kick-off.          I told him that I could not let him in because                                  of everybody

else around          the gate        from the outside.                 I therefore       sent him around         to

the office.




I did not          consider       that    the police decision                  to open A Gate was            a good

decision.          I Jcnew that many of the people waiting outside                                 the gate did

not have       tickets.          I considered             that it would be more            sensible      for     the

police to move them back outside the wrought                                  iron gate in order         to ease




                                                                              signed

the pressure.         However,       the police took over from us and the matter was

out of our hands.                    did not want to hand the keys over but when the

order came from the inspector there was not a lot he could do.                                            We were

instructed by the club that if there is any trouble or if we are in any

difficulty we must               always _rely on      the police         to assist us.               If we are

given orders by the police we must try to oblige them.                                   If we are faced

with    a    serious       situation     then   it     is    appropriate          to    wait        for    higher

authorisation and,            in those circumstances, we do not just blindly follow

the orders of a police constable.                     We wait until he has received higher

authority.          Once    the police       officer        came    back    with       the    important       and

higher authority there was nothing we could do.                                The police           simply took

over the situation.




I   have     never     seen       anything    like    this     at    a     Semi-Final          in    the    past.

Normally at a Semi-Final the supporters are in by 2.50 pm and no problems

are experienced.             In my opinion the supporters                  arrived late and did not

care how they got             into the ground but were determined                       to do so.           I did

not    think    that       the    gate was    going     to    break      but    I believe            that    those

outside were trying to break it down.




After       the match      I went up     to the wrought            iron gate to look at                   the fire

engines       and   ambulances.         Announcements were being made                        over    the    tannoy

but I was not able to hear what was being said.




 I did not      see B Gate being             opened    and    could      just catch a glimpse of C




                                                                         signed

Gate from where    I was   standing.    I remained   in the vicinity   of A Gate

until about 3.40 pm.       At that stage there seemed to be nothing more for

me to do and I went home.      I did not wait to collect my pay.




I have been interviewed by and have provided a Statement to the police.




This Statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

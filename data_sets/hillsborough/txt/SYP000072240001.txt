 were      visible           on    the       way     there.

                       managed          to     park    the       car     in the       s c h oo l      yard about            one a n d a

 was      no    set     fee       but       she just       asked       if y o u w o u l d        g iv e    what       you       could

 afford         for     the       b e n e f i t of    parking          there        and    the       money would            be        used

 for      the     s ch o ol       f u n d s . This         w as a b o u t      2.30       pm    (1430).

 T he     f ive    of       us    set       off to w a l k       to    the     ground.            I w as     o nc e     more          aware

 of     lots      of    p ol ic e       around        on m o t o r c y c l e s ,      and       in    cars,     as      you mads            your

 way      to    the     stadium             there     were       lots     of    uniform          police       on f oot           in the

 area.          The     c r o w d was          orderly.           I d o n ’t t h i n k          I could        have        walked          200

 with      the     police          presence           at    th is      time.

 At L e p p i n g s         Ln    it w as       busy,       traffic        was       s t ill     driving        along           t his      road.

 been      able        to h ave         driven        along       by     the    g r o un d,      adding        to     the

 congestion.

 At Leppings                Ln    on    the a p p r o a c h       to     the    entry        g at e     at L e p p i n g s       Ln     I saw

crowd      could        h ave      p r e v e n t e d me         from       seeing         other          police        officers,             w ho

may    h av e    been       on     foot,        between Leppings                     Ln and          the       turnstiles.

I fully         expected           to     join a         recognisable                queue        at      the     turnstile             but

there was          no      such     thing           in e v i d e n c e .

I was      allowed with                 everyone             else     to    e n t er      the a r e a          a s a mas s.             The

complete         a r e a w as       filled with                 peop le.            There       was       no o r d e r l y        queue       that

was    visible.

Barry      my    s on was          at     my    s i d e,      the     o the r lads             were       all     with       us.        We we re

through.           They      closed            just      as     I approached                them.           It s e e m e d        like       ten

minutes         before       they were               reopened.              I w as        c l ose       to a m o u n t e d            police

move     back.          T hi s     w as    just         impossible             due     to      the      c r o w d m ass.

At    t hat     po i n t    the     officers             were       yelling          at     the      fans.            Some       of    the

were     screaming           at     the P o l i c e           to    open       the     gates         as     they       could          not

breathe         in this          mass      of a         crowd.           All     this       t ime       the      pressure             was

increasing            and    people            were      beginning             to    get       h ur t     as     the    crowd          swelled

continuously.                I f elt           t ha t    the       pressure          combined with                    the    temperature

I d o n ’t know.

I w as      out     of     con tr ol           of w h a t      I would           h ave      liked-            My       f e et     stayed        on

the    ground           but    I was           moving        forwards            faster          than        I would            h a ve     liked.

I never          w as    asked          for m y        t i c k et .       I had m y             ticket        in m y         left        hand

ready       to    present              at     the    turnstile            but       there        w as    no       turnstile              to    be

seen.        I heard                                   say     to me          " T h at s    us B,        t h ats        what       we w a n t . ”

I seen       the        l ar ge        letter        'B'     o ve r     the      tunnel/Leading                    to      the     ground.               I

was    swept        along          in t h is         d i r e c t i o n by the              crowd.            This       was       the      section

of    the    ground my                 ticket        was     for.         I never           s aw a n y        stewards             in t his

I entered           the       t u n n e l.          I couldn't            h av e      got       out.         I w a s n ’t too             unhappy

about       going        down          th ere,       although           it w as        a bit           faster          than       I would           have

liked.           I c oul d         see        daylight        at      the      end     of       the     tunnel          and       then        the

I heard          the     che er         go     up.

I was       pushed         into         the        terrace         down       the     steps ,          not    u n der        my    o wn       speed,

but    I managed              to       stop.         I stopped            behind           other        people.              I knew           I was

in a       big    crowd.               I knew        I w as        g o i ng    to h a v e        to     stop where                I was        due       to

were       all    in the           immediate              area      cl ose       to    one a n o t h e r .              I do       not        stand

behind       the        goals.              Once     i n si d e     the       terrace           I thought              that       I could           go

w as    about         six    f e et     from        the        perimeter             fenc e.            The     pressure          w as    on me

by the w e i g h t           of      the      crowd        behind            us.        I crossed              my arms       over        my

scream        out.          The      h ea t    was        increasing               and       t he    pressure.              I remember              a

with     the         downward and              forward              pressure            b e in g     exerted          on    them.         T he

terraces             slopes        down       to    the        pitch which assists                         in    increasing              the

pressure             from    be h i nd .

people        on      the    fie l d.          There           were       lots       of      police        on    the       fi eld.

People        were       compacted             so     tight          together             it was          impossible           to m o v e          e ve n

to     the    slightest              d e g re e.          I u s e d all            my     energy          to    keep       breathing           with

my arms          c r osse d.

Fans     were         being        dragged          out        of    the      terrace             by o t h e r       fans    who     had       got

through          the     g at e a n d         then        by    the       po lice.           The      pressure          was    still

People        began         to     realise          t hat       people            were       screaming           to    get     out       and

began        to yell         at      the      crowd        to       get      b ack      as     people          were    b e in g     c r u s h e d at

the    perimeter            fen ce,          I n e ve r        knew       this.         I c o u l d n ’t ha ve       helped          them

if    I ha d      known.             I tried        to     p u sh    b a ck w i t h m y a r m s         crossed and                did

yell     out      but    I c o u l d n ’t do             t hi s     for    long,        as    I n e e d e d all      my       energy          to

continue          breathing.

The    pressure          did         start     to       come      off     eventually.               I d o n ’t k n o w        if    I had

closed my          eyes      or       blacked          out     but      I lost        reality        but    then     I was          able

to    step      back a n d           get    the     pressure            off me.          I wa s      in a s i t u a t i o n .        1

I s aw    three         police         officers           at      the     top    of     the    terracing          ste ps,          they

were     just      looking            on at       the      sce ne .        I approached              the    poli ce,          one    told

me    he w as      one a n d a half                 miles         away and         had       been    sent    to a      pitch

invasion.           A fourth               bobby arrived and                    told     these       others       about        a

barrier.           I walked            down with             them and           I saw a m e t a l          barrier        th at      was

bent     and      leaning            over.      I walked and               saw     the       barrier        was     flat.            I was

in a     state      of      shock.            Ih e a r d     people        ask     a    policeman           if the m a t c h was

abandoned          or    not.           I heard a            leader        of    the     police       ask    on his           r a d io    if

the    g a me     was    o ve r       and    tell        people         it w as       off.       1 wasn't         aware        of

I w as    choking           a bit          but did       not      vomit .

     Dear Sir

     HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
     YORKSHIRE TELEVISION PROGRAMME

     Mr Williams and Mr Birts are advising the Director of Public
     Prosecutions in this matter.     Kindly place this letter and
     enclosures before both Counsel for their information.

     I recently attended at Yorkshire Television in London to see a
     rough-cut version of the above television programme. I made some
     notes during the course of the showing of this programme which
     have now been typed and copies are enclosed for your attention.

     The format of the programme refers continually to the findings
     of Lord Justice Taylor's interim report.      On the question of
     content alone I am of the view that there is no question of
     contempt of court, either under common law or under the 1981 Act.

     The police are happy with the contents of the proposed programme.

     Should either Mr Williams or Mr Birts wish to discuss the
     programme with me, I shall be only to pleased to speak with them.

      Yours faithfully

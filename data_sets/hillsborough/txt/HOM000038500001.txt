     I am a qualified and fully-registered medical practitioner, 34 years of age, (aged 26 at the time
of the disaster), holding the degrees of bachelor of medicine and bachelor of surgery (Sheffield,
1986). I was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Anaesthetists (London) in 1991, and passed
the Advanced Trauma Life Support Provider course in 1995.1 currently work as an accident &
emergency specialist in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire.
     I took a particular interest in accident and emergency work as a student, and spent six months
working in the A&E unit o f St. Stephens hospital (now the Chelsea and Westminster) after
qualifying. From 1988 to 1991,1 underwent training in the specialty of anaesthetics, culminating
in my passing the final examination for fellowship of the college in 1991. Shortly afterwards, I left
anaesthesia, and for a time practised psychiatry. I returned to accident and emergency work in
1993, and have stayed within that specialty since.
     I have some knowledge of the legal process, and an interest in it, due mainly to the influence
o f my father who is resident Circuit Judge in Sheffield, and was recently appointed honorary
Recorder of Sheffield.
     My involvement with 'Hillsborough', which had ceased shortly after the disaster, was re­
established following the Granada dramatisation broadcast in December 1996.1 reviewed the
programme for the British Medical Journal, and wished to donate the £100 fee to the family
support group. I spoke to the secretary of the group on the telephone, and it soon became
apparent that I was the 'unidentified doctor' they had been trying to trace for the last seven years.
Since this initial contact, I have spoken to several more families whose relatives I treated at the
hospital.
     I have been asked more than once why it has taken me this long to 'come forward.' Since I
had given written submissions to the relevant authorities, I always assumed that the families
concerned knew who I was, and had no desire to contact me. I also assumed, not unreasonably,
that since the authorities had not approached me, I had nothing useful to offer. I did not follow
the inquests closely, which perhaps I should have done. It is only since the beginning of this year
that I found out my evidence had been overlooked at the inquests, and that I had been referred
to on several occasions as 'unidentified.'




                                                                             Dr. Ed Walker page 1
                                   M y A c t io n s   on the   Day.
      In the spring of 1989 I was a trainee anaesthetist with the North Trent region, working at
Rotherham district hospital. I lived on the outskirts of Sheffield, near to the Northern General
hospital. On the day, I returned home from walking the dog around 3.00 pm I am not a football
fan, but happened to turn on the television and saw BBC 'Grandstand' coverage of the FA cup
semi-final at Hillsborough football stadium. The pictures showed a crowd disturbance of some
kind, and as a result of seeing these pictures, I decided to drive to the Northern General hospital
in case I could be of use. I arrived at the hospital I believe at around 3.20 pm, minutes before the
first casualty arrived. I spent the next six hours in the hospital, administering emergency treatment
to a number of victims. My actions at the hospital are outlined in two documents. One was an
account prepared for Mr. James Wardrope, the consultant in Accident & Emergency at the
hospital; the other is a statement handwritten by me on West Midlands police force witness
statement paper, dated 20th July 1989. Both these documents are I understand in possession of
the Scrutiny.




     I have tried to limit my concerns to the following areas. These are:


     1)        What happened to the police statement I made, and why was it apparently
               not made available to either the inquests nor to Lord Justice Taylor's
               inquiry?


     2)        The inconsistencies between my own observations and pathological evidence
                presented at the inquests.


     3)        The difference between 'traumatic' and 'crush' asphyxia, and its bearing on:


     4)        The '3.15 cut-ofF decision, and the significance of events after that time.




                                                                            Dr. Ed Walker page 2

     The evidence about my actions and their timing on the day of the disaster has been described
in the press as 'new.' In that I submitted a written report to the Northern General hospital outlining
my actions, and wrote out a police statement, it is not new. But since nothing that I did or said
has ever been heard by a jury or inquiry, my evidence is indeed new.
    I was given to understand that my name was made available to West Midlands police, and
even given written notice by the hospital (copy attached) that I may be approached for interviews
and a formal statement.
      I was never approached by West Midlands police, and asked for statement paper to be sent
to me, on which I wrote my evidence. The statement was made at Rotherham district general
hospital, in an office adjacent to the Intensive Care Unit. There was no police officer present.
After I had written out the statement, I approached                         a ITU staff nurse there at
the time, to act as a witness as I signed each page. This he did, and at the same time it can be seen
that I put a line (in purple ink) through the areas labelled 'Officer's name', 'Rank', and 'No.' At a
later date, someone called Julie APPLETON who I understand is a West Midlands police officer,
has apparently added her name and signature to the documents. She was not present when I wrote
the statement, and                  will confirm this.
     I do not recall what I did with this statement, but I must have returned it to someone in some
authority, as it has ended up in the possession of South Yorkshire police, who sent a typed copy
to the office o f the Scrutiny in March of this year.
     One might assume that I was just one of many doctors and other witnesses who were never
interviewed, but I recently discovered that at least one other volunteer doctor, Peter James
MARSH, a spectator who travelled to the hospital accompanying a victim from the ground, was
traced and interviewed on several occasions, which I understand invplved officers travelling to
London. He was involved far less in the resuscitation of victims than I was. I lived minutes away
from the hospital and my identity was known, yet I was never approached by the police. I also
have seen statements made by Dr. Janet Rosemary DOORE, who was asked to make three
separate statements in all. The final of these is also witnessed' by Julie APPLETON.

     It seems that most if not all medical expert evidence at the inquests came from pathologists,
who of course deal only with the dead. I feel it is imperative that expert medical opinion is heard
from those whose specialty is the treatment rather than the dissection of patients, who can explain
the causation and therapy of asphyxia, rather than its post-mortem appearances. Only in this way
can it be clearly established whether events after 3.15 did indeed contribute to Some deaths.
     In particular the impression generated was that death was inevitable in all cases from an early
stage. I do not believe this to be true; the reasons ior this belief are outlined in the section dealing *** * ^ ^
with the difference between 'crush' and 'traumatic' asphyxia.                                                 5
                                                                                                   fv< t           ^
     There are some further points I should like to make concerning post-mortem evidence. They ^-* 1 ^ f
are rather technical, but I feel important, as they throw doubt on the propositions made about the
timings of deaths.
     I have seen two transcripts of inquest evidence - from Dr. Neil SLATER concerning the
victim Philip HAMMOND, and from Dr. John Chalmers CLARK concerning the victim Gary
Philip JONES - in which it is suggested that either no resuscitation was attempted, or that the
attempts were made after death had occurred. I believe I was the doctor attempting to resuscitate
both of these victims.                                                                            ^            ^
    Regarding Philip HAMMOND, Dr. SLATER states that there wergno jigos„QfleSuMtadan,7
as no needle puncture marks were found. The following is taken from the inquest transcripts:
                ...all these cases were examined extremely carefully to look, fo r example, fo r
                needle marks. I f needle marks had been placed in the body I am quite confident
                I would have found those. There were certainly no needle marks that I found in
                Philip, sir, and so clearly there had been no injection o f anything into Philip.
      It is not sound to assume that as no injections had been performed, no drugs had been given.
The first step of intervention in the hospital treatment o f someone who has 'arrested' (whose heart
has stopped and who is not breathing) is to 'intubate' the patient. This involves passing a hollow
tube - an endotracheal tube -through the vocal cords into the trachea (windpipe). Ideally, the next
step is to obtain access to a vein, so that drugs to re-start the heart can be injected. However, if
it is not possible to do this, through technical difficulty or lack of time, these drugs can be literally
squirted down the endotracheal tube from where they are absorbed directly through the lining of
the lungs into the circulation.
     This was common emergency practice at the time of the disaster, as indeed it is now, and I
certainly used this technique extensively on some victims. I made reference to this fact in my
report to the hospital. If the endotracheal tube is removed after the resuscitation has been
abandoned, there may be little or no evidence that the patient had extensive and prolonged
resuscitation. It is certainly not reasonable to assume that lack of needle marks means that the
patient was 'dead on arrival'.
     Dr. SLATER then goes on in his evidence to the inquest to state that in his opinion Philip       ~^
HAMMOND was dead when he was brought to hospital This is despite Police Constable Stephen
TAYLOR, who accompanied Philip to the hospital in an ambulance after administering first aid *vvvj> ■ J
at the ground, stating in his evidence that an 'unidentified doctor' (myself) tried for around 20
                                                                                                                   *




                                                                                   Dr. Ed Walker page 4
                                                                                                       lit k i d
minutes to revive Philip. Dr. SLATER's belief is that Philip was in fact dead before he arrived at        i * /A
the hospital. Even though P.C. TAYLOR says he could feel a pulse in Philip's neck, Dr. SLATER,
after direct questioning from the coroner, suggests that the policeman was in fact feeling his own
pulse.
     In the inquest evidence about his post-mortem findings on Gary JONES, Dr. CLARK states
that there was a 'plastic tube ju st above the right collar bone; there was a drip inserted into his
right arm', which he rightly identifies as medical intervention. The tube near the collar bone is a
central venous line, which is a large-bore tube which is placed with the aid of a needle, into a
large, central vein near the heart. This is a more efficient way of giving intravenous drugs in an
arrest situation, as they are injected almost directly into the heart.
     I placed several central venous lines on patients that day. In the case of Gary JONES, the kA~-nJ"
pathologist states that these puncture marks 'hadn't caused any reaction', or braising, so the
patient was already dead when this was done. Someone who requires a central line placement J w •#
during cardiopulmonary resuscitation is certainly in extremis, but they are just as certainly not       .
dead.
    In both the cases outlined above, I feel my evidence would have contradicted that of the
pathologists, had it been made available.
     Finally, there has been some correspondence in the British Medical Journal between myself
and Dr. David SLATER. Dr. SLATER is the pathologist who was portrayed in the Granada
dramatisation as holding a telephone conversation with an off-duty Liverpool police officer about
the circumstances surrounding his attempted resuscitation of one victim (Kevin WILLIAMS) on
the pitch. Copies of this correspondence are enclosed, and are I think self-explanatory.

     There has been much talk of the difference between 'crush' and 'traumatic' asphyxia. Professor
Alan USHER, in a report prepared for West Midlands police which attempted to cover all the
pathological aspects of the tragedy, states that 'the two terms are synonymous.' They are not, and
a bold distinction between them was made by the medical teams from the Northern General and
Royal Hallamshire hospitals in an article in the British Medical Journal published in November
1991 (after the inquests had ended.)
     The term 'crush asphyxia' was used in this article by Wardrope el al (Wardrope J, Ryan F,
Clark G, Venables G, Crosby AD, Redgrave P. The Hillsborough tragedy. B M J1991; 303: 1381.)
to define this syndrome. The cause of death in most cases was simple lack of oxygen to the brain
and heart, brought about by the victim's inability to breathe. The following is taken fronj that
article:
                Crush Asphyxia
                The disaster at Hillsborough resulted in a gradual and prolonged crush affecting
                large numbers ofpreviously fit people. The patients presented with little evidence
                o f the classic signs o f traumatic asphyxia - facial oedema; cyanosis offace, neck,
                shoulders, and upper chest; subconjunctival haemorrhages; scatteredpetechiae
                over the upper part o f the body - yet many developed serious neurological
                sequelae, usually said to be rare.
                Discussion
                We have used the term 'crush asphyxia' to describe the main neurological injury
                in these patients. Although there were similarities to traumatic asphyxia, these
                conditions differ in mechanism o f injury, clinical findings, main
                complications, and outcome.
                Traumatic asphyxia is usually caused by a heavy weightfalling on the chest or
                a violent crush between heavy objects, such as motor vehicles       By contrast,
                crush asphyxia is caused by a gradually increasing and sustained pressure on the
                chest, so preventing inspiration....
                (emphasis added)
     'Asphyxia' means simply the prevention of air from entering the lungs. It can be caused by any
number of means, from suffocation through choking to strangulation. 'Traumatic' in medical
terminology means injury caused by the transmission of force. Thus 'trauma' encompasses road
traffic accidents, sporting injuries and assaults among others. 'Trauma' is often subdivided into
•blunt trauma' and 'penetrating trauma', the former concerning transmission of forces to the body
by blunt, often high-speed objects (such as hitting the steering wheel of a car with one's chest
during a road accident), and the latter concerning stab or gunshot wounds.
      So 'traumatic asphyxia' means the prevention of air entering the lungs by means of force
applied to the chest. In itself, however, this can cover an enormous range of injuries. If someone
is r un over by the tyre of a truck, they may die of traumatic asphyxia (although they may have

other damage to structures within the chest which will contribute to death through torrential
bleeding.)
     The situation at Hillsborough was different, and unusual. The degree of force involved was
not sufficient to damage the heart or large blood vessels in all but one or two cases. Indeed, the
degree of compression of the chest wall in the victims was not sufficient even to break ribs in the
vast majority of cases.
     There was also discussion at the inquests about the speed at which unconsciousness and
 death supervene when oxygen is not available to the body. In some respects this was discussed
 accurately, in that unconsciousness occurs within seconds, and brain damage begins within three        ^
 minutes oFsoroTcompleteanoxia 0hypoxia: low oxygen levels; anoxia: no oxygenpresent.) But
IhiTm q^^                           whole process was inexorable, inevitable and irreversible.
     This may apply in true traumatic asphyxia, where the lungs are so severely damaged as to
make gas exchange impossible even if the victim is treated. But in the case of crush asphyxia, it
is quite apparent that even up to the stage of brain damage commencing, if the victim is removed
from the crush, and oxygen {or air, which. is-an adeq.uate ’second best’) given in the form of
mouth-to-mouth or artificial respiration, then it is completely possible to halt the damage, and in
some cases reverse it.
     It is worthy of note that as a general rule, the younger the victim, the more amenable to
treatment of this kind they are. Even if brain damage has occurred, young brains have incredible
reserves and potential for full or partial recovery. A classic example of this phenomenon is
drowned children, who may appear dead to all intents and purposes, but can, given the correct
treatment in time, make full recoveries.
     It is pertinent here to discuss very briefly the diagnosis of death. Death is a process rather
than an event. While it is easy to say with certainty that a patient who is sitting up and talking is
alive, and that one in whom rigor mortis has set in is dead, the passage from one state to the other
takes the patient through a very grey area indeed. Someone whose heart has just stopped beating,
perhaps as the result of a heart attack, may still be alive with measurable brain activity.
Conversely, someone with a beating heart but no brain activity can be described as 'brain dead.'
This term, which is used quite freely in the lay press, is in fact a pointedly specific diagnosis,
which cannot be made until a strict set of diagnostic criteria have been fulfilled.
      As a matter of routine in accident and emergency work, we deal with patients who would
appear dead to a bystander. We certainly do not declare life to be extinct until resuscitative
measures have been started, given a chance to take effect, and found to be of no avail. Even then,
once we have decided to abandon attempts, I personally do not like to declare death until a period
o f a few minutes have passed during which there has been no cardiac or respiratory activity.
     In summary, the chances of recovering from the sort of crush experienced at Hillsborough
are immeasurably greater than those of recovering from what is normally understood as 'traumatic
asphyxia.' In particular it is incorrect to state that there was any one point at which the
death of all victims was inevitable. In all cases, there was a chance of some recovery possible
provided the crush was removed and appropriate emergency care given, at least up until the point
that cardiac arrest occurred (the heart stopped beating), and possibly even beyond that point. This
I feel renders the '3.15 cut-off ruling untenable.

     My understanding of this decision is that the coroner decided after hearing the pathological
evidence that by 3.15 pm, all the deaths that occurred were inevitable, and nothing that happened
after that time made any difference to the eventual outcome. He therefore refused to allow
presentation of evidence of anything that happened after this time.
    It may perhaps be accurate to say that all those that died had received their fatal injuries by
3.15, (although I am still unclear how this time was decided upon), but to then go on and say that
nothing that happened to them between 3.15 and the time at which they died made any difference
to the outcome, is incomprehensible to me. If this were the case, it would make redundant
everything that I and others did at the hospital, and by extension the whole concept of emergency
medical care.
     The ruling not to hear anything of actions or omissions after this time meant that evidence
of events that I ■nfeel        may have contributed                 to some deaths was never presented to the inquest jury.

     My experiences on the day were confined to the hospital setting. Confusion reigned for some
time, and it was unclear what sort of disaster was occurring. Most Major Accident plans (usually
known as 'Majax' plans) are geared up to surgically-based trauma, such as one might expect to
see following a railway accident, or an explosion. Hillsborough was again unusual in that most
victims needed nothing except very simple anaesthetic intervention. Ideally, the hospital should
have been given more details of the type of injury involved at an" early stage. Lack of this
information meant that the department was geared up for the wrong sort of victims.
     In my report prepared for the hospital authorities, I make reference to lack of basic
equipment, drugs, and oxygen, even within the hospital setting. Had more accurate information
been received at an earlier stage, it is possible that this equipment would have been ready in time
for the reception of the casualties. Delay in activation of the 'Majax' plan is referred to in two
separate publications in medical journals.
    In January 1990, James WARDROPE published a short paper in the journal Injury (1990 21,
53-54) entitled 'The hospital response to the Hillsborough tragedy.' The paper states:
                   As with almost all major incidents there were severe communication difficulties
                   but these are part o f a judicial enquiry and cannot be discussed at the time o f
                   writing.
     The second reference comes from the BMJ article (WARDROPE et al) previously referred
to, published in November 1991:
                   Hospital accident and emergency departments
                   The accident and emergency departments o f the Northern General and Royal
                   Hallamshire Hospitals received a message from the police at 1520 to say they
                   were on 'casualty standby. ’ The agreed and correct procedure, however, was to
                   telephone the hospital switchboard with the message, 'Implement the major
                   disaster plan.' No such message was received.




                                                                                            Dr. Ed Walker page 8
               Northern General Hospital
               After the police message at 1520 key staff at the Northern General Hospital,
               including the consultant in accident and emergency medicine and two assistant
               matrons, were informed that the hospital should expect casualties. A t 1525 a
               message was receivedfrom South Yorkshire Ambulance Service control to 'expect
               a child with a cardiac arrest'. There was no reference to Hillsborough or
               indication that a major incident was taking place....
               Failure to implement the major incident alert earlier meant that only a few staff
               had to cope with a large clinical workload in addition to implementing the major
               incident plan.


    Mr. WARDROPE, the Accident & Emergency consultant in charge at the Northern General
hospital on the day stated in a letter to one of my superiors that 'For a time Dr. Walker was the
only person with anaesthetic training in the Resuscitation Room and he was instrumental in
bringing speedy treatment and resuscitation to a large number o f patients. ’
     I have seen more than one statement in which the witness states that they rang the hospital
switchboard to tell them to activate the plan. However, it is my understanding that it is only
activated upon direct instruction from the ambulance or police service, or the consultant in charge.
This did not happen I believe until around 3.45 pm. Failure to activate the plan at an earlier stage
meant that key personnel such as anaesthetists were not present at the time we were receiving
most casualties.
      Another important feature of events after 3.15 which I feel has bearing is the apparent refusal
to allow ambulances onto the pitch. I understand that some 40 or so ambulances were outside the
ground, but only two were ever allowed on to the pitch where they were needed. This must surely
have contributed to some deaths. Victims had to be transported on advertising hoardings to areas
where volunteer doctors with no equipment did what they could. Any ambulance at that time
would have been equipped with oxygen, and a 'bag and mask1 to give artificial ventilation.
Paramedic crews would have been equipped and trained to intubate victims. Failure to allow the
ambulances to the immediate site of the disaster to administer first-aid meant that some victims
still alive received no treatment in time, and treatment of others was delayed. As outlined in my
description of'crush asphyxia', it is critical that oxygen is administered as soon as possible after
the crush element has been removed.
     It is my firm belief that these occurrences after 3.15 pm may indeed have contributed to some
deaths which might otherwise have been prevented. They also resulted in brain damage in some
victims, which could have been lessened, or avoided altogether. By virtue of the '3.15 ruling', no
evidence of this was ever heard by the inquest jury.




                                                                            Dr. Ed Walker page 9

            Dear Colleague,

            As you nay know, the West Midlands Police are investigating the incident
            at Hillsborough Stadium on the 15th April 1989.      One arm of the investigation
            concerns the Coroner and he is especially interested in the patients who were
            brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of the Northern General
            Hospital and have subseouently died.   i. have provided an over used statement
            of the situation but the Coroner would like much more detail on the
            activities in the Resuscitation Room on that day.    I have therefore provided
            the Police with a list of people involved in the Accident and Emergency
            Department.

            'You may therefore be asked for a statement by West Midlands Police.
             There may be difficulties in patient identification but all the available
             information on patients is housed with Mrs. Chris. Stockwell in the Medical
             Records Office.

            I have contacted the Solicitors acting for the Health Authority in this
            matter and they have advised that if you have any reservations regarding
            these statements, you contact them before speaking to the Police.

            The»9olicitors concerned are Oxley & Coward, address - 275 Glossop Road,

Police room.    No one there knew what was happening outside that

building.

Once booked in -   I   completed the pro forma statement - in the gym in

the company of other officers who also had no radio, and who were

also oblivious to what was happening anywhere else.

At approximately 3.10 pm (15i0 hrs) I made my way back under the

North Stand towards Leppings Lane to return to my serial.      At that

tirre I still had no idea that anything was wrong.

On arrival at the rear of Leppings Lane I saw what can only be

described as confusion.     Police Officers and spectators were carrying

people from an area near to and in the tunnel, back towards the lane

outside the gates.

I had no idea what had happened and could not see any members of my

owr. serial.   I helped to carry persons frcm that area.

One man I helped to carry was large, approx. 25 - 30 yrs, fair hair,

not wearing any shirt - he was breathing when I put him on the lane.

Monents later when I returned with someone else I saw that he was
       &
deed - I was shocked that this would happen at a football match.     When

I saw an ambulance man he suggested putting him at the side of the

lar.e with the others.    I carried him with other officers to where I

sav\ about 7 people covered up - obviously dead.     I still had no idea

what had happened.

At the back of the lane there were numerous Police Constables

standing about, helpless to do anything.

I couldn't see any of my serial and can't recall seeing anyone above

the rank of Sergeant in that area.

Mary spectators were swearing and abusive towards the Police - a high

proportion still in a drunken state.

After most dead and injured had been removed frcm the Leppings Lane

stand, I stood at the entrance to the tunnel with other Officers -

attempting to prevent fans re-entering to find relatives - many

became violent when prevented from entering the tunnel.

Once the game was abandoned and the majority of spectators had left

the ground, I made my way through the tunnel on to the pitch where I

rejoined other members of my serial.

I later attended at the de-briefing and went off duty at El at 7.30

pm (1930 hrs).

During the push outside the ground - my fears were for the other

Police Officers pushed up against the gates and the walls, and for

the children, especially the ones with their necks pushed up against

the barriers.

If I had been in charge outside the ground I would not have hesitated

in opening the gates - at that time.

Some notes arising out of the conversation with R. Manning

Tel Call from Mr. Richard Manning at about 7.5 p.m.

Note started at 7.33p.m

Mr. Manning rang re the file note which I had mentioned to Mr. Croston.

He told me that he had been accused of suppressing evidence and he wondered if I
could remind him were we met to discuss the statement.

I said that I could not recall but would have thought it might have been in my room.
He said he had never been in there and in those circumstances i t could not have been
there. It could have been I suppose somewhere in the corridor but I cannot recall that
detail I told him that although I was not absolutely sure I think I was trying to
determine whether I could use the statement as documentary evidence but of course
 c o u l d o n ly do so i f i t was not controversial. I s a i d I recall being concerned about
 Insp White and also about speaking to him (Mr. Manning) but in the end this was the
best way forward. Mr. Manning wondered if I had got one Stan Beechey to show the
 statement to him but I said the note says I showed it. I did not show the whole of the
 statement but only a part.

 He confirmed that the statement of Insp. White had been found. The value of the
 statement is of course an entirely a different matter.

 He said that they were trying to establish a conspiracy between him and me as there
 was no short hand note of the conversation. I said there would not be as it did not
 take place in court but that there was no question o f a conspiracy between us. The
 initiative for the contact had been mine and I was trying to overcome a difficult
 evidential problem.

 Mr Manning pointed out to me that he would not have felt it right to admit a
 statement which was controversial if he could not cross examine the maker and this
 seemed reasonable to me. Furthermore I could not have admitted it as documentary
 evidence if it was controversial.

  I said I was sorry I could not help further.

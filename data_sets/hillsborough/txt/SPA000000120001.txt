             Dear Member

            OFFER OF RESIGNATION BY THE CHIEF CONSTABLE

            Further to my letter of 8 August I enclose a further item of press comment
            which appeared in the Sheffield Star on Monday.

            I also enclose copies of letters which have been received by the Chairman or
            myself addressed to the Police Authority as such. I would add that it may
            well be that there is further correspondence in the GPO at Rotherham
            awaiting collection which is prevented by the NALGO action.

            Yours sincerely




            R C Johnston
            Clerk and Financial Officer

            acted upon
         THE report by Lord Justice Taylor into the
         Hillsborough Stadium disaster puts Sheffield
         in the dock.
             It damns South Yorkshire Police for a
         breakdown of control; it indicts Sheffield City
         Council as inefficient and dilatory; and it
         accuses Sheffield Wednesday of failing to act
         on capacity problems at the Leppings Lane
         end of the ground.
             In other words, all the blame for the
         tragedy is laid at Sheffield's door.
             But the interim report reserves its clearest
         and most damning criticism for South York­
         shire Police. It presents a catalogue of errors
             Chief Constable Peter Wright has tendered
         his resignation. When members of the South
         Yorkshire Police Authority meet on August 14,
         they should accept it.
             Peter Wright is an honourable man who
         has had a brilliant career and who has
         behaved with utmost dignity since the tragedy
         in April.
             He has consistently said he would shoulder
         the executive responsibility for the actions of
         his officers, and he has said he fully accepted
         the findings and conclusions of the inquiry
                       Enormous job to do
              In those circumstances the police authority
          has no choice and should accept his offer to
          go.
              It is significant that Lord Justice Taylor's
          report dwells most on the behaviour of senior
         officers, calling into question leadership
         qualities and the wisdom of pre-match plan­
         ning decisions.
             It says 65 police officers gave oral evi­
         dence, and that the quality of their evidence
         was in inverse proportion to their rank.
             Collectively, Sheffield now has an enor­
         mous job to do. With the city bidding to
         become one of the world's major sporting
         centres, confidence has got to be rebuilt and
         we have to prove our commitment to the task
         ahead.
             The findings of the interim report have to
         be faced squarely, and if difficult decisions
         have to be made as a result, so be it. Respon­
         sibilities in all quarters, from police, to
         council, to club, cannot be avoided.
             There has also got to be a fundamental new
         approach to the whole business of football,
         and that involves everyone from fans to
         s o c c e r a d m in is tr a to r s , and th e c lu b s
         themselves.
             Ninety-five lives were lost on the terraces
         of Hillsborough. The least we can do is to
         make sure their memorial is the knowledge
         that lessons have not only been learned, but
        ^acted upon for the future.                            j

   Dear Mr Chairman

   This Chamber of Trade wishes to advise you of its support for the Chief
   Constable of South Yorkshire, Peter Wright, following the issue of the Interim
   Hep or t on the Hillsborough otadium disaster inquiry by the R t Hon Lord
   Justice Taylor.

   We feel that South Yorkshire can ill afford to lose the services of a Police
   Officer with the integrity of Hr Wright at this time.

   Whilst it is public knowledge that Mr Wright is prepared to submit his
   resignation as a result of the criticisms of the Police handling of the crowd,
   we trust that your Committee in the interests of South Yorkshire, will not
   accept it.

   Yours sincerel

   Dear Jack                                   I

   ."us:; a note for the record that I believe your    Committee   snould
   not accept the resignation of Peter Wright-
                                               I
   This wouJd not. be a solution to the problems that occurred in
   that tragic event in Hillsborough.         I jindicated on Yorkshire
   Television that if public opinion was for retribution then you
   will sack the Chief Constable, but if it'wants to find solutions
   to complex problems, then Peter Wright will be asked to continue
   to be part of what will hopefully be a national team trying to
   find solutions to these complex p r o b l e m s .^ I also believe that
   taking a wider view of Police Operations,; it would be in the best
   interest of South Yorkshire for th© C h i e f i Constable to continue.

   Hope these comments are helpful,

   tours sincerely

Sir Jack Layden,
C ha ir ma n,
South Yorkshire Police Authority,
Snig Hill,
Sheffield.

Dear Sir,

I have read in the press that Peter Wright, Chief Constable,
has offered to resign his position in view of the official report
findings of the Hillsborough Enquiry.

It seems that the Hillsborough Disaster was the result of a number
of different factors outside the control of the Police.

As far as I am able to tell, Mr. Wright has generally carried
out his duties and responsibilities in a very efficient manner
during his term of office, and I, therefore, urge you not to accept
his resignation.  The fact that Mr. Wright has offered to resign
proves his integrity.  Policing in South Yorkshire has been very
effective, as far as I am aware, during the last few years.




Yours faithfully,
               __

            Dear Mr Johnaton

            Re;          Chief Constable Mr Peter Wright

            Further to our telephone conversation, I would strongly request
            that the South Yorkshire Police Authority accept Mr Wright’s
            resignation on the grounds that his continuance as Chief Constable
            is no longer tenable.

            There aro 4 main areas:

            1            He should fulfil the commitment he made on April 21st 1989 to
                         accept full responsibility for the action of his officers.

                              Ref:  Taylor Report para 278.
                              ...the main reason for the disaster was the failure of
                              police control...

           2            Mr Wright as Chief Constable was responsible for
                         pi'omoting the "officers in charge on the day and as cited
                         by Lord Justice Taylor:-

                              Ref: Taylor Report para 280.
                              ...their handing of problems on the day nor their account
                              of it in evidence showed that the qualities of leadership
                              to be expected of their rank...,

                               ...these represent a number of errors of judgementI

           3            The police case at the Inquiry was conducted in a manner
                        that was unrealistic and despicable. Not only was there
                        no expresseion of regret for the SYPA part, but they
                        persisted in attempting to blame "drunken fans and late
                         comers"

                              Ref: Taylor Report para 285.
                              ...such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety

                                                            1

          as to whether lessons have been learned. It would have
          been more seemly and encouraging for the future if
          responsibility had been faced....

     As Chief Constable, instructions to Mr Woodward Q.C. was under
     Mr Wright's    stewardship   and despite   insurance   company
     requirements, he should have faced his responsibility towards
     the Inquiry, and the feelings of the bereaved families and the
     injured.

     lie himself went on record shortly after April 15th as "seeing
     no connection between opening the gate and the crushing".
     Again a complete error of judgement. Indeed the behaviour of
     most of the senior officers at the Inquiry was lamentable.

          Ref: Taylor Report para 280.
          ..... they were defensive and evasive witnesses...

          Ref: Taylor Report para 279.
          ..... for the most part, the quality of their evidence
          was inversely proportional to their rank,

4    During the final stages of the Inquiry,        the need for
     disciplinary action has been denied, despite officers being
     moved sideways, and Mr Duckenfield suspended. Even after the
     Taylor Interim Report was published, no acknowledgement of
     police responsibility has been made - indeed we are subjected
     to an accusation of unfairness by the Inquiry towards the
     police, (Mr Woodward Q.C. final submission).

I, as Chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, strongly
request the SYPA to accept Mr Wright's resignation as part of the
necessary resolution of the tragic events on April 15th at
Hillsborough.

I would repeat that we, the HFSG, would prefer to deal with these
matters in a private and considered way, but should the SYPA fail
to give our representation due importance, we will have no
alternative but to initiate a full scale media exercise and will
naturally be petitioning the Home Secretary,

I would repeat Mr Wright’s continuance as Chief Constable is not
acceptable and merely on the above his position is totally
untenable and we feel that the SYPA has no alternative but to
accept his resignation forthwith.

Yours faithfully



Trevor Hicks
Chairman - Hillsborough Family Support Group

    Peter Wright CBE The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police.

    Peter Wright has offered his resignation to the Police
    August* * 7 vhlch v 1 1 1 meet to consider this on Monday the 14th

    You must be suffering from a surfeit of free advice and it is
    also my intention to request to the many you must have received
    this    StayS as ^ i e f Constable and I give my reasons for


    uwJ??               hav® had mY differences not only with Peter
    Wright but with other officers and therefore I trust that my
                »n°?   J ? ken as someone who 'would say that
    wouldn’t he ’ classification.

A   South Yorkshire Police have taken a 'beating » from some
    ?owr*nSSTa?iv,in?rale aJ loYervrank level is from my information
    low and 1 remain convinced that a change in Chief Constable
    will not boost morale rather the contrary.

    S£r«.J;et?lL?righ5,t? have a c c e P fce d responsibility for the events
    nnf          ^ fr i  J futypl0ai gesture by him but surely he is
    not expected to lead the parade and sweep up after it ,
    One accepts he appointed some of the officers but so did the
    Police Authority .

              b(\ J he tlme when we a 1 1 unite not only behind the
    Chief Constable and South Yorkshire Police but also the Police
    Authority.They know South Yorkshire and its citizens.

    r La ? !£ i be«.unS«r?? a VOje ,
                                   of confidence is given to the Chief
    Constable the Police and the Police Authority.
    Truly I hope this can be the situation.

            OFFER OF RESIGNATION BY THE CHIEF CONSTABLE

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY - 14 AUGUST 1989

OFFER OF RESIGNATION BY CHTFF CONSTABLE


Report of the Clerk and Financial Officer

1     Introduction

       The purpose of this report is to set out briefly the main relevant
       considerations to the A u th ority’s decision on whether to accept the Chief
       C o ns table’s offer of resignation following the publication of the Interim
       Report by the Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor on the Hillsborough Stadium
       Disaster.
2     Options

2.1   Members already have a copy of the letter which the Chief Constable sent
       to the Chairman on 4 August placing his office at the disposal of the
       Authority.

2.2   The following alternative responses are available to the Authority

       (a)       To accept the offer of resignation with or without an expression
                of reluctance.

       (b)       To accept the offer of resignation (with reluctance) but to ask
                the Chief Constable to remain in post until a successor has been
                appointed and/or is in a position to take over from him.
       (c)       To accept the offer of resignation (with reluctance) but to ask
                the Chief Constable to remain in post for a specific period - for
                example until the substantial completion of the C o roner’s
                Inquest, expected to take place early in the new year.
      (d)       Not to accept the offer of resignation.

2.3   In practise there may be little difference between options (b) and (c) in
       terms of the eventual date of the Chief Constable’s resignation. Moreover
       in relation to option (d) it should be borne in mind that the Chief
       Constable having attained the age of 60 is now in a position to retire on
       full pension. His term of office as President of ACPO expires in
       September.

2.4   Whichever decision is adopted it will be essential to spell out for public
      information the underlying rationale. However, no matter how carefully
      this is done, there will be a tendency to read into the decision an
      implied degree of acceptance of the contents of the report and support for
      the Chief Constable and his Force.
3         Considerations

3.1   In reaching this decision the Authority will have regard to the following
      main factors.

          (a)      The statutory duty of the Authority to maintain   anadequate   and
                  efficient Police Force.

          (b)     The interests of the public of South Yorkshire.

          (c)     The effectiveness, reputation and morale of the South Yorkshire
                  Police Force.

          (d)     The general public interest at a national level.

3.2   It would be presumptious of me to comment on any of these factors and the
      list is probably not exhaustive. However as some indication of the
      national dimension of the issue I attach some of the press comment
      following the publication of the report which can be seen to represent a
      wide spectrum of opinion.
4     Conclusion

      The factors outlined in paragraph 3 are closely interlinked and in giving
      as they must prime consideration to their statutory duty as expressed in
      3.1(a), the Authority may in effect be reflecting the balance of arguments
      under items (b) to (d). I suggest therefore that the overriding
      consideration must be which of the options set out in paragraph 2 best
      serves the maintenance of an adequate and efficient Police Force.

CHIEF CONSTABLE                                                        4 August 1989




 Councillor Sir John Layden




 You will now have received a copy of the Report of the Inquiry conducted
 by Lord Justice Taylor into the tragedy at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.
 The Report levels a number of criticisms at members of the South Yorkshire
 Police and indicates that the police handling of events was a contributory
 factor to the disaster that occurred.

 You will recall that at the meeting of the Police Authority on 21 April I
 made a statement in which I accepted full responsibility for police action
 in connection with the event.

 In the light of Lord Justice Taylor's findings I have decided to offer my
 resignation to the Committee in order that members can review my position
 as Chief Constable. Accordingly my Office is now at the disposal of the
 Committee.

 I have forwarded a copy of this letter to R C Johnston, Clerk to the South
 Yorkshire Police Authority.




                          NOT FOR P U B L I C A T I O N as it
                      contains         exempt     information

HILLSBOROUGH:     PROGRESS ON IMPLEMENTATION

We agreed that I would clear the draft and covering note with you
before they are put to Private Office.    Since the original note
is addressed to Mr Moriarty I have drafted for his signature.

I have already done some work on what might go into a Statutory
Instrument - hence the reference in the draft note. I cannot see
how an Order would help implement the Interim Report except as a
measure to ensure that local authorities include in safety
certificates terms and conditions which are not there already.
But if local authorities are already doing all that they can an
Order will not hasten the process.    (I get the impression that
all this is more for presentational purposes.)

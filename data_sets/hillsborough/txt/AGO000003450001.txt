               For your information. I am not faxing the judgment in Woolgar v Chief Constable of Sussex
               and UKCC as it is 21 pages long!

               The Attorney General might like to discuss this when I see him at 9.30pm tomorrow
               morning.

               R v DUCKENFHXD AND MURRAY

               I thought I would write to you concerning the two outstanding issues raising from the disclosure
               decision you have taken in this case. The draft letter you provided to me on Thursday evening
               is ready to be sent.

               The two main points that we discussed were;

               1        Whether the account of the interviews with Lord Taylor and Geoffrey Dear conducted
                        by Sir John Woodcock and/or Sir Clive Whitmore should be disclosed in addition to the
                        initial report o          At the time of your original decision to disclose the report,
                        you were unaware oi these interviews.

               2        Whether it is legally necessary or, in handling terms, appropriate to inform Sir Geoffrey
                        Dear of your decision.

               As to 1 ,1 suggest that the letter from Sir John Woodcock recording the interviews should be
               disclosed. The contents complete the picture in a wav which is important if the court is to assess
               the true value of the information provided by          should either party decide to rely on it.

               As ro 2, my advice is that the conversations recorded in Sir John's letter dated 13 July 1990 were
               held in confidence. For this reason, Sir Geoffrey Dear ought in principle to be informed of you
               intention to disclose that letter (if you agree with my advice under 1 above) and given the
               opportunity to object if he wishes to do so. If he did, you would need to consider Whether thui
               objection should be overridden in the public interest.

               I enclose thejudgmenr in Woolgar v ChiefConstable o fSussex and UKCC (CA, 26 May 1999),
               which helpfully sets out the legal position. The fact that these documents are to be disclosed to
               ensure the proper administration of justice would in principle fall within the exception:.!
               circumstances that justify disclosure. Subject to your views, I do not consider the facts that these
               were not interviews under caution,or that they were not conducted as part of m "ordinary" police
               investigation are significant in the context of establishing the principles that ought to apply io
               the disclosure of the interviews to a third party.

              Like you, I doubt that Sir Geoffrey would object to the disclosure of his response if the initial
              report is to be disclosed. I recognise that you wish to take this matter forward quickly and <lo
              not think that you would need to do more than give reasonable notice of your intentions (say 48
              hours). We could consider writing to Mr Justice Hooper regarding the initial report at the same
              time as writing to Sir Geoffrey Dear.

              I hope this is helpful.

              will say as follows


1.   I was born on the 30th August 1956.



2.   I joined the Sheffield ambulance service in 1972 and was

     initially based at Corporation Street, Sheffield.        I joined

     as a clerical officer, and after some time I transferred to

     the administrative block at Nethe^i^lepfâ€™Hospital in Sheffield

     and then on to the work shops back at Corporation Street

     until approximately four weeks ago.        At that time I came
     over to control to commence training as a control assistant.

     My     training to date has incorporated switchboard training,

     and I generally sit with other more experienced people

     within the control room.       I was not on duty on Saturday 15th

     April 1989, but I called in to control shortly after 1500

     hours with                 , who is a Standards and Efficiency
     Officer.    As we arrived at control in                   car, I
     noticed Mr Alan Hopkins rushing out of the control building

     over to Roger Morley, who had just arrived at the same time

     as ourselves.    Mr Hopkins informed Mr Morley that there was

     trouble at Hillsborough Football Ground and then Mr Hopkins
     and Mr Morley got into the staff Range Rover and presumably

     left for the ground.                      and I went in to the

     control building, and as is normal practice when one is off

     duty               informed Control Superintendent Ray Clarke
     that we were both in the building.        The control room was

     very busy,      and Mr Clarke's basic comment was that he
required our assistance.



I was initially requested by Mr Clarke to telephone control

at West Yorkshire and inform them that there was incident

taking place at Hillsborough, just in case we required extra
assistance.



Mr Clarke then told me to sit in the Control Superintendents

office, which is just off the control room, and with a list

of names of all control officers and assistants,           I was

requested to make contact with as many people on the list
with the intention of asking them to come into work.        Four

control officers and four control assistants agreed to come

into the control immediately.



Shortly afterwards, Albert Smith who is the Assistant Chief
Ambulance Officer heading Control and Communications,

arrived at control.       He asked me to telephone two more

officers and arranged for them to act as liaison officers at

the Northern General hospital and the Royal Hallamshire

hospital.     The two officers concerned were
and _______________, and I gave them instructions to go to

their respective hospitals.



Thereafter I went back into the control room and shortly

afterwards                    , who   is one    of   the control
assistants who had recently arrived, suggested opening up a
                                                            oJc
        switchboard.    The switchboard is not normally used otf

        weekends.   It was a sensible suggestion bearing in mind

        that the telephone lines were jammed with press calls an

        other non emergency calls.   I assisted              on the

        switchboard initially and was then left on my own.        I

        carried on with this task until sometime between 1900 hours
        and 2000 hours by this time, the number of calls from the

        press had greatly reduced, and it was decided to close down

        the switchboard.   jay involvement with the Hillsborough

        incident basically came to an end at that point in time,

        although I continued to help out in control until I left
        with           at 2240 hours ,

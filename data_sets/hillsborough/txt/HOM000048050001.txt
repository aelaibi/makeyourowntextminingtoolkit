HILLSBOROUGH PAPERS



I return herewith the files which you lent to the Scrutiny in August last year. These are

         LSLO 20.18.94
         LSLO 20.26.92
         LSLO 20.1.92
         INQ.4.92 Part A
         INQ.4.92 Part B

2.     You also let me have copies of papers from your general file on Hillsborough
(400.89.105). As I mentioned on the telephone I am not returning these copies but am
destroying them as classified waste.

3.      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has asked me to pass on his gratitude - which I entirely
share - for your help with this material.

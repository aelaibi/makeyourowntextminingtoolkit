Dear Dr Popper

I write on behalf of Mr Hadfield who is on leave.

I am now aware that any confusion which existed as to who was your
officer in regard to Hillsborough 1989 is resolved and that unequivocally
Mervyn Jones fills that role. Equally clearly, I confirm that such
assistance that Mervyn will need in the future by way of staff, etc, to
carry out that responsibility will continue to be provided from this
Force. Similarly, Mr Sharp will be supported in respect of his area of
responsibility, ie, DPP and PCA aspects.

Yours




Acting Chief Constable

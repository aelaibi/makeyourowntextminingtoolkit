roundabout         contr o l l e d          junction        of the A616T and A 6 1 , I a t t e n d e d at

that     location and was                   informed        that      traffic          entering        the    roundabout     ,
particularly               from the M a n c h e s t e r         side       of the A616T,            were      unsure    which

exit    to take            from the         r o undabout        to travel          to     the    football       ground at

Hi 1 Is bo rough.

On arrival         this          situ*                    evident          and as a result,              I

directedPolice               Serges                       AXTER       to C l a y w h e e l s     Ln Traffic Office               to

collect a number                  of     informatory          signs        for    placing        on the       roundabout

to a l l e v i a t e       the    problem.

This    was     carried out and at approx irnate ly                               1100 h o u r s , two d i r e c t i o n

signs were         placed on the                  roundabout and             the       problem was           rectified.

It was       obvious          to me       that     the m a j o r i t y of         football        traffic       in evidence

was    carrying Liverpool                     s u p p o r t e r s , being        i dentified        by their

favours.         T raffic          flow       remained moderate                  and    no e x cessive         build up of

traffic was            e x p e r i e n c e d at an y of the N o r t h e r n Police ma n n e d

points       until         1300 hours when               traffic        trav e l l i n g       along    the A61    from

j u n c t i o n 36 at T a n k e r s l e y          became       reas o n a b l y heavy and began                 to buiId

up on the T a n k e r s l e y             side     of the       roundabout             j u n c t i o n with    the A616T.

Due    to this         I    inst r u c t e d O f f icers            enga g e d at       this     roundabout       to ease

t raffic      flow         by div e r t i n g      traffic          right    onto       the A 616T to D e e p c a r .

This    diversion             proved        eff e c t i v e and       certainly           by    1400 h o u r s ,, t raff i c

flow was        light.

Additional         direction              signs were at rny instructions                          placed at       the

Deep c a r    exit         of the A & 1 6 T        d i r ecting       football          traffic        onto    the Old A616

received        reports at              frequent         intervals          from motor           cycle       patrols,

patrolling         the A61             to H i l l s b o r o u g h    to the       effect        that traffic was

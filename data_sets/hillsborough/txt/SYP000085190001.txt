On arrival          at the gr o u n d we found other               o f f icers     in serial         formation

sat    in the N or t h S t and of the ground where we were                             briefed as         to

our    duties       by Seni l o r    off ic e r s    present.



At    10.3 0am the same            date we m ar c h e d jas a se r iaj/ f rom the g round to
                                                                      Q jb r* '
Hali f a x R o a d / b e t w e e n the Trave l l e r s FjijUa-Hrfi-iouse and Mads ley Bridge

R a i l w a y Station,       where we were           spaced     i n d i v i d u a l l y at   regular

intef^it-als along          this    s tr e t c h of the      road,     taking      up static         points

on the     public house            side of the         road.    Our    duties were           to su p e r v i s e

football       supp o r t e r s ma k i n g    their w a y to the gr o u n d from this                   side of

the    city.    These       s up p o r t e r s we re almost      e x c l u s i v e l y from Liverpool.



My nearest          serial    colleague        on Halifax Road,             was P c / a t t e r s o n, we were

stood by the b o u n d a r y wall             of a large        d e t a c h e d house and garden.

B e t w e e n the    public     house and the           railway station.



At this       location we          remained until p . 0 0 pm the              same    date.      Whilst at

this    location the L i ve rp oo l            supporters w a l k i n g         past me were          orderly

and    in good spirits.             I saw five         persons ar r i v e without             tickets      for      the

m a t c h walking      up and down the              line of s u p p o r t e r s    trying to buy them.

Three were          succesful.       Three     groups      of Liv e r p o o l     youths a sked me w h i c h

public houses were              open so they could buy a drink.

None    were o b vi ou sl y drunk            but    several     had o b v i o u s l y been drinking

intoxicants.          Quite     a lot of       people w al ki ng        past my point were                drinking

intoxicants          from    cans and        had supplies         in the      bags     they were        carrying.

The    route    to the gr o u n d was          littered w i t h d i s c a r d e d empty beer and

soft    drinks       cans.

At 3 . 0 0 pm the same          date Ps A t k i n m a r c h e d       the   serial      to the L e p p i n q s

Lane    end of the ground.              I had no idea w h y at this                  time.      I assumed          some

pate Public House               in Hali f a x Road other                o f f icers      not from our       serial

were     a t t ending       a disorder         s i t uation w i t h i n the         premises       involving

L i v erpool         s upporters      but    did not        require      our assistance.



O n arrival           at the Leppi n g s         Lane      end of the        ground,       we were       formed    into

a cordon across              the    ent ranpr'lo           prevent further persons entering

the    ground.         Approximately           ten minutes          later as a serial we                 entered     the

g round via the L e p pings                 Lane     end and the         central         tunnel    w h i c h gives

a cc e ss    to the standing a rea and                     pitch we were           met    by a scene of

confusion.            Persons      on the      pitch,       an a m b u l a n c e   had been driven to a

po s i t i o n on the        pitch by        the goal.         Several       persons were          laid out on

the    pitch by the goal,                some o bv i o u s l y dead,          others       being    given heart

m a ss a g e and m outh to m ou th               resuscitation           by a mixture          of Police

Officers,            a m bulance    staff and            private    individuals.           There were       no signs

of obvious            violence      on the       bodies.



I a s si st ed to bring out t w o / p e r s o n s                from the L e p p i n g s Lane area over

the    fence         to jthe pit c p ^ whe r e       other     p^-rSons gave          them first aid

attention.            I neTped a L i v e r po o 1/^upporter                female        nurse,    out    of the

same     crowd to render a s s i s ta nc e                 to the     injured       persons



I then joined a cordon of Police Qffifi'ers,                                 across       the w i d t h of the

p i t c h n ear the half w a y              1 i ne_. I wVfi'po s i t i o n e d off centre towards the

s up p o r t e r s    of both teams.

As well       as the numerous               persons        in shock,       grief      there were         several

groups       of L iv er p o o l     s up p o r t e r s    intent    on trouble w i t h the N o t t i n g h a m

F o r es t   supporters and the Police                      in some      cases.       We were      verbally

a b u s ed   from the        pitch and stand by the Liv e r p o o l                      s upporters who      blamed

the Police            for the      tragedy.

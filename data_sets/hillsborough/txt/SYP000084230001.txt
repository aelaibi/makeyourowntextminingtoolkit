                     SEMI-FINAL, HILLSBOROUGH 1988

                     Liverpool played on Sheffield wsdnesday1s Football Ground,

                     Hi 1Isborough, Sheffield,                in April 1988,                I was engaged with my seri

                     During the period prior to the kick-off,                                I recall carrying out dut

                     outside the Leppings Lane entrance.                                 These duties involved the

                     searching of tans for cans, bottles, alcohol and offensive weapons

                     together with checking that fans had tickets and directing them to

                     correct part of the ground.                    At no time do I recall any barriers o

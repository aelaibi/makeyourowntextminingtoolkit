 Thank you for your faxes of today. We refer also to our
 telephone conversation. The HFSG have asked for a copy of
 the Guidance provided by CPS to SYP, via ourselves, by way
 of your letter of 15 July 1998. We have no instructions on
 this point at present but can you let us know if CPS would
 agree to such disclosure assuming that our clients did not
 object?

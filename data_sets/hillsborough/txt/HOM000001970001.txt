              I am a m a r ri ed man and               I live at the above address with my wife and

              two     children.

                I have been a sked about                 the events         that occurred on Saturday                 15th

              April       1939.

              For     the    past two years            I have      been employed,             on a casual        bases,   at

              H i l l s b o r o u gh Football        ground.         I have        received no formal            training      for

              rny position.              I can be posted to any                   part of the ground.            I arrived at

                the ground -at about              1115 hours         on the day with



                                 I parked my           car in Fadding Rd,               off Lappings Lrt.           tamer         on,

                on the      previous match,            we were told by people                   from the      club that ail

Ln,   through the m ain gate,               and    into the ground.                        Wa walked alongside

the   river at the          rear    of the South Stand and                 into the stile office.                                      I

noticed that there were a number                        of Liverpool           supporters already

hanging around the Leppings Ln entrance.                             I would                   say that there were

about 50          or 60 there.        We went and         collected our tickets                                       from, the

office and we hung about                  there        for the newt 40 minutes.                                       In fact we

went out to the            pitch.     There we saw a few supporters already                                                 in the

ground.          i saw some      in the Spion Kop and two old                               ladies                in the seating

area of the South Stand.

I got to          my tur instil e at aoout 12 noon or                12.135.                    1 was all o cave a

I opened my turnstile at about                         1210 hours.         At this stage,                                   w ou ici

describe         tns    crowd as very thin.               There were only a few people                                       coming

through.          I remember       that    there was a police man on every turnstile

outside     the ground and there were                     in-line     of about 5 or                               6    police

officers         on the    inside.        I would describe as quite                                  thin up until about

1.30pm     (1330).        I only took about 40 tickets                     up until                          then.

After     that     time more        people     started arriving.                      The            police were still

there     checking        tickets.        They were also searching                               them on the outside

  When they got            in they were being             searched again.

 I noticed a bit of a difference                        in the number            that were                        trying to get

in at about 2.15pm             (1415).         There was nothing out of the normal                                                for a

match of this size.                 At about 2.30pm            (1430)      I noticed                             that the     crowd

 naa swollen.             There was thousands             there      by this stage.                                They was a

 crush on.             I didn* t see anyone            being   injured at this stage.                                       i. aidn't

like a normal         match.         It remained         like that        until    I closed the gate

at 3pm    (-1500).          Nobody    told us to close the gate                  I just closed at the

normal    time.       I remember       that    there were         still    people outside.           There

w asn' t a     lot about 20 or 30 thats all.

I left rny turnstile at about 3pm                    (1300)       with|_____ |.     I normally walk

into    the' North S tand and around the                   pitch at the West Stand End to

qetto    the    players         tunnel and the stile office.                    However    on   this Gay

we were making          our way arouno to            the iviorun Stcind when a stew^ir d

stopped us and told us that we had no chance                              of going around that way.

He said that          there were       thousands         on tns    pitch.        I could see       that

people were        sitting        down holding       their    sides and others walking a r o u n d

helping      others.        1    didn't see anyone        lying     down.

We   then went        out       to qate "8 ’ it was still           closed. I remember              we     had

to open      it.      It wasn't       locked    its only on a little               catch.       wnen we

went    through we          closed the gate         bsnind us.           This    orougm,    us oiii to

tne walkway which               leads around to the directers                   tunnel at the back of

the S ou t h Stand.             I saw that there were a m bulances around.                       It was

obvious      that something           serious       had happened.           When we were walking

past gate       ’C 5 by the brick wall              I saw a number of people who                   had been

injured.        There wasn't man y fans around there at this stage                                it was

mo s t l y a mb ul an ce me n and      policemen.          I saw people sitting              by that wall

who were       obviously         injured.      I saw one man,             he must have been         in      his

3 0 " s who was       lying face       up on the ground.                I couldn't    see his face.           I

 remember      that he           didn't have       any    clothes on apart from a pair of                 whit

 boxer shorts.         He        didn't have       any shoes       on      or anything. There were a

 number      of u n i formed      person around him.               I c o u l d n ’t tell    if they were

 a m b u l an ce me n or     policemen.        I d i d n ’t notice any women there.                  *ney

 were    trying       to revive      him.      I know t m s        because       I saw his      legs j u m p m

 when he was          being     thumped on the           chest,    i dont know       if ne was

 dead or       not.     I also       saw a number         sitting       on the grounu who iiac>

injuries            to their           legs.       At one stage                  shouted out that he had

seen a young                  lad what         1& years     old who was          dead.     He was          very upset

and started to                      cry.    i didn't     see the lad,          I thougnt            it best to take

         away at this                  stage       because'    he was     very upset.

We walked ar o u n d the back of the S outh Stand and                                     into the stile

office.             we handed our                 tickets   in and we got          paid.        After a short

while we went                   onto the T r a c k a i o nside         the     pitch and stood at                     the

corner         of the Ho p and the South S t a n d .                      At this        i>tage       1 would say           that

the whole              of the ground was still                  full     of supporters.                I coal a see

that      there were                 thousands       of fans on the           pitch.      At        this    i,ime nobody

knew what was                   happening.           1 didn't     have a view oi           the toesi.

S t a n d because cf the                      number   of fans on trie pitch.                  we stooa there               for

about        -iO to         15 minutes.             1 saw   people       rip billboards             down ana           run to

the     other          side         of the ground.          I saw    people       being    carried on

billboards               but        I couian*I describe anyone                 in particular.                  I could see

that      the        people          on,    The    b i 1 Iboards were      being    taken to the                corner      of

the Spion Kop and the N orth Stand.                                 ihere were a number                    ot ambulances

there.

When we were                  standing         there    I saw a N o t t i n g h a m r o r s e ^ ran who was

standing             in the S pion Kop near to the                       corner    of the South Stand.                       I

remember             he had short              dark hair.        He was wearing a blue

shirt.             I think he was                 in his mid 30*s.            He was     standing           just up where

other        fans were               taking       the billboards         from.     He was           shouting          something

to some young Liverpool                            supporters who were on                the piuCh.             I remember

that       thev were                shouting       something     back at him.            I oon t know wuat                  that

        I !                                     af


        W I L L STATE




                                                                                                    I have        a part-time


        job   as   a    turnstile       operator      at    Sheffield         W e d n esd ay       Football       Club     and   I

        have b e e n doing this part-time wor k since h a l f way through last season.




        On 15th April this year I arrived at the ground w i t h my

        at about       11.15 am.         W e went     straight         to    the   turnstile          operators'         office

        and   signed        on     at   about    11.20      am.        At    12.00      midda y       I    was     designated

                                   By   12.05   I had      opened m y        turnstile.             At    that     stage    some

        turnstiles          were    already     opened.         At    that    time      there       appeared        to be    one

        policeman on each turnstile on the outside and a line of policemen on the

        inside s earching fans as they came through.




        Between opening at 12.05 and about                           1.30 p m I would          say        that    I must have

        let in about 40 or so people.                      During that           time    there was plenty of time

        to    talk     to    the    police,     stewards        and    other       turnstile         men.         It was    very

        slack but not unusually so.                   Things u s u a l l y start            to become busier about

        1.45 p m or thereabouts.




        I remember- ’talking “t             o    t    u     r     n     s    t     i    l      e         andr-he^wa-s- s-ayiirg*

         that we       could probably expect               a crush a bout          2.15     pm since             the Liverpool

         train was ar riv ing at W a d s l e y Bridge S t a t i o n at 2.02 pm.
From about        2.10/2.15         pm it did             indeed    start        to get bus y with                a constant

stream of people             coming       through.           The        crowd was          quite       jovial.         I would

say    that    there       was     not    much       harassment           and,    although             I would         normally

expect to smell drink on their breat h as they come through the turnstile,

on 15th April,            I saw no sign of drunkenness                         at any time.                Obviously some

must have b e e n dri nki ng but,                as I say, I saw no sign of drunkenness.




From      about    2.15      pm    onwards,           I    saw     no    police        on       the    outside         checking

wheth er or not people had tickets,                          although they had been there earlier.




At    a   normal      league       game        one    can     expect       a     lot       of    activity         from     2.15

onwards,       and at 2.30 pm this day,                      I could he ar            that       there were            a lot of

people      outside.          I    heard       people       going        over     the       roof      of    the    turnstile

building       and    I    could        then    see       them jumping           down                                       the

inside of         the turnstile.               I did not see             the     police ma king             any    effort    to

stop them, but it is fair to say that I was ve ry b usy at the time.




From 2.30 p m to 2.45 pm the crowd was                              r e ally pushing               to get        through    the

stile.        There       wou ld   be     two    or       three    people        at    one       time      in    the    doorway

when      there w o u l d n o r mal ly         only be       room        for one.           It was         then    that    some

people started jumping over the turnstile.                                      Some went             through by forcing

their w a y in close b ehi nd one w i t h a ticket                              in front.             As   I released       the

turns file'

instead       of one.         This       is    sometimes         known,        I believe,             as   "doubling       up".

That was       the    state        of    things       from       about     2.30       pm    to    about         2.55    pm with




                                                                                  signe

more     and m o r e    of a crush       to   the   turnstile entrance.              I could          tell    from

some of the peoples'             faces that there was a real crush outside.




Fr om 2.40 p m I estimated               that about     thirty people came through without a

ticket.       There was no        w ay    that those people            could be     sent back and             they

simply forced           their w a y   through       either b y     jumping      over      the    turnstile      or

giving me no alternative but                  to let them through.              Some people were also

throwing m o n e y on the counter and then forcing                          their way      through without

stopping.




At some      time during the crush             I recollect hearin g            the turnstile operator

on                 having arguments w i t h people w h o               had not      got     tickets      or had

the wrong tickets.              I remember this ha ppening on two or m or e occasions.




Some fans came through m y turnstile with no tickets and others with wrong

tickets.         I recall       that some had        tickets     for    the    terraces whereas              I was

only supposed to take tickets                  for the sitting           in the West        Stand.        It was

w h e n I was telling some poeple               that they mu st          go bac k since          they had      the

wr ong     tickets       that                   shouted      over      to     me,   from        his   turnstile

                  that     a    po liceman    had     told   him    to      take    any    ticket       and    let

anybody in.            That was about 2.45 pm.

                                                                        sigi
w ay b a c k into the crowd anyway.




It was     also    about       2.45       pm     that    I    noticed       someone       in   turnstile          16    was

trapped      and he was         s cre aming        for someone            to pull h i m out.               I would      say

though     that he       was    there       for      no mor e       than    a m inu te     when       he managed          to


release himself.




At   about     2.50   pm,      I could         see     from m y     turnstile        through         the    open   doors

onto     the    inside    of     the      ground        and    I    saw    then    that    a    concertina             gate,

which    I now know         to be         Gate    B, was       opened by a policeman at                     that       time.

He did     not    appear       to be       ejecting          anyone.        He    simply       opened       it   and     the

crowd surged in.            I recollect turning to the turnstile operator behind me

at stile 14 and saying "that copper has opened                                    the gate".          At    the time I

found it v e r y surprising since the whole crowd was coming in uncontrolled


wi th no ticket checking.




During     the    time      that      I    saw     the       gate   being        opened    I    was     still      taking

 tickets       through    the    turnstile.              I would          estimate    that      he    left       the    gate

 open    for    about    five m i n utes          up     to about         2.55    pm beca use        it was       at    that

 point    that    the     p ressure        of     the    crowd      at     the    turnstile       eased,         and    then


 there was no pushing or shoving.




 The p O T i c e m a h ’Vhro" o pened Gate B-looked                  to be a normal            constable since he

 had a n orm al helmet.             I did not see who closed the gate but w h e n I looked


 again at about 2.55 p m the gate had b e e n closed.                                ^_______________________

By 3.00 p m there w e r e           only one or two                 peop le left outside and itwas then

that    a p ers on    offered m e      £40   to        let          him    in.Isaid        that     I   could          not

accept it a nd he went away.




Just after about 3.05               pm I pushed the                outs ide door closed.




As w e w e r e c ollecting          the tickets into a bag                 and getting        ready          to    leave

the    turnstile building           I recollect        that        the    turnstile        operator          in stile

      had a handful        of money and he         turned      to me       and held his           hand out             and

said "look at this lot.              W h a t shall I do wit h this?".                      He said "they have

just b een    throwing        it at me".        I said        that       the    same had happened                  to me

and we deci ded        that    the only      thing we         could do was               to put     the money           in

our pockets.




The    turnstile operator at stile                                  ha d a handful           of   £5 notes.              I

had about     the same.         I   had   about    £30.                             at                      had    a bit

m o r e I think.      The day       after w e went           to the City Hall and donated                         it to

the D i s as ter     Fund.      A   couple    of   days       later        there      was    a report             in   the

papers that gatemen had b een taking bribes for letting people in.                                                I rang

Sheffield W e d n esd ay       Club O f fi ce     to    speak       to    the       secretary     of        the    Club.

He was u nav ai l a b l e and I spoke to his assistant,                                                     I did not

give m y   name      but     I ex plained    how we          had    come       by    the    money       and       we   had

/donated ;it to" C he Dlsater: Fund,. ^ S h e said- that                    that was- f ine and -that -we-

had    acted quite p roperly by doing              that.           She    told m e not         to wo rry           about

it and thanked m e for ringing in and explaining.




                                                                          sigrn
At no point on 15th April did m y    turnstile b reak down or prove faulty in


any way.




In the previous year     I was a turnstile operator at the F A Cup Semi Final

at the Spion Kop end     of the grounds   and I remember thinking h ow quiet   it

was on m y stile that    day.




I have read   this   Statement and it is true and correct   to   the best of   my

knowledge.

   Mr Robert Atkins MP
   Minister For Sport
   House Of Commons
   Westminister
   London

   Dear Mr Atkins

   Lord Justice Taylor,     Final Report   (Recommendations)

     Now nearly 3 years' since the Hillsborough Disaster, and the
^ ^ p u b l i c a t i o n of the Taylor Report, we are, as expected, hearing
      the same stale arguments from those with a vested interest,
      precisley as we did after Bradford and Popplewell.

   Mr Tom Pendry M P , Chairman of the all party committee on
   football has publicly endorsed those stale arguments by saying
   " We want more flexibility to help clubs which would have very
   great difficulty paying for all seater changes, many are
   already facing increases in their bills for policing at a time
   when arrests and convictions are falling."

    I recoqnise the cost involved in implementing Taylor's
    recommendations is huge, but as your aware the present
    government has redirected £100m to the Football Trust, surely
    the clubs have a duty to the public to do something for
    themselves for perhaps the first time in their history.

    I am concerned by those who don't support argument and debate
    for the implementation of Taylor's recommendations.

    In his report Taylor quotes Popplewell and he clearly thinks
    these worth repeating " almost all the matters into which I
    have been asked to inquire and almost all the solutions I have
    proposed, have been prevoiusly considered in detail by many
    disinguished Inquiries over a period of 60 years."

    I am concerned for the safety of individuals, amd our national
    sport, but in that order. Therefore I would welcome yours views
    regarding the Taylor recommendations and the Conservative
    Partys position now that argument for backtracking appears to
    be gaining momentum.

    Yours sincerely


    Barry W Devonside

I understand that you held a meeting with Robert Atkins on
4 March to consider whether Premier League clubs should continue
to have access to Reduction in Pools Betting Duty money. One of
my officials attended the meeting as an observer.

The meeting also discussed the application of the Taylor
recommendation on all-seated stadia to clubs in the Third and
Fourth divisions. As I think you know, we in the Home Office
consider that we should hold the Government policy line that all
clubs should convert their grounds by the deadlines recommended
in the Taylor Report.  This will maintain pressure on clubs and
ensure that they all act to improve the safety of their grounds.
The recent disturbances at Birmingham show that the old problems
are still very much alive.

While there may be a case for revising the requirement for Third
and Fourth division clubs in the future we think it may be too
early to do so now.   I would much prefer to wait until all the
First and Second division clubs are converted or at least fully
committed before considering revision of the requirement.    Any
slight opening of the door now would surely encourage the larger
clubs to try to take advantage.   We would wish to avoid that.

I am not convinced therefore that it would be wise for officials
of  our departments    to prepare   a   joint paper containing
recommendations.

DRAFT LETTER FOR SIGNATURE BY THE ASSISTANT PRIVATE SECRETARY TO
THE MINISTER


Barry W Devonside Esq
                                             FEP/90 19/35/1
                                                 April 1992



Dear Mr Devonside,


Thank you for your letter of 12 March in reply to mine of 10
March about the implementation of the Taylor Report.


While it would be wrong for me to attempt to anticipate the
outcome of the General Election, I can say that the present
Government's policy on all-seated football grounds remains
unchanged; namely that standing accommodation at Football League \
grounds should be eliminated, by August 1994 in the case of
(Premier League) 1st and 2nd Division clubs, and by August1999
for those in the 3rd and 4th Divisions.


We have consulted the Minister for Sport s office and understand
                                               if
that the report in the Sunday Times of 1 March you mention# and
other newspapers published on the same day, was not based on any
press inteview given by the Minister.

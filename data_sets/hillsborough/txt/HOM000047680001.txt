RE: STATEMENTS OF (1) DR EDWARD C WALKER
                   (2) ROGER HOULDSWORTH

I refer to our telephone conversation of 18 November 1997 and as requested forwarded you a
copy of the original statement of Dr Edward C Walker. You will note that Dr Walker wrote his own
statement hence the blank lines and different coloured ink to the countersigning officers. Also
enclosed is a print of the statement from the West Midlands Police HOLMES Hillsborough
Incident data base.

In respect of Roger Houldsworth I enclose copies of the 3 statements he made and printed
copies of these statements from the HOLMES data base.

              conclusion,.          X was       directed to take             up my       point.

              I was a member              of serial          13 under       the    s u p e r v i s i o n of Police Sergeant

              2001 Burnrian.             At    11.15 a.m.          I took up my          point    together wi            ^Police

              C o nstable 2 592 Shimwell.                     We were       d e p loyed at the       base of the

              s t a irw ay     leading         up to the seated area                in the West Stand.              There are

              two such stairways and we were                             p ositioned on the one            leading        into

              the stand above                 the    pens numbered four,                five and six.         Our   duty was

              to assist, the six stewards also at this                                  location.      When the fans

              entered the ground from the Leppings                                Lane    end at    12.00 a.m.           they were

              a d m i t t e d to the West Stand,                   having    first       had their     tickets       checked by

              the stewards,              each were          then torn at          the    corner    to prevent        it being

              used again          by fans           in the terraces          below.        A steady      influx     of fans

              were    a d m itted        throughout          the afternoon.              All   tickets were         checked and

              a d m is s i o n gained          only by those             in p o ssession of a ticket             for the

              seated area.               Throughout          this    process many tried to               come back         down

              the stairs          for various           reasons          (to buy    programmes       etc.)     but were

    challenged                          by stewards,                       became              violent and abusive.                        On one occasion

I also      saw numerous             fans    standing       on the       pitch and my         immediate

thoughts were            that       there    had been an          incident       involving        fighting.            As

I a pp ro a t h ^ d the      perimeter            fencing       I saw a Police        Inspector         assisted

by two male Pol'ice C o nst ables                    pulling       people    through the gaits of                pen

number '2.         This a r e K o f         the    terrace a p p e a r e d to be well             packed

a lt h o u g h   I was    not aware          that an y o n e was         being    crushed.         I could see

people      i m m e d iately        behind the fencing and they did not appear                              unduly

dis t r e s e d a l t h ou gh       the officers          pulling       people    free were        having

diffi c u l t y because          the volume          of    people       seemed    c o n c e ntrated ar o u n d

the gate.        At this        time     I also      saw further          officers      climbing        onto the

a d v e rt is em en t    boards       in front       of    pen 3.       These     officers       shou t e d at

the fans         to move     back away from the                 front.      A gain    I did not see

anyone      unduly d i s t r es se d and from.my                  position       I saw that a l t h o u g h the

pen was full            of fans,       there was          room toward the back               to ac c o m m o d a t e

more.       A short       time       later    I heard fans          inside       pen number 3 shouting

that     they were        being       crushed and that             there were        people       underneath..

I then spoke            briefly with Police S e r g e a n t               1288 Payne,         who aver t e d my

a t t e n t io n to an elderly g e ntleman                  pressed tightly against                  the    fence.

He was      purple       coloured and his m o u t h gaped open.                       I could see           he had

been     crushed to death and the weight                          of fans behind him was                 holding

him tightly agai n s t               the fence.           Yet   still     thepe-. was    roorri at the \back

of the       pen/aiid we        c        nued shgutirrg for              tl^m to     pCiT-h back.          KVas

now fully' aware           of/the       •s.ituaj.lon occurring             before me and           I looked for

the    exit gates         from where          these       people    could be       released from the

pressure.          I could see only one gate                      providing an e v, x £ l\om this

hands and tried to pull                    them up and over        the    perimeter     fence.       For

some    reason they were              reluctant        to do so,    perhaps    because      they were

so tightly       packed they           could not        get an arm free       to    reach up.         1any

fans were       successfully           recovered by this method and ushered ont) the

pitch to       clear     the    immediate area.            During    this    process     I recall

looking up onto            the seated area above               the terraces and saw many fans

being    pulled from the terraces                  into the stand.

O n the arrival          of Chief S up er i n t e n d e n t Nesbit,         I was    instructed along

with other       officers        to form two           lines   on each side of the gate               t3 pen

3.     This    I did a n d from this             point    I a s s i s t e d with the    removal       of

bodies     being    pulled from the              pen.     As each one was          freed then the

line    passed them along until                  the    last two    officers       removed them to

the    pitch and       rendered first aid.                As the    process    continued        I saw

many    bodies     removed,          all    of which were       purple     coloured and        had

urinated       onto their        clothing,        they seemed to be dead,              but even so they

were    given m outh to mouth                r es u s c i t a t i o n and heart massage    in an

attempt       to revive        them.       Whilst a s s i s t i n g with this       process many of

the    fans a lr e a d y    freed a pp r o a c h e d     the area    in a d i s t r e s s e d state,

concerned for their friends and                        relatives.        On several     occasions          I

a d v i s e d them to      clear       the area and a llow the Police to                continue.              On

the arrival        of an a m b ulance          onto     the pitch   I was aware         of a m b ulance

crews as s i s t i n g     with the aid of breathing apparatus.                        Those    persons

who a p p e a r e d to be alive were              removed and others          beyond     help were

covered with Police              uniform anoraks.              Slowly,     the terraces        were

cleared and        in doing so             I saw that     there was a layer of bodies                 piled

on top of one another.                 Police Officers          entered the terrace and

continued to        pull       the     bodies    free.

Water was       s u p plied to         casualties who were          conscious and many           removed

from the scene           on mak e s h i f t    stretchers.

           abuse and       pulling     the boards away        from the       front     of the stand.        I was

            then     concerned    for my safety and          returned to the           pitch where    I was

                            INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND
                           SATURDAY 15th April 1989




    8.30am 15.^»89, duty commenced at E1. Arriving at Hillsborough football ground at
    approximately 9»30am for a later briefing at 10.00am. Meal taken directly after the
    briefing and on conclusion    I was directed to take up my point.
             I was a member of serial 13 under the supervision of PS 2001 Burman. At 11.15am I
    took up my point together with P.C. 2592 Shimwell. We were deployed at the base of the
    stairway leading up to the seated area in the West stand. There are two such stairways and
    we were positioned on the one leading into the stand above the pens numbered 4,5 and 6.
    Our duty was to assist the six stewards also at this location. When the fans entered the
    gsround from the Leppings Lane end at 12.00am they were admitted to the West stand having
    first had their tickets checked bjr the stewards, each were then torn at the corner to
    prevent it being used again by fans in the terraces below. A feteady influx of fans were
    admitted throughout the afternoon. All tickets were checked and admission gained only by
    those in possession of a ticket for the seated area. Throughout this process many tried
    to come back down the stairs for various reasons (to buy programmes ete) but were prevented
    from doing so. The vilume of spectators coming into the ground remained steady and
    controlled until about 2.3Qpm when there was an apparent increase in the number of fans
    entering the stand via the stairway. Many of these fans appeared to be intoxicated and
    some were rowdy although none were particularly troublesome. As time progressed toward
    kick off time, between 2.30pm and 3.10pm there was a surge of fans pushing their way into
    the stairway. The stewards then were overwhelmed with the volume and had great difficulty
    in effectively checking tickets. Many fans pushed and forced their way onto the stairs
    and when challenged bj stewards became violent and abusive. On one occassion a fan struck
    one of the stewards. Myself and PC Shimwell tried to stop a number of fans entering the
    stand without tickets but were literally propelled along with the flow of fans. The
    sheer volume of fans increased to such a degree that this task became impossible and for
    our own safety we told      the stewards to stand back and we then stood by the wall adjacent
    to the base of the stairs.     At this point we watched as     the surge diminished and we
    received a radio message " All officers attend on the perimeter track." We immediately ran
    round the rear of the West stand toward the Police control box and on route encountered
    a young woman who was lying on the ground in the area beside the Police box, between the
    West and Jgouth stands.     She was in a state of shock and    was suffering with breathing
    problems. She vomitted      and complained of being crushed    in the crowd. Ie rendered firstaid
    and were joined by a St Johns member who then assisted further. This then enabled1PC
Shimwell and myself to continue onto the perimteter track, where we joined several other
officers also attending in this area. On our arrival on the pitch we were confronted by
the sight of many Police officers immediately infront of the Vest stand terrace.        I also
    saw numerous fans standing on the piteh and my immediate thoughts were that theee had

                                                                            . 2 .


                                                                                               i
been an incident involving fighting. As I approached the perimeter fencing I saw a
Police Inspector assisted by two male P.C’s pulling people through the gate of pen
number 2. This area of the terrace appeared to be well packed although I was not aware
that anyone was being crushed, I could see people immediately behind the fencing and
they did not appear unduly distressed although the officers pulling people free were
having difficulty because the volume of people seemed concentrated around the gate.
At this time I also saw further officers climbing onto the advertisement boards infront
of pen 3- These officers shouted at the fans to move back away from the front. Again I
did not see anyone unduly distressed and from my position I saw that although the pen
was full of fans there was room toward the back to accomodate more. A short time later I
heard fans inside pen number 3 shouting that they were being crushed and that there
were people underneath. I then spoke briefly with PS 1288 Payne who averted my attention
to an elderly gentleman pressed tightly against the fence. He was purple coloured and
his mouth gaped open, I could see he had been crushed to death and the weight of fans
behind, him was holding him tightly against the fence. Yet still there was room at the back o:E
the pen and we continued shouting for them to push back.   I was now fully aware of the
situation occuring before me and   I looked for the exit gates from where these people could
be released from the pressure.   I could see only one gate providing an exit from this pen.
At the gate several officers were attempting to pull the people free. This was made
very difficult by the bodily pressure of others immediately at this point. Hoiifever one by
one bodies were pulled out of the pen. Whilst this process continued other officers
standing against the fencing encouraged people to reach for their hands and tried to
pull them up and over the perimeter fence. For some reason they were reluctant to do so,
perhaps because they were so tightly packed they could not get an arm free to reach up.
Many fans were successfully recovered by this method and ushered onto the pitch to clear
the immediate area. During this process I recall looking up onto the seated area above
the terraces and saw many fans being pulled from the terraces into the stand.
      On the arrival of Chief Superintendent Nesbit   I was instructed along with other
officers to form two lines on each side of the gate to pen 3« This   I did and from this point
I assisted with the removal of bodies being pulled from thejpen. As each one was freed then
the line passed them along until the last two officers removed them to the pitch and
rendered first aid. As the process continued   I saw many bodies removed, all of which
were purple coloured and had urinated onto their clothing, they seemed to be dead but even
so they were given mouth to mouth resusitation and heart massage in an attempt to revive
them. Whilst as isting with this process many of the fans already freed approached the
area in a distressed state, concerned for their friends and relatives. On several
occassions I advised them to clear the area and allow the Police to continue. On the
arrival of an ambulance onto the pitch I was aware of ambulance crew assisting with the
aid of breathing apparatus. Those persons who appeared to be alive were removed and others
                                                                                   - 3 -




beyond help were covered with Police uniform anoraks. Slowly the terraces were cleared and
in doing so I saw that there v/as a layer of bodied piled on top of one another. Police
officers entered the terrace and continued to pull the bodies free.
    Water was supplied to casualties who were conscious and many removed from the scene
on make-shift stretchers.
    When the pens were completely empty a radio message was received to the effect that
the fans in the west stand were becoming increasingly aggitated and together with other
officers I stood in the terrace below the stand where I could hear the fans shouting abuse
and pulling the boards away from the front of the stand. I was then concerned for my
safety and returned to the pitch where I was asked by a Police Sergeant to remain with
his serial until further instruction. After a short while I again located PS 1288 Payne
and further E1 officers. Together we waited for further instruction and when the match
was officially called off we made our way into the north stand. Before doing so I located
and joined PS 2001 Butman in the seated area of the v/est stand, where I assisted serial 13
search   for property that may have been left behind,
I have   four years service in total and during this time    I have worked       atall the
football venues in the force area excluding Rotherham F.C. I have worked at Hillsborough
football ground on numerous occassions. I have undertaken several duties within the
ground   including turnstiles. I have previoBs experience    of duties at theLeppingsLane
end of   the ground and within the v/est stand. I have attended the vast   majority ofmatches
this season at Hillsborough football ground.

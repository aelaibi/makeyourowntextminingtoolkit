disorder was apparent.                      We were       then   i nstructed to form/a                  cordon

woman being             helped      by a young man walk               towards          the    cordon.       Whe n she

was    only a few yards away,                    the young           lady fell           onto    the floor.           The

man    ran towards me and,                  a lt h o u g h    in my opinion was                 the worse       for

drink,       he was       e xt re m e l y   distressed.



T o g e t h e r w i t h PC H A G U E , I went           to the a s s i s t a n c e         of the young woman

an d found         that    she    had an       i nj ury to her              leg and was          unable      to breathe

smoothly.            After       giving what           help we         could,       she a p p e a r e d to be much

better and so             I a d v i s e d her,       w ith the a s s i s t a n c e         of the youth,            to seek

medi c a l    help at the Po l i c e             room.         Ha v i n g    left her,          together      wit h PC

HAGUE,       I a s s is te d a man who had w i t h him a small                             boy who a p p e a r e d to

have    injured his            ribs.        I also a dv i s e d these               to seek medical             treatment

and d i r ected       them to the Police                     room.          At    this    point     I now     noticed

that a lot of             people were          on the         pitch and that a lot of these were

injured.           I also      saw at       least      two     people whose faces were                     covered with

coats and were             o b vi ou sl y     dead.          I then began to move a r o u n d the goal

m ou th area and           gave a ss i s t a n c e and advice                    where    necessary.          On more

than one occasion,                 I was a pp ro a c h e d        by    people who were              obviously          in

distress,          some    even     crying.          On one such o c c asion                I was a p p r o a c h e d by

a y ou th and after              calming       him,      follo w e d him to a y o u t h              lying      on the

floor,       who a p p e a r e d to have           injured his              legs,        Together,      we    rendered

first aid and was                q ui c k l y joined          by a group of about                 10 youths who

were    carrying an a d v e r t i s e m e n t           hoarding.                These youths        im m e d i a t e l y

took    hold of the            injured y o u t h and began to pull                         him onto       the

hoarding.           I advised         them to be             careful        as    they were       obv i o u s l y

causing       the    injured y ou th some               pain a n d became                involved      in an argument

wit h these youths,               some      of w h i c h were          the worse          for drink.          Once

things       had    calmed,       the youths           carried the               lad away.



I then once a g a i n began                 to move about              the area giving             help and

a s s i s ta nc e w here       I could.          I did not assist                  in carrying anyone               to the

but    there was a need for, orqanisaj^Ton near to the goal mouth.                                                                After a

a g ai n a p p r o a c h e d    by PS 812 who             informed me to find other                                  cafnmunity

I had helped to keep                   clear.         Once     in L e p p i ^ f s Lane          I formed a cordon

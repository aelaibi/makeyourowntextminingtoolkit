   LORD TAYLOR'S INQUIRY


   Thank you for your letter of 23 October which arrived whilst I was on leave but which we had
   the opportunity to discuss before I went away.

   Compilation Video

   As I explained, one of the members of the Treasury Solicitor's team, Hussein Kaya, attended
   on the West Midlands Police in the early stages of the preparation for the Inquiry to look at
   various videos and to assist in preparing the compilation video shown at the Inquiry.

   My recollection is that he spent one or two days with the Police looking at videos but clearly
   he is the only one who can directly help as to the process, bearing in mind that we are talking
   about an exercise which took place several years ago.

   Mr Kaya is presently with the DTI Solicitor and Director General Legal Services, 10 Victoria
   Street, London SW1. Telephone: 0171 215 3444. I have mentioned the possibility that you
   might be in touch with him and if you decide to do this it will therefore come as no surprise.

   Evidence

   As I may have said to you in our telephone conversation, the gathering of evidence for Inquiries
   varies somewhat from case to case. In this particular matter the West Midlands Police had
   been called in as an outside Police Force to investigate the actions of the Yorkshire Police.
   There was also some suggestion of possible prosecutions. The result of this was that the West
   Midlands Police set up a HOLMES Inquiry and put a considerable amount of manpower into

   Peter Whitehurst - Head of Employment Litigation Team
   Edward Solomons - Head of Commercial Litigation Group
        S     i ? r ofwitnesses. There was great cooperation between the Inquiry and the
  S .if                        u W“ agrecd at an “ '■J' sta*e tllat *>*y would supply the legal team
  with all the statements as they were produced. This meant that even before the Inquiry beean
  (and throughout) we received on a daily basis literally box loads of statements T h le
   “                "°‘ tak,:n ,n chronological or other order and consequently were a mixture of
  football fans, police, emergency service personnel etc etc.

  r* P " 1 °f, J 6 f r0£;eSS of dealinS with the evidence it was decided at meetings between Lord
  Taylor and the legal team that effectively a chronological story would be told. Consequently
  slT f r w w T 1S,thal the LlverP°o1 fans gave evidence first followed by the Police then by
  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and some others.

   With this framework in mind, myself and other colleagues on the team together with the three
  Inquiry Counsel read through as many statements as we could by way of a 'sifting’ exercise to
  produce core evidence in each of the areas we were interested in. TOose T o a c S y ~ v e
  ewdence were selected by leading and Junior Counsel and the Treasury Solicitor Team .S d e
  the arrangements for them to attend. In addition to this scheme for preparing evidence we
 f      ?,      Siy ° 3Ware 0f the Pollce 0fficers who were in charge of various parts of the
 football ground. We were therefore able to identify at an early stage which of those we wished
 to call evidence and I think it likely that we would have asked the solicitors for the Yorkshire
 Police to supply us with statements from those individuals and they were then called by the
 Inquiry and questioned on the basis of those statements. There was something of a similar
 process with regard to evidence for Sheffield Wednesday FC and others in that we again
 identified who should give evidence and asked for those parties to supply us with statements.

 There were a group of people who were not represented in any way eg those who lived in
 proximity to Hillsborough and after advertising for any witnesses of this sort who might have
 evidence the Treasuiy Solicitor Team followed these leads up and where appropriate took
 statements from the individuals.                                                  opnare took

Finally, because the HOLMES statements continued to anive throughout the Inquiry there was
aperiod of one or two weeks between the las. evidence and thefinal s u b m K w h^T he
Treasury Solicitor Team continued to read statements and some additonal ones were selected
and formally put before the Inquiry as evidence although without the individual appearing.

Roger Houldsworth

IliA ext? mel)! d“      ow, With a few notable exceptions, to recall who did give evidence let
alone why an individual did not do so. I do not recall Roger Houldsworth at all but that is not
to say that one of my colleagues was not involved in considering his statement I shall make

Finally I will be at Queen Anne's Gate more or less full time for 2 - 3 weeks from 10
November probably with Stephen Wells and if I can assist at all while I am there thenT am
more than happy to do so. Perhaps even seeing the papers that you                   h i ntZ
recollecting matters. From what I can see from the papers retained here there has W n hnth
a sifting and transfer to PRO exercise which has clearly led to some gaps hi the documents that ‘
    I have been able to see.




    Yours sincerely

                                                               Date:        S'     November 1997




I have been appointed by the Home Secretary to conduct a scrutiny of possible fresh evidence
relating to the Hillsborough Football Stadium disaster. I understand that you represented
many of the families of those who died in the disaster, on behalf of the Hillsborough Steering
Committee, at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry and at the Inquests. I am writing to ask for your
assistance.

2.       It might be helpful if I explain that the objective of my scrutiny is to establish whether
there is any significant new evidence about the disaster which was not previously available to
Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, to the Inquests, or to the prosecuting or police disciplinary authorities.
If there is significant evidence, it will be my aim to see if it would have affected the outcome
of any of the proceedings. I hope to report my findings to the Home Secretary by the end of
the year. I attach my terms of reference.


Video evidence

3.     The information which I have is that two videotape recordings from the police monitors
were exhibited to the Taylor Inquiry, with the West Midlands police references TB1 and TB2
(Documents 109 & 110). The Taylor Inquiry also had as an exhibit a schedule of their
contents. TB1 ran from 11.59 to 15.04 and TB2 from 11.59 to 15.34.

4.     My understanding is that all the exhibits which had been prepared for the Taylor Inquiry
were made available to the legal representatives at the Inquests. The material required for each
day was placed in a side room at the hearings. The rest of it was kept at the local police station,
where any legal representative who required access could have it

5.      Much o f this Taylor material was not used at the Inquests, including the two videotapes
TB1 and TB2. The Inquest jury saw (inquest reference C278) a ‘compilation’ which the West
Midlands police had put together for the Taylor Inquiry from footage made available by the
police, the media, and Sheffield Wednesday. The ‘compilation’ included little of TB1 or TB2
as there was much more striking video coverage of events from the other sources. None of the
footage from TB2 after 15.04 was shown on it.

6.      I should be grateful if you would confirm that this accords with your recollection of
the position. Did you view videotapes TB1 and TB2 at the time of Lord Taylor’s Inquiry or
the Inquests?

7.    Videotape TB2 contained shots taken by camera 5 (the one mounted on the
scoreboard, near the police control box) between 14.18 and 14.23. This showed spectators in
pen 2 of the Leppings Lane terrace, possibly following some misbehaviour. The camera
zooms and pans. The shots show very little of the adjacent pen 3, where most of the deaths
occurred.

8.    TB2 also contained shots from camera 5 of the Leppings Lane pens from 15.02
showing spectators climbing over the fence from pens 3 and 4, with scenes on the pitch
adjacent to the fence. Most of this sequence is in time-lapse and parts of it are distorted to
some degree by whitening and ‘flaring’. The Coroner showed this to his jury on 15 March
1991, after they had asked whether there was any video evidence of the terraces.

9.     The impression I have is that the police officers who were in the control box on the
day had an excellent view of the Leppings Lane terrace through the windows of their box and
they were looking through these rather than at their monitor screens. Was it ever your
understanding that these officers were saying that they could not see that pens 3 and 4 on the
Leppings Lane terrace were overcrowded because camera 5 was not working to its full
potential (as evidenced perhaps by the whitening and flaring on the tape)?


The aftermath

10.    D uring my scrutiny it has been submitted to me that the jury at the Inquest were
unaw are that not all those who died did so before 3.15, and that not everybody who was crushed
and lost consciousness died.

11.    It appears to me that this must have been apparent to them from the following matters, if
none other:

        a       on 19 November 1990 (p.16), in the course of his ruling on the 3.15 cut off
                 point, the Coroner said:

                 11 that does not mean to say that some o f them did not infact respire fo r a matter
                 o f time or even have a heartbeat [after 3.15], but the damage was done

        b       it was clear from the mini-inquests on Lee Nicol and Adam Spearitt that they
                 were alive when they reached hospital and died a considerable time later. In the
                •case of Philip Hammond, the summary at the mini-inquest states that he died in
                  hospital, although Dr Slater doubted this;

        c       in the course of Mr King’s submissions on day 1 of the main Inquest on the 3.15
                 cut-off he referred to two cases where recovery had taken place, notwithstanding



 G: | HILLSBOR | MAIN\FRASER. 1 4 3
                 crushing and unconsciousness - a case referred to by Dr Glyn Philips (p8), and
                 a case referred to in the statement of Mr Saxton, a St John’s Ambulanceman
                 (who did not give oral evidence - p9);

         d       a number of witnesses at the Taylor Inquiry gave evidence of losing
                 consciousness, passing out, being resuscitated etc. These included Bradley
                 Hennessey, Golding, and Clarke;

         e      similar evidence was given by witnesses at the Inquest, for example by Garrett,
                 Crawford, Langley, (Eddie) Spearitt and Ball; and

         f      Mr Wardrope gave evidence at the mini-inquests that of the 87 patients admitted
                to hospital 17 were taken to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit; and that there were
                in addition 4 patients who were dead on arrival and 13 patients in all who died
                It would seem apparent that 8 of those taken to the intensive care unit must
                have survived.

 12.     I would be grateful for your comments on these points and particularly on whether you
 as solicitor for the families were fully aware that not all those who died did so before 3.15 p.m.
 and that not all those who were crushed and lost consciousness died.


 Erivilege

13.     I have asked that the families waive privilege and they have done so. In fact I do not
anticipate that the information I seek is privileged and I certainly do not want to know of any
advice you may have given your clients.

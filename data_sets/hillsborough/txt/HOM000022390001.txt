HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY
Lord Justice Taylor has been looking at a programme of visits to
various football grounds in the UK and abroad. He has decided
that a transatlantic trip will be unnecessary but would
nevertheless like to know what sort of sports entertainment (and
other attractions) at big stadia are provided in the US and
Canada. Do you have any information readily to hand?

Lord Justice Taylor is beginning to consider the extent to which
he should examine the structure of the administration of
football. Has there been any survey of football by management
consultants or the like in the recent past? Again, any
information would be helpful.
Similarly, he is wondering whether any information is to hand
about the organisation and funding of football in other European
countries - principally Holland, France and Italy, which he hopes
to visit, but also others (West Germany and Spain). What he is
after is the way in which big professional football is organised,
the extent of Government involvement, where football in these
countries finds its money from, how the transfer fee market
works, the extent of commercial sponsorship and whether any money
is specifically allocated to safety. I realise these are big
questions and you may want to talk about them or put me on to
other sources - but we have to start from somewhere!

A copy of this letter goes to Peter Palmer.

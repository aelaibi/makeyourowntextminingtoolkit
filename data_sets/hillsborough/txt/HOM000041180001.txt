sergeant was 2422 Lawson. The centre pens were closed prior to the kick off as both were full”.
(p. 107)

The following observations have been DELETED in full:-

“OBSERVATIONS

1. Why were we so adamant at 9.45 am (0945) that the kick off would not be delayed ?

2. Why at 2 pm (1400) with 12,000 people in the ground did someone not realise that it is nigh on
impossible to get 42.00 more in in one hour and start to make contingency plans ?

3. Why were the sliding doors at the back of the tunnel not closed at 2.45 (1445) when those
sections of the ground were full as at the Manchester United match this season ?
4. Why were no serials apparently filling the comer sections as we had done at the Leeds/Coventry
game two years ago ?

5. Why was the kick off not delayed ?” (P. 107)

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith referred only to the deletion of paragraph 3 above (p.320). He failed,
therefore, to comment upon P.C.Brookes’ assertion that at 2.50 it appeared to him that the centre
pens were Iqq full. ( Word “too” deleted in amended report) He also fails to refer to P.C.Brookes
experience at the 1987 semi-final when the pens were filled sequentially and the centre pens were
closed prior to the kick off as both were full.

P.C.Brookes notes o f 16* April 1998 (Pp 108-113) were not referred to in his amended report but
they add nothing of substance to his statement.

           Briefing by Chief Supt. Duckenfield.

           Briefing was             initially the same as previous semi-finals but one

           difference was that Chief Supt. Duckenfield stressed that there was

           no provision for the kick off to be delayed,                         he seemed adamant about

           this.

Man from the stand grabs me and says he can see his son in the melee,

I take him onto the              pitch and we find him and return him to the side

of the pitch.              I try to get dazed and winded fans to sit at the side

of the pitch but few respond.

A press      cameraman grabs me and shows me a man laid face down in the

turf,    I ask him what           hurts and he said his back so I took his pulse -

 trong - and tried to get him to move                  his toes.    He smelt of

alcohol.          I asked how much he had drunk and he said two or three

pints.      Some fans brought a board but as the man had hurt his back I

didn't want him moved.               Soon an ambulance man (a Liverpool         fan not on

duty)    checked the man and said We could move him,                 some fans were

there    instantly with another board.                We   carried the man at a run to

the bottom corner of the pitch.                 We put him down and looked to our

left where a man on a board looked dead.                     We left the other man and

PC Hanson         (2348)    gave mouth to mouth as         I pushed his chest and tried

Off duty Medico Legal.



I have worked the last two semi-finals but on different serials.               I

work every Wednesday match on the same serial as for the semi-final.

For the Coventry v. Leeds match I worked on the Leppings Lane

terracing,   that day we worked the south section and formed a cordon

which moved gradually south as the se ct i o r T f i 11ed up to ensure there

were no vacant sections.      Serial Sergeant was 2422 Lawson.      The

 centre   pens were   closed prior to the kick off as both were full.



OBSERVATIONS
             Why were we so adamant at 9.45am    (0945) that the kick off

would not be delayed?

 2   .       Why at 2pm (1400) with 12,000    people   in the ground did

 someone: not realise that    it is nigh on impossible to get 42,000 more

 in in one-' hour and. start to make   contingency plans?

 3>          why were the sliding doors at the back of the tunnel not

 closed at 2.45   (1445) when those sections of the ground were full as

 at the Manchester United match this season?

 as we had done at the Leeds/Coventry game two years ago?

Attached is a photocopy of notes I made on Aprl              16th (160489) when I

got up**- I' have not       read them since.



CONCLUSION

Hi llsborough will       never be   ’safe*   until   the River Don is concreted

over, Penistone Road diverted and Vere Road demolished.                Wednesday

and United should be forced to play at the Don Valley Stadium.




NOTES MADE ON 16 APRIL 1989 (160489)

I was on serial      1, 1 out of 60 odd,       so many more than for normal

matches.     One   is our    regular serial, a duty consisting of patrolling

the perimeter track around the pitch, a duty that is obviously well

known to us.       The   pre match briefing was at 10am (1000),        five full

hours before the match,         it was slightly longer than normal and

covered the usual        routine    procedures for ground evacuation etc.          I

listened carefully but knew most of what was said from experience.

In hindsight one comment made at the briefing sticks out like a

beacon,    I remember     it now as if had been said in capital         letters,

"There    is no provision at this stage for the kick-off to be delayed"

Why not?

The briefing over we sat and chattered in the spring sunshine as we

ate our sandwiches,         the weather was glorious,      the pitch like a

billiard table,      the mood almost a festival,         I remembered last y e a r ’s

match,    same teams,     same stadium,      great atmosphere and here we were

preparing for a repeat.            We had been told that the gates would open j

to allow the spectators         in at 12 noon but at about a quarter to the

first few supporters drifted into the empty terracing so we took up

our positions.
                                                                                    PAGE/^
                                                                                    RS13

I had put my stool,      on which we sit during the game,           so as not to

obstruct the spectators'       view,   in its usual      spot, this was in front

of entrance C to the North stand, about 25 yards from the Leppings

Lane end of the ground facing the main stand.

An elderly couple       immediately occupied the two seats behind me and I

jokingly implored them not to invade the pitch at any time.                   The«.

stand filled but only slowly, as did the Leppings Lane end of the

ground.    At 2pm   (1400)   I went to the      p l a y e r s ’ tunnel, where the

Sergeant and Inspector who are in charge of our serial stand,                   to get

meal    tickets for myself and my colleague,          PC Hanson, whilst      I was

here    I overheard someone from the club say that there were only

12,000 spectators       in the ground.     That meant 42,000 to get in in

little over an hour, as we went to try and get a meal                 I said this to

Kevin    (PC Hanson).

The canteen was     shut and at five      past two      I returned to my position.

I had a personal     radio with me with which I could listen to match

control,    there were    reports of people drinking outside many local

public houses and some        calls from landlords for assistance.             Pub

names    like the Royal,     the Horse    and Jockey,    the Gate   and others

spring to mind,     I could imagine       the   scene, last year     I had seen

Nottingham Forest supporters drink the Owl               pub at Neepsend dry in

about an hour and urged them to leave            in time to see the game.

At two twenty the canteen re-opened and I went for dinner,                  as it was

nearing kick off Kevin and I went one at a time so as not to leave

the serial    short of men.      The ground was filling but not fast

enough.     I ate   chicken and chips with apple          pie, a good meal     for a

mobile kitchen but burnt my mouth on hot tea as I rushed to get back

outside,    I ended up throwing it away.           I went back to my position by

going through the stand and not           around the track,     I   realise now that

beneath the stand was too quiet           for twenty to three,       but at the time




                               (f a j )
                                                                                                 PAGERS
                                                                                                 R213

paid no real thought to it.             Once back in position the ground seemed

considerably fuller than before,                         there was          no terracing to be seen      01


the Spion Kop but still        the concrete steps on the wings of the

Leppings Lane terracing were exposed.                               The     centre sections were full

as they always are,      the wing sections                         probably give the worst view a1

Hillsborough and on entering the ground at that' end the tunnel                                   to thi

centre sections      is a natural entrance as                          it affords a narrow view of

the pitch over the heads of those standing                                  in it and so attracts

spectators.

I remember the Mounted Sergeant,                         Soresby I think,          being asked for

more horses at Leppings Lane and he sent two, there were obviously

lots of people still       outside,          the West stand seats were nearly full

but still the concrete terrace steps                               in the    corner were visible and

the kick off was       less than ten minutes away.                             I know what Liverpool

fans are like,       I ’ve seen them at Wembley without tickets trying to

pull    each other    in over walls and fences and throwing ticket stubs

outside to fans without any means of entry.

Several youths with scouse accents were shouting at me about not

having the Kop where there            is more space,                      I was asking them to sit

down when the Liverpool team ran out onto the pitch, there was an

almighty roar and I turned to f*c'e the                              pitch.     I could see that the

centre of the Leppings Lane/terraced was swaying like a wave.                                     I
  |:                         HimIII   ir - n - - - ^ —    —   ■—                        •
heard the radio again,        I/think it was a number                           like 1963 asking for

the kick-off to be d e layed as there was a problem o u t s i d e ^ i ^ ^ t o o

many supporters       crushing against the gates,                            he asked twice   if not

three times.     Then just as a second roar from the far end of the

ground greeted the Notts. Forest team the                                 reply from match control

was    ’One of the teams    is on the                    pitch,      tp<s match will not be delayed
The referee tossed up and the game g<rx going,                                 I d o n ’t remember one

kick,    I never got near my stool.                           As'"the game started I heard someon
                                                                                            R213

say the s i t u a t ion ou t s ^ ^ t h e       a round w as s e r i o u s <^»dT'X ha t there was <

likelihood of serious              injuries,        could t h ^ a t e s     be opened,   space was

still evident at the edge of the terTace.                           Then the gate to my stand

must have been opened because boys, youths,                          men started to appear

from beneath the stand with tickets,                          jumping onto the track and

asking where the seats were,                   I tried to get them back into the stand

and off the track,             other supporters           shouted about their view being

obstructed and repeated claims to the Spion J*op.                             The people were noi

coming onto the track              in numbers.

Then    I heard someone on the radio say "All officers West stand prepa

for a rush, we are going to have to open the gates".

A short while         later there was a tremendous                   roar from my side of the

ground.      I looked round and s«w a tidal wave sweep towards the front

of the Leppings Lane terrace, apparently Peter Beardsley had just hi'

t   h   e    H    T   o    ?   e   r   r   "    e    w    ^    n   •t see   it.

I was using my stool as a step to get fans back into the stand when
/
heard the game            close to me, two          players had tackled and I looked awa;

from the crowd to see the ball spin to the Leppings Lane end for a

corner.      For the first time            I saw that there were fans spilling onto

the pitch, Policemen and fans were stood on the fence trying to pull

people over.          Fans behind me screamed and howled at me as if I was

the cause,        I saw a policeman go up to the                    referee and the players

leaving the pitch,             I gave up trying to get people into the stand.                      A

middl-e aged man came down and said he could see his son as the crowd

on the      pitch from the Leppings Lane end swelled,                         I took him onto th

pitch to help him find him,                I remember him tearing the crutch in his

trousers on the advertising hoardings                          (what a blessing they proved t

be) as he jumped over.                 We got his son back to the stand and sat dow

By now there were more Policemen,                        who had been called from the gym b;

the goal         pulling and lifting but outnumbered by fans trying to help.
                                                                           R213

I was asking people to go and sit at the edge of the pitch if they

w e r e n ’t badly hurt so we could see who was,   but they were shocked,

dazed,   only a few responded.     The crowd behind the goal was so thick

I couldn't help,     I saw a press photographer with a man on the edge o

the six yards box,     I knelt down and felt his pulse,     it was strong

but he complained he could not move his feet,        he was gripping the

turf with his fists     like if he let go he would fall off.       He smelt o

drink but told me he'd only had two or three pints.

Four Liverpool fans     came next to me with a blue advertising board to

use as a makeshift stretcher but declined,         he was breathing well and

I didn't want to move his back.       Then a red shirted man with a red

scarf    came up, he said he was am ambulanceman,      he checked his back

and the man screamed but the amb ulanceman said we could move him.

This time a red and white advert was the stretcher, Kevin had joined

me now and with the fans we carried the man on the board to the

bottom corner,      the first ambulance was   pulling onto the pitch.        It

was   like a clearing station     so we   put the board down.

Alongside was a man laid on       his back,   his face waxen,   his left    eye

swollen out of the socket,       we left our man with the fans and knelt

over him,    he had no pulse.     Kevin started to give him     the kiss    of

life,    I knew he was dead,    I think Kevin did too, he blew,    I pushed.

Then the man was sick into Kevin's mouth,        as Kevin spat out    I tried

to pull    it out of the man's mouth with my fingers.       We turned him

over and a fireman dropped a handkerchief for us to use.           Then a gir

ran over,    red shirt and scarf and said she was a nurse,        now she

pushed Kevin blew and I tried to get the sick out, his mouth seemed

to bite at my fingers,      the sick kept coming but it was just the nurs

pumping    it up.    It was obvious he was gone,    I told the nurse to go

and try to help someone else-and Kevin pulled the man's jumper over

his head.     At this stage I thought that here was the only dead perso
         an d we had'to- get him: out- of view of the-crowd?, or there would be a                 ’

         riot..     K e v i n W myself a n d three officers picked him up - I pulled hi*

         sweatei?tr.of f his face and told the lads he needed, help quick — I didn

         want then? to- k n o w he was dead - and we ran behind the North stand'.

         I ran-into the gym with the body to get him out of the way,                     I was

         aware of many people as we ran a n d once inside I shouted at the lads

         who had helped to go out and help some more,                   they ran out,   I was

         kneeling over the body facing Kevin barely believing                     I had carried a

         dead football          supporter off a football          pitch - still   I believed he

         was the only one.               Then I looked up,      beyond Kevin, and saw the floor

         was    littered with bodies - some already in rows,                how had I not seen

         these?       I didn't take            in what I saw,   twelve hours later I hadn't lefi

         the gymnasium area and I still                  didn't believe what was in front of
                                                .

         me,    t w e n t y ^ t o u r ,hours   later   I now know it was true. WHY?

 On duty at Bolsover Section Station.

 9-30 (0930)

 Parade at Hillsborough.

 9.45 (09^5)

 Briefing by Chief Supt Duckenfield.

 Briefing was similar, to that given at previous semi-finals.   Chief Supt

 Duckenfield stated that there was no provision for the kick off,, to be

 delayed.

 10.10 ( 1010)

 First Meal.

 11.30 (1130)

 Onto track side, my position was North Stand, 20 yds from the Leppings

 Lane end.

 11.50 (1150)

 First few fans trickle into ground.

 2.00 (1400)

 Second meal.    I went to get meal tickets from PS Chapman at players'

 tunnel and he was in conversation with a Club Official.   I heard that at
2.00 p.m. (1400) there were only 12,000 fans in the ground.   I told this

to one of my colleagues at meal.

2.20 (1420)

Meal taken - canteen shut at 2.00 p.m. (1400)

2.40 (1440)

Resume position.    At this time Kop appeared full, Leppings Lane centre

sections both full and steps still visible in the corner sections, first

few fans climbing up into West Stand but I thought this was to get a

better view.

2.45 (1445)

Radio message    to send two more horses up to Leppings Lane end.       The

crowd was massing outside.

2 . 5 0 (1450)

Many fans climbing into West Stand - hears Supt Marshall on the radio

saying how big the crowd was.   It appeared to me that the centre section

was now full and the steps were still visible in the corner sections.

2.55 (1455)

Liverpool team come onto the pitch, PC Buxton outside at Leppings Lane

end asks for kick off to be pub back, he says "You'll have to put it

back".    As the Notts Forest team take to the pitch I looked at the main

stand clock, it was just gone 2.56 (1456), I thought they were late, the

answer to PC Buxton was "The match will go ahead, one of the teams is

already on the pitch".   Supt Marshall says that a gate must be opened to

prevent fatalities outside the ground.

2.58 (1458)

Fans start coming out of the North Stand onto the track from the first

tunnel waving tickets asking where their seats are.      I put them back
into the stand and tell them to walk beneath and find the appropriate

tunnel.    More   fans come out as game kicks off,   3*00 (1500), fans at

Leppings Lane end start to come over fence behind the goal; Supporters

in North Stand are shouting 'Shitty Ground, Shitty Ground*, etc, as more

pour over the fences.     Control give message re gates going to be opened,

xfermission given to open gates to North Stand.; Then a large roar behind

me (apparently Peter Beardsley had hit the cross bar) still trying to

 get fans into stand.     Impossible now so just trying to get them to sit

 on the track, some are walking around from Leppings Lane end.

 3.05 (1505)

 Play is just behind me and I turn and see ball go for a Notts Forest

 corner.   I then realise that there is a Policeman on the pitch, by now

 fans spilling onto pitch behind the goal.

 3.06 ( 1506)

 Match stops.

 Man from the stand grabs me and says he can see his son in the melee, I

 take him onto the pitch and we find him and return him to the side of

 the pitch.     I try to get dazed and winded fans to sit at the side of the

 pitch but few respond.

 A press    cameraman grabs me and shows me a man laid      face down in the

 turf, I    ask him what hurts and he said his back so Itook his pulse -

 strong - and tried to get him to move his toes.     He smelt of alcohol.     I

 asked how much he had drunk and he said two or three pints.       Some fans

 brought    a board but as the man had hurt his back I       didn't want him

 moved.     Soon an ambulance man (a Liverpool fan not on duty) checked the

 man and said we could move him,       some fans were there instantly with

  another ^t>oard.   We carried the man at a run to the bottom corner of the
1

    \




        pitch.   We put him down and looked to our left where a man on a board

        looked dead.   We left the other man and PC Hanson (2348) gave mouth to

        mouth as I pushed his chest and tried to remove vomit from his mouth as

        he vomitted.   A nurse - Notts Forest fan not on duty - tried but to no

        avail and we carried the body behind the North Stand and into the gym to

        get it out of the public view.        Once inside I saw at least 30 other

        bodies   already   laid   out.   Three Liverpool   fans   and   a tall Special

        Constable carried a body (body no 48) - Gary Collier, 22 years - and put

        it next to me.      I took it off the special and dealt with the sudden

        death.

        Sunday, 5-00 a.m. (0500)

        Off duty Medico Legal.

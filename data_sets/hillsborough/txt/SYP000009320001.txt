                    I am single and         I live at the above address w ith my parents.

                    I am a POL sd             with the S ou th Yorkshire                Police,     s tationed at

                   E c c l e s f i e l d Police Station.         I have      been doing duties as a Special

                    Constable        since May    1988      (000588),

                   At     1630 hrs     on S at ur d ay    15th April       1989    (150489)       I reported for         duty

                    at Harnmerton Rd Police Stat ion,                S h ef fi el d and a l located to do traffic

                    control    at     road junctions        of M id dl ew oo d Rd and Holme L n ,

                    ensuring     that all      eme rg en cy    service       vehicles       got to and from the

                   H i l l s b o r o u g h Football   Stadium.       I was      not      in possession of a Po li ce

                    radio    but there were           other Police Officers               close   by who were       in

                    possession of a radio.                The traffic        using the       road was heavy at           this

                    time,    both going       towards      the ground and making               their way home.           All

                    this    co-insided w ith the           local S h ef fi el d         rush hour    traffic,      w hi ch       is
                                                                                                           P AGE     2
                                                                                                           S 836

           heavy on a Saturday.

          W hi l s t    performing        the traffic     duty    I was sub je ct ed to verbal abuse

          from whom           I believe were Liverpool            fans.

          Some     of the fans a p pr o a c h e d me on foot and started to strike                       up a

           co nv ersation about what               had taken     place earlier at the H i l l s b o r o u g h

           ground.           I noticed at this time that they had alcohol                    on their      breath,

           these mo s tl y were asking              directions as to where          they could find

          missing        friends and        relatives.       At about      1800 hrs    later     that    day    1

           left my traffic          control        post and walked to the H am m er t on Rd P o li ce

          S t a t i o n w h e r e I a ss is t ed    in advising      people   of the     l oc at i on of t h e i r

           friends and          relatives,      and general 1 ly ans we ri ng       their queries.

           1 have       not    done any duty at any f o o t b a l 1 matches and did not att en d

          the    1988 semi        final     Football    match.

           I was       not    involved     in the Policing any of the            incidents       in or around

          the ground other           than the traffic            control.

           I might add that at about                 1730 hrs whilst        on traffic     control       I did

          witness        some of the football           fans     purchasing     cans of alc oh ol ic       drink

           from the Off License              called T hreshers        in M i d dl e wo o d Rd.

           I saw some fans urinating                 in the street        up against    the wall        close to

          the    swimming        baths     in M id dl e wo o d Rd.

                                                                                                          SIGNED

OCCUPATION:     POL PC1715



           At 8.20 am (0820 hrs ) on 15.4.89 (150489) I reported for duty at

           Hackenthorpe Police Station I ascertained then that I was on Serial no

           16 under PS1288 Payne.

           Bus transport to Hillsborough and arrived for briefing in the North

           Stand well before 10.00 am (1000 hrs). During the briefing found we

        were to work turnstiles A - G on Leppings Lane - outside the ground.

           Packed meal was provided and eaten in the stand prior to taking up

           positions at the turnstiles.

           Positions were taken up at the turnstiles in plenty of time for them
  i
        opening at 12 noon (1200 hrs).    One turnstile opened up at about 11.

           50 am (1150 hrs), they were all open by about 12.10 pm (1210 hrs).

           Initially I was paired up with PC3066 Huckstepp at the turnstile

        nearest the barrier, furthest away from the wall.

        Once spectators began to arrive the numbers were low enough to allow

        that EVERYONE was searched before entering the ground.     Other

        officers on the serial made arrests for various offences committed by

        persons attempting to enter the ground.

        The first arrivals at the ground were generally very good humoured,

        soter and caused few problems.    As the numbers arriving at the

        turnstiles began to grow - from about 2 pm (1400 hrs) onwards, the

        searching of spectators became selective - but the atmosphere was

        generally still good.

        At this time, the number of Police Officers on duty had decreased at
BEST                    ANDREW



these turnstiles due to prisoners having been arrested.

At 2.30 pm (1430 hrs) or thereabouts, the numbers at the gates

swelled considerably.    Many of these late arrivals were worse for

drink but may not be classified as drunk.    They were singing and

chanting and began to push from the back, causing congestion between

the barrier and the wall on the approach to the turnstile.

Further problems were caused by numerous supporters working their way

to the turnstiles and finding that they had no ticket at all, or that

they had a ticket for another part of the ground.

Mary Liverpool supporters had bought their tickets from the

Nottingham area where they lived, but they wanted to stand with the

Liverpool supporters, not with the Notts. Forest.

Earlier in the afternoon, the turnstile operators, on the instruction

of the Stewards, had allowed people into the Leppings Lane end of the

grcund, even though their tickets were for the Notts Forest Kop end

of the ground.

When the turnstiles became very busy however, this policy was changed

anc no one was allowed through unless they had the correct tickets.

Consequently, people arrived at the turnstile, weren't allowed

through, but then couldn't get back, they were blocked in.    This

happened at most of the turnstiles and the crowd built up without

being able to get through.

After 2.30 pm (1430 hrs) the push at the turnstiles was so great that

the Police officers on them had to go back through the turnstiles

themselves.    I managed to get through the barrier and stand outside

the crush.    Despite shouting to the crowd to get back and stop

pushing - the rowdy mob at the back kept pushing forward.    It was

apparent at that time that a number of people were in difficulty up

against the barrier where I saw two young boys (separately) who were
 BEST                      ANDREW



 just tall enough to have their wind-pipes pushed up against the top

 rail of the bar.       With the help of their respective parents I managed

 to push seme reran and pull the boys to my side of the barrier.

 By this time there were a large number of youths and men -

considerably worse for drink - many were drunk.        They came down the

outside of the barrier and tried to force themselves in at the

turnstile.        This caused a great deal of trouble - resulting in fights

taking place between fans, and scuffles with Police officers who

were trying to prevent them.

The push on the crowd at the front of the turnstiles was so great

              Th an k you for your letter of 23 D ecem b er 1991. It has taken me some time to
              answ er because our officers have had to ask for information outside our Force
              area.

              It has been suggested to me that the extract of the report to which you referred in
              your earlier letter cam e from correspondence conducted by your solicitor with W est
              Midlands Police and H M Coroner. I have caused the W est Midlands Police papers

  4           to be exam ined but all the information apparently known is that which was
              mentioned in the report and which w as available for consideration by the Inquest.

              I very much regret that this takes matters no further than my previous letter.

              It must be very frustrating, trying to put together details for your own peace of mind,
              but it really seem s now that you are in possession of all the facts which are going
              to em erge. I’m sorry to bring some disappointing news but, at this stage, it seem s
              as if w e ’ve reached as far as w e can go.

          M r and Mrs S Roberts and family




          Thank you for your letter of 22 November. The delay in my answering has been
          caused by my making some enquiries into how you received the excerpt of the
          report which you enclosed. All our best information would suggest that this has not
          come from a South Yorkshire Police source but, if I am wrong in that, I would be
          pleased to hear how you did receive it.

          I scarcely know how to begin writing to you all.

          I am very very sorry that you lost G raham at Hillsborough and wish to goodness
          that there were som e way of turning the clock back.

          Your letter is constructive and looks to the future, which is very welcome, but your
          grief is obvious and, so far as I can, I join you in it.

          As you concede, som e good work was done on the day by many of our officers.
          If I read the extract correctly, PC Best saw that G raham was breathing and turned
          to others more in need of help. That judgement may have proved to have been
          wrong but I can imagine - just - the circumstances under which it was made. In
          your cutting, the 70 year old pensioner had stopped breathing and Constable
          Paul Martin rightly sprang into action.

          On just the limited information I have, the cases seem quite different. But in the
          end, G raham died when he shouldn’t have done; no amount of examination or
          attempt at justification will change that.

          If I can find out any more detail, I will write to you. For the meanwhile, I really am
          sorry for what has happened.

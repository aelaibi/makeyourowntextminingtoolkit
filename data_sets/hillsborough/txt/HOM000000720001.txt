outside        the    gate,      possibly           the worst        I had ever seen at             any football

match. It s ee m e d unusual                 that     there was        no    police      checking as to who                  hat.

p re vious        year at the same match.                     Although heavily              congested there was

no disorder.              There wer e            no stewa rd s       visible      at this      point and no

signs       visi bl e     directing          people       to ground entrances.

We q u e u e d to get           to the       turnstiles           and the       only    police    officers          I saw

at     this    stage we re two m o u n t e d              police     officers          near to the turnst iles

wh o     could do nothing              to    control       the     congestion.

Whi ls t      in the queue          I could see            numerous         people      climbing     over the top

of the        turnstiles,         but       I think       they had tickets              and had     climbed up to

avoid       the    crowd       crush    below.

about       25 m i n u t e s    to get       f rom the       gate     into the g ro u n d via the

st up id               that          there were                  no gates                 that          could be op en ed                      to     allow access

between                 the           pens.               There       had          been no              loud speaker                    a nn o u n c e m e n t s made,

I l ooked                    t h r o u g h the              fencing                into       pen three                   and     it was            still          packed

with            p eople *                      There were             a lot of                people              lying m o t i o n l e s s                on the

I cannot                     d e sc r i b e           them,        but         I think              they were all                       men w e a ri ng                things

the foot                     of the              fence       in pen three,                          at      the          point         I had        climbed over,

was       dead*

He had                 close             c ropped blond                       hair,        of m e d i u m                build and height                         and was

wearing                 blue jeans,                       white         trainers                an d a beige                     t-shirt-               He was

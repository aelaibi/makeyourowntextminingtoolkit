Merseyside WILL SAY



I am |            ^ears     of    age,    my     date    of birth          is    the

went        to      Hillsborough          with     my        two     uncles,                   and

                           is      and                  is            We went by car



We        left home       at about        10.00        a.m.    and    arrived      at    the    pub near

    the ground at about 12.00 p.m.                       I had a glass of coke.                  We left

    the pub at about 2.25 p.m.



We made our               way    into    the ground and              it was by     this time about

    2.25    p.tp.        The     crush     to    get     into       the ground     was    worse        than

    normal      and     although        there were           only    about      2/3,000       people,    it

    was 'a confined area.                 The queue.was              right out of        the gates       to

    the ground leading into the turnstiles so I knew that I wasn't

    going       to get     in there.            I walked           into   the concertina gate             to

    see if the crush would subside and I saw a high ranking police

    officer tap on the window of the gate to a steward on the other

    side,       telling     him    to    open     it.         He    opened      the concertina gate

    and     I    went     through        with    about        4/500       other    people.           Nobody

    checked       my     ticket.         At     this    stage,       it      was   approximately 2.45

    p.m.        Once     through        the gate        there was a choice of going                     down

    three tunnels, I went down the centre tunnel as did the bulk of

    people.         The    people       were     backed        up off      the terraces         into     the

    tunnel and I wove my way through them into the ground and stood

    with my back           to the wall.            They were calling the names                       of the
 ayers      out when suddenly there was a surge of people and I got.

icked up off ray feet and carried                       from where I was standing at

the back right down                to the bar which was                behind    the    perimeter

fence.           I    was    crushed        on ray left      side,       ray right          side    was

protected        because        there     was       somebody       slumped       over       the    bar.

Somebody was           stuck under          the bar        being       pushed up      into     it and

there      was       somebody      behind      me    who    was        either   unconscious          or

dead,    Icouldn't breath.              There        was somebody else who               was being

crushed          back      onto    the bar and he          was    turning-blue.             I pulled

him   up    and       ray cousin's        boyfriend         was    leaning      over     the       fence

pulling people              out, he     tried       to pull hi m out but he c o u l d n ’t,

he was      still getting crushed.                   I pulled somebody else out from

under the bar and propped him up against my arm.                                      My feet were

still      about       two    foot    off    the     ground,       having       not    touched       the

ground again           since the surge of people coming through the gate

had     forced       me    to the front.             There were people underneath me

pulling ray feet and biting at me to pull themselves up.



 After     I had       initially        gone    through          the    gate,    I    saw    it    being

 closed,     but      it must have been opened again to let the surge of

 people through.



 Before I got             thrown forwards,           I was being pushed against a man

 who was         screaming at me            to get off because his                   collarbone was

 being      crushed.          He   then     turned      round      and butted me            to get me

 out of the way and ray cheek bone has been bruised.
.ifter the   fence was ripped down         I got dragged          through.   I sat

on   the ground and      someone   came   to me and gave          me   some water.

Since the    event,    I was off school        for three days with bruising

to   the muscles   down my      left   side.     I also had       diarrhea and' I

have been having nightmares.           I start my O-levels next week and

I have been unable to concentrate properly on my revision.



I have   been   treated    by my   doctor,      who   is   Dr I          |locum   at

________________      Huyton.   The bruising has not been              treated but

I have had anti biotics and dioralite.

              My full name         is STEVEN ANDREW SHEARWOOD,                      I am a Police Constable with

              eight years service and I am based at Hackenthorpe Police Station,

              Occupation        Lane.    Hackenthorpe.            I am currently engaged as community

              constable        for the H a c k e n t h o r p e area of my sub division.                       My collar

              number    is 1 6 1 8 .
              On Saturday 15 April              1989 I commenced duty at Hackenthorpe police

              Station at 8.30am for duties                   in connection with the F.A.Cup Semi

              Final between Liverpool Football club and Nottingham Forest to be

              held at Hillsborough Football Stadium, with other officers I was

               transported to the football ground from my home station and attended

               a briefing in the North stand where at 10.00am we were spoken to by

               Chief    superintendent            Duckenfield who was                 inoverall command              of the.

               At 11 15am we took up duties in                          the West Stand, which               at t h i ? ,

had no supporters     inside.     At 11.50am in company with Police

Cons'a&ie     .1170 fc'airclough I was directed by PS Burman to supervise

the   south   entrance gates to the upper      level of the West Stand.         Our

aim was to supervise     entry by supporters and where necessary prevent

entry by unauthorised persons.          This entrance consists of two swing

metal gates which     lead directly into an enclosed stairwell which                'v:

affords access     into the upper seated level of the stand.          Seven

stewards employed by the club were also on duty at this entrance.

We were instructed by Inspector White to remain in the enclosed par||

of the stairs on the middle         level and stop fans from runnning up and

down the stairs,     hence keeping them clear and free for access.              This

part of the ground is familiar          to myself asmy normal duties on         a

Saturday match are usually          employed in this part of the ground.

For a long period of time very few fans entered this particular gate

and we chatted with the stewards.           However fans did begin to arrive

and people of varying ages entered the upper             level.      tl.U t oint*V

 police with many families entering the upper stand of our section.                    -

 The fans were well behaved         and did not appear   in drink.

 There was one attempt by a fan to enter the             seated area without a         .

 ticket but he was spotted by the steward and ejected by PC Faircloug

 and myself.
 At approximately 2.30pm as the fans entered in a steady stream we                     j
 were beckoned by the stewards to the base of the stairs who pointed^

 to the turnstiles off Leppings Lane.           We.sa w a number-of young ,f:^na£

The    inside of      Che ground at the rear of m e       west stanu wa^ now

heavily congested with fans making their way onto                the terraces.

At    1440 my attention was drawn to a group of approximately six men

who were stood urinating against the outside walls of the toilets at

the rear of the West Stand.              Both PC Fairclough and myself approached

the group.          Several    on seeing us discontinued but one remained stood

near to the wall urinating.              Both PC Fairclough and myself took hold



                 nd he was taken to the police detention area.           Because he

began to struggle he was placed in an arm lock by myself which caused

some other fans to use and direct foul               language towards PC Fairclou^h

and m y s e l f .
At the police room the circumstances were outlined to the custody

sergeant and it was decided to ej e c t )                   [from the ground.

Details were obtained and PC Fairclough and myself ejected him from

 the ground.
 In company with PC Fairclough I then began to return to the Vest

 Stand and our positions.

 As we walked near            to the turnstiles off Leppings Lane approximately

 ten minutes        later     (1450hours)    there was a noticeable difference in

 the atmosphere,         the area inside the ground was congested and we saw

 approximately thirty men standing alongside the walls urinating

 against them.          Because it was impracticable for the two of us to               .V

 arrest everybody we split up and approached all those urinating and^.

 threatened them with eviction from the.ground if they did not s tp p^ f

 Most did stop but it was blatantly obvioua that most yeire-ln

 As we passed the turnstiles we were approached by fans wh o were^

 demanding that something be done about the crowd directly;

     they had just pushed their way through and into the ^grpund..^;

     returned to the bottom of         the   steps leading into the 'upper-level,

the West stand.      it was o d v i o u s   on our return that the stewards were

struggling because ot tne sneer numbers ot fans to monitor                            the people

entering the stand and rather           than argue with some over               the validity

ot their tickets     they allowed them to enter the stand.                      Some fans

were obviously drunk and arguments             took place between fans,               stewards

and ourselves.      Some shoved straight past the stewards and because of

the congestion it was       impossible to physically stop them from

climbing the stairs.
One of the metal     swing gates had been closed and the stewards stood

on the inside of it allowing fans through the right hand one which

was open.   PC Fairclough and myelt            tried to install some sort of

order and insisted on checking tickets.                   Those with other standing

tickets were directed to the standing area.

Whilst at this entrance I noticed the opening of a set of double

sliding doors from Leppings Lane.              The gates were opened for access

by fans and 1 saw a mounted officer giving instructions to the

 crowd.   Moments    later a number of fans surged towards our entrance

 and both PC Fairclough and myself were pinned against the metal gates

 and it became    impossible to restrict access to the upper level.

 As we tried to restore normality to the entrance a middle aged man

 approached us shouting words to the effect "There are people dying ir

 that stand, being crushed what are you going to do about                         it .

 At this point      both PC Fairclough and           myself were still pinned against

 the gates and      were unable to move.         I indicated a group             of

 approximately eight officers and a             s u p e r v i s o r y   officer who were stoOc

 in a group near the turnstiles and asked that he go and explain t o j

  them as they were In a better position                t o   help.       However he continue,

  to shout at me "One six one eight I want you to do something now

  Again I asked him to seek help from              the other officers and he left.'.

  Several minutes     later the number of          fans depleted near to our
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     U52

e n trance and PC Fairclough and myself were able                to move therefore I

approached    the man again and asked wnat            the specific      problem was.        H

complained of people pushing and shoving and I said I would help to

which he apologised for shouting at the two of us.                     However on

looking down the tunnel at the rear of the West Stand I saw some fan

milling about but did not see any injured or indeed anyone who looke

as though they required assistance.         I began to walk further into th

tunnel and was requested to return by PC Fairclough who was

attempting to radio through to control               to advise them of the                  -K

complaint.     At    this point a number of serials began running through

the ground and towards the pitch area near to the police control.                        ;

1 had heard nothing on my personal       radio and assumed fans were

fighting.     Both PC Fairclough and myself remained near the tunnel an

were then approachd by a teenage fan who complained of chest pains.

We took this fan to the first aid point near the gymnasium,                     left him

and then returned to the rear of the West Stand.                      On our return the

whole area behind the stand was littered with casualties lying on th

floor surrounded by other people and police officers.

It was obvious       that some were dead lying on the floor and many were

 injured and vomiting.       PC Fairclough and myself split up and I went

 to the assistance of the injured as did PC Fairclough.                      Many were

 placed in the recovery position and advice given to onlookers on wha

 to do.     Some supporters were helpful,      others were obviously angry

 with the police directing obscene comments towards other officers an

 myself and spitting on our uniforms.           I saw groups of officers               7.^

 carrying and running out of the tunnel with unconscious people. -,£||

 other officers most of the injured were taken out of the::ground)^h|^

 into an alleyway at the rear of the football ground,                            ’

 Outide the ground inspector Sykes and his men were carrying -the

        a 1 1 e n a e a to tfi6S6 people rendeiirig first aid.

        On arrival   of the Fire Service,       they instructed   that the aiieyway at

        the rear ot the ground should be cleared and a one way system be

        o p era te d- for emergency vehicles.

        Both PC Fairclough and myself with other officers attempted to clear

        this area of people and vehicles.

        A doctor appeared on the scene and asked me where the first aid poiivt

        was.    I told him that as far as I was aware it was next to the

        gymnasium.    He then walked up and down the injured categorising them

         into priority for the ambulacnes.

        Once most of the casualties were cleared both PC Fairclough and

        myself closed the double sliding gates to hide the sight of the dead

         on the floor outside the ground.        As first aiders and medical    teams

         arrived we directed them to the gymnasium area.

         we left Hillsborough and returned to Hackenthorpe Police Station,

         going off duty at 7.15pm.

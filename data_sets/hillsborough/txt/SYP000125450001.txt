 FOUR MONTHS




 WERE YOU AT THE PREMISES FOR LAST YEARS SEMI FINAL?

 NO


G4

 WERE YOU AT PREMISES ON THE DAY OF THIS YEARS LIVERPOOL/NOTTS FOREST MATCH?

 YES


Q5

 WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT MADE THIS MATCH DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN THE PAST?

 THERE WAS A LARGER CROWD THAN FOR OTHER MATCHES BUT THIS WAS WHAT WE EXPECTED


Q6

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY INCIDENTS OF DRUNKENESS OR DISORDERLY BEHAVIOUR OF ANY

 OF THE FANS?

 I SAW A NUMBER OF FANS WITH CANS OF BEER AS EARLY AS 0800 WHO CAME INTO

 THE SHOP BUT NO DRUNKENESS OR DISORDERLY BEHAVIOUR BUT THIS VIEW FROM THE

 SHOP IS LIMITED BY POSTERS & METAL GRIDS


Q7

 WAS ANY DAMAGE CAUSED TO YOUR PREMISES BY FANS?

 NO

Q9

 NO


GIO

 Ej^YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS CONCERNING THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE ARRANGEMENTS

 FOR THE MATCH/OR INDIVDUAL POLICE OFFICERS ON DUTY?

 AS FAR AS I COULD SEE THE POLICE WERE DOING EVERYTHING THEY COULD CONSIDERING

THE SIZE OF THE CROWD- THERE WAS A STEADY FLOW OF PEOPLE IN & OUT OF THE SHOP

 UP UNTIL ABOUT 1515 HRS WHEN THERE WAS A MASS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE WHO WERE

PUSHED CLOSELY TOGETHER

 ABOUT 12 PUSHED INTO THE SHOP & TO AVOID ANY MORE COMING IN MY MOTHER LOCKED

 THE DOOR THE CROWD CLEARED IN A MATTER OF MINUTES & WE RE OPENED


G11

 ^ T H E R E ANY OTHER MEMBER OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD ABLE TO PROVIDE RELEVANT

 INFORMATION?

 NO


Q12

 ANY OTHER INFORMATION YOU WOULD LIKE BROUGHT TO THE NOTICE OF THE INDEPENDANT

 JUDICIAL ENQUIRY?

 I    FEEL THE INCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY A LARGE AMOUNT OF FANS ARRIVING AT THE

 GROUND TOO CLOSE TO THE KICK OFF TIME CAUSING A CRUSH OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES

 IF THEY HAD ARRIVED EARLIER THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY PUSHING TO GET

 INTO THE GROUND

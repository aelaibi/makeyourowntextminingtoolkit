                 I am Michael Buxton, a Police-Constable of 25 years service and I am

                                                                          In the cours

                 drive the Divisional Land Rover each working day.                     The Land Rover is

                 fitted with a multi             channel    radio and a public address system.

                 On Saturday,             15 April   1989 (150489)    I was on duty in connection with

                 the FA Cup Semi Final               between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at

                 Hillsborough.             My djities were as driver with the Land Rover and
                                      p

                     reas.

                     etween 2^30 pm <1430) >rfnd 3 pm (1500)           I received a radio m e ss a g e from

                 ground control            tch-fake the l^ru^^o^Vier to Leppings Lane to assist with

                 c              I              informed Mr. Chapman of this and drove to Leppings

                 Lane .

                 When       I arrived at Lep'pings Lane turnstiles            I was amazed at what      I

                Af o u n d .    F rom the JKurnstiles to beyond the t raf f i c 1 ights       in Le ppi ngs

                 Lane there was d mass of supporters.                   They were simply pouring down

                 Leppings Lane towards the g^cmnd.                   At the turnstiles there seemed to

                 be making          little    if any progress through the turnstiles.          The

                 pressure at the front of the queue was tremendous and I became very
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                R 4 09

very concerned.    I appealed to t h ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ d ^ o ^ ^ a s e   the

                              ■ ^I^><fid the supporters that people at the

front were being crushed and that these were women and children,

their own people that they were crushing.              It made no difference.            I

repeated my messages    several    times to no effect.

I then called match    control on my personal radio andx§*ked .for the

kick off to be delayed i n^jrdej'^a^jD^ff^^

the crushing but I was     informed it was too late.
                            mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmrn.
I then became worried and I realised people were going to get harmed

and injured if something was not done.             So I called the Mounted

Inspector on the PA but he could not hear me because of the noise

from the crowd but after a minute or two I managed to attract his

attention and I gesticulated to him to form the Mounted Police

Officers   into a line across     the area parallel with the turnstiles and

this he managed to do - however this had little effect,                  the crowd was

hardly affected with some simply going under the horses''bellies.

The attitude of the supporters struck me as different because whilst

there were several adults with youngsters not taking any part in the

matter but standing    to one side of the main stream of supporters

pouring down Leppings Lane the bulk of supporters appeared to be

gripped by an urgency to get        into the ground and get in now and if

someone was Irurt* so what,      it seemed as though something more

important than a football match was taking place behind the

turnstiles.   They appea re d fanatical        to gain entrance.

It was obvious that the greater         part had, as so often is the case,

been drinking and had left it too          late and on arrival         seeing the

large crowd still waiting to get in the ground had realised they

would miss part of the game, although I didn't think so at the time                          I
                                        -
now think the fans were storming the turnstiles.

Just when my concern was at its peak,           just as     I was at my wits end
                                                                           5*GE    3
                                                                          R409

wondering what    I could do next the crowd seemed io^Jrfsappear so fast

that    initially I could not believe    it and I realised that a large

concertina type gate had been opened;        I was immensely relieved and

very grateful*

Seeing that I was no longer      required I began     to drive down towards

the rear of the     South stand when I reached a gate at the rear of the

Police Match Control    point   I heard a radio message "Everybody on the

track,    everybody on the track".     I stopped the Land Rover and gained

entry to the ground and ran onto the football         pitch.

Initially what    I thought   I was seeing was just a pitch invasion.

Thein? were no players on the pitch and fans were climbing over the

  ncing at the Leppings Lane end.        I was not overly      concerned because

I knew that     we're quite easily capable of dealing with a pitch

invasion.     I walked towards the goalmouth area at the Leppings

Lane.     As I did so I saw that a Liverpool    supporter had got to the

Notts,    end of the ground and was agitating the Notts,        fans by his

actions    in the goalmouth at that end.     As I walked across      to the

Leppings Lane end goalmouth,      I turned and saw that he had been

arrested around     the middle of the pitch.     As I neared to the

goalmouth I saw     Police officers helping fans over the fencing        and I

began to realise/it was more than a pitch invasion.            I then saw a

gate in the jN^rtce and fans lying trapped on top of one another in the

gateway.    looked behind the fencing and saw that the fans were all
 ^BBT*.
crushed together.  I saw a young fan amongst them and realised he was

dead.

I went to the open gate and tried to pull a youth out of the entrance

but he said that his foot was trapped.        With other officers      I then

tried to pull a young female out but she was trapped by fans behind

her and she began screaming and the other officers stopped pulling.

I said 'she's got to come out,       come on pull.'    We eventually pulled
                                                                          PAGE
                                                                          R409

her free and then pulled out a youth who had been trapped under her

but to one side, after which I was able to pull the youth who was at

the bottom back towards the fence and I was able to free his foot

which had been trapped between a metal     post which supports the

fencing and a concrete step.

I was obliged to recover by resting against the St. John's
                                v
ambulance.  I saw Chief Superintendent Nesbit standing on the

advertisement hoardings and holding onto the fencing trying to get

some organisation but the noise was top much.        I ran to the Land Rover

and a hand held loud hailer and gave it to Chief Superintendent Nesbit

who was still     in the same position still   trying to get things

organised.     He then instructed Police Officers to form a tunnel down

whian we passed bodies of the fans whilst some alive, a lot of them

ware obviously dead.      We passed back body after body until     eventually

 e cleared the area.

1 then assisted     in taking dead bodies on advertising hoardings to the

opposite end of the pitch clearing the area and from there         into the

gymnas ium.

My next recollection     is that I drove the Land Rover onto Pertistone

Road and parking on the central     reservation and performing traffic

duty directing ambulances down Herries Road and turning         right into

Penistone m a d   and then into the ground.

Eventually I went to the gymnasium looking for Superintendent

Chapwan.     When I arrived at the gym and I saw all    the bodies       laid on

11>§ floor I couldn't believe there was so many,      row upon row of them,

 ventually Detective Chief Superintendent^A^dis began issuing

 nstructions    regarding procedures and finding    I was not   required,     I

went into the North Stand looking for Superintendent Chapman.             He was

there with other supervisor officers so I sat in the stand.          I

remember seeing Chief Superintendent Mole approaching the North Stand
                                                                            PAGE    5
                                                                            R 409

from the Po 1 i ce Cont r o 1.   It was obvious he was now in control and I

can remember the feeling of immense        relief.

After being stood down by Mr Chapman I returned to the gymnasium to

see if I could assist,       but it seemed all organised.     I did a driving

job allocated to me by Chief        Inspector Beal (thAn resumed to my beat.

When I arrived at Leppings Lane initially*           I was able to travel

freely up to the crowd because there were very few fans walking up

Leppings Lane they were all        coming down.   The crowd was of three to

four thousand strong.

The mood of the fans was a grim determination to get in the ground,

no one was laughing or joking,        just the determination to get in.

I have no recollection of any actions by any stewards.

Radio communications were not good so much so that on previous

occasions the radio set up in the Land Rover           is such that   it can be

utilised as a radio room and has been on previous occasions by

pressing the correct buttons.         It receives and transmits messages via

match control.      At one stage I thought that       I would be required for

this.

My normal   function on match days is that qf driver with the Land

Rover of the Chief Superintendent and always           in position in Leppings

Lane.   This   is a duty I have been performing for years.

I remember that when I was at Leppings Lane and after using the P.A.

and having and having no success,        I was joined by an Inspector who

climbed onto the roof of the Land Rover and used the P.A. with the

same result.

                         Attention: Mr A. Brown.

Dear Sir

                    Home Office Circular 11/1990.
               Final Report of the H ills bo ro ug h Enquiry.


Ear lier this w e e k I received your circular dated 7th February,
having read the final report.

You will I feel sure appreciate that we in St John Am bu la nc e
are ext reme ly di sa pp oi nt ed that no me nt io n is made of the
tremendous input we have in providing practical support and
specialist advice p art icu la rly to desig na te d and regulated
grounds.

As you may know from previous c or re sp on de nc e I have myself been
p e r so nal ly involved since the Bradford fire and in fact met
Lord Ferrars to illustrate many shortcomings in the 1975 and
1987 Acts. This was subsequently confir me d by letter but no
action was taken.

M a y I therefore also make the following points:

1. P a r agra ph 230, page 40.
                 <» I'S Z . „

This states a private ambulance - not an ambulance from an
acceptable vo lu nta ry organi sat io n approved by the statutory
ambulance service.
NOTE
Since the A m b ula nce di spute started in September we have, at
their request, provided all ambulances, in sufficient number,
for d e s i g nat ed grounds, (some 300). All these vehicles are
subject to annual inspection by the L ondo n Ambu la nc e Service
and all crews trained to levels laid d ow n by the same service.
There could be man y problems in using "private" ambulances
w h i c h are us ua lly crewed by paid people often of unk nown
standards.
C om mu n i c a t i o n could be difficult whe re as we have for many years
inte rl in ke d our communication.
      2. I am on the S a f e t y / A d v i s o r y team of ne ar ly every ground in
        ondon and as a result of pressure and w i t h the full support of
        icensing A uth orit ies and Clubs have ensured that by the
  ♦     eg inning of next seaso n all will have either
      a) New First-Aid posts
      b) R e -c ons truc ted F i rs t-Ai d posts
      c) R e d eco rat ion and/or refurbishment.
      W e have been respons ib le for outlining the design.
      In addition all 1st and 2nd Div is ion grounds will have 25/30
      stretchers, 50 blankets etc. etc. as recommended 48 hours after
      Hillsborough.
      Grounds wit h a c a p a c i t y of over 25,000 are pr epared to increase
      to the R ecom m e n d a t i o n 69 of the report.
      We are also pr ov idi ng First-A id training to ma n y of the
      stewards and staff.

      M a n y Lo nd on Boroughs are also requesting our advice as to
      adequate First-Aid cover in leisure centres, swimming pools and
      indoor arenas etc.

      measures        as i m p or ta nt .

      Ho p e f u l l y the Gr een Code,w ill be more explicit on First Aid and
      medical requirements.

      M a y I, in conclusion, hope that wh en the Football Licensing
      A u t h o r i t y is set up that on the Com mit tee will be a person who
      has medical knowledg e and most import an tl y ma n y years of
      experie nc e at the sharp end.

Times (Sport) page 14 1st M a r c h 1992,              "There wil l be no chang e
in our plans r e g a r d i n g first and sec on d d i v i s i o n teams.     We m a y
have a look at the l ower d i v i s i o n s and cou ld lea ve them out."

Are there any pla ns to change the r u l i n g on all seater in

I  look   forward                  to    your   reply    and   may     I     thank   yo u       in
anticipation.

Yours s i n c e r e l y

 Thank you for your letter of 16 October to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, which arrived here
 yesterday.

 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has asked me to tell you that he has read your letter with interest
 He is grateful for the points you have made in it and will take them into account.

You ask to meet the Judge again, and he would welcome that. It would be helpful if the
meeting could take place at our offices here in London, as you suggest. We would arrange
for the discussion to be transcribed and would send you a copy of the transcript. You might
wish to have somebody else with you, for instance your legal adviser or Professor Scraton
and that would of course be perfectly acceptable.

Please telephone me to arrange an appointment. I look forward to hearing from you.

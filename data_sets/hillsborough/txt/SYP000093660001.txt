Qn Saturday 15th A p r i 1 1969 (150489)                   I had two tickets for the

Liverpool            v Nottingham Forest Cup Semi-Final match at Hi 11sb oro ug h„

Sheffield»               The seats were f o r m y s e 1f and my son                and we re .jSQjOi ri

S T A N D , GANGi*JAY G 7 ROW R , SEATS 19 AND 20.



Due to a business               commitment     I was    late leaving Nottingham on the 15th

April; .1989 (150^89) with my son                                 .rove my car Rover 3.5

saloon.                       up the HI North from Nottingham to Sheffield.

At about 1.15pm (1315) .we had r e a c h e / a very heavy traffic queue which

became a solid traffic jam on the 0Tctsrcliffe R o a d »                          A number of

people were parking their vehicles                      in side streets and. setting off to

walk to Hi 11sborough =



ye remained virtually stationery and at '1.45pm (1345) we decided to

park and walk,                X parked the car adjacent to Sutherland Road.                       I

anticipated a walk of about E-3 miles to- the qround.

points an ^unidentifiable 5 police refreshment van had stopped to

supply drinks t o t h e   officers on point duty*      The weather was indeed

humid and sunny.



As we" 'reached Neepsend Lane it became noticeable that there were more

and more supporters on foot.        These were both Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest supporters evidenced by their scarves and favours.

Throughout our walk to the junction of Neepsend Lane and Penistone

Road,; which ye reached at about 2.25pm <1423) we saw no violence or

trouble with the supporters either outside Public Houses or on foot.



At the iron bridge from Neepsend Lane to Pen istone Road a Police

Control   caravan was stationed.      There were numerous police officers

stationed along the remainder of the route to the Ground.



Once in Penistone Road the number of persons walking to the Ground

increased dramatically as did the volume of traffic heading towards

the Ground.



Also noticeable along the latter: stretch of this road was the number

of occasions,, four or five at least,       that within a half-ffiile we had to

avoid piles of vomit on the footpath.          Appreciating   it is hearsay I

did comment to my son that some of ti'w'spectators were going to be in

a poor state to watch the game.         /




At J . 4 0 pro (1440) we were on ? / n i stone Road some quarter-mi 1 e f rom the

ground.    At this time pe>$p/e were still entering the Public Houses.

These were certainly suppj^rters wearing the scarves and favours of
                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                         S379S

There was no apparent violent xfonduct among the supporters other than

one or two minor scuffles jamd jostling between individuals as they

walked towards the g r o w



As we passed some of the Public Houses which people were still

entering I commented to my son that                 some of these would have a job to

get in for the start of the game. I was certain that would                           be so as

we had seats and     1   knew we would only just make the start.



On reaching the ground at g.5 0 pro (1430)               I was surprised at the number

of people still outside the ground.                  Many people appeared to walk

behind the South Stand going           in our       direction.          Behind that stand

there were no problems and we q & ip td l quick entry to our                    stand.        On

reaching our seats at about S.J^pm               (1455)     virtually everyone around us

was standing.      Our seats w#re well back in the stand and ware about
                               /
level with the six y a r d ^ i n e .



On looking around the ground 1 noticed that the Kop appeared full of

Forest supporters.         The matter which also drew my attention and which

was commented upon by people around us was the w f i v i t y                   of the

standing spectators       in the two centre blocksyat the Lappings Lane end

of the ground.     People around us were say/ng how crush e d they were and

that it was stupid as there were •plentty of room at the side.                           In

those two blocks the spectators were extremely tightly packed and were

involved in a swaying forward movement.                     In the wing blocks,

certainly the one adjacent to our stand,                   there was plenty of space and

the terracing was clearly visible.



I recall seeing some fpectators             climbing out          y 'ih e   centre block      into

the wing block nearest us.             All t h e s e •a h s & f   lions took only a minute
                                                                               PAlaE        '
                                                                               S3792

or so at which time the two teams appeared.



As the match got underway I did notice some standing spectatoj^sT' bein 9

pulled out of the Lappings Lane block into, the s t a n d »         Seat holders

in the stand were leaning over and hoisting        p s i n t o      their stand.



Within a few minutes of the kick-off/Spectators were on the pitch at

the Leppings Lane end.       I saw spectators attempting to climb over the

fence and out of the centrve ^ i^ c k s , onto the pitch surround.             At this

point the game was stopped.       Some players became      involved with some

of the spectators .on the pitch.      Very quickly the p 1ayers          left tha

p it c h .



Numerous police arrived a t the pitch side of the Leppings Lane fence.

My initial thought was that the spectators were simply invading the

pitch.       From comments around me that was the view of many.

                                                           :k\
The action of some of the police officers at the fence was initially

difficult to comprehend.       They at first appeared to be trying to urge

spectators back by waving     thex r arms aC   LnesTi? bu&j at* tris sasue iuxme

some officers were helping     people over the fence cmfct> the pitch side.

On reflection I formed the opinion that s o m e        f i c e r s were a 11 a m pt i n g

to urge the spectators to move back as t p r v s e at the front were being

crushed.                                 /



Spectators seated in the stand above the standing spectators                continued

to pull up dozens of people into their-stand.            Most of those        I saw

lifted into the stand appeared able to walk up into that stand.



Within a few minutes a large number of police officers were assembled
                                                                          P AGE

an the pitch side of the Leppings Lane fence™



Spectators were continually being lifted out of the crush from behind

the fence.       It was soon apparent that many people were beinq

seriously crushed.



Despite this it appeared that those at the back of the centre blocks

were still     pushing forward*, or maybe were themselves being pushed from

behind.      From our position it was not possible to see the cause.



During the next 45 minutes many dozens of people either climbed out or

were   lifted out of the centre blocks.          Some appeared unhurt?   some

appeared distraught or shaken.            Some however were carried from the

area of the fence either by police or spectators and laid on the

grass.     Many were given attention by police, St John's Ambulance

staff or spectators.          1   saw many of those applying either   chest or

mouthr-io—mouth resuscitation.           I saw a number of police officers in

particular applying resuscitation techniques.



One officer    immediately in front of our stand was

Most- pieopie who were being treated in any way had more than one person

in attendance.        In one instance a body of people gathered round a

person lying on the grass suddenly broke into cheering as it appeared

the victim had been resuscitated.           At some stage spectators,

initially at the Leppings Lane end,          began pulling down the advertising

hoardings around the pitch to use as stretchers.            Eventually hoarding

from all   points around the ground were being used.              /

■were problems and coula spectators        clear the pitch to allow the

emergency services to deal with the * injured’.              This request was

greeted with cheering and applause and some persons did w o v e off the

pitch.      However,   many of those still on the pitch ware still tending

the injured or removing people by stretcher or were themselves

recovering from their involvement.



By   this time it was clear that some spectators were dead.              A number

of bodies were      lying on the ground their heads covered with items of

c;lathing.



Throughout the whole of the period the police officers and the other

emergency service staff, arsd many spectators were actively involved in

the operation.         They were constantly removing people from the crowded

blocks- and treating them.                                        /

right across the p i t c h y ^                         This operation must have entailed over 60

officers but it disa'uaded any -further movement by the Liverpool

spectators.                  GrU'y persons carrying stretchers were allowed through

that cordon.



A number of incidents occurred involving photographers.                                                      Some who

been taken that no further ambulances                                       youId enter the pitch area.

All further             casualties were either                        physically carried or taken by

stretcher to the Kop end and out oy                                    the ground.              I could see

remain in position in the ground until a further announcement,                                               I

presumed the re q u e s i            to remai n i ri the g ra und was to ensure                   1   ess

activity outside the ground enabling the emergency services to operate

more quickly on the roads.



No mention of any fatality was made                          in the announcement.



Whilst we remained in the stand there were various                                  comments whether

from radio reports or rumours,                       I do not know., to the effect that 3,

then 10, then 13 people had died,



I did not hear another announcement and eventually the stand was

virtually empty as were other stands                           in the ground.            We then left

Hillsborough and made our way back to the car then N o t t i n g h a m »

to reach the ground.-           Many of the people     I saw outside and entering

the public houses would          have   had difficulty in getting inta the ground

for the start,     Cwe only      just   snads it with a few minutes to spare).

The people who I. saw in         this   situation were mainly male,     in   the 16yr -

30yr bracket.       Of those I saw worse -for drink I         would suggest it was

dozens as opposed to hundreds,             Most of those affee.ted appeared in

good humour but some were staggering and stumbling along or having

difficulty in standing still outside the public houses.



The only violence      I saw, other than in the crushing in the crowd at

the Leppings Lane end were a few minor jostlings of fans on the route

to the ground.        As stated earlier these appeared to be ’friendly'              and

amongst persons known to one another.



The majority of late arrivals           X saw on my route approaching the ground

appeared to be Forest su pporters.               Thera were certainly many

Liverpool supporters on the route.                That was evident if only with

regard to those wearing favours.



Inside the ground I do not know who or what caused t h e ■excessive

shoving and crushing at the Leppings Lane end.                Most definitely that

problem was already there at S.5 3 pm (1455).              This was witnessed and

commented upon by people around us.

Hillsborough would have been very high.                  A policy decision as 'to

whether such volume of equipment? at the cost involved?                     should be

available on a regular basis has no doubt to be raade,                      I personally

doubt that such volumes of equipment are available at theatres?

cinemas and most crowd pulling events where a disaster                     involving

injury to hundreds of people could occur.



At Hillsborough my/opinion w jfe that there appeared to be a lack of
            i
            .              /
appreciation of the actu-3^ problem in the early stages.    From my

position that was easy/xo understand.                 Probably the initial view of

the vast majority o^fspectators was that an tmrul-f’ pitch invasion was

taking place,       .Within minutes the actions of' the police and other

involved persons was concentrated on trying to free persons from the

crush,



The true situation was also evaluated by people                  in the stands near the

Le ppi ngs Lane end,        The spectators at the Kop end of the ground would

have had great difficulty in assessing the true situation.



The 1a c k of 1o uds peak e r a .n n g id m ^ m & rit s or advice was d if f i cu 11 to

understand,        An early^ja^icmncement even if just saying some people

had been injured in a crush situation would at least have put the

54,000 crowd in the picture.              Additionally an earlier          loudspeaker

announcement could have.asked for volunteers with medical experience

to assist.



As a whole     I was impressed by the .attitude of virtually the whole

crowd once the situation had sunk in.                 That applied to both the

Liverpool and Forest spectators.

           POLICE SERGEANT K„L. JONES

           D"I DIVISION



           SEMI FINAL - D DIVISION PLANNING



           Chief    Inspector Bet-tiaon, who     is engaged on the HQ semi      final enquiry

           team has requested that I submit a report on the above subject to his

           office urgently and in any event before 27 April           1989.



           INTRODUCTION - D DIVISION OPERATIONS PLANNING



           Presently myself and Police Constable 916 Bradley are responsible for

           the initial         planning of D1 Sub Divisional   policing    response to events

           which occur within the sub division.          Occasionally we plan the

           response for the whole division when the manpower              commitment     is large,

           such as for a Royal         visit or major march/procession which affects D1

           and D 2 .
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              R76



First knowledge of events         is gained in several ways,     from

correspondence,    media reports,      poster campaigns,   telephone      calIs and

there are many which recur annually.          Once we have knowledge of an

event which appears     to require Police action,      a report is made to the

Sub-Divisional Comrnande r .      He then instructs the course which will be

taken which ranges from advising the organisers to preparation of an

operational    order.   FGO and FSOs are consulted and adhered to where

applicable.



Once   it has been decided that an order will         be prepared,      the event

is programmed into the D1 planning system.           A file   is opened and a

number of customised forms are completed.            Key dates   are    entered in

the sub divisional      diaries and the event assigned a unique event

number.     It is not unusual      to have several   events being      planned

simultaneously,    presently there are 8 'live*        files being handled by

the office.



Thereafter,    meetings are held with all      interested parties and regular

reports made to the      (Sub-Divisional and sometimes Divisional)

Commander to keep them up-dated.          The usual method is for a minute to

be attached to the event working file showing the up to date

position.     We also   liaise with statutory undertakers,        PSV Operators

and the emergency services as a matter of course and in the week

prior to the event      itself,    pro-forma letters are sent to PSV

operators and the emergency services.



Using the directions given me in the frequent           planning discussions

and minutes on file written by the Sub-Divisional Commander,                I then

draw up a draft Operational Order.          Experience and divisional        policy
                                                                         PAGE         3
                                                                         R76

is used to deploy the manpower       involved.    The first draft   is then

submitted to the Sub-Di v is i onal Commander      (or Divisional Commander)

who will   request amendments or sign the order.



At that point the order is copied and published.



The event then takes     place and usually an officer from the office          is

involved in the actual     execution.



Following the event,     de-brief    information is recorded and the original

file,   along with the working      papers,   is filed for future   reference.



1989 SEMI FINAL PLANNING



First knowledge of the event was gained from media reports on 21

March 1989.    Our   initial   response was to open two files,      one headed

manpower and one headed semi final.           Certain customised forms were

completed and the event given a unique number.           On the face of it     "D "

Division would be required to mount a similar operation to the one

mounted in 1988 when     (excluding traffic      points in D Division)   200

men were used.



I discussed the matter with A/Superintendent King who told me to

begin planning our operation based on the 1988 operation.             After that

meeting    I consulted the sub divisional       duty books and realised that

it would be difficult to raise the,manpower wholly from D Division

officers due to annual     leave and courses.                              ,



On 22 Mar ch 1989, myself, PS 694 Stacey and PC 916 Bradley, attended

a joint planning meeting at Hammerton Road Police Station.             Also
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              R7 6

present were officers from Headquarters Operations,          Dog/Mounted

Section,    British Transport Police and representatives          from British

Rail,   South Yorkshire Transport and other organisations.            Chief

Superintendent Mole      chaired the meeting.      Basically the outcome of

that meeting was that the      "D* Division commitment would be the same

as in 1 9 8 8 , with the exception that Ops and Traffic would be

accepting    responsibility for all match traffic       in the. South Yorkshire

Police area on 15 April      1989.



At the meeting I arranged further meetings with South Yorkshire

Transport,    British Transport Police, British Rail and Road Traffic.



On S3 March 1989, myself and Police Constable 916 Bradley attended

the first of the several meetings we were to have with Road Traffic

to discuss the traffic      policing in 'D* Division.      It was agreed that

Inspector Scholey would draw.up the traffic operations order and that

affected divisions would ’second*          officers to traffic on 15 April

1989.    It was estimated that traffic would require 30+ D Division

Constables on '15 April     1989.



I discussed the developments with A/Superintendent King and informed

him of the    requirement to supply 30+ Constables to traffic          in

addition to the 200 we would probably need in 5D ? Division for our

operation.     I also   informed him that     raising the total    in house was

proving difficult and that cancellation of weekly leave might be

required.     It was decided at that point       - 28 March 1989 — to ask

'D* Division to supply volunteers to work on weekly          leave as an

alternative to cancellation.         The   request was circulated and produced

more officers.
                                                                         PAGE   5
                                                                         R76

I had several meetings with Inspector Mabbott of the British

Transport Police and also with staff from British Rail.         The meeting

took place in the offices and platforms at Midland Station.          The

outcome was that British Rail would be using the same tactics as in

•1988 to deal with the influx of fans at the station,       except that

Inspector Mabbott     initially declined to have his men segregating

Liverpool    fans from the travelling   public on the platforms    prior to

exit from the South Luggage Exit as in the past.         This task was to

be left to us.       (However two days before the operation we received

the British Transport Police order which stated that BTP would after

all segregate the fans on the platforms.       This   contradicted our

order,    but the new information was given at   "D* E)ivision briefing on

15 April    1989).



I also met Mr. Bert Middleton of South Yorkshire Transport who told

me that last year a fleet of 35 buses transported fans to and from

Midland Station.      On the outward trip 41 full     loads of Nottingham

supporters were carried and 11 full      loads of Liverpool fans were

carried.     On return 8 Liverpool   loads were carried and 37 Nottingham

loads.     The outward figures showed that approximately 4,160 fans had

been taken to the ground and that 3,600 had returned.          (It is not

unusual    for fans to walk back due to congestion).      The figures also

showed that    17 buses-; had managed a return trip on the outward    leg and

that   10 had managed a return trip on the return leg.



South Yorkshire Transport     regularly transport fans to Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club from the Midland Station.         Police escorts are

always requested and it is usual to deploy two officers to a full

bus.     This was discussed with A/Superintendent King and he decided

that two officers     per bus would be used for the operation,     but that
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              R76

if possible they were to return to Sheffield Midland for a ’return

load*.     It was hoped that at least 104 officers would be required for

PSV escorts.



Qn 29 March     1989,    I received a request froitr Police Constable 808

Rosevear    (HQ Ops)    for   ’D* manpower to work at SWFC fon 15 April        1989,,'

After speaking with A/Superintendent King I informed PC Rosevear that

it would not be possible for            ’D ’’ Division to supply any staff as we

were having difficulty raising manpower for our in-house needs, on the

day .



On the 4 April      1989, Road Traffic requested 35 Constables and 4

Traffic wardens from          'D" Division.     They were to report at Brightside

Lane by 0800 on the 15 April            1989=    I subsequently warned 35 Officers

who were all D2 C o n s t a b l e s „



Also by 4 April       1989,    I informed A/Superintendent King that

cancellation of weekly leave was then needed as we were still some 40

officers short.         He consulted Chief Superintendent Broornhead and

weekly leave on 15 April          1989, was     cancelled for    "D’ Division Officer

on that day.



All     *D 5 Division staff - with few exceptions -- were now included in

the planning.       Court Staff, Charge Office Staff, CID Aides and some

administrative officers had been included.               Cancellation of weekly

leave raised most of the shortfall              but we were obliged to go to

Police Constable 808 Rosevear for 17 Officers.                  Most of these were

Detectives who worked in uniform for the day.               Given that they were

''strangers'    none were eventually deployed other than on PSV escort

duties.
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               R76



On 5 April   1989,   I had a meeting with A/Superintendent King.               I told

him that I had raised enough manpower for. the operation envisaged

which would take in public order patrols on the 14 and IS April,

patrols   in Pond Street and PSV escorts on 13 April            1989.   One problem

was that we had a surfeit of Sergeants and it was decided that two

per PSV serial would be allocated as the important factor was that

each PSV have two officers.        At that point allocation of

responsibility for the     *D'* Division senior officers         involved

was decided by A/Superintendent King,         which I noted for inclusion on

the Order.



On or around the 5 April     1989,    I. contacted Inspector Sewell at          'FI5

and confirmed the unloading        points for the P S V s .    I also   informed him

that the escort serials would amount to 110+ and that they were

available as a reserve during the match itself.               He told me to have

them report to the Gymnasium at SWFC and that they would be given a

hot meal after half time.      I noted the      information for inclusion in

the draft    *D " Divsion Order.     Police Constable Bradley sent a-Gen 2

containing the information to Inspector Sewell           via Chief

Superintendent Broomhead on 8. April        1989.



By this time serial make up and deployment had been decided.                   We had

also made requests for the attendance of Mounted Officers,               Dog

Section staff and arranged for a Brimac vehicle to be on stand-by,.

It was apparent that we would need extra vehicles and requests for

these were made through Headquarters Traffic Management.                Also

requests for radios and repeater sets were made.              One radio between         Z

officers was to be the issue.         A' logistics team was appointed to

manage all the extra equipment from collection to issue and return.
                                                                                 PAGE    8
                                                                                 R 76



Meals were ordered for all         concerned and the PSV escort serials were

to be given a.hot drink and pack-ed rneal at briefing             in case they did

not receive their hot meal at SWFC due to being uti.lis.-ed'-.           Hot drinks

were also    laid on at Sheffield Midland.



On 7 April    1989,    1 drew up a draft operational order.          I gave    it to

A/ Superintendent King on 8 April            1989 for his amendments.      On 9

April    1989, A/Superintendent King         returned the order to me with some

minor    changes.     These were   incorporated into the 2nd draft which I

submitted to him on ID April         1989.    This   copy was read by

Superintendent Bates who signed the order that day.                 It was then

copied and distributed.



At around that date       I, attended a final     planning meeting at Harnrne r ton

Road which was chaired by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.                   My input

to the meeting was the arrangements made for the PSV escorts.



In the final    days    run up to the operation,       the office    published

several    other unconnected orders.         As is common on orders which use

large numbers of officers,         changes had to be made to the semi          final

order serials as circumstances dictated.             Consequently it was

necessary to up date the master serial            list by hand.     A copy of that

list    is attached and reflects the make up of the serials as they were

deployed on 15 April       1989.   The new information was passed to the

officers    involved,    both prior to and at the main briefing.

Efficiency was not compromised.



All supervisors were sent an advance            copy of the order on the 10

April   1989, as were surrounding Divisions,          HQ, Specialists and B T P .
                                                                                   PAGE~
                                                                                   R76

In common with normal            practice,   spare   copies were available at

briefing as were displayed copies of the serial                  lists' and

deployments.          A pile of SWFC maps were also made available for those

unfamiliar with the ground.



A total of IE serials were sent to SWFC,                totalling    120 officers of

which 19 were Sergeants.             Inspectors Harper and Dews accompanied

them.      In *D * Division        (excluding traffic    points) 46 officers were

deployed on public order and Pond Street duties over a three day

operation.



As for the order           itself,   the main strategy and policy was laid down

by A/Superintendent King.              I attended the detail and liaison with

other Divisions and outside organisations.                    The working   papers and

original      copy of the order        is filed in E Group office at West Bar

P o 1 i c e S t a t ion.

     SUBJECT:   SEMI FINAL - D DIVISIOH PLANNING


    Chief Inspector Bettison, who is engaged on the HQ semi final enquiry
    team, has requested that I submit a report on the  abovesubject to his
    office urgently and in any event before 27 April 1989.

    INTRODUCTION - D DIVISION OPERATIONS PLANNING

    Presently myself and PC 916 Bradley are responsible for the initial
    planning of D1 sub divisional policing response to events which occur
    within the sub division. Occasionally we plan the response for the
    whole division when the manpower commitment is large, such as for a
    Royal visit or major march/procession which affects D1 and D 2 .

    First   knowledge   of events is gained in several        ways,   from
    correspondence, media reports, poster campaigns, telephone calls and
    there are many which recur annually. Once we have knowledge of an
    event which appears to require police action a report is made to the
    sub divisional commander . He then instructs the course which will be
    taken which ranges from advising the organisers to preparation of an
    operational order. FGO and FSOs are consulted and adhered to where
    applicable.

    Once it has been decided that an order will be prepared the event is
    programmed into the D1 planning system. A file is opened and a number
    of customised forms are completed. Key dates are entered in the sub
    divisional diaries and the event assigned a unique event number. It is
    not unusual to have several events being planned simultaneously,
    presently there are 8 "live" files being handled  by theoffice.

    Thereafter meetings are held with all interestedparties and regular
    reports made to the sub divisional (and sometimes          divisional)
    commander to keep them updated. The usual method is for a minute to
    be attached to the      event working file showing the up to date
    position.We also liaise with statutory undertakers, PSV operators, and
    the emergency services as a matter of course and in the week prior to
    the event itself pro - forma letters are sent to PSV operators    and
    the emergency services.
    Using the directions given me in the frequent planning discussions and
    minutes on file written by the sub divisional commander I then draw up
    a draft operational order. Experience and divisional policy   is used
    to deploy the manpower involved. The first draft is then submitted to
    the sub divisional      commander (or divisional commander) who will
    request amendments or sign the order.
At that point the order is copied   and published.


The event then takes place and usually an officer from the office is
involved in the actual execution.

Following the event de brief information is recorded and the original
file along with the working papers is filed for future reference.


 1989 SEMI FINAL PLANNING

First knowledge of the event was gained from media reports on 21 March
1989. Our initial response was to open two files, one headed manpower
and one headed semi final. Certain customised forms were completed
and the event given a unique number . On the face of it D Division
would be required to mount a similar operation to the one mounted in
1988 when (excluding traffic points in D Division) 200 men were used.

I discussed the matter with A/Superintendent King who told me to begin
planning our operation based on the 1988 operation. After that meeting
I consulted the sub divisional duty books and realised that it would
be difficult to raise the manpower wholly from D Division officers due
to annual leave and courses.

On 22 March 1989 myself, PS 694 Stacey and PC 916 Bradley attended a
joint planning meeting at Hammerton Road Police Station. Also present
were officers from HQ Ops, Dog/Mounted section, British Transport
Police,  and representatives from British Rail,      South   Yorkshire
Transport and other organisations. Chief Superintendent Mole chaired
the meeting. Basically the outcome of that meeting was that the D
Division commitment would be the same as in 1988 with the exception
that Ops and Traffic would be accepting responsibility for all match
traffic in the South Yorkshire Police area on 15 April 1989.

At the meeting I arranged further meetings with South Yorkshire
Transport, British Transport Police, British Rail and Road Traffic .

On 23 March 1989 myself and PC 916 Bradley attended the first of
several meetings we were to have with Road Traffic to discuss the
traffic policing in D Division. It was agreed that Inspector Scholey
would draw up the traffic operations order and that affected divisions
would "second’’ officers to traffic on 15 April 1989. It was estimated
that traffic would require 30+ D Division Constables on 15 April 1989.

I discussed the developments with A/Superintendent King and informed
him of the requirement to supply 30+ Constables to traffic in addition
to the 200 we    would    probably need in D Division for our operation.   I
also informed     him that raising the total in    house was proving
difficult andthat cancellation      of WL might be  required.  It was
decided at that point - 28 March 1989 - to ask D Division to supply
volunteers towork on WL as an       alternative to  cancellation.  The
request was circulated and produced more officers.
                                                                       "?{?




I had several meetings with Inspector Mabbott of the British Transport
Police    and also with staff from British Rail. The meetings took place
in the offices and platforms at Midland Station. The outcome was that
British Rail would be using the same tactics as in 1988 to deal with
         lux. °* f*ns at the station except that Inspector Mabbott
initially declined to have his men segregating Liverpool fans from
     traveling public on the platforms prior to exit from the South
Luggage Exit as in the past. This task was to be left to us.( However
two days before the operation we received the British Transport Police
order which stated that BTP would after all segregate the fans on the
platforms.   This contradicted our order but the new information was
given at D Division briefing on 15 April 1989).

I also met Mr Bert Middleton of South Yorkshire Transport who told me
that last year a fleet of 35 busses transported fans to and from
Midland Station.       On the outward trip 41 full  loads of Nottingham
supporters were carried and 11 full loads of Liverpool fans were
carried      On return 8 Liverpool loads were carried and 37 Nottingham
loads       The outward figures showed that approximately 4160 fans  had
been taken to the ground and that 3600 had returned.         (It is  not
u£usu* .,f°r,r,f*ns to walk back due to congestion). The figures also
      in!!ai     busses had managed a return trip on the outward leg and
that 1Uhad managed a return trip on the return leg.

South Yorkshire Transport regularly transport fans to SWFC from the
Midland Station. Police escorts are always requested and it is usual
to deploy two officers to a full bus. This was discussed with
A/Superintendent King and he decided that two officers per bus would
ct S!® i50ru^5? operation but that if possible they were to return to
Sheffield Midland for a "return load". It was hoped that this would
save manpower. That meant that on 1988 figures at least 104 officers
would be required for PSV escorts.

On 29 March 1989 I received a request from PC 808 Rosevear (HQ Ops)
for D manpower to work at SWFC on 15 April 1989. After speaking with
A/Superintendent King I informed PC Rosevear that it would not be
       ® for. ? Division to supply any staff as we were having
airrlculty raising manpower for our in house needs on the day.

On the 4 April 1989 Road Traffic requested 35 Constables and 4 Traffic
wardens from D Division. They were to report at Brightside Lane by
 ??            AP n l 1989. I subsequently warned 35 officers who were
all D2 Constables.

Also   by 4 April    1989 I informed A/Superintendent     King   that
cancellation of WL was then needed as we were still some 40 officers
short. He consulted with Chief Superintendent Broomhead and WL on 15
April was cancelled for D Division officers on that day

All D Division staff - with few exceptions - were now included in the
Planning. Court staff, Charge Office staff,       CID Aides and some
administrative officers had been included. Cancellation of WL raised
??st °*.the shortfall but we were obliged to go to PC 808 Rosevear for
    °5     ® : Most of these were Detectives who worked in uniform for
the day. Given that they were "strangers"        none were eventually
deployed other than on PSV escort duties.

On 5 April 1989 I had a meeting with A/Superintendent Ring. I told him
that I had raised enough manpower for the operation envisaged which
would take   in public order patrols on 14 and 15 April, patrols in
Pond Street and PSV escorts on 15 April 1989. One problem was that we
had a surfeit of Sergeants and it was decided that two per PSV serial
would be allocated as the important factor was that each PSV have two
officers.  At that point allocation of responsibility for the D
Division senior officers involved was decided by A/Superintendent King
which I noted for inclusion on the order.

On or around the 5 April 1989 I contacted InspectorSewell at    FI and
confirmed the unloading points for the PSVs. I also informed him that
the escort serials would amount to 110+ and that they were available
as a reserve during the match itself. He told me to have them report
to the Gymnasium at SWFC and that they would be given a hot meal after
half time.   I noted the information for inclusion in the draft D
Division order. PC 916 Bradley sent a Gen 2 containing the information
to Inspector Sewell via Chief Superintendent Broomhead on 8 April 1989

By this time serial make up and deployment had been decided. We had
also made requests for the attendance of mounted officers ,dog section
staff and arranged for a Brimac vehicle to be on standby.      It was
apparent that we would need extra vehicles and requests for these were
made through HQ Traffic Management. Also requests     for radios   and
repeater sets were made. 1 radio between 2 officers was to      be the
issue. A logistics team was appointed to manage all the extra
equipment from collection to issue and return.

Meals were ordered for all concerned and the PSV escort serials were
to be given a hot drink and packed meal at briefing in case they did
not receive their hot meal at SWFC due to being utilised. Hot drinks
were also laid on at Sheffield Midland.

On 7 April 1989 I drew up a draft operational order. I gave it to
A/Superintendent King on 8 April 1989 for his amendments. On 9 April
1989 A/Superintendent King returned the order to me with some minor
changes. These were incorporated into the 2nd draft which I submitted
to him on 10 April 1989. This copy was read by Superintendent Bates
who signed the order that day. It was then copied and distributed.

At around that date I attended a final planning meeting at Hammerton
Road which was chaired by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. My input
to the meeting was the arrangements made for PSV escorts.

In the final days run up to the operation the office published
several other unconnected orders. As is common on orders which use
large numbers of officers changes had to be made to the semi final
order serials as circumstances dictated. Consequently it was necessary
to update the master serial list by hand. A copy of that list is
attached and reflects the make up of the serials as they were deployed
on 15 April 1989. The new information was passed to the officers
involved both prior to and at the main briefing. Efficiency was not
compromised.
All supervisors were sent an advance copy of the order on the 10 April
1989 as were surrounding Divisions, HQ, Specialists and BTP. In common
with normal practice spare copies were available at briefing as were
displayed copies of the serial lists and deployments. A pile of SWFC
maps were also made available for those unfamiliar with the ground.

A total of 12 serials were sent to SWFC totaling 120 officers of
which 19 were sergeants. Inspectors Harper and Dews accompanied them.
In D Division (excluding traffic points) 46 officers were deployed on
public order and Pond Street duties over a three day operation.

As for the order itself the main strategy and policy was laid down by
A/Superintendent King. I attended to the detail and liaison with other
divisions and outside organisations. The working papers and original
copy of the order is filed in E Group office at West Bar Police
Station.

TAYLOR REPORT;   HOME SECRETARY'S STATEMENT
Following this morning's meeting, I attach a redraft of the
statement picking up the points made,
2. Two comments. The addition to the paragraph at the bottom
of page 2, to nod to the work already being done in football,
is drawn from the report. The addition to the top of the last
page is also drawn from the report and is designed to meet
Mr Mower's point thatf bearing in mind television coverage,
the announcement of the abandonment of the membership scheme
would best be followed immediately by a positive statement of~"
what the Government is going to do.
3. I have added in the margin references to paragraph numbers
in the report.

               I am a Police Con/table of Greater Manchester Police, at present

               stationed at Stockport.

         We are all       locals at the Lane Ends public house,



         All four of us then set off from the public house in                                     car to

         attend the game at Hillsborough, S h e f f i e l d .



         We did not stop anywhere en route to the game and only                            encountered any

         travel delays in Sheffield which were due to                         the sheer volume of

         traffic going to Hillsborough.



         We parked the car about half a mile from                         the ground at the Leppings Ln

         End on quite a steep hill                   close to a public house.



         We arrived at this point between 12.15pm (1215) and 12.:                               (1230)   the

         same date.



         All the public houses at the Liverpool FC a l l o c k e d end of the ground

         were shut and therefore Liverpool supporterfe v^r^-going into an off

         licence near to where we parked the car ancr-^Kiying caflg^of beer w hich

         they were drinking there and then.



         The other three with me went into the o f f A i c / n c e a nd purchased six to

         eight cans of b e e r.                 The off licence would not allow anyone to buy

         large amounts of beer.
                                                                        PAGE       3
                                                                        81131

All four of us then walked towards        fie ground and again went into an

off licence and purchased anothej       five to six cans of beer from there.

Again other Liverpool s u p p o r t ^ s were buying and consuming b e e r from

this off licence.



Police Officers were    present between our arrival     point and the ground

but we did not receive an escort or directions from them.            I did not

witness any drunkeness,    disorder or fighting cmtside the ground.



          and     had tickets for the Spion Kop although they ar

Liverpool supporters so we stood on a main road at the Leppiybs Ln End

of the ground hoping that fans would come past who would fw^p their

tickets for the Liverpool     end for          and           ickets for the

Nottingham end.



Whilst doing this we drank our cans of beer as did other Liverpool

supporters.     The mood y ,afs jovial and good natured throughout this

period.



At about 2pm (I^QO)^we had not managed to swap the tickets and so all

four of us walked down to the entrance to the turnstile for our end of

the grount



I have yDeen shown a diagram and the entrance I refer tj/leads to the

turnstiles marked A to G and 1-16 on that diagram.



We have arrived at Jfchis entrance at about 2.05pm       (1405)   the same date.



The crowd waitLng to enter the turnstiles was right back out into

Leppings Ln and was closely packed.
                                                                       PAGE     4
                                                                       S 1131




                   we nt towards the turnstiles ma/ked A to G to try and

find a policeman to seek advice      regarding tharir tickets.



        and myself joined the queue leading M> turnstiles 1 to 16 w hich

was back at the actual entrance gates to the ground.           In fact the

word queue does not really apply,      it was just a mass of people slowly

moving forward.



I could not understand what was causing such a hold up.           I have

attended many big games and have A x e v e r   encountered anything like it



I did not see either    police q\yficers or club stewards a ttempting to

form queues.



The message got back from the front near to the turnstiles that

everyone was being searched which was no doubt why the crowd was so

big for getting in.



As I neared the turnstiles I could see that absolutely everyone going

through was being searched by police officers and also being asked to

produce tickets.



I must say that I feel searching everyone was out of order due to the

chaos    it was causing outside.



I could see through the fence to my right that the approach to the

turnstiles A to G was similarly packefl.



After approximately thirty minutes       I arrived at the turnstile where I
                                                                 PAGE      5
                                                                 S 1 131

was searched by a Woman Police Constable and requested to produce my

ticket which I did.



I then entered the turnstile where the attendant took my ticket,

removed the stub and gave the main portion



I also saw a number of steward* out*ide the              standing near

                                     ing notI
to the police officerjr apparently doing



Inside try turnstvn.es I did not see any police or club stewards

present but I was not really looking for them.     This area inside the

turnstiles was quite full of people.



Although I experienced difficulty entering the ground I did not have

trouble finding my entry point.



I did not see any gates open or gates opened nor did I see any

unauthorised entry by fans.



______and I were not /itting together   inside the ground so we walked

towards the North &tand.



We split up after I had told       that I would meet him after the game

back at the car.



I carried on along the back of the North S^and following the signs to

my gangway.   I went up my gangway where^a club steward was present.

He did not ask to look at my ticket so I went to my seat having no

difficulty finding    it.
                                                                     PAGE     6
                                                                     S 1131

I took up my match viewing point at about 2.45pm (1445) the same date.



I did not witness any disorder between entering the ground and taking

up my match viewing position.



At my match viewing position which was clrfse to the pitch and level

with the edge of the eighteen yard boxyat the Spion Kop end of the

ground I had a good view of the Ulest Stand antj/'the standing area

beneath the seats.



I saw that the pens marked thM?e and four behind the goal were packed

tightly and the whole crowd was swaying back and forth.



The areas marked 6 & 7 on the diagram had loads of room for more

people as did areas 1 and 2 but to a lesser extent.



The players     came out onto the pitch and the game   gan.


                                        N   II 1 0
The next    thing I noticed was a police officer running onjto the pitch

from the    Leppings Ln   end and approaching the referee.



The game    was stopped and I immediately looked over/towards the Ulest

Stand and saw/that people were climbing over the fences from Pens 3

and 4 out on/o the pitch/and being Lifted out of the same pens up into
           jt je J x        ^ o X d
the seated^area above.



Pens 3 and 4 were full to capacity with what appeared to be more

people entering them.



The   police,   fans who had already got over the fences and other
                                                                                             PAGE         7
                                                                                             S1131

                     officials were pull/ing people over the fences onto the pitch which was

                     littered with people.



                     Advertiseme      hoardings were being broken up to be used as makeshift

                     stretchers



                     The    injured were being carried across the pitch to a position directly

                     in front of me.      Some of the bodies had their heads covered with

                     coats etc.



                     I decided that I would go down onto the ^itch to give assistance which

                     I did.



                     I saw a man giving mouth to mouth resuscitation to a lad.             The man

                     was struggling so I took over the mouth to mouth and heart massage.



                     The lad had no pulse and was motionless showing no           signs of life.



                     Someone    in uniform came overyand took over from me        who Ibelieve to    be

                     members of the St J o h n ’s Ambu lance Brigade.      After a short while they

                     carried the lad from the       pitch.



                     I would describe this youth a s / o l l o w s i

                     Other than thWt I can describe him no further.



-             A            my opinion this lad was dead.
                                                                                     PAGE    8
                                                                                     S1131



I looked down the pitch towards the West Stand.                      The pitch was

littered with people being tended to by all the emergency services

p r e s en t .



I felt I could offer no more assistance and returned to my s e a t .



I feel      that    in the   circu(nstancesy/ol lowing the^Tiatch being s t o p p e d
                    Q & p + e . Com m
that the emergency services a r a whole did tt/s best they c o u l d.

However,         I feel that the police officers w h/S formed a cordon across

the pitch at about the half way line              col I   I/   have been more usefully
                                                          V
employed tending the injured after the risk of the Liverpool                     fans

approaching the Nottingham end had subsided.



I left the ground at about 4.45pm (1645) the same date,                     returned to

the car where         I met up with my friends and eventually returned home.



I was        pot injured      as a result of this disaster.



I did        not see anyone consuming alcohol             inside the ground.



I cannot say that I witnessed arty crowd surge only sway                    that appeared

to be        due to more      people ente/ing Pens 3 and 4.



Although announcements                 made over the PA system when I left it was

of my own accord.



I did not witness anything that I consider to be a cr^ninal offence.



I would say without a shadow of doubt that the crowds outside the
                                                                                   PAGE     9
                                                                                   S 1131

         Leppinq Ln end turnstiles was / a u s e d   by   the searching of all the fans

         be they children or pensioners when it>£as not required.



         In my opinion as a police officer /f tweAlvke y g a r s ^ e r v i c e a minority

         of the police officers at Hi ■U.spo^'ouqh showed a lack of

         professional ism in the handling of the situation.           By this I mean

         they gave the impression that they just did not know what to do next.




                                                                                  SIGNED

Dear Mr. Cleugh,

Thank you for your letter of the 20th instant, the contents of which I
note.

We very much appreciate your attitude in this matter and indeed have
subsequently been involved in a meeting with the Coroner when the arrangements
for the resumed Inquests were outlined.
                            4

That will certainly be of fmmense assistance to us and fellow members;
of the Group in connection with the fatal cases.

I note the position as far as the statements from living witnesses are
concerned and whilst I regret that those individuals at least for the
time being have to go through the trauma of making a second full statement
I appreciate your position.

I may come back to you on this point later if there are particular problems
at our end.

All good wishes.

Yours sincerely,



                     —-

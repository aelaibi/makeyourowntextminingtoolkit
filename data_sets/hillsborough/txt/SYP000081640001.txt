               Later      that       same      day       I was         collect       d by       transit          van     and        t a k e n t,o

               after      arriving,            approximately                  3.15pm        I was        informed,             in    the    dining

               room      that       a major      public             order       situation            had      occursd          at    Hillsborough

               immediately.

               A     convoy     was    formed            and      we    attended          at    the      ground        at      the     rear       of   the

    On ali g h t i n g    the transit,         an    Inspector       (the          identity     I do not know)

    ordered me to forin a cordon across                       the halfway              line of the        pitch,

    f a c i n g t o w a r d t h e !_e p p i n g s L.a n e en d .   M a n y Liverpool            fan s a p p r o a c h e d ,

m an y smelling            of    intoxicants and shouting abuse at us, and                                instructing

    us to help        injured supporters.                It was      not apparent at this                  time what

    e xa c 1 1y had taken         p 1ace »

    Whilst     standing         in the    cordon      I saw numerous                people    being     carried on

    h oardings r by supporters,                it was apparent                that soiiie of the          people

    being     carried were dead.

After        several       officers       had shouted for us to help,                        I together       with

    other    officers       broke     from the        cordon and went                to the l~eppings t.ane

a rea       of the football            pitch.        On arrival          at    the     goal mouth       I saw

    numerous       people       laid motio n l e s s     and some         injured.           I went     on to a s s is t

a group of s u p p orters                to carry a male white                     supporter a p p r o x i m a t e l y 27

    years    to awaiting St.             Johns a m b u l a n c e m e n    near the N o t t i n g h a m Forest

    side    of the       football     ground.         I then returned to the Leppings                         Lane     end

    of the football             pitch to further assist.                      At    this   point the       ground

    began to       clear    of supporters.

    I then     re joined my serial,              and we were         instructed to walk with the

    fans    into    the    city     centre,      which we did.

After         completion of our duties                  I went     off duty at At t e r c l x f f e Police

S t a t i o n at 8pm that            same     day.

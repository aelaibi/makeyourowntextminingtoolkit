FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL:   SAFETY ISSUES - APPEALS

Mr Moynihan's response to Mr Lloyd's letter of 16 October is
attached.   The content is not entirely unexpected - as pointed
out in my note of 13 October. Because of the timing of the Bill,
resolution of this disagreement is now urgently required.

2.   Our advice remains unchanged. Responsibility for the Safety
of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) rests with the Home
Office.   Changes to it should, we believe, reflect Home Office
policy which, from the outset, has envisaged both consultation
and appeal provisions in order to ensure co-operation and
fairness in the relationship between the Football Licensing
Authority (FLA) and local authorities responsible for safety
certification.

3.   Whilst Magistrates 1 Courts may not be experts in technical
or safety issues they have had responsibilities under the 1975
Act since it was enacted.     Originally their role was to hear
applications from local authorities for orders restricting or
prohibiting the use of a particular ground in the event of a
serious risk, since January 1988 Magistrates' Courts have been
the appellate authority under the 1975 Act for appeals against
notices restricting or prohibiting the admission of spectators
to a sports ground as well as appeals in relation to safety
certificates. These changes were brought about by Part II of the
Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987.

4.   Magistrates' Courts have also for many years now been the
appellate authority for appeals under the Fire Precautions Act
1971. They also have an appellate function under entertainment
licensing.

5.   If, as suggested by DoE, there is "little risk" of the FLA
acting arbitrarily there should be no objection to building in
appeal rights against its directions.     Our experience, albeit
limited, under the 1975 Act and more generally under the FPA 1971
does not support the view that there would be a series of appeals
delaying implementation of decisions. Of course if the FLA were
to act unreasonably the situation might be different.

6.   If Ministers wish to maintain the present line (as we
believe they should) a draft reply for Mr Lloyd's signature is
within.  Government amendments are to be tabled at the end of
this week and it may therefore be necessary for Mr Lloyd to meet
Mr Moynihan or to speak with him tomorrow.

                 FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL:           SAFETY AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS -
                 APPEALS


                 Thank you      for your    letter of      16 October about appeal
                 rights    against        terms     and     conditions      in    safety
                 certificates where these arise from a requirement of the
                 Football Licensing Authority (FLA).


                 Both the Home Secretary and I certainly recognise and
                 understand your views.            Even so,       given our particular
                 responsibilities to protect the rights and liberties of
                 the individual, we do not believe that it would be right,
                 in effect,     to remove appeal rights from the Safety of
                 Sports   Ground    Act    1975     (the   1975    Act)   which   already
                 exist.


                 We accept of course the role of the FLA as a national
                 supervisory authority,           but although the composition of
                 the authority and its inspection teams will reflect the
                 disciplines      normally    consulted       by    local   authorities
                 themselves     when   they draw up        terms    and   conditions   in
                 safety certificates the difference is that it is those at
                 the    local     level     who     are     exercising      operational
                 responsibility.       We believe it must be right, therefore,
that    where       the     FLA     requires        new     terms .in       a    safety
certificate drawn up by a local authority after statutory
consultation,            the appeal rights under the 1975 Act of
those potentially affected should be preserved.                                      Since
the local authority retains powers to amend or re-issue
the    certificate          in     appropriate        circumstances             we    also
foresee       practical          difficulties         if    appeal     rights          are
retained       for       some    parts    of    certificates         and        not    for
others.


Magistrates' Courts have always had a role under the 1975
Act.     Originally this was to consider application from
local authorities for order under the emergency procedure
of the 1975 Act to restrict or prohibit the admission of
spectators          in    the    event     of   a    serious       risk     to       their
safety.        When        the    Act    was    amended       with    effect          from
1 January 1988, the courts became the appellate authority
not    only    for appeals           against        terms    and    conditions          in
safety        certificates               (or     omissions           from        safety
certificates) but also for appeals against the issue of
prohibition          or     restriction         notices       issued        by       local
authorities.             This brought the appeal provisions of the
1975 Act in line with those of the Fire Precautions Act
1971 which also provides for appeals to the Magistrates'
Court.        Our experience of the operation of both these
Acts does not lead us to believe that the provision of
appeal rights leads to unnecessary or untoward delay in
the implementation of decisions.


The court would adjudicate, in such a case, on the merits
of the expert arguments.                   It does not itself need to be
an expert organisation.


We     need    to        resolve    this       quickly      in     order        to    give
instructions to Parliamentary Counsel.                           If you still feel
unable to agree to our line perhaps we should meet or try
to resolve this on the telephone.

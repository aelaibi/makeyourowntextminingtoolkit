               (000085)          and    I worked as an unqual i f i e d Amb u l a n c e Woman between

               1985 August             1988   (000888),         when        I was made         up to q u alified Am b u l a n c e

              woman.



              3.         I joined the Amb u l a n c e           service as a cadet                    in 1983      (000083),           and

               served two years as a cadet,                          one year as an u n q u a l i f i e d A m b ulance

               w o m a n a ndf r o m       1988    (000088)         as a qua l i f i e d A m bulance w o m a n .              As a

               cadet       I wo r k e d at M o o r g a t e Rd Headquarters,                        m oving   to M i d d l e w o o d

               A m b u l a n c e S t a t i o n following            completion of my training and                         in November
1988     (001188)       I moved to L a n g l e y A m bulance Stat i o n where              1 am based.



4.     On S a t u r d a y   15th April       19S9    (150489)?     I was      returning       home   from a

trip to the City             centre.        I was    driving my      car along Pen i s t o n e Rrf

at a p pr ox im at el y      '1530 w he n    1 saw a mbulances        outside     the

H i l l s b o r o u gh football       ground.       I was diverted from Pe n i s t o n e Rd

into Harries Rd S and from there                      I continued my j o u r n e y .



5.     I was     due to      report     to Long l e y S t a t i o n at    1800 to work the           1800

to 0200 shift.              I decided at about           1645 that       I should      report    to the

station.        At this        stage    I was    not aware      of the s i tuation at

H i l l s b o r o u g h football      ground and having made             the decision to         report

for work?        I changed and drove             to the Station,         where    I arrived at

1730.       There was        one other       crew member       on station;

we were       contacted and were             told by control        that we were         not needed at

H i l l s b o rou g h a nd s h o u 1d s ta nd b y .



6•     At   1830 there was a call               to the station by control?               using a

t e 3.e phone , request i ng                  and    I to attend      the N o r t h e r n General

Hospital,       Ward 60 to transfer              patient     number 31       from that ward to the

CT Bean Unit at the Royal                   Ha l l a m s h i r e Hospital.              and    I left the

station and a rr i v e d at the N o r t h e r n G e n e r a 1 Hospital,               and a 1 1 e n d e d

War d 60 to          collect    the    patient.       We were     told by a staff          nurse     on ward

60    (female,       although      I do not       remember     her name)       that    there was      no

patient       on Ward 60 to transfer and she sent me                         to the    casualty

de par t m e n t .              and    I waited for quite a while               until    the    patient

arrived.         The    patient was         loaded and was        in a stable         condition and we

took    the    patient      to the Royal         Hallam s h i r e Hospital.           We handed      over

the    patient,        returned to our vehicle,              radioed      in to   control       that we

were    green,       and    control     ordered us to return to the N o r t h e r n General
                                                                                                                  P AGE.       3
                                                                                                                  S 3300

Hospital                and     collect    patient   number 39.          The    patient was           transferred

onto             our     cot and    into our     vehicle,       together with the doctor and                          nurse.



7.            As      I was the a t tendant at all             times    on this vehicle,              I radioed

control                using     channel    2 without     difficulty,          who    told us to go to the

                    and   I were    then told,         that    three    bodies were       ready to

be transported.             The Police and Stat i o n Officer Paul EASON                     co­

m o r t ua ry    in the gym n a s i u m onto         the ambulance.        Each body was

a c co mp an ie d    by a policeman throughout.                  W hen the     bodies and

policem en were           loaded onto       our vehicle,         we drove      to the Medico

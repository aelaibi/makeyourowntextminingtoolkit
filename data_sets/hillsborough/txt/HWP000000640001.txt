  Liverpool, L69 2DH.                                                           7 July 1994




   Dear Me Bounds,
   X have-b e e n asked by the Attorney General to thank you for your
   letter of 28 June 1994 and to reply on his behalf.              He
   recognises the strength of feeling of the families who have been
   so tragically bereaved and once again expresses M s sincere
   condolences to all of them.
   It must however be recognised that the role of the Attorney
   General in relation to this tragedy is confined to that provided
   by section 13 Of the Coroners Act 1988.    That provision enables
   an application to be made to the High Court on specified grounds
   by interested parties seeking that the High Court direct a fresh
   inguest.   The snaking of such an. application must be authorised
   by the Attorney General.     The question of any further public
   inquiry is not a matter for the Attorney General.
   Zt will also be recalled that there has already been an
   independent inquiry into the disaster by Sir Peter Taylor (as he
   then was), now the Lord Chief Justice, who was appointed by the
   Home Secretary.    Any question of a further independent inquiry
   is also a matter for the Bome secretary.        The relatives of
   several of - the victims did make a formal application to the
   Attorney General in 1992 .for his consent under section 13 of the
   1988 Act to an application to the Bigh court.    That application
   was carefully and sympathetically considered but the Attorney
   General concluded that this was not an appropriate case for
   consent.
   She Attorney General has made it clear in the context of the Cook
   Report that he would consider a renewed application if supported
   by significant cogent and fresh evidence in proper form.      But
   at present it seems likely that the material presented to the
   City of Liverpool Council as described at paragraph A of the
   minutes, is substantially- the same as that examined in 1992.
   Despite the press and media reports to the effect that fresh

     evidence is available, none has in fact been presented.
     In these circumstances the Attorney General must advise you that
     there is unlikely to be any further action he can properly take
     and he cannot therefore see that a meeting with a delegation of
     oity councillors in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster would
     be appropriate or serve any useful purpose*

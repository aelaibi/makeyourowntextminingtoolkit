                           SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF DR EASTWOOD

                                            RESUME


      The majority of the points raised in this submission are directed towards Dr
      Eastwood defending his position by asserting that everything   done by him was
      after full consultation and referral to the Officer Working Party.

      The following are of relevance to the South Yorkshire Police.

      Inspection and Testing of Crush Barriers   (paragraphs 8 - 1 4 )

      Surprisingly, little is said of collapsed barrier 124A other   than it had been
      tested and passed inspection and that the conclusion made is   that it  had been
      subjected to significantly greater crowd pressure than envisaged by the 1986
      Green Gu i d e .

      Radial Fences (paragraphs 27 to 33)

      The submission correctly points out that the introduction of radial fences and
      the resultant creation of pens was at the request of the Police following the
      problems experienced during the 1981 Semi-Final.   It is stated that "the
      proposal was logical and reasonable provided that the control (which it was
      the purpose of the scheme to introduce) was exercised".   However, there is a
      failure to amplify the point that at this time the area was used by home and
      away supporters and that .'control' in this sense was aimed at segregating the
      rival supporters and not control as to crowd capacities.

      Reference is made to the subsequent recommendations in the Green Guide
      regarding the introduction of radial fences and the creation of self-contained
      sections each with its own services.  Rather conceitedly it is stated at
      paragraph 29 that the 1985 scheme(s) prepared by Eastwoods would have achieved
      this ideal but were not proceeded with.  In truth, the scheme(s) were spawned
      by the Police (Inspector Calvert, day 30 page 34).

      At. paragraph 32, it is stated that "the raison d'etre for the introduction of
      radial fences was that there should be controlled filling of the pens which
      the radial fences created." This is wrong, the objective was segregation as
      previously described.

      The same paragraph gives the cause of the tragedy as failure to implement the
      system of controlled filling.  Repeatedly, this issue is being confused.   The
      control exercised in relation to the pens has always been in terms of
      segregation at league matches.  There has never been controlled filling in
      terms of crowd capacities at either league matches or semi-finals and this is
      a question which should properly be directed t o .the club.

      Removal of barrier 144 in 1986 (paragraphs 34 to 42)

      Again the removal of this barrier is quite correctly stated as being at the
      request of the Police and the reasons stated at paragraph 35 (viz (i) to
      remove the blockage caused on entry and (ii) to facilitate speedier
      evacuation) are accurate.
                                      -   2   -




 Alternatives are discussed and at paragraph 41 concludes that the decision to
 remove this barrier was "a rational decision in the interests of safety as
 well as the maintenance of order."  Indeed, the hypothesis is proferred at
 paragraph 42 that its retention would have resulted in casualties in the
 tunnel.

 The submission closes with a bold statement (paragraph 50) that the tragedy
 was caused by the admission of an uncontrolled flow of spectators into the
 central pens when they were already visibly full but makes no reference to the
 behaviour or intent of the spectators themselves.  (A common thread!)

1.   The criticisms put to Dr Eastwood come under five h e a d s : -



     (i)             Inspection and testing of crush barriers.

     (ii)            Height of crush barriers;

     (iii)           Arrangement        of     crush          barriers       (with    particular

                     reference to the removal of                       144);

     (iv)            Perimeter gates.

                     Capacity.



Role of E astwood & Partners

2.   Fo llowing       the    firm's     appointment             by the       Club in     December

     1978,    Dr Eastwood prepared plans                       for improving the safety

     of the ground and a report on ground capacity                                   (core bundle

     page     48).      These     were       submitted           to    the     Officer   Working

     Party.



3.   The     proposals       in   relation              to    the     West     and    North   West

     Terraces        were   approved      by       the       Officer     Working      Party   at a

     mee tin g with         representatives              of   the     Club     on 2 April     197 9

     (core bundle pages           69,    71} and were dul y implemented.




4.   Subsequently Eastwood & Partners



     (i)             Carried      out    an    annual          i n s p e cti on   and tests    and

                            Authority and to the Club.



          (ii)              Attended at the bi-ennial                           or annual            inspections

                            of the        ground by members                    of the Officer Working

                            Party;



          (ii i )           Acted       and    advised              on    be half         of    the     Club     in

                            relation to any other matters                            in w h i c h they were

                            instructed.



     5.   In     prep ari ng       the     1979         Scheme           and    in    giving          subsequent

          advice to the Club,                 Eastwood & Partners                    owed a duty to the

          public as well as to the Club,, but- they were not engineers

          to    the     Licensing Authority,                       nor wer e th e y responsible                  for

          the     way      in    whic h    the     Licensing              Authority            exercised        its

          st at u t o r y powers.



     6.   The    Licensing Authority acted t h r o u g h the Officer Working

»•        Party,          which     included            an         engineer          from       the.    Building

          Surveyors'            department,         to       whom         the    Licencing             A u th ori ty

          looked           for      advice          on             engineering              matters.            (For

          the    bi-ennial         or     annual        inspection              of    the      ground      by    the

     I n s p e c t i o n and Testing of Crush Barriers



     8.    Prior       to     the    1988/89             season           all       the     crush      barriers          were

           in s p e c t e d      (core bundle page 457).



     9.    The    two       spans        of     the barrier whi ch                        collapsed       on   15 April

           1989        (124A)       were           tested       and         their          perform anc e        recorded

           (core bundle page 466).

     10.   The    provisions               of      the     1986          Green        Guide,      Ann ex       C,    as    to

           t e s ti ng      are     ambiguous.                 On        Dr~ Eastwood's             interpretation,

           both spans passed.                       On the alternative interpretation,                                    one

           span p ass ed and the other required a retest,                                                although its

           r ec ove ry on the third application load was                                            100%.



     11.   Whether          or     not        it    accorded              with        the    intentions             of    the

           draftsman,               Dr        Eastwood's                 i n t e r p re tat ion        of      the       test

           requirements              of       the        Green           Guide        was     reasonable            and    in

     12.   If    the     alternative               interpretation had                       been applied,            there

           is    an    overwhelming probability                                 that       the    span      requir ing       a

           Ea st w o o d      in    his       evidence.                  His    evidence          is   re inf orc ed by

           the     fact       that         in      all     46       cases        in       which     the      figure       " 0"

      s u b se que nt test        (core bundle pages 464-471).



13.   Dr    Eastwood's           tests    of     the    two       barriers         (128      and     137)

      w hi ch     suffered        permanent          deformation          on     15    April       showed

      that      the w eak er did not start to d e f o r m p las tic all y until

      s ub jec ted to a load of approx.                      7. 5KN/metre,            i.e.    1.5 times

      the       d es ign    load     and       1. 25    times          the     test     load.           (Dr

      Eastwood's           statement,      paras.       109 to          112).       Those barriers

      were in p e n 4.            It is probable that the crush pressure, in

      p en 3 was even greater.



14.   Dr Eas two od        concluded that the b a r rie r whi ch collapsed on

      15      April        did     so     because           it     was         subjected           to    a

      si gni f i c a n t l y greater crowd pressure                      than is en visaged in

      the        1986      Green        Guide.              (Dr        Eastwood's            statement,

      para. 113).          This conclusion has not be e n challenged.

17.   The    Gr e e n     Guide          recognised                 that     although             new       work        or

      re co n s t r u c t i o n     at      football                grounds          should not             be    to     a

      st and ard        lower        than        that          set    out       in    the       guidelines,             in

      asses sin g         whether         existing situations                         p rov ide d ade quately

      for    the      safety        of    spectators                 the    criterion was               that          of a

      reasonable           degree         of      safety.              ( 1976         edition          para,          1.5;

      No    uniform        height           of    crush             barrier          will       suit     everyone.

      Adopting          the    criterion of                    a reasonable               degree       of    safety,

      the     he ight         of    the     pre-1979                 crush      barriers           on       the       West

      Terrace was             no less          safe than that of the post-1979                                    crush

      barriers.           The former may indeed be preferable,                                          especially

      if    the       height        is    to     be       measured          from          the    nosing          of    the

      step     b ehi nd       the    barrier              (as in the G r e e n Guide),                       for the

      reasons given by Dr Eastwood (day 27,                                          pages       61 - 63).



19.   The    Officer          W o r kin g      Party considered                  the        height          of    the

      65,     66)       and        subsequently                 approved             Dr    Eastwood's             plans

      w i t ho ut       requiring           the           height           of        the        existing          crush

      barriers         to be raised.



20.   It    has     not    bee n         suggested              that       the       height       o f ' the       crush

A r r a n g eme nt of Crush Barriers on the West Terrace

21.   Dr    Eastwood's             original          arrangement             is       shown       on    drawing

      11427/7.



22.   The    horizontal            spacing           was       closer    than          the       Gre en      Guide

      required.           The gradient of the terrace was                                  modest and the

      distance          from        front        to        back     relatively                short.            All

      barriers          were       brought       up       to     category         A    standard. ’            These

      were     "plus"          factors.              On    the     "minus"            side       the    existing

      terrace       had       no    gangways,             and Dr Eastwood                 considered           that

      the    i n tro duc tio n           of     gangways          on     that         terrace          would     be

      unsafe       and/or          impractical             for     reasons            wh i c h    he     gave    in

      evidence.          His arrangement closed the gaps betwe en certain

      crush       barriers,           but       left        certain          other         gaps        to     allow

      movement.           In       his    interim          report        (core         bundle          pages    36,

      40-41)       Dr    Eastwood d r e w attention to the p oss ib i l i t y that

      some of the barriers                    close to the exits might restrict the

      pass age of spectators unreasonably                                (as subsequently proved

      to be the case).                   He also dre w attention to the absence of

      gangways          and    recommended                that    capacity            should       be       reduced

      on    that    account          by       10%.         This    was       a rea sonable              approach

      and    accorded           with       the       criterion           of       the      code,        viz.      to

      prov ide a reasonable degree of safety.



23.   Dr    Eastwood's             plans       and    report        on       ground        capacity            (core

      bundle       page       48)    were        considered             by    the        Officer          Working

      Party        at., two          meetings              at     wh ich . the             Club         and     its

      representatives were not present                              (12 Feb ruary and 30 March

      1979    -    core       bundle          pages       57 and       65)    and        at      two    meetings
be t wee n     the       Officer     Working      Party    and       representatives             of

the Club including Dr Eastwood                      (2 and 18 April               1979 - core

bundle        pages        69     and    74).      The     Officer          Working        Party

conclu ded          that    it would       be unreasonable             to insist          on the

pro v i s i o n     of     gangways      or     additional          exits        (core    bundle

pages     57      and     60)    and the plans          for the West             Terrace were

approved.



The    subsequent           alterations         to the     barrier          arrangement          on

the    West         Terrace        are   shown     on    drawi ng       1142 4/8.              They

comprised:



(a)     the       introduction of radial                barriers,       two in 1981             and

        two in           1985,    coupled w ith the removal                 in    1985 of two

        sections           of     rail     from    what       wo uld     otherwise             have

        become        one continuous            barrier across          the whole width

        of pen 3;



(b)     the removal of barrier 144 in 1986.



These alterations                 arose from requests by the Police,                       based

on problems, which they were encountering,                              and received the

approval          of the Officer Working Party and au tho ris ati on of

the    Licens ing          Authority.           Eastwood        &    Partners           were    not

authors        of    the proposals            but did     not       oppose       them    (in the

w ay   that         Dr     Eastwood      opposed,       for     example,          the     Police

request        to    have        a clear   strip    from        front    to      back     of    the

terr ace on either side of each radial barrier:                                   core bundle

page    169).
2 6   Although          the        Police      were       not    engineers,           their       views        were

      entitled           to    considerable                respect        in     matters           concerning

      their experience of crowd control and maintenance of order

      at the ground.



Radial Fences

27.   Prior    to        the       i ntr oduction          of    radial        fences,           the    terrace

      was     "open           plan"          and     the        policy        wit h    regard            to     the

      d i s t r i b u t i o n of spectators was one of laissez                                  faire.         This

      failed        to    w ork         at    the    Tottenham          Hotspur        v    Wolverha mpt on

      Wanderers          semi-final in 1981 when crushing occurred at the

      corners.                The       Police       diagnosis           of     the        cause        was     the

      refusal of fans to move                        (core bundle page                138,        139).        They

      pr opo s e d      as     a remedy the introduction of radial                                     fences    in

      order        to    divide          the        terrace       into        three     sections,              each

      served        by    its       own       entrance,          and    so     allow        a    more     active

      s y s t e m of control of spectators.                            Eastwood & Partners were

      i n s t r uct ed        to    prepare          the    necessary           plans           (core     bundle

  -’- page     145)          and     the      proposal          was    approved        by        the     Officer

      W o r k ing    Party          (core      bundle       page       153).          The       proposal        was

      logical        and       reasonable,               provided      that      the       control        (which

      it     was        the        purpose          of     the    scheme         to     introduce)              was

      exercised.               Radial          fences       were       also     recommended               by    the

      Green         Guide          ( 1976       edition,          para.        18.1;            1986     edition

      para. 206).'                 Conversely              if    the ' Club           had         refused        to

      i n t rod uce .radial fences                   and a re petition of the 1981 s e m i ­

      final     had       occurred,            they would             then     have    been        criticised

      for     failing              to        introduce          radial        fences        despite            past
experience,               the    requests          by    the       Police,         the    approval        of

the    Officer            Working       Party       and the          recommendations               of    the

Green Guide.



The same paragraph                     of the Green Guide stated that ideally

each sect ion should be self-contained and serviced by its

own      entrance/exit,                 refreshment             facilities               and     toilets.

This     ideal        would       have been achieved by the                         1985 scheme(s)

p re pared           by     Eastwood          &     Partners,             but      which         did     not

proceed.



At    the    same time as the                   1985 scheme was                 under discussion,

the     Police            with    the     support        of        the    Licensing            A u th ori ty

w is hed      to      extend           the    system          of     radial         fences        by     the

co n str uct ion of two new fences,                           which woul d           (a) divide the

central        pen         into     two      (pens       3     and       4)   and        (b)    create     a

buffer zone between                     pens 4 and 5.               The Club was now in                  the

first       d ivi sio n          and      the      Police       were experiencing                  fairly

large       crowds          (Inspector Calvert,                    day 30       page       20).          The

su g g e s t i o n    of    a    further          radial      fence       dividing p e n           5 into

two     (core        bundle        page      235       para.       (c ) ) was        opposed        by    Dr

E as twood       because          he    saw       no    sufficient            reason       for     it    and

the    idea      was       dropped.             There were,           however,           sensible        and

logical         reasons           for     the      introduction               of    the        other     two

radial       fences.             The    reasons         for the buffer               zone were           set

out in Dr Eastwood's                    letter to the Club dated 17 June                                1985

(core       bundle          page       252).       The       radial       fence      dividi ng           the

central        p en into two was                  intended to enable the di ve r s i o n

of    spectators             into       either         half    and       so   permit           c ont rolled

and     cons were weighed is to be found,                                    for example,            in the

approved their i ntr oduction in 1981                                  (core bundle page               153)

and     in     Dr    Eastwood's            letter           to    the     Licensing            Authority

dated 26 January 1982                     (core bundle page                   169).



The     raison       d'etre         for     the       introduction              of    radial         fences

was     that       there      should       be     controlled              filling       of      the    pens

wh ich       the    radial        fences         created.              The    method       of    control

was d escribed by I n s pec tor Calvert                             (day 30 pages' 20C,                26C,

30B).         It     was    not      as    good        as    the       scheme        proposed         by    Dr

Eastwood in           1985.          However,          it was believe d by the Police

to    be,     and was,         viable           so long as the intended method of

control        was    exercised.                 Dr Eastwood             held the same belief

and     no    problems         were       brought           to    his     attention            after       the

i n t rod uct ion        of    the        radial           fences      apart     from          the    local

blockage           caused by bar rie r                144.        The cause of the tragedy

on    15     April       1989     was      not        that       the     system       of    controlled

filling was           not      viable,          but        that    it was       not implemented.

No    attempt        was      made    to monitor the                     filing of the           central

pens,       and Gate C was            o pened.when they were already v isibly

full.



If    there        had     been      no    radial           fences        but   Gate       C    had    been


                                            -    11    -
      opened         without        first     closing               the    central         tunnel,        it    is

      difficult to see how a tragedy of the same kind would have

      b een      averted       (especially            in       view        of   the    1981       incident).

      The div ision of the terrace into pens pro vided a means                                                 for

      p r e v en tin g such a disaster;                   it was not used.



Removal of Barrier 144 in 1986

34.   In      his       initial       report         to        the        Club,       Dr        Eastwood       had

      foreseen          the    possibility            that          central          barriers          close    to

      the        exits        might      restrict              the        passage          of     spectators

      u n r eas ona bly       and     require        to        be    removed         (core       bundle       page

      36,     40).       To retain a barrier which caused blockage of the

      central            e n t r a n c e / exit           would             conflict              with         the

      recommendations               of    the        Green          Guide       as     to       ingress        and

      egress        (1986 edition,            Chapters              5 and 6).



35.   The     reasons         for the Police request                       for the removal of two

      spans       of    barrier       144     were        given       in evidence by Inspector

      C alvert         (day 30 pages          21-3,       51-3,           56-60).      They considered

      it    to    be    a matter         of   safety           as    well       as    convenience.              In

      summary:

      (i)     There were repeated complaints                               by the Police Officers

                 that     the       barrier           was           causing          blockage           of     the

               entrance,         despite         attempts            to     make      spectators             move.

                 This led to a build-up back up the tunnel,                                       ill temper

               and disorderly behaviour.

               N. B.     Similar      blockage            had,        acco rdi ng          to    the    Police,

                         been the cause of the c rushing in the 1981 s e m i ­

                         final.          (Core       bundle pages               138,       139.    Inspector

                       Calvert,    day 30,           page 57c).



      (ii) The        Police      feared        that       in     the    event           of    emergency

              evacuation        the   barrier             would      prevent        access       to     the

              tunnel.         (Inspector         Calvert's            end     of        season    report

              dated 11 June 1986).



36.   The p r o bl em was discussed at the meeting on 7 August                                        1986,

      incl udi ng      the     possible         effects          of     the        removal       of     the

      barr ier        (Inspector      Calvert,            day     30,    page           249)    and     the

      po ssi bil ity     of    moving    other            barriers       (Inspector             Calvert,

      day    30,     pages    24A and       61G-62A).                In the        end    the    Officer

      W o r k ing    Party    approved          and       Mr    Bownes        on    behal.f      of     the

      Licensing Auth ori ty authorised the removal of the barrier.



37.   The   sug ges tio n      that   the       removal         of    barrier           144 created       a

      diagonal        route towards         barrier            124A is incorrect.                 Such a

      route already existed.



38.   It is     not clear whether it is suggested that the response

      to    the      Police    request          for       the    removal           of    barr ier       144

      s h o u l d have been

      (i)     to do nothing.          This would have been irresponsible.

      (ii) to        re-site    the     barrier.                This     was       considered           and

              rejected for good reasons.

      (iii)         to take some other course.                    No specific suggestions

      were put to Dr Eastwood.



39.   In any        event,    once the Officer Working Party approved and


                                            -   13    -
       the     Licensing          Authority          authorised            the    removal       of      the

       barrier       as    requested       by     the       Police,        the    Club    would        have

       been     open      to   criticism         if    they     had    not        carried       out     the

       work.



40.    The tragedy on 15 April                  1989 was not caused by the removal

       of    b arrier      144,    but    by the        admission of spectators                   at an

       unco ntrolled *rate            into       pens       which     were        already       visibly

       full.



41.    On the       assumption that the inflow of spectators                               was to be

       controlled         by      turnstiles          and    that     the        pens    were     to     be

       closed whe n full,           the d ecision to remove barrier 144 was a

       rational       decision       in    the       interests        of     safety       as   well      as

       the maintenance of order.



42.    On     the   other      hand,       if    spectators           were        admitted        at     an

       unco ntrolled rate into pens                    already full^it may be that                        a

       different          configuration          of     barriers           might        have    altered

       pr ess ure      point(s),         but    no     configur ati on           could     have       been

       expected to prevent severe crushing somewhere.                                     If barrier

       144    had    st^Lll    been      in     place,       many     of    the    casualties           may

       have    been       in the     tunnel and there would                      have    been strong

       critic ism         of the failure         to     remove      barrier         144.          (Dr

       Eastwood,          day 28,        pages 66H-67A.             Inspector           Calvert,       day

       30,    page 61F).



Perimeter Gates

4 3.   Dr Eastwood deals with this subject in paragraphs                                       5 3 to 61
      of his statement.              See also his evidence,                    day 27,       pages       58

      and 59,      and drawing 11424/5.



44.   In summary,        the primary evacuation route                          from pens          3 and 4

      was    through the tunnel               and allowed ev acuation well wi thin

      the    time prescribed by the code.                          The perime ter gates               and

      the gates in the radial fences pro vid ed a secondary escape

      route    which would           enable        the pens           to be    evacuated within

      the     prescribed        time,         as     well        as     allowing          access      for

      security.          The width       of the peri met er                  gates   was     a matter

      considered         and     determined              by     the      Licensing          Authority

      through        the       Officer        Working            Party:             Dr     Eastwood's

      statement paragraphs              58 and 59.              Past experience had shown

      them    to   be    satisfactory          (Inspector              Calvert,      day     30,    page

      18).      However,        they    were        not       d esi gne d     or   intended        for    a

      si t uat ion      in   which     there * was            such     gross       overcrowding          of

      the pens as to make movement impossible.



Ca pacity

45.   In his initial report to the Club                           (core bundle page 36) Dr

      Ea stwood       described         the        way     in     which        the       Gre en     Guide

      calc ulated spectator             capacity.               In     the    report      and in his

      further report           (core bundle page 48)                    he suggested capacity

      figures      and set out his reasoning.



46.   The    Licensing Authority through the                           Off ice r Working            Party

      cons idered..Dr          Eastwood's          report         and •exercised •th e i r            own

      judgment.          The    number        of    spectators           c ertified         for     Spion

      Kop    was     16,850     (core    bundle           page        117),    compared       with       Dr
Eastwood's           suggested            figure          of    16,000        (core       bundle       page

56).



Subsequently                 when        radial        fences            were       introduced            Dr

Ea s twood        and    Mr    Strange          pointed          out     to    the       Club    and    the

Licen s i n g Authority that the removal                               of barrier w o ul d mean

a     loss     of    capacity            calculated             by the    code.            See     core

bundle       pages" 160,            162,       169.        Unknown        to       Dr    Eastwood       the

Police       expressed the view to the L icensing Authority that

there       was     no need         to reduce             the    c ertified         capacity          (core

bundle page          165).



Similarly,          in       relation          to    the       removal        of    barrier       144     Dr

Eastwood's          evidence         was        that       Mr    Strange           reported      to     him

after       the     meeting         on    7 August             1986    that        the    question       of

the    effect       on       capacity was             considered          and       a similar          view

expr e s s e d by the Police                   (day 27,         page     54f).



The    d e ci s i o n whether            to reduce the certified capacity and

if    so     by how much was               not       the r e sp o n s i b il i t y        of    the    Club

or     its        engineers,             and        they       were      not        privy        to     the

discussions             of    the    Officer           Working         Party on           the    subject

except at ground inspections.



On    the     day in question,                  the opening            of Gate           C meant       that

there       was     no   way    of       limiting          the    number           on    the    West    and

North       West    Terraces         to the certified' figure w h a t e v er that

figure       might       have       been.            In    the     event,          the     Health       and

INTRODUCTION


1.   The criticisms put to Dr Eastwood come under five heads: -



     (i)             Inspection and testing of crush barriers.

     (ii)            Height of crush barriers;

     (iii)           Arrangement         of    crush       barriers      (with    particular

                     reference to the removal of 144);

     (iv)            Perimeter gates.

     (v)             Capacity.



Role of Eastwood & Partners

2.   Following        the    firm's      appointment         by the      Club in    December

     1978,    Dr Eastwood prepared plans                     for improving the safety

     of the ground and a report on ground capacity                               (core bundle

     page     48).      These     were        submitted      to    the    Officer    Working

     Party.



3.   The     proposals       in   relation        to       the    West    and     North    West

     Terraces        were    approved by        the    Officer Working            Party at a

     meeting with           representatives           of    the   Club    on    2 April    1979

     (core bundle pages           6 9,    71) and were duly implemented.




4.   Subsequently Eastwood & Partners



     (i)             Carried      out     an   annual       inspection         and tests    and
               reported            on the     results          to     the       Licensing

               Authority and to the Club.



(ii)           Attended      at the bi-ennial            or annual         inspections

               of the ground by members                  of the Officer Working

               Party;



(iii)          Acted     and    advised      on    behalf        of      the    Club     in

               relation to any other matters in w h i c h they were

               instructed.



In     preparing       the      1979 Scheme        and    in    giving         subsequent

advice to       the Club,Eastwood & Partners                   owed a duty to the

public as       well as to the Club,           but they were not engineers

to the       Licensing Authority,           nor were they responsible                    for

the    way    in     which   the    Licensing       Authority            exercised      its

statutory powers.



The    Licensing Authority acted through the Officer Working

Party,       which     included       an     engineer          from      the     Building

Surveyors'         department,        to    whom    the    Licencing           Authority

looked         for     advice         on    engineering               matters.          (For

confirmation see the evidence of Mr Bownes:                              day 29,    pages

63C,    70 - 71,      91 - 92,     121 - 122)




Eastwood       &     Partners      were     not     members         of    the     Officer

W orking     Party and did not attend its meetings                          (other than

the    bi-ennial       or    annual    inspection         of    the      ground    by    the
      members of the Officer Working Party).



I n s pe c t i o n and Testing of Crush Barriers



8.    Prior      to    the    1988/89             season       all    the       crush    barriers         were

      inspected            (core bundle page 457).



9.    The    two      spans       of    the barrier which                  collapsed on          15 April

      1989       (124A)       were          tested       and       their       performance        recorded

       (core bundle page 4 66).



10.   The    provisions            of       the    1986       Green       Guide,       Annex    C,     as    to

      testing         are     ambiguous.                On    Dr     Eastwood's         interpretation,

      both spans passed.                     On the alternative interpretation,                              one

      span passed            and the other required a retest,                              although its

      recovery on the third application load was                                        100%.


                                                    I

11.   Whether         or    not        it    accorded          with       the    intentions          of     the

      draftsman,             Dr        Eastwood's             interpretation             of      the        test

      requirements             of       the       Green       Guide       was     reasonable          and     in

      accordance            with        the       practice           of    a    responsible          body     of

      engineers              (cf.           Bolam        v     Friern           Hospital        Management

      Committee            1957    1WLR 582).



12.   If    the alternative                 interpretation had been applied,                           there

      is    an     overwhelming              probability             that      the   span requiring               a

      retest          would       have       passed          for     the       reasons     given       by     Dr

      Eastwood         in     his      evidence.              His     evidence is         reinforced by

      the     fact         that     in      all     46       cases    in       which    the     figure       " 0"
      appears      in the test results in the u/load column for test

      1 or test 2, it also appears in the u/load column for each

      subsequent test          (core bundle pages                 464-471).



13.   Dr    Eastwood's        tests     of     the      two       barriers          (128    and     137)

      which    suffered       permanent            deformation           on    15    April     showed

      that    the weaker did not start to deform plastically until

      subjected to a load of approx.                        7. 5KN/metre,        i.e.       1. 5 times

      the     design     loa d    and        1.25      times        the       test    load.          (Dr

      Eastwood's       statement,        paras.         109 to         112).     Those barriers

      were in pen 4.           It is probable that the crush pressure in

      pen 3 was even greater.



14.   Dr Eastwood concluded that the                        barrier which collapsed                   on

      15     April      did      so     because             it    was      subjected           to      a

      significantly greater crowd pressure                             than is envisaged in

      the     1986      Green         Guide.             (Dr      Eastwood's           statement,

      para. 113).       This conclusion has not been challenged.



Height of Crush Barriers



15.   The    crush    barriers        designed         by    Dr     Eastwood         complied       with

      the Green Guide's           recommendations                 as to height.             The pre-

      1979    crush     barriers        on   the       West      and    North        West    Terraces

      were lower.



16.   Where    a     crush    barrier        was       significantly            lower       than     the

      m inimum       height    recommended             in     the      Green     Guide,       it     was
                                                   ©


      removed or modified              (core bundle pages                 98 and 121,         122).
The    Green        Guide       recognised             that      although new             wor k        or

reconstruction             at    football grounds               should           not      be    to      a

standard       lower       than        that      set    out     in    the      guidelines,             in

assessing whether                existing situations                 provided        adequately

for    the    safety       of    spectators            the    criterion was            that         of a

reasonable          degree       of     safety.           ( 1976      edition        para,          1.5;

1986 edition para. 8).



No    uniform        height       of    crush       barrier          will     suit     everyone.

Adopt i n g    the     criterion            of   a reasonable           degree       of    safety,

the    height        of    the    pre-1979             crush     barriers on              the       West

Terrace was          no less safe than that of the post-1979                                   crush

barriers.           The former may indeed be preferable,                             especially

if    the     height      is     to    be     measured        from      the    nosing          of    the

step    behind       the barrier              (as in the Green Guide),                     for the

reasons given by Dr Eastwood                        (day 27,         pages     61 - 63).



The    Officer        Working          Party       considered           the    height          of     the

pre-1979        crush barriers                on the West          Terrace       (core         bundle

65,    66)      and       subsequently approved                    Dr    Eastwood's             plans

w ithout        requiring             the        height       of the          existing          crush

barriers to be raised.



It    has     not    been       suggested that            the      height       o f ' the       crush

barriers has any relevance to the events of 15 April                                                1989.
A r rangement of Crush Barriers on the West Terrace

21.    Dr    Eastwood's           original           arrangement                is    shown        on     drawing

       11427/7.



22 .   The     horizontal          spacing          was        closer       than           the    Green        Guide

       required.           The gradient of the terrace was                                  modest and the

       distance           from     front        to        back        relatively                 short.          All

       barriers       were       brought        up       to    category          A     standard.               These

       were     "plus"       factors.               On    the     "minus"             side       the     existing

       terrace       had     no gangways,                and Dr       Eastwood             considered            that

       the     introduction             of    gangways            on       that       terrace           would      be

       unsafe       and/or        impractical              for    reasons             which        he     gave     in

       evidence.          His arrangement closed the gaps between certain

       crush        barriers,       but        left        certain           other          gaps        to     allow

       movement.            In    his    interim           report          (core       bundle          pages      3 6,

       40-41)       Dr Eastwood drew attention to the possibility that

       some of the barriers close to the exits might restrict the

       passage of spectators unreasonably                                  (as subsequently proved

       to be the case).                 He also drew attention to the absence of

       gangways       and        recommended             that    capacity             should        be    reduced

       on    that     account       by       10%.         This    was       a reasonable                 approach

       and     accorded          with     the        criterion             of        the    code,         viz.     to

       provide a reasonable degree of safety.



23.    Dr    Eastwood's           plans       and        report       on    ground           capacity          (core

       bundle       page     48)    were        considered             by       the        Officer        Working

       Party         at     two     meetings              at     which           the        Club         and      its

       representatives were not present                               (12 February and 30 March

       197 9    -    core    bundle pages                 57    and    65)       and       at     two    meetings

      bundle     pages          69     and    74).          The     Officer         Working    Party

      concluded          that    it would           be   unreasonable          to insist on the

      p r ovision        of     gangways      or         additional         exits     (core   bundle

      pages    57     and      60)    and the plans              for the West         Terrace were

      approved.



24.   The    subsequent          alterations             to the     barrier         arrangement    on

      the     West       Terrace        are   shown         on    drawing       11424/8.         They

      comprised:



      (a)     the introduction of radial                         barriers,      two in       1981 and

              two in          1985,    coupled with the removal in                     1985 of two

              sections          of     rail         from    what       would    otherwise        have

              become       one       continuous          barrier across         the whole width

              of pen 3;



      (b)     the removal of barrier 144 in 1986.



25.   These alterations arose from requests by the Police,                                      based

      on problems which they were encountering,                                and received the

      approval of the Officer Working Party and authorisation of

      the    Licensing           Authority.              Eastwood       &    Partners     were    not

      authors       of    the proposals              but did not            oppose    them    (in the

      way     that       Dr    Eastwood       opposed,           for    example,       the     Police

      request       to    have        a clear       strip    from      front    to    back of     the

      terrace on either side of each radial barrier:                                   core bundle

      entitled              to        considerable           respect        in     matters         concerning

Radial Fences

27.   Prior      to         the       introduction           of     radial       fences,         the    terrace

      was      11open            plan"          and    the        policy        with       regard        to     the

      d i s tr ibution of spectators was one of laissez                                          faire.        This

      failed           to    wor k         at   the    Tottenham          Hotspur        v Wolverhampton

      Wanderers semi-final in 1981 w hen crushing occurred at the

      corners.                   The       Police      diagnosis           of     the      cause        was     the

      refusal of fans to move                          (core bundle page                13 8,     139).        They

      proposed          as        a remedy the introduction of radial                                  fences in

      order        to       divide          the       terrace       into       three       sections,           each

      served       by        its       own      entrance,          and    so     allow        a more      active

      system of control of spectators.                                    Eastwood & Partners were

      instructed                 to    prepare         the        necessary       plans         (core     bundle

      page      145)         and        the     proposal          was     approved         by    the     Officer

      Working           Party          (core      bundle      page        153).         The     proposal        was

      logical           and       reasonable,              provided       that     the      control       (which

      it     was        the           purpose         of     the     scheme        to      introduce)           was

      exercised.                  Radial         fences       were        also     recommended            by    the

      Green        Guide              (1976       edition,          para.         18. 1;        1986     edition

      p a r a . 206).                 Conversely             if     the     Club        had       refused        to

      introduce radial fences and a repetition of the 1981 s e m i ­

      final      had         occurred,            they would            then have          been    criticised

      for      failing                to    introduce             radial        fences          despite        past
experience,           the    requests          by    the        Police,        the    approval           of

the    Officer        Working       Party       and       the    recommendations                  of    the

G r e en Guide.



The    same paragraph of the Green Guide stated that ideally

each section should be self-contained and serviced by its

own     entrance/exit,              refreshment             facilities               and     toilets.

This    ideal     would have been achieved by the                                1985 scheme(s)

p repared        by     Eastwood          &     Partners,             but       which        did        not

proceed.



At    the same time as the                   1985 scheme was under discussion,

the    Police         with    the     support         of       the     Licensing            Authority

wished      to      extend         the       system       of     radial         fences            by    the

construction of two new fences,                           which would            (a) divide the

central       pen      into     two      (pens        3    and       4)   and        (b)     create       a

buffer zone between                 pens 4 and 5.                The Club was now in the

first     division           and      the       Police          were experiencing                  fairly

large     crowds        (Inspector             Calvert,          day 30        page        20).         The

suggestion        of    a further             radial       fence       dividing pen               5 into

two    (core     bundle        page      235       para.        (c))      was    opposed           by    Dr

Eastwood       because        he    saw       no    sufficient            reason       for        it    and

the    idea    was     dropped.              There    were,       however,           sensible           and

logical       reasons         for     the      introduction               of    the        other        two

radial     fences.           The    reasons          for the buffer zone were set

out in Dr Eastwood's letter to the Club dated 17 June                                                  1985

(core     bundle        page        252).           The    radial fence              dividing           the

central       p en into two was intended to enable the diversion

of    spectators         into       either         half    and       so   permit           controlled

filling        (core       bundle         page     235      para,       (b)    and     evidence           of

Inspector Calvert,                  day 30 page 60).



The     advantages            and    disadvantages                of    the    radial          barriers

i nvolved          a balancing            exercise.             Evidence       that       their pros

and cons were w eighed is to be found,                                      for example,            in the

minutes       of the meeting of the Officer Working Party which

approved their introduction in 1981                                   (core bundle page               153)

and     in    Dr     Eastwood's            letter          to   the     Licensing             Authority

dated 26 January 1982                     (core bundle page                  169).



The     raison       d' etre        for     the       introduction            of     radial         fences

was    that        there      should       be     controlled            filling       of       the    pens

which        the    radial      fences          created.              The    method       of    control

was described by Inspector Calvert                                (day 30 pages               20C,    26C,

3OB).         It    was    not       as    good       as    the       scheme       proposed          by   Dr

Eastwood in           1985.         However,          it was believed by the Police

to    be,     and was,         viable so long as the intended method of

control        was    exercised.             Dr Eastwood               held the same                belief

and     no    problems         were       brought          to    his    attention             after       the

introduction             of    the        radial       fences          apart       from       the    local

blockage           caused by barrier               144.         The cause of the tragedy

on    15     April       198 9 was         not     that         the    system        of    controlled

filling was           not      viable,          but    that       it was       not implemented.

No    attempt        was      made    to monitor the                   filing of the            central

pens,       and Gate C was opened wh e n they were already visibly

full.



If    there        had     been      no    radial          fences       but    Gate       C    had    been
      opened       without           first   closing           the    central        tunnel,       it    is

      difficult to see how a tragedy of the same kind would have

      been       averted       (especially          in    view       of   the       1981    incident).

      The division of the terrace into pens provided a                                        means for

      p re v enting such a disaster; it was not used.



Removal of Barrier 144 in 1986

34.   In     his        initial       report       to     the        Club,      Dr       Eastwood       had

      foreseen          the    possibility          that       central         barriers       close      to

      the        exits        might       restrict        the        passage         of     spectators

      unreasonably             and    require      to     be    removed        (core bundle           page

      36,    40).        To retain a barrier which caused blockage of the

      central            entrance/exit                  would          conflict             with        the

      recommendations                of    the     Green        Guide     as        to    ingress       and

      egress       (1986 edition,            Chapters          5 and 6).



3 5. The    reasons        for the Police request                     for the removal            of     two

      spans       of    barrier        144 were given in evidence                         by Inspector

      Calvert          (day 30 pages         21-3,       51-3,       56-60).        They considered

      it    to     be    a matter         of safety        as well        as    convenience.             In

      summary:

      (i)     There were repeated complaints by the Police Officers

              that        the         barrier       was        causing         blockage          of     the

                 entrance,       despite          attempts       to    make     spectators            move.

              This led to a build-up back up the tunnel,                                    ill temper

                 and disorderly behaviour.

              N. B.      Similar       blockage         had,     according           to    the   Police,

                         been the cause of the crushing in the                               1981 s e m i ­

                         final.           (Core    bundle       pages        138,    139.     Inspector
              Calvert,       day 30, page 57c).



(ii) The      Police     feared        that    in     the     event         of     emergency

        evacuation      the    barrier        would       prevent       access       to     the

        tunnel.        (Inspector       Calvert's          end    of     season       report

        dated 11 June        1986).



The problem was discussed at the meeting on 7 August                                      198 6,

including      the     possible        effects        of    the        removal       of     the

barrier      (Inspector        Calvert,        day    30,     page          249)    and     the

p ossibility      of   moving       other     barriers        (Inspector            Calvert,

day   30,    pages     24A    and    61G-62A).         In the          end the       Officer

Working      Party     approved       and     Mr     Bownes       on    behalf       of     the

Licensing Auth o ri t y authorised the removal of the barrier.



The   suggestion       that    the     removal       of    barrier          144 created a

diagonal      route towards          barrier       124A is incorrect.                 Such a

route already existed.



It is    not clear whether it is suggested that the response

to    the    Police     request       for     the     removal          of    barrier        144

should have been

(i)     to do nothing.         This would have been irresponsible.

(ii) to      re-site     the        barrier.         This     was       considered          and

        rejected for good reasons.

(iii)       to take some other course.                    No specific suggestions

were put to Dr Eastwood.



In any event,          once the Officer Working Party approved and
      the     Licensing          Authority             authorised the removal                of    the

      barrier       as    requested        by         the    Police, the Club         would       have

      b een    open      to    criticism         if    they    had        not carried       out    the

      work.



40.   The tragedy on 15 April                   1989 was not caused by the removal

      of barrier          144,    but      by the admission of spectators                     at an

      u ncontrolled            rate     into     pens       which    were        already    visibly

      full.



41.   On the        assumption that the inflow of spectators was to be

      controlled          by     turnstiles           and    that    the     pens    were     to    be

      closed w h e n full,            the decision to remove barrier 144 was a

      rational        decision        in   the       interests       of    safety     as    well    as

      the maintenance of order.



42.   On    the     other        hand,     if    spectators          were        admitted     at    an

      uncontrolled rate into pens already full^it may be that                                        a

      different          configuration                of    barriers might          have    altered

      pressure        point(s),          but    no     configuration         could     have       been

      expected to prevent severe crushing somewhere.                                   If barrier

      144     had    still       been    in     place,      many of        the    casualties       may

      have     been      in the       tunnel     and there would have been strong

      criticism          of    the      failure        to    remove       barrier     144.         (Dr

      Eastwood,          day    28,   pages      66H-67A.           Inspector       Calvert,       day

      30,     page 61F).



P erimeter Gates

43.   Dr Eastwood deals with this subject in paragraphs                                    53 to 61
     of his statement.             See also his evidence,                  day 27, pages         58

     and 59,      and drawing 11424/5.



     In summary,      the primary evacuation route from pens                             3 and 4

    was     through the tunnel             and allowed evacuation well within

     the time prescribed by the code.                         The p erimeter gates              and

     the gates in the radial fences provided a secondary escape

     route    which would          enable       the pens          to be evacuated within

     the     prescribed       time,        as     well       as     allowing       access       for

     security.        The width        of the perimeter gates                    was    a matter

     considered       and      determined             by     the     Licensing         Authority

     through       the       Officer       Working           Party:          Dr    Eastwood's

     statement paragraphs             58 and 59.             Past experience had shown

     them    to   be satisfactory            (Inspector Calvert,                 day    30,    page

     18).      However,      they     were       not       designed       or intended         for a

     s i tuation    in     which    there       was        such    gross    overcrowding         of

     the pens as to make movement impossible.



Capacity

     In his initial report to the Club                        (core bundle page 36) Dr

     Eastwood       described        the        way    in     which        the    Green       Guide

     calculated spectator             capacity.              In the       report   and in his

     further report          (core bundle page 48) he suggested capacity

     figures      and set out his reasoning.



     The Licensing Auth o r it y through the Officer Working Party

     considered       Dr     Eastwood's         report        and    exercised         their    own

     judgment.        The     number       of    spectators          certified         for    Spion

     Kop    was    16,8 50    (core    bundle          page       117),    compared      with    Dr
Eastwood's          suggested            figure        of    16,000       (core       bundle       page

56).



Subsequently                w hen        radial        fences        were       introduced           Dr

E astwood        and    Mr    Strange           pointed       out    to    the       Club    and    the

Licensing Authority that the removal of barrier would mean

a    loss     of    capacity             calculated          by     the    code.            See    core

bundle       pages      160,        162,       169.     Unknown to             Dr    Eastwood       the

Police       expressed the view to the Licensing A uthority that

there was          no need          to   reduce        the certified            capacity          (core

bundle page 165).



Similarly,         in       relation        to    the       removal       of   barrier        144    Dr

Eastwood's         evidence          was       that     Mr    Strange          reported       to    him

after      the     meeting          on    7 August          198 6 that         the    question       of

the    effect      on capacity was                    considered          and a similar view

expressed by the Police                     (day 27,         page 54f).



The decision whether to reduce the certified capacity and

if    so    by how much was                not the responsibility                     of the Club

or     its       engineers,              and     they        were     not       privy        to     the

discussions            of    the     Officer          Working       Party       on    the    subject

except at ground inspections.



On the       day in question,                  the opening of Gate                   C meant that

there      was     no w a y     of       limiting       the       number       on    the West       and

North West         Terraces          to the certified figure whate ve r that

figure       might      have        been.         In    the       event,       the     Health       and

Safety       Executive's            best       estimate       of    the     total      number who
entered through turnstiles A to G and Gate C is 9,734,                              ie.

lower     than    the    certified     figure.           The    tragedy      was    not

caused     by    the    admission     of     too    many   spectators         to    the

ground,    but    by    the    admission      of    an   uncontrolled        flow    of

spectators       into    the   central       pens   when       they   were   already

visibly full.

       FOREWORD FOR THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE HANDBOOK




       In the foreword I wrote to last season's handbook I called for a
       new    realism         and     courage                in    finding             solutions            to     football's
       problems.        Lord Justice Taylor's final report on the Hillsborough
       Stadium disaster has since endorsed the need for football to face
       up to its responsibilities.                            Better facilities, more consultation
       by    clubs     of     their       supporters                and       positive              leadership       arr; all
       urgently needed.             ^I         am encouraged by Jthe, steps being                                   taken by
      clubs      to    take     up        these          challenges               and | very             much    welcome     the
      positive way in which the football authorities have responded to
^      the   Taylor      report.               The       interests            of       the         game,    the    clubs     and
      their supporters are best served by Government and the football
      industry working together to implement the measures                                                         recommended
      by Lord Justice Taylor,

                                      t    r   <    c    x            d t l k f       j'nW v                                       ,
      T& q key        measure [fa*~44apxsa£ina the                           safety and m m f o r t nfspectators /
      will    be -tho int-reduetion— of                           a l l ■ocating,                  Lord    Justice     Taylor”
      considered that all-seater, stadia would do more to improve safety
      and cure problems of crowd behaviour at footba"                                                     natches than any
      other      single        action.                  All-seating                 is         a    i-    sure    which      the
      Government         has        long        supported               and        which            we               ‘to     see
      implemented at all football League grounds.


      In recognition of the importance which the Government attaches to
      the                      implementation                         of          Lord              Justice         Taylor's
      iecosiuitendations the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his
      budget last March a reduction in Pool Betting Duty to 40%,                                                            This
      was*    »n condition           that          the money,                estimated             to be around            £100m
      ov       he next         5 years,            was used by the Football                                 Trust to        fund
      capital         works    for        the           safety        and         comfort of               spectators       in
      accordance with the recommendations in Lord .Vastice Taylors final
      report.         This     is    in addition                   to    the        £73m .which             the    Trust    had
      already said it would                        make available                     to professional               football
      over the next 10 years,




                                                                                               ,7 -4,       Q /J ,
Important      as    improved    facilities will         be   in encouraging        better
behaviour,     further measures are also necessary to combat football
hooliganism.         The Government is looking carefully and quickly at
the   other    suggestions       put    forward     by   Lord    Justice        Taylor   for
tackling      this    problem;       including   the     creation    of    new    offences
specifically related            to   football,    the use of        attendance centre
orders and electronic tagging of offenders.                         We are determined
to solve this problem in order that the great majority of decent
law abiding supporters can go and return from games in safety and
in turn encourage others to return to the ga me .


In my view we now have the basis for a new era for football                              in
which the comfort and safety of spectators are given the highest
priority.            All   those       concerned,        including        the     football
authorities,        clubs, players and spectators,              must play their part
if the lessons of Hillsborough are not to be wasted.

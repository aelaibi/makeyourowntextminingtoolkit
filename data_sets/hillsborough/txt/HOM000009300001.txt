         I spoke to Peter Hayes today concerning your letter to me of 6 September
         1989. I hope that he will have the chance to discuss our conversation
         with you as aoon as possible in which case I feel sure that he will be
                                        t

         able to put your mind at rest on the doubts     that you raised*
         The all Important factor to emphasise is contained in the third line of
         Mervyn Jones penultimate paragraph, when he    w*vte to Stuart Anderson on
         my behalf on 5 September 1989, He said “nothing is being lost at this
         time in impetus” and that remains the case.
         You will know that I have been issued with a directive       by my Police
         Authority (reinforced as recently as this morning) not       to engage in"new
         work"1 - however that slight be defined, I am unwilling      to bring into play
         my statutory powers and for reasons that may be obvious      to you would
         wish to be seen to comply with this directive,
          At the moment there is no problem., The work that we are doing is vital
          to the criminal inquiry as essential preparatory work, but is
          coincidentally also essential to t h e .inquiry for HM Coroner, There Is
          thus* de facto, a duality which allows me to operate without loss of
          momentum whilst still satisfying points made by ray Authority, They,
          incidentally, are about to put more pressure on the Home Office from
          their end to seek a resolution of the financial problems that exist.
         I thought that, after our telephone conversation on 4 September, you
         were in agreement with the Regulation 7 Notices for discipline purposes
         being served by Kenneth Cooper, since he is still appointed as
         Investigating Officer*  Immediately after we spoke, I telephoned Captain
         Taylor at the Police Complaints Authority and he was in full agreement

                                              -   2   -


            with this course of action* w® appreciate that there are      legal
            requirements concerning speed of service and these would best be
            discharged by the Notices being served by Kenneth Cooper, We tooth
            recognised that any disciplinary inquiry would, thereafter, have to be
            left in abeyance until after the criminal matters had been resolved.
            By that device, therefore, the requirements of the Discipline
            Regulations could be discharged without delay and my position with my
            Police Authority would not be compromised. It is, 1 suggest, a neat
            solution in all the circumstances.

            One of the over-riding considerations must be the necessity to be fair
            and even-handed with your officers in both disciplinary and criminal
            inquiry matters, I know that you have this already at the forefront of
            your mind. I am absolutely satisfied that their position is not being
            prejudiced at the present time, neither do I envisage that occurring in
            the future* On the contrary, I would not allow such a situation to
            develop.

            Of course, I would be pleased to discuss any of the details on the
            telephone, if you wish. I shall be at the office or on the car
            telephone all next week*

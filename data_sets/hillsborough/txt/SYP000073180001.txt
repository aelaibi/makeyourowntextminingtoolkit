               I am a married man living at the above address with my wife and son.

               On Saturday 15 April       1989,   (150489)    I attended the F A Cup Semi Final

               which took place, at H i ll sb o r o u g h , Sheffield,   between Liverpool F C

               and Nottingham Forrest F C.          I support Lj.vejypool foo^Jfr£ll club.

               We travelled to the match in my car which i/drove.

               My ticket for the match was for the JMorl/fi Stand.             I bought   it from

                                   for £14.

               We set out for the match from Liverpool at about 11.10 am                  (1110).

               We went via the M62 coming off at Manchester and then along the snake
                                                                            PAGE         2
                                                                            S1744

pass into Sheffield.        Traffic moved quite well u p X i l we reached

Manchester,      when we started to get involved       hold ups.   This was due

to the very heavy volume of football tilaf^'Sc making towards Sheffield.

We arrived in Sheffield at about 2 pm (1400) and parked the car about

a mile from the ground on the roadside on the Leppings Ln,          side of the

ground.        All 4 of us then began to walk towards the ground.      We had no

Police directions but I had been to the ground on previous matches and

also to the Semi Final Jrast year and knew where to go.

We had intended to $ 6 into a pub and have a drink before going             into

the ground but could not see any of the pubs open.           I did not see any

other supporter       consuming any drinks whilst   I made my way to the

g ro u n d .

I did not see any trouble between supporters or          any other incidents        of

note between leaving my car and arrp^Lng at the          ground.

We made our way to the e ntrancj»»*/of the ground in Leppinqs Ln and

arrived there at about £.3Jir pm (1430).        I would describe the situation

outside the ground at that time as being full of people but no worse

than any other big game.        The outside gates to the ground were open

and there were       large queues formed from the standing turnstiles back

through the outside gates.

This was tending to block the entrance to our turnstiles to the North

Stand and I had to push through to get to my turnstile.            I managed to

push through in much the same way as any big game and it was no worse

at this time than the Semi|Fi/al of last y e a r .

Whilst making o u / w a y   fromM_eppings Ln towards the turnstiles     I saw a

mounted Pplit^e man trying to get people to form some sort of queue.                 I

think I hkyi seen this Officer at Ai/field at regular matches.              I also

saw two foot Officers on each t^rnfctile.         I cannot remember seeing any

stewards       before entering the ground.

I went through a turnstile and before being allowed in my ticket was
                                                                        PAGE         3
                                                                        SI 744

checked by a Policewoman.    The stub to the ticket was collected by the

fnan operating the turnstile.

After   passing through the turnstiles        I was stopped        rched by a

Police Officer   in the ground.         I then went to the toilet and then made

my way to my seat.                  X

In this area there were stewards who directed us to our part of the

ground.    I had no problftins in getting to my seat and was in my place

at 2.40 pm (1440).

I did not see anyone    consuming alcohol or any incidents of trouble

from the time I entered the ground up till the time I took my seat in

the North Stand.

I was   in my seat from this time until the match started.         The match

started on time at 3pm    (1500).

After the match had started I noticed the two outer pens in the

Leppings Ln Standing area were quite empty while the 2 inner ones w e r e

packed.

I continued to watch the game and I remember at about 5 minutes into

it Peter BEARDSLEY hit the cross bar.           There was a big shout from the

Liverpool supporters.     The game then moved up to the Leppings Ln end

of the ground and at this time I could see about 40 people had come

onto the pitch from the stand.           There were also fans trying to climb

over the fence onto the touch line, and I could see people trying to

get out of the rear of the standing area into the upper stand.

At this time as the centre were very full          I thought that the fans were

being allowed to come out and sit on the edge of the pitch.

I then saw several   persons from the crowd approach the Liverpool

Goalkeeper and the next thing I remember          is a Policeman running up to

the referee who stopped the match and called the players off.

I then saw several fans    ripping advertising boardings down and

carrying injured people on them towards the Kop end of the ground.               I
                                                                                            PAGE          4
                                                                                            SI 744

             remember   in particular seeing one person being carried on a boarding

             Vh o s e head had been covered over with a red            track suit or jumper.      I

             then realised that something had gone badly               wrong in the Leppings Ln

             Stand.

             I then saw an ambulance drive from the Kop End towards the Leppings Ln

             End and pull up by the goal area.

             I could see then, many other      injured persons were         being pulled out of

             the stand.

             At this time, which I would say was twenty past three, a line of

             Police Officers formed in front of our             stand looking towards usand           a

             line of Police formed across the pitch             by the half way line.

             My brother and myself made our way towards the pitch in order to

             assist   persons who had been injured.            WE were told by other    persons       in

             our stand that the Police wou^d not let anyone onto the pitch.

             As t he Police were just s e n d i n g   there     and doing nothing to help the

             injured, we got onto tpe pitch through             the Police line.    I was

             surprised that they made no effort to stop us.

             Once on the pitch I ran towards the Leppings Ln end through the Police

             line across the pitch, again no attempt was made by the Officers to
                                                                           //
             stop me.

             I saw a man lying on his back on the left hand / 4 d g e of the goal area.

vJs-fl-t-J   I would describe him as a white m a l e in his g<arly 30 *s of heavy b u i l d .

             He had light brown short hair, a moustache^              I think he was dressed in

             a denim jacket and a pair of j e a n s .         T h p jacket was pushed up exposing

             his stomach
                                                          /

                                                      /                He appeared to me to be
  P
             dead.    There was an old St             Ambulance woman holding the m a n ’s

             hand and a Policeman was kneeling near to him.
                                                                                    PAGE     5
                                                                                    S1744

                                                    tipped his head back,       held his

        Inose and blew into his mouth.      I blew several times,       the m a n ’s chest

        rose but appeared to be injured.        I then tried to pump his h e a r t , I

        carried on for several minutes and another man ^ame and tried to

        revive him.       Then a fireman came with oxygen apparatus and put that on

        his face.     After several attempts to revive/the man the fireman said

        that    it was too late and that the man was /lead.

        I then looked around and saw an injured ifian lying on a hoarding and I

        assisted other people to carry this ma/ to the Kop End of the ground,

        The man was dazed but alive.

        At the Kop End of the ground I saw ymy brother             .    Just as I saw him

        a group of people brought up a pe/son on a boarding with a coat over

        his face.     They slid the person/off the boarding onto the pitch and as

        they did so the coat came off ^tis face.        I could see that this person

        WaS a white male of about      14/years of a g e .   He was of slim build, with

o \ b l a c k    short hair,   clean shaken and had a Liverpool        football shirt and

        jeans.     He appeared to have stopped breathing.

        In an effort to revive tRe lad I started to pump his heart and my

        brother gave mouth to mcuth.       We carried on for sometime,        but the

        lad remained unconscioyus.      We then put the lad in the recovery

        position and shortly Aft erwards     he was stretchered away by a fireman.

        We then moved to ancAher man who was lying on his back and appeared to

        be dead.     He was a fu hite male of about 40 years of age.         Of average

        build with ^brown short h a i r, c lean shaven, wearing a brown sports

        jacket and x^ight Coloured slacks.
                      k                         was not breathing.       The brother was
        He

        sitting next to him crying.

        I                                                blew into his mouth but as I

        did                                                  [ had to stop.

        My brother and me then made our way to the North Stand.

         We joined up with the 2 friends that we went with and watched the

        'rescue operation which was taking     place for about half an hour.     At

         that time the ground was full of ambulance and firemen and I knew that

         I could assist no further.

         We left the ground of our own accord at about 4.10 pm (1610).         We went

         to the car and made our way back to Liverpool.

                                                                           SIGNED

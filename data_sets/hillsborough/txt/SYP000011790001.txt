         PERSONAL

         Dear Mr Wright

         I write to express my appreciation and commendation of the Police Officers
         my staff worked with at the Hillsborough Boys Club, Sheffield Wednesday
         Gymnasium, and Forbes Road Church Hall on Saturday and Sunday last -
         through the whole process of receiving relatives and friends, identifying
         victims and giving what help and support could be given.

         The Police Officers involved demonstrated a high degree of
         professionalism, tact and judgement throughout the whole operation.

         I have had many expressions of appreciation from my staff - and I also
         speak for myself as I was on site for most of Saturday night and Sunday.

         I also wish to express appreciation about the level of cooperation we have
         received through this week in follow up work with families and other
         people shocked by the disaster.

         Although in such circumstances - naming individuals is somewhat invidious
         - as so many Officers at all levels participated - I must pay special
         tribute to those Officers with whom we had most contact.  These were:

         Chief Inspector Norman Beltison
         Chief Inspector Creasey
         Chief Inspector Addison
         Inspector Purdy
         Constable
         Constable _______________

         If you wish to pass on a copy of this letter to the staff concerned or to
         publicise any p art of it, ^ w o u l d be pleased for you to do so.

         Yours sincerely




         Director of Social Services

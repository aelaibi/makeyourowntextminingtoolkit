Dear Colin

Thanks very much for your letter dated the 12 December.

I am pleased to hear that the families campaign for justice is getting
somewhere. I will be happy to confirm my on going support and wish to
work with Eddie and the campaign in the future. Do contact me about
anything I can do.

Best wishes for â€˜97.



Yours sincerely




Alan Simpson MP

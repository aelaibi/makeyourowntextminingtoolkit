    ,   given my radio to Sgt WATSON and was therefore without a radio and

^   •   re1 iant on PC SCOTT for any radi o m e s s a g e .    After    pairing up PC SCOT

        and I then patrolled once around the ground to familiarise me with the

        area before taking up point duty on the           central    reservation on

        Penistone RD,      opposite the North Stand entrance gates             "O’.



        At this    location we were to supervise the Nottingham Forest supporters

        who were arriving at the ground on Penistone RD and who were all

        required to enter the ground through the Penistone RD turnstiles.                       As

        we stood at this point Nottingham Forest supporters were arriving                       in

        large numbers but we were well behaved and entered the ground as soon

        as they arrived presenting      no unusual     policing     problems.



        At abd^t    1.35 pm (1335) PC SCOTT and I were then detailed to attend

        W ads 1ey Bridge   railway stat ion to assist      in the arrival and escort of

        Liverpool   supporters from the train to the Leppings LN turnstiles.



        About   1^55 pm (1355) approx 400 supporters arrived on the train and

        myself and about seven other Mounted Officers began to escort them to

        the ground,     down Penistone RD,   onto Leppings LN,         towards the

        turnstiles.     However, at this time there were also several                 hundred

        Liverpool   fans who had not come on the train making their way towards

        the ground in the same direction as the escort.                These   people all

        joined on to the escort until by the time we had entered Leppings LN

        at its junction with Penistone RD it was           impossible to tell who had in
                                                                                  PAGE          3
                                                                                  S1387

fact corne on the train.             were^hundreds of people walking up

Leppings LN taking up half of the ca rriageway, as they made their way

to the ground.    Because of these large numbers of Liverpool                 fans   it

was   impossible to k©«p them on the pavement.



On arrival at Leppings LN tur nstiles, which was about 2.15 pm (1415),

I could see that there were also hundreds of fans pouring down the

road from Middlewood RD area and onto the bridge area of Leppings L N .

At this   point the fans   coming from both d i r e c t i ^ K ^ c o n v e r g e d on the

bHsdge area which became blocked from Catchbar LN.                 A build up was now

beginning   in front of the turnstiles but at this time it was orderly,

people were gradually moving forward as they gained entrance to the

ground.



1 could also see that the vast majority of the Liverpool                  supporters

arriving at this time were young males who had with them c^j&s of beer,

generally in 4 packs or 2 litre bottles and they we re readily

drinking,   singing and chanting and not making any attempt at this

stage to enter the stand.



At rHis point I had become separated from PC SCOTT and so I joined up

with PC3186 WILSON of the South Yorkshire Mounted De p a r t m e n t .

Together we began to attempt to clear Leppings LN,                to try and keep the

traffic flowing and to try and encourage fans to enter the ground.                         We

c ont i nually went back and forth along Leppings LN asking people to

make their way into the ground.



Whilst doing this we became aware of a f rg-fcjt taking            place between

Liverpool ^TuTpfi^rters outside a gas showroom at the junction of

Leppings LN and Catchbar LN.        PC WILSON and       I went to that 1o cat i on
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             S 1387

and assisted in^The^M^^s^ersal of a small group of about            ID fans whilst

foot officers detained some of the gr o up .



We then continued to attempt to clear the bridge area which was still

inaccessible to vehicles.         Whilst doing this we were joined by two

Merseyside Mounted Officers.



By now the atmosphere was beginning to become           less friendly.      The

bridge area was still        blocked by young m a l e s , many seated,   who were

still drinking heavily.         Foot officers were attempting to confiscate

some of the beer but because of the large numbers with beer this was

alomost an impossible task.



A further fight then'Htiroke out on the bridge on Leppings LN between

about 20 Liverpool     supporters which again I attended with PC WILSON

and assisted whilst     foot officers detained       people.



By this time even greater numbers of supporters were flocking down

Che road with a sudden increase         in front of the turnstiles and on the

faridge ISKQea.   There were by now 'about 3000 people in t he area in front

of the turnstiles and spilling out onto the road.



It was then that     I was
                        informed by PC WILSONVthat we had beeja asked to
                                              \      s o e 'T/SUlh .
go to the Leppi ngs LN turnstile area.  It was a^bout 2.50 pm < 1 4 5 0) .

This area by now was a solid blcK.k of people who were            pressing down

towards the turnstiles.         The turnstiles at this location are divided

into North Stand turnstiles and West Stand turnstiles by a brick wall

with blue steel     gates between the area immediately in front of the

turnstiles and the entrance of Leppings LN.            The turnstiles     into West

Stand are bordered on one side by the wall and on the other side by a
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                S 1387

steel barrier.            This area in particular was packed solid with people

who were being pushed forwards towards the turnstiles by the vast

numbers of people behind them.              The majority of these people pushing

at the rear of the crush had only arrived within the last few minutes

and were badly affected by drink.             They were pushing in an attempt to

get into the ground and were becoming more             ill-tempered,    unco™

operative and aggressive as they realised that it was almost time for

the game to commence and that they were not yet in the ground.



At^ the front of the          crush people were being forced against, the

turrvsh)i lV ^, s o m e    of the younger   children were being   passed overhead to

escape the ejKreme           pressure.   A large number of people      were also

climbing up the            walls and gaining access to the ground over the top           of

the walls despite them being about             12* high.



I could see that two of the Merseyside Mounted Officers had gone to

the front near the turnstiles and were attempting to relieve                 pressure

at the front, whilst other Mounted Officers were near the blue steel

gates attempting to create some form of barrier between those pushing

at the rear and            those   in the turnstile area.   However, because ofthe

vast numbers of            people they were still   pushing through into the

turnstile area.



I together with PC WILSON tried to get through the crowd in order to

get towards the front to assist             in holding them back.   However,       again

because of the number of people             pushing at the rear, who were unco-

operative and hostile towards the Police,             this proved difficult as

\h e y were determined to get to the front.


              N7fT50
A landrover with loudhailers then arrived              but could not get through
                                                                                            PAGE     6
                                                                                            S13S7

                the crowd of people and its message requested that the crowd stop

                pushing for fear of injuring           people at the front, was lost beneath the

                noise of the crowd-



                I then saw that.the blue outer gates had been closed.  At this point                 I
‘V ’"-®0                                    |I(M"
                was beckoned by Inspector HAND-DAVIS of South Yorkshire Mounted

                Section to form a \rose
                                   bs   to tail          cordon with the horses across    the

                entrance from Leppings LN which I did with a number of other Mounted

                Officers.     This we were able to achieve because of the temporary

                relief given by the closure of the outer gates.



                We formed the cordon but were still under great             pressure from the

                crowd who were pushing at the horses,           hitting them and pulling at

                their   reins.     The pushing was so great that the horses were         put under

                extreme pressure,      people were      in fact pushing the horses out of the

                line and breaking through them,           they were abusive and aggressive.



                It was whilst      I was   in this    cordon that   I was approached by a man who

                was   i.rrate and abusive.      He was shouting at me "What do you lot think

                y o u ’re doing,   look at that      lot at the front by the turnstiles,    if you

                d o n ’t open those big gates and let us all          in, someone will get killed

                out here."       This man was    in his thirties and it was apparent to me

                that he had been drinking.



                We continued to hold the crowd with the cordon for a few minutes;               I

                then noticed that the crowd had broken through the line of horses

                behind me and that         people were rushing down towards the turnstile

                area.    I looke'flKdown towards the ttHcnsti 1es and could see that the

           -)   area was    clearing   rapidly as everyone entered the ground through a set

                of gates wTTich had been opened.           The area cleared very quickly.
                                                                                    PAGE      7
                                                                                    S 13S 7



I was then sent round onto Penistone RD to standby opposite the North

Stand gates       'O' which I did with a number of other Mounted Officers.

We were sent to this point as it was opposite the access onto the

pitch,    should it have become necessary for us to enter the ground.

However,       it very quickly became apparent that something seriously

wrong was happening       inside the ground.



We remained at this point on Penistone RD until about 4.30 pm (1630).

I then began a general       patrol with PC WILSON,         supervising the

departure of Nottingham Forest supporters from the ground in the

Penistone RD and Herries RD area.



We were at the junction of Parkside RD and Penistone RD when we

received a radio message        regarding a fight       in Hillsborough Park.           PC

WILSON and I attended together with PC's             1498 and 2472 o f South

                                                                                    Les and

pieces of wolKj        each othe r , wh i ch ^ ^ s d i s pe r s e d enabling foot

officers to detain some of them.            We then continued through the park

onto Middlewood RD.       A further radio message was then received

regarding a fight on Middlewood RD,            however we did not find a

disturbance so we continued to patrol down into the Hillsborough

shopping area.       This we found all quiet so we returned to Penistone RD

via Middlewood RD and Leppings LN and then remained on standby on

Penistone RD with Sergeant SOARSBY of the South Yorkshi re Mounted

Se ct io n .



At about 6.30 pm (1830) we were          informed that we could stand down arid

return to Niagara stables.

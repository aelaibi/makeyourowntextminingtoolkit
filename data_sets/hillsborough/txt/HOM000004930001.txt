Dear Mr.      Taylor,

I r efer to our m e e t i n g on the 10th M a y and t h a n k you most
s i n c e r e l y for a g r e e i n g to meet T o n y a n d myself.       I p r o m i s e d to
let you have a note of o u t s t a n d i n g p o i n t s w h i c h you c o u l d take
up w i t h y o u r c o l l e a g u e s and I hope the f o l l o w i n g w ill be
helpful.

1.   Bournemouth v Leeds

     I told you that we w e r e h a v i n g a m e e t i n g w i t h the
     A s s o c i a t i o n of Chief Po l i c e Off i c e r s .  That has n o w been
     held and c r i t e r i a a g r e e d for the p r e p a r a t i o n of the Fixt u r e
     List for 1990/91 and a m o d u s o p e r a n d i for d e a l i n g w i t h
     police r e q u e s t s for changes of fixtures.                  W h a t we a g r e e d
     ar o u n d the t able n e e d e d to go to the a p p r o p r i a t e A C P O
     c o m m i t t e e and as soon as I hav e c o n f i r m a t i o n f r o m t h e m I
     wil l be w r i t i n g to the Home S ecretary.               I w ill see that
     you get a copy.

2.   Football Licensing Authority

     I c o n f i r m that we are k een to see the F o o t b a l l L i c e n s i n g
     A u t h o r i t y set up as soon as p o s s i b l e so that we can begin
     d i s c u s s i o n s on h o w the F.L.A. is g oing to w o r k an d ho w it
     is g oing to e x e r c i s e its d i s c r e t i o n in i m p l e m e n t i n g the
     Taylor r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s .      We nee d to h ave some
     c l a r i f i c a t i o n q u i c k l y since some c lubs are a n x i o u s to get
     on d u r i n g this c l o s e d season w i t h some of the w o r k and we
     are anxi o u s that it sh o u l d not p r o v e to be a b o r t i v e once

       the F.L.A. has got down to determining its own criteria.
       If the Taylor timetable is adhered to strictly and
       capacities are reduced in order to comply with the
       recommendations of the Taylor Report without any timetable
       flexibility, there would be,in the short term, more sell­
       out matches and people without tickets would create
       problems outside the grounds.   We  would prefer each club
       to be able to submit their own realistic timetable for
       i m p r o ve m e n t s .

3.     Ticket Touts

       If all of our effo r t s r e g a r d i n g all ticket m a t c h e s and
       s e g r e g a t i o n are to have any ch a n c e of being a c hieved, then \                 j
       the ti c k e t touts need to be banned.             We w o u l d h ope that
       you w o u l d be able to take this on board fairly quickly.

4.     Government           Steering Group

    It w o u l d be m ost h e l p f u l if an infor m a l S t e e r i n g Group
    c ould be esta b l i s h e d , i n c l u d i n g o f f i c i a l s fro m all the
    de p a r t m e n t s c o n c e r n e d for the i m p l e m e n t a t i o n of the T a y l o r
 ^  Report.            I see these p r i m a r i l y as being Home Office,
 JP D e p a r t m e n t of the E n v i r o n m e n t and Treasury.              It w o u l d
    c e r t a i n l y save me time in not h a v i n g to tell the same story
    several times ove r but m o r e i m p o r tantly, I t hink it w o u l d
    help ensure that we get a c o n s t a n t and logical a p p r o a c h in
    an are a w h e r e it is only too e a s y to have f r a g m e n t a t i o n .


If you could h elp w i t h any of the a bove m a t ters,                   I should be
most grateful.

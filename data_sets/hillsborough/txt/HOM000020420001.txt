HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


Thank you for your letter of 8 September asking whether your
consulting engineer, Mr Noel Burne of Burne Associates, may have
sight of the scale drawings prepared by Brade & Partners at the
request of the Health and Safety Executive for Lord Justice
Taylor's Inquiry.

Lord Justice Taylor is content for your engineer to have sight of
these drawings, provided that a similar facility is made
available to the other parties to the litigation.

This facility is made available on the basis that copyright and
ownership of the drawings is retained by the Inquiry, and any
costs are met by the party seeking copies of the drawings.

In your letter of 18 September to Mr Brummell (Treasury
Solicitor) you gave details of the other parties to the
litigation. I am therefore sending a copy of this letter, and of
your letter of 18 September, to the other four parties so that
they may be aware of these developments.

                                        R M WHALLEY

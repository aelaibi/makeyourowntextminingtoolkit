 Thank you for copying to me your letter of the 26 June 1992 to
 Tony Newton.

I am content to support your proposal and endorse the view of the
Lord Chancellor that any offence should be a summary one.     The
Crown Prosecution Service provided some detailed comments to your
officials on the 4 April 199 0 and your proposed formulation of
the offence coincides with their preferred option.    I take this
opportunity of endorsing a point already made by the CPS that we
should in drafting the Bill seek to avoid making criminal any
bona fide private sale on the match day between friends and
relatives.   Although it is unlikely that any such transactions
v/ould be detected, it is right in principle that legislation
should be closely focused on the mischief which it addresses.
I am copying this letter to the Prime Minister, Members of LG
Committee, David Mellor, First Parliamentary Counsel and the
Secretaries to LG Committee.

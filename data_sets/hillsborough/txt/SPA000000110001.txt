SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY - 18TH AUGUST, 1989

COMPLAINT MADE ABOUT THE CONDUCT OF THE DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE, MR. PETER HAYES

Report o f the Clerk and Financial O f f ic e r


1.     Matter fo r Consideration

1.1    A complaint about the conduct o f the Deputy Chief Constable a r i s i n g out
       of the Inquiry in t o the Hillsborough D is aste r has been received from
       Mr. Trevor Hicks as fo llo w s "that i t was t o t a l l y improper o f the Deputy
       Chief Constable, w h i l s t the Inquiry i s s t i l l hearing evidence and the
       p o l i c e internal i n v e s t i g a t i o n i s s t i l l taking pla ce to s t a t e p u b lic ly h is
       d e c isio n regarding fu rther a c tio n a g a in s t Chief Superintendent
       Duckenfield." Attached to t h i s report (Annex 1) i s correspondence which
       provides background information to the complaint. The P o l ic e Authority,
       as the d i s c i p l i n a r y au thority f o r sen io r o f f i c e r s , must decide what
       a c tio n i s to be taken in r e s p e c t o f the complaint.

2.     Background

2.1    Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was the D iv is io nal Commander o f "F"
       D iv is ion and as such, took overall control o f the p o li c in g o f the F.A.
       Cup Semi-Final a t Hillsborough on 15th A p r il, 1989.

2 .2   During the course o f h is evidence to the Inquiry held by Lord J u s t i c e
       Taylor, i t was suggested th a t Chief Superintendent Duckenfield had l i e d
       or been d e c e i t f u l about the i n t i t a l cause o f the d i s a s t e r immediately
       a f t e r i t occurred.

2 .3   Following Chief Superintendent Duckenfield‘ s evidence to the Inquiry the
       Deputy Chief Constable, then the person with the delegated au thority for
       d i s c i p l i n e within South Yorkshire P o l i c e , received a question from a
       member o f the press as f o l l o w s : -

       "Chief Superintendent Duckenfield misled h is A s s i s t a n t Chief Constable
       (Operations) regarding the opening o f gate “C". Pending the outcome o f
       the Inquiry what i s the Force going to do about it?"

       In response to the q u es tio n , the Deputy Chief Constable made the
       fo llow in g sta tem ent:-

       "Pending the outcome o f the Inquiry, I have considered t h i s matter
       c a r e f u l l y and i t i s my view th a t no fu rther a c tio n i s required".

       Mr. Hicks has in ter pr e te d t h i s statement as meaning th a t no fu rther
       a c tio n was to be taken a g a in s t Chief Superintendent Duckenfield s u b je c t
       to the f in d in g s of the Inquiry.

2 .4   Members must be c l e a r about t h e i r r ole in t h i s matter. I t i s not the
       merits o f the case a g a in s t Chief Superintendent Duckenfield which i s
       under c o n s id e r a t io n , s in c e t h i s i s properly a matter for the Deputy Chief
       Constable, but the propriety o f the d e c isio n of the Deputy Chief
       Constable to make h i s view known w h i l s t the Inquiry was s t i l l hearing
       evidence.
                                       NOT FOR PUBLICATION as i t
                                     contains        exempt       information
                                     within para              I .................. of
                                     Sch.l2A to the Local Government

     2.5   The Inquiry by Lord J u s t i c e Taylor has been charged with the task of
            findin g out what happened and what caused the d i s a s t e r . The
           appropriateness o f internal d i s c i p l i n a r y ac tion to be taken a g a in s t any
           o f f i c e r involved in the even ts a t Hillsborough on the 15th April i s not
           within the purview of the Inquiry but i s a matter for the Deputy Chief
           Constable a lo n e . However, when Mr. Hayes announced h is d e c isio n he did
           so in the knowledge th at no complaint had been lodged a g a in s t
           Mr. Duckenfield by a member o f the p u b lic . Whilst the l e t t e r from
           Mr. and Mrs. Hicks o f 7th June i s primarily a complaint a g a in s t Mr. Hayes
           i t could a l s o be regarded as a public complaint a g a in s t Mr. Duckenfield
           p a r t ic u l a r ly in view o f the comments on page 2. The Chief Constable has
           now decided to record the l e t t e r as a complaint a g a in s t Mr. Duckenfield
           and i t w ill take i t s normal course.

    2.6    In e s s e n c e , the complaint by Mr. Hicks a g a in s t the Deputy Chief Constable
            i s th a t the timing o f the announcement was perhaps i n d i s c r e e t or la cking
            in diplomacy.

^   2.7     Annexed to t h i s report i s a copy o f the Deputy Chief Constable's
            explanation for h is a c tio n s (Annex 2 ) .

    3-     The Legal P o s iti o n

    3.1    Section 86(1) of the P o l ic e and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) places upon
           the P o l ic e Authority the duty to record complaints a g a in s t o f f i c e r s for
           whom they c o n s t i t u t e the appropriate authority and su b je c t to su b -se ctio n
            (2) (s e e below) to i n v e s t i g a t e i t . The Deputy Chief Constable i s such an
           o f f i c e r and the complaint made by Mr. Hicks has been recorded.

    3.2    Section 86(2) (PACE) empowers the Authority to deal with the matter
           acccording to t h e i r d i s c r e t i o n i f s a t i s f i e d th a t the conduct complained
           o f , even i f proved, would not j u s t i f y a criminal or d i s c i p l i n a r y charge.
           This i s the broad equivalen t o f the informal r e s o lu t io n provision in
           regard to o f f i c e r s of lower ranks.

    3 .3   Any d i s c i p l i n a r y ac tio n a g a in s t the Deputy Chief Constable a r i s i n g out o f
           the complaint would be for d i s c r e d i t a b l e conduct, th a t i s a c tin g in a
           manner reasonably l i k e l y to bring d i s c r e d i t upon the reputation o f the
           force or o f the p o l i c e s e r v i c e .

    4.     P o s s ib le Courses o f Action

    4.1    The Authority has two courses of a c tio n open to i t : -

            (a)    To appoint an o f f i c e r to i n v e s t i g a t e the complaint. This would
                   have to be undertaken by the Chief Constable or by a member of
                   another force o f the rank o f Chief Constable or Deputy Chief
                   Constable, s in c e the i n v e s t i g a t i n g o f f i c e r must be o f a t l e a s t the
                   rank o f the o f f i c e r a g a in s t whom the complaint i s made.

           (b)     To use the d i s c r e t i o n aff ord by s e c tio n 86(2) and not deal with the
                   case by way o f formal proceedings.

    4 .2   With regard to 4 .1 ( b ) even though no formal proceedings are taken i t i s
           s t i l l open to the Authority to take whatever ac tio n i s considered
           appropriate.
5.       Recommendation

5.1      That the Authority con siders the appropriate course o f a ction to reso lv e
         the complaint made by Mr. Trevor Hicks.

 Dear Home Secretary,                                                                                     0


                                        re: Hillsborough Disaster


 I am the father of               the     late Sarah and Victoria Hicks who unfortunately
^ r e    among the 95 people so tragically killed at Hillsborough.


        will    require         little reminder of            the     increasingly acrimonious rounds
 of     accusation      and      counter    accusation          that    abounded          in    the media until
 you had the good sense to issue your instruction to the police and request
 a general cessation.
 Despite       acute provocation and               at    times      great personal             anquish,      my wife
 and    I have resisted            numerous       opportunities          to    fuel    that deplorable            and
 unseemly       state      of    affairs,    preferring          to    assist       the    Taylor       Inquiry    in
 its difficult task - including being prepared to await the outcome before
 making detailed comment to the media.


 I write to you today to request your comment and intervention following
Qp      statement,      widely reported            in the media,             by South Yorkshire’s Deputy
 ^pief Constable           Peter    Hayes     to    the       effect    that     "no further action               was
required"   in  connection  with                        the    actions        and     behaviour         of     Chief
Superintendant David Duckenfield.
I was under the impression that Lord Justice Taylor on the one hand and
the internal Police Investigation by the West Midlands force on the other,
would draw conclusions when and only when they had concluded their work
and     had    time   to    deliberate.       Despite         the     careful       wording,      the     issue   of
this statement by the Deputy Chief Constable pre-empts these findings!


Words fail me when I try to convey to you the hurt and totally unneccessary
anguish this untimely statement has given my wife,                                  myself and presumably
the other       families.         Apart    from    the crass nature of this action,                           I find
the need to issue such a statement at this time beyond contempt.
                                               2


  One can only conclude that this is yet a further attempt by South Yorkshire
  Police to divert public opinion away from               their    appalling      performance
  both on the fatal day and subsequent to it.


  Apart       from obvious offence   to the bereaved,     how are the public to view
  this premature ’’absolution" by the Deputy Chief Constable!
  That a senior police officer - who by his own admission deliberately chose
  to deceive his superiors (and others!) should not be disciplined is totally
  incredible.
 Even if one believes Chief Superintendant Duckenfield's reasons for lying
^ ^ o the general public at the time,        (and I am bound to say that I personally
    !not!)_ there could have been no credible reason to have misled the Deputy
 ^iief Constable.


  Is     it   purely   coincidence   that   this   provided   an   excuse   for    the    Chief
 Constables silence during the lead-in /initial week of the Taylor Inquiry,
 when the fans were able to give their views?
  I trust that under the circumstances you will               understand my fears of a
  whitewash" at the least and at the worst a deliberate attempt to "close
 ranks” and distort the course of justice.


 I regret that Mr.Hayes's insensitive and untimely public action has further
 reduced my opinion of the South Yorkshire senior police.
^ ^ t leaves me no alternative but to formally complain directly to yourself,
  -id to ask you as the vanguard of a Government claiming to be ’’committed
       law and order” to make an unequivocal            statement of your opinion and
 intended actions in the wake of this regrettable development.


 I will await your urgent response during the course of today or tomorrow,
 but would       advise   that should   I fail     to recieve an appropriate response
 I reserve the right to follow Mr.Hayes example and release                    this      letter
 to the media tomorrow evening.


 Your;



 Trevor Hicks.

          The Home Secretary has asked me to thank you for your letter
      of 8 June 1989 and to offer his personal sympathy for your
      terrible loss.

• )       The Government has instituted the inquiry by Lord Justice
      Taylor in order to discover what went wrong at Hillsborough on
      that day. Whilst the responsibility for deciding whether
      disciplinary action should be taken against a police officer or
      chief superintendent rank or below lies with the Chief Constable,
      the Home Secretary considers that any final decisions on
      disciplinary matters are bound to await the outcome of Lord
      Justice Taylor's inquiry.
          I understand that the Deputy Chief Constable of South
      Yorkshire takes that view.

f.a.o:- The Right Honourable Douglas Hurd M.P.                                     10th June 1989.

Dear Home Secretary,
                                  re:- Hillsborough Disaster


Thank you for your courtesy in replying to my letter of the 7th so promptly
and for your personal expression of sympathy to my wife and I.


      was    pleased     to   recieve       clarification      of     your    position     regarding
>_^.scipline,    however your       letter does not really deal with the complaint
I was making.          Namely,    that   it was totally        improper of the Deputy Chief
Constable,      whilst     the    Inquiry    is    still    hearing   evidence and        the police
internal      investigation        is    still     taking    place,     to    state    publicly    his
decision regarding further action against Chief Superintendant Duckenfield.


His    very    well    publicised       action    in    stating^ that    having       considered, the
matter carefully,         subject to the findings of the Inquiry "it is my view
that    no    further    action    is    required” appears          to be at great divergance
from the position you claim in the last paragraph of your reply to me.


     ) view of the very poor impression                that the police evidence has created
^     the minds of the public,           I cannot help but feel that the^^DkC.C.                  has
quite deliberately,           and most      improperly,      "jumped the gun"         in an attempt
to counteract the poor showing of his senior officers at the Inquiry.


As    the improper conduct of an                  officerof the rank of Deputy Chief Constable
is a matter for you, I would welcome your comments and intentions on this
particular point and await your early reply.


                                         Yours JPa^hfully,




                                            Trevor Hicks.
                                                    June 1989




                   ^JVvv '          j

    Thank you for your further letter of 10 June.

    The responsibility for considering complaints and allegations
against police officers of the rank of Assistant Chief Constable:
and above lies with the police authority for the area concerned,;
in this case the South Yorkshire Police Authority, and not with ;
the Home Secretary.

    It would be wrong for me to become involved in any complaints
about the activities of officers of the South Yorkshire Police,
whatever their rank. This is because if a police officer is
disciplined, he or she has a right of appeal to the Home
Secretary. I can only be seen to be-/'impartial ^in :the-hearing ,of
an appeal if I have not been previously involved in the case.

                     Due      to     the    mass       of    people           I. had        difficulty              in f i n d i n g       and        getting          to

                     my      entry        point.         Also       where          I was       s t o o d at         first,      by the          gates       leading

                     to      th e    N Stand        turnstiles,                due     to a         gate       to    the       right       it        blocked       out
                                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                                               SI 568

and     I couldn't             see       the    Terrace         turnstiles             until       I actually             walked

along       the    rear        of    the       mass    of      the    crowd,,




Then       it t o o k    me     about          twenty       minutes         to    enter       the T e r r a c e       turnstiles

into       the    ground        due       to    mass     of     p eople.



At    no    time     did       I see       any      gates       being       opened          but    when       I got       through      my

turnstile          the        blue       concertina            gate    to       the    right       was     slightly         open

allowing          policemen              in a n d     out      of    the    ground,          the    gate       was    s hu t    by a

steward          wearing        a    bright         coloured          tabard.



Whilst         I was      waiting          to    get     through           my    tu rn stile        I saw        so rne s u p p o r t e e s

about       three        or    f ou r     climb       o v er    the    terrace          turnstile             wall.




I still          hav e    my    ticket          stub wh ic h          I have          retained       which          bears      the

markings          Leppings           L.N s t a n d i n g ,      si:-; p ou nds ,                    L...L3,




Once       I had     cleared             the    turnstile            I just       followed          the       c r o w d who     were

all     heading          for    the       tunnel       straight            in f ro n t ,      I didn't           notice        any

other       direction           signs          because         the    tunnel          was    so    obvious          in f r o n t     of me

I just         headed         for    it.



i    w a l k e y down         the    t u n n e l which          wasn't          full    and       I h ad      easy     passage

a l o n g ""it.      I saw          no    police       or      stewards          standing          in or a r o u n d        the

t u n n e 1.




I witnessed              from       the    turnstile            to m y m a t c h        viewing          p o i nt    no    disorder

or    d r i nk i ng w h a t s o e v er .




As    I left       the        tunnel       down       the      slight       drop       I entered           the      standing         area

to   the       left        of    the      fence        i n t o P e n 4 a nd        stood        behind        the       first        barrier

closest          to    the       tunnel          and     the   dividing           fen c e ,     this    was        my    first        match

viewing          point.



I stood          in t ha t         same        place      physically             wedged       and    crushed            in the         crowd

with      my     pelvis          crushed          into      the     barrier        u n t il     I saw        the    ambulance               come

onto       the    pitch w h i c h             was      about       five     to    ten mi nu t es        after           the    match         was

stopped.              Shortly          after        the     ambulance            appeared        the    pressure              eased         off

slightly          and       I was         pushed         closer       to    the    fence        to my        right.           Th e     crowd

then       gradually             thinned          out     around        me.



I have         been        shown       a g'fid of P e n s             3 and       4 and       I. w o u l d    estimate           my

Whilst       I wa s      being          crushed against                  the     barrier,             to    my    left        I could

hear    a man         screaming            and     crying          for    help.            He    was       physically            bent

double       o ve r     the     barrier,          he w a s         about       thirty           years       old,       white,         d a rk

hair,    with         either         a beard          or m o u s t a c h e ,      wearing             an ano ra k          or    jacket,

what    colour          I d o n ’t know.                He    was    wearing           a    personal             stereo         as    I sa w

the    headphones             dangling           from        his    neck.         He       was       bent       double        with       his

head    by    his       feet       and     I s aw       his     hand      grab       my     jeans,          he w as        still

screaming          but     I was          pushed        to    the    righ t       and       I lost          sight        of     him.




As    I was       pushed        to      the     r i ght      a f t e r a w h i 1e the                pressure          eased and

crowd     started          to      thi n out          and     I wa s      able       to     w a 1k t o w a r ds          the      r ight

hand    fence         to w a l k        down     towards           the    gat e      to     get       onto       the     pitch.            As

I w a 1 k e d t o w a r ds         t he    f e n c i ng      I s a w s ome        bo d i e s         1 y i ng    o n t lie f 1 o o r o f

the    terracing           surrounded              by     pe o p l e .      They       appeared             to    be     injured           but      I

wouldn't          be a b l e       to     describe           them    or     their          clothing             I j us t      noticed

them.        At    th is      time        I was       in a s t a t e        of    shock          and       was    unable         to a s s i s t

anyone       else.



I the n star ted              to     w a 3.k d o w n      the      ter rac i ng        to       go    through          the      g a te     o nt o

the    pitch.         I got        to     the    gate and           there        were       about          five     or     six

policemen          at    the       open       gate      but     they wou ldn't                  allow       me    through            for    no

r e a s o n at     all.         So      I walked          along      the       wall        and       climbed        th ro u g h a gap

where    the       wire       fencing           had     been       cut    a w a y.         I got        onto        the       pitch and
                                                                                                                            P AGE.    6
                                                                                                                            S31368




I think       one    of    the    factors         of    the    injuries            and    deaths          caused was

because       the    F.A.      game     is    the      wrong     end        of    the    ground       completely.               I

eventually          left    the       ground      at    about       quarter            past    to    half       past    four

( 1613)--( 1630) »             I left       the   ground       because            of    the    loud       speaker

announcement           telling         us    t ha t    the    match         had    been abandoned.




I did     not      witness       any    criminal            offence.




After     the      match    was       stopped,         the    po 1 i ^ j ^ w o u l d n * t a l l o w       people       out     the

trying       to    climb    out       over    the      fencing         at    the       front.        I think          the    police

and     g round     s taf f we re                 i n r e a ct i ng         to    the    s i t u a t i.o n .     Also       there

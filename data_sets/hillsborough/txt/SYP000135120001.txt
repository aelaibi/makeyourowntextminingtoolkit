       Dear Sir

       In connection with the above fixture, would you please inform the coach
       operators that it will be appreciated if they follow the below mentioned
       route:

       Coaches should be advised to take Junction 36 off the Ml onto the A61
       where they will be net and escorted to the ground by the police motorcycle
       branch.

      Coaches should be advised to arrive at the rendezvous point between
      1.30 pm and 2 pm/6 pm -and 6.30 pm.. Please find enclosed maps for further
      assistance.

      It is possible that visiting supporters will be asked to remain inside the
      ground after the final whistle. Supporters will be notified at the ground
      of the procedure to be followed and are asked to comply with the request
      made by the Police in order to facilitate a relatively trouble free exit
      from the ground.

      Supporters will normally be escorted by the police back to the coach park.

      Yours faithfully




A     Chief Constable

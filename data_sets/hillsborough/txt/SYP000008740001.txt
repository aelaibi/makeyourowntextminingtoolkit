I first went             over     to a man who was               c l utching           his    stomach,           1 would

bald,       wearing        dark       clothing,          I a s k e d him         if he was alright,                 he gave

me   th e    thumbs        up sign an d said              to go and help                someone       else.

Myself       and              then went         over     to a ma n an d woman,                 the man was           sat

beside       her wit h his a r m              a r o u n d her    shoulder,             I could see that              she was

finding          it difficult           to    breath and a p p e a r e d              to be    in shock,          she was

c ry in g    and       kept    s h iv e rin g .

I would          describe        this     lady as white              with       long    blonde       hair    of about           29

years       of age w e a r i n g        a skirt and a white                     blcn ise.

it was       then that a p o l i c e m a n             told us that              they       needed more          stre t c h e r s

we    continued          over     to                       and gave         her       the    stretcher,          she was

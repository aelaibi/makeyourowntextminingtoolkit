    Dear Sir

    RE                                       DECEASED

    I understand that you act for relatives of the above name deceased in relation
    to the Hillsborough disaster at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on 15 April
    1989.

    As the relatives have indicated they do not wish any direct contact with the
    Police concerning this matter, I enclose the copy of a letter for your
    information and onward transmission to relatives.

    You will note the inquest is scheduled to commence on or about 10 January 1990
    and further details will be forwarded in due course.

    If you have any query relating to the progress of the inquiry please contact
    Nechells Green Police Station Ext 224.

    Yours faithfully

Dear

RE ...............................         DECEASED

As you are probably already aware the hearing of oral evidence in relation to
Hillsborough Inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor concluded on the 14 July 1989.
Enquiries on behalf of H M Coroner Dr Popper still continue.

The purpose of this letter is to inform you that with effect from that date my
offices at Furnival House, Furnival Gate, Sheffield and Smithdown Lane,

Should you have any query in relation to the forthcoming inquest scheduled to
start on or about 10 January 1990 you can either contact one of my officers at
the Medico Legal Centre, Watery Lane, Sheffield, telephone number 0742
......... or my main incident room a t ’Nechells Green Police Station, details as
above.

May I also bring to your attention that we are still in possession of a large
amount of unclaimed personal property removed from Hillsborough.  Should you
have any query regarding outstanding property you should contact Nechells Green
Police Station Ext 224.

Yours Sincerely

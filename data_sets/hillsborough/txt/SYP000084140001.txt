where       the    majority          of N o t t i n g h a m          Forest        supporters          were        standing.

At    this     stage         I had       no    idea w h a t          was     happening,          nothing           had     been       s aid

on    the    radio       and       all     I could          see      was     the    football          match       had      been

stopped        and      t h er e    were       hundreds           of    supportsrs          on    the       p 11 c h .

After       a few m o m e n t s          injured          a n d jd&ad f o o t b a l l       s u p p o r t e r s were            being

car r i ed off          the       pitch       to    t his      entrance        and    I faegan to ass i at                  the       f i rst

aid    ps p p 1e .

Several        minutes            lat er      I heard          over     the    radio    t hat         police         dogs       had       been

requested          to    enter       the       ground          and     I returned       to       the     police           dog     van,

collected Police                   Dog     ’B r u n o '     and went          onto    the    p i t c h a nd s t o o d             in a

line     with      numerous          other          dog     handlers          in    front    of       the      P e i n s t on s      Rd

stand       where       the    Nottingham               Forest         fans    were    standing.                At    this        p o int

the    Nottingham Forest                      supporters             were     subdued       and       k e pt    asking          what      wa s

happening          and       were    not       aggressive.

After       the   match        had       been      officially               abandoned       I returned               to    the       police

vehicle       and       resumed          patrol         with      PC H i b b e r d    assisting             with      e s c or t i ng

Returning          to    the       City       Centre        area       it w a s     apparent          that       most      of     the

football          supporters             were      upset        and     were       causing       no    problems            at     all,,

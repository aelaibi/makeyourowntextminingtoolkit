                         FINAL        REPORT           OF HIS      INQUIRY
     INTO THE            HILLSBOROUGH                  FOOTBALL        STADIUM           DISASTER




With         permission,              Mr     Speaker,          I should            like     to m a k e

a statement                   about       the     final        report        of     Lord    Justice

Taylor's                 Inquiry             into          the         tragedy             at          the

Hillsborough                   football           stadium         in        Sheffield            on     15

     April            1989,     which        is    published           today.



Shortly               I will,        of    course,         refer        to        Part     1 of        the

Football                Spectators                Act     ^and          the         Government's

intentions               with        respect            thereto.             But    that        matter

m u s t be p u t in c o n t e x t                  and    I will        t r y to f o l l o w t h e

theme            of     the         Report        and     come         to     the        membership

scheme           at     the     right        moment.



We         are    indebted           to    Sir         Peter     for    the        Report,       which

is         a careful           and        thorough        analysis            of    why     we        have

h a d so m a n y m a j o r t r a g e d i e s               at f o o t b a l l       grounds over

the          years            and     why         we      have         had         disorder            and

hooliganism.                    Sir P e te r e x p l a i n s           h o w in h i s        interim
report        he c o n c e n t r a t e d          on o v e r c r o w d i n g    because           that

was    the     c a u s e of the H i l l s b o r o u g h                disaster,          but now

he    goes      on        to        talk    of        a game,        the    image      of    which

has    been        much         tarnished,              and    of     a blight         over        the

game         due          to          old         grounds,            poor          facilities,

hooliganism,               e x c e s s i v e d r i n k i n g and poor l e adership.



Sir P e t e r d o es not s p a r e t h o s e w h o run the i n d u s t r y .

He     says        indeed            that        the     provision           they     make         for

their         customers               is      often           not     merely         basic         but

squalid,           and         squalid           conditions           can      have       both      an

impact        on      safety           and        lead        to    lower      standards            of

behavi our.



The     Football               Association              and        Football         League        have

not     seen         it        as     any     part       of        their     duty      to     offer

guidance           to          clubs        on        safety        matters         and      it     is

questionable               whether           the d i r e c t o r s         of the     clubs        are

genuinely            interested                  in    the     welfare         of     their        own

s u p p o r t e r s or t h eir good b e h a v i o u r .                     Players too are

condemned,) with                     Lord    Justice           Taylor       pointing         out
that    incitement           from      the        pitch       or     bad      behaviour           by

players       has     a major         influence             on     the      crowd.



Lord Justice              Taylor      agrees         with        the G o v e r n m e n t        that
                                                                              JWhfoM,
there    must        be    a move       towards            al 1 - s e a t e r ^ s t a d i a a n d

points       out that the m a c h i n e r y                for that           now exists           -

section        11     of    the       Football            Spectators               Act.          The

change         will         improve           safety             and        will          improve

behaviour,          and     we    propose           to    bring        it a b o u t .           Lord

Justice        Taylor        says       (116)            that       the      bulk         of     the

finances        for       ground      improvements                 must      be     raised        by

the    clubs        themselves,         and         the     Government             agrees.



The          Report         makes             a          number             of       detailed

recommendations              about gates,                g a n g w a y s and m a n y o t h e r

matters        relating          to    spectator              safety,            building         on

the     recommendations                of         the     Interim           Report.              The

Government           accepts          these        proposals,               some     of        which

can     be     implemented             immediately.                     Some       will         need

further work.               I propose             to p l a c e      in t h e       Library        of

the     House         a     detailed              response             to     the         various

recommendations              in C h a p t e r              of the           Report      so t h a t
Hon    Members        can         see     what    action         the    Government            is

taking      to     implement             them.



Hon     Members           will       recall        that       section         13      of     th e

Football         Supporters             Act     provides      for(the          setting        up

of^jthe F o o t b a l l        L i c e n s i n g A u t h o r i t y to s u p e r v i s e the

safety       responsibilities                    of      local         authorities            in

respect       of     designated               football      grounds.            We     intend

to     implement            the      provision.             Lord       Justice         Taylor

would     l i k e us to go f u r t h e r a n d                extend        t h e r e m i t of

the      Football              Licensing          Authority            to      cover         all

grounds       designated                under    the     1975      Safety       of     Sports

G r o u n d s Act,        a n d i n d e e d all ^ g r o u n d s j r e q u i r i n g s a f e t y

certificates              or    licences         under      Parts       III     and        IV of

the      1987         Act.                This        would        require            primary

legislation           and we will               have    to c o n s i d e r     the m a t t e r

further          and^^also               the     possibility             of        voluntary

interim       arrangements.



Part      III        of        the       Report        contains         a      number         of

p r o p o s a l s r e l a t i n g to c r o w d c o n t r o l       and h o o l i g a ni s m .
It     acknowledges               the        crucial       role        of    the     police        in

crowd control.                   S i r P e t e r p a y s t r i b u t e to t h e p o l i c e

generally            for       their         invaluable          work        in m a i n t a i n i n g

order      at    sports           events.            I want          to a d d m y       personal

tribute         to       his    and     to      thank      the       police        service        for

their      efforts,             without           which,        as    Sir     Peter        rightly

reminds          us,           many     sporting            events           could         not     be

permitted            to    take        place.         They       turn       out     to do w h a t

is     often         a    very        unpleasant           job.         They        often        face

derision,            abuse       and     assault,          and they endure                  it all

with      remarkable                  good        humour.             They        deserve         the

thanks      of e v er y           decent          citizen.



The Report               recognises           the    advances made                 in t h e      last

c o u p l e of y e a r s         in t h e e f f e c t i v e n e s s o f t h e p o l i c i n g

of f o o t b a l l ,       particularly              inside grounds,                a n d to t h e

major      impact          of CCTV           on     the    hooligan           problem.



Sir Peter            also       recognises           the great              potential         value

of     t he^ N a tional                 Football            Intelligence               Unit        in

dealing          with            f o o t b a 1 1 -re 1a ted            crime         and         with

hooligans            travelling              to m a t c h e s        abroad.
The     Report        recommends               the      creation            of     three        new

specific         offences              to     apply       at     designated               sports

grounds:          throwing             a missile;               chanting          obscene        or

racialist        abuse;               and    going       onto        the    pitch        without

reasonable           excuse.            It a l s o       asks        for    consideration

to    be g i v e n    to t h e         extending          of     the       courts'        powers

to    impose         attendance              centre       orders           and     electronic

tagging         in         sentencing                offenders              convicted            of

footbal1-related                  offences.                      I         welcome            these

recommendations                  in         principle.                Before            bringing

forward       any     legislative              proposals             to    implement           them

I     shall     look       carefully               at    the         practicalities              of

their     enforcement.



T h e r e a r e f u r t h e r r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s d i r e c t e d to p o l i c e

authorities           in    connection               with       charges           to     be    made

for     policing        inside              grounds,      and        to     the        police    in

connection           with         planning              their        operations,               with

communications              at    the match,              and        with       the     training

for     police        commanders              at     matches.               I    endorse        all

these      recommendations.
So     far     as       hooliganism                is     concerned.                Lord         .Justice

Taylor        takes           the        view      that        better         facilities               and

better             treatment               of       fans             will         bring           better

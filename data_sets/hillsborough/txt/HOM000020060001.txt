Control

Hampden Control will operate from the Police Control Hoom adjacent to the Tunnel.
All Chief inspectors, Inspectors and Sergeants will uplift a Hampden radio from
the Police Office and adopt the call sign allocated in relevant Section.  The
importance of maintaining a listening watch at all times and responding promptly
to calls from Hampden Control is stressed.  Radios can be returned to Hampden
Office or Craigie Street at the conclusion of duty. Officers must not leave
their designated place of duty without informing Hampden Control. Officers
in charge of reserve details will equip themselves with a loudhailer.

Safety Checks

On reporting to their appointed place of duty all officers in charge of details
will ensure that all emergency gates in their area are manned by stewards and
are unlocked. They will check the efficiency of each exit by having it physically
opened. Pass Gates should also be checked.    Hampden Control should be notified
when this has been done. They will ensure that all officers are aware of exit
routes and evacuation procedures (see below).

Turnstiles

Inspectors in charge of turnstile details will ensure that officers are in
position prior to turnstiles being opened. He will advise Hampden Control
when all turnstiles in his section are manned and open. Officers on turnstile
duties will ensure that orderly queues are formed and that, there is no crushing
or crowding.  Supervisory officers will respond promptly to any problems which
appear to be developing and advise Hampden Control.  If, owing to apprehensions,
manning levels fall below an adequate level Hampden Control should be notified
immediately. When the game starts and queues have cleared an appropriate
number of men will be left to cover the turnstiles remaining open.   The remainder
will report for redeployment on the terracing on the instructions of the officer
in charge of the detail.




Terracings

The Officer in charge will operate from the track in front of his designated
sections.  Officers on terracing duty will ensure that passageways and exit,
routes are kept clear. An even distribution of spectators throughout the
terracing area should be maintained.   Officers must be alert to crushing or
disorder in the crowd and if local measure cannot effectively remedy the
situation, Hampden Control must be notified immediately.   Spectator transfer
between sections is not permitted.   In the event of such a transfer being
necessary through overcrowding the officer in charge will seek permission
from the Divisional Commander.

Stand

The officer in charge will operate from the track in front of the stand.
It is a condition of the Safety Certificate that smoking is forbidden in the
seated area of the Stand. All officers will assist stewards in enforcing this
rule. Officers will identify themselves to the fire stewards (red bibs) and
acquaint themselves with fire points. Spectators must not be permitted to block
exit vomitaries or to stand or loiter on exit routes. Regular checks should
be made of exit routes from the Stand.

Track

Section Supervisors will ensure that each track gate is secure but unlocked
and manned prior to the admission of spectators. The officer in charge will
notify Hampden Control when this has been done. Officers on track duty will
face the crowd approximately 9 feet from the fence. No unauthorised encroach­
ment onto the track or playing field is permitted. Only police, ambulance men,
stewards and bibbed personnel are permitted on the track. Officers on track
duty should not, unless absolutely necessary, enter the terracings to deal with
outbreaks of disorder but should, in the first instance, have the matter brought
to the attention of the terracing detail. Officers should be particularly
vigilant in identifying any areas of the terracing where overcrowding appears
to be occurring and bring the attention of their supervisory officer to the
matter.   Priority must be given to ensuring that gates are manned at all times.


Prisoners

All prisoners will be taken to Hampden Police Office.  Prisoners should be
removed via the normal exits or onto the track and thence via the East or
West passageways.  They must not be escorted in front of the stand.  Once relieved
of their charge at the office one officer only will remain to complete the report.
Supervisors involved in arrest should remain at their post and delegate the escort
to a constable.

Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980

The provisions of this Act will be strictly enforced.      The following aide-memoire
is provided.

Evacuation

The decision to evacuate the ground partially or totally will be taken by the
Divisional Commander.

It will be the responsibility of officers in charge of details to ensure that
all police officers under their command are familiar with the general geographical
layout of the Stadium in order to obviate misunderstandings should their
assistance be urgently required at another part of the Stadium.

The officers in charge of reserve details will be equipped with a loudhailer
to assist in the evacuation of members of the public from the affected area
of the Stadium, should this become necessary.

Should circumstances allow, an al e r t i n g message will be broadcast by radio and
public address.

"Would Chief Inspector Eris contact the Control Room immediately.  Repeat.
 Would Chief Inspector Eris contact the Control Room immediately."

This message is only a warning and does not indicate that evacuation should
begin. Officers however should be alert to the imminent possibility of evacuation
and prepare accordingly by taking up suitable positions at exit routes.  If
the Divisional Commander authorises evacuation the public will be advised via
the public address system and police loudhailers to leave the ground or part of
the ground as directed.

If, following the alerting message evacuation is not necessary the Divisional
Commander will have the stand-down message broadcast by radio and public address.

 "All police and stewards return to normal duties.       Repeat.   All police and
 stewards return to normal duties."

 Should evacuation of the East/Centre/West Sections of the Main Stand become
 necessary, members of the public should be directed to safety in a calm and
 orderly manner by way of the nearest usable exit point, via the vomitaries or
 onto the track.

 Should evacuation of the terracing become necessary, members of the public will
 normally be directed to safety by way of the exit gates at the rear of the
 terracing. However, should the nature of the emergency situation render this
 i m p r a c t i c a l , members of the public will be directed to safety by way of t h e
 Track Access gates then round the side of the track to the nearest carriageway
 exit gate.

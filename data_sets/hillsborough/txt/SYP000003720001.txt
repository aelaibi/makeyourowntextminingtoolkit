quarter         to 'Nifhree. At /the                  time     of    reaching               the     turnstiles                 area ,

there      was       a    largeNtiass            of    fans     outside            the        t u r n s t i les a n d           I had

difficulty               in    reaching          the    turnstiles.                There          were      no       orderly

queues.         I could          not       see a n y      police          n ea r       to     the     turnstiles                but

I did      see       police          officers          on h o r s e b a c k        a       fe w y a r d s       away       n ear      to

the      gates,          shouting          and    trying        to    sort         out        the     crowd.          I

cannot         remember          seeing          any    stewards           at      the        turnstiles.

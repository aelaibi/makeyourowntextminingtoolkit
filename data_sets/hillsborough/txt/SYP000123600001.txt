          P Hayes Esq QPM
          Acting Chief Constable

          HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION

          You will no doubt be aware by now that Mr Leslie Sharp, QPM, Chief
          Constable of Cumbria, was appointed as the new Investigating Officer with
          effect from 1 April 1990. He is now in full command of the investigation
          and is responsible for deploying officers of the West Midlands Police
          investigation team. Consequently, any future communications on the
          Hillsborough investigation should be referred to him, care of Nechells
          Green Police Station, or anywhere else he may specify.

          The Inquests were concluded on Friday, 4 May 1990 and that day saw my
          departure from this investigation. With effect from Tuesday, 8 May 1990, I
          took up a temporary post at the Police Staff College at Bramshill as the
          Assistant Chief Constable to the Senior Command Course. The purpose of
          this letter, therefore, is to indicate my departure and at the same time
          express my gratitude to you and your staff for the very professional way in
          which our relations have been over the past twelve months. In expressing
          these sentiments I also reflect those of my colleagues with whom I have been
          privileged to work.

          With Mr Sharp at the helm I feel certain that there will be no loss of
          momentum nor loss of continuity, especially as Detective Chief
          Superintendent Mick Foster remains with the team. Of course, whilst I will
          be in Hampshire I will be available to give Mr Sharp any assistance he
          requires.

   7*    ( In saying thank you can I also express my appreciation of the efforts made
        K by Mr Stuart Anderson, Assistant Chief Constable, Chief Superintendent Don
         (Denton and Police Constable Ken Greenaway.


                                                                         Cont....



  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T          L.lpyd House, Birmingham

I fully appreciate that the past year has been a most traumatic one for
South Yorkshire. In closing, therefore, can I wish the Force well, with Mr
Wells at the helm and you as an able support.

                                              HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY
                                                   15 APRIL, 1989

  1. The Authority have now completed a careful and detailed examination of the report
  and the evidence relating to the individual complaints arising from the Hillsborough
  tragedy on 15 April, 1989. We have considered Mr Anderson's memoranda, subm itted to
  us in accordance with the provisions of Section 90(5) of the Police and Criminal
  Evidence Act, 198^, and his letter of 10 April, 1991. We have noted your force's
  proposals not to prefer disciplinary charges against any of the officers who are the
  subject of complaint and your reasons for these proposals. However, as I told Mr
  Anderson on the telephone, the Authority were disappointed that he did not explain
  your reasons more fully. We have also taken into account the views expressed by Mr
  Sharp, the investigating officer.

  2. Having considered the evidence relating to the complaints against Police Constable
  Smith, Police Constable Illingworth, Superintendent Marshall or Superintendent Green­
  wood we have concluded th at the evidence in respect of thesea toyr
                                                                  four officers does not
   justify disciplinary p roceed in gs and w e agree with your proposal.

  3. We have also considered those complaints which have been laid against Chief
  Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray which allege th at they were in
  'neglect of duty*. These complaints raise difficult issues. In reaching our conclusions
  we have borne in mind the decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions as one
  factor amongst others. As you are aware we do not accept that culpable misfeasance
  and neglect of duty are coterminous nor th at, even if they were, wewould be bound (as
  far as discipline is concerned) by the decision of the Director not to bring criminal
  prosecutions. We have, throughout, borne in mind the definition of neglect of duty set
  out in paragraph & of Schedule 1 of The Police (Discipline) Regulations, 1985.

    fy. The incident which gave rise to the tragedy     •             '          .•            on 15
    April, 1989 would not have occurred had sensible cr                                   ■ <o secure
    the safety of spectators in Pens 3 and h on the                       !   Terraces,     It is clear
    that the basic cause of the disaster was overcrowdi-                                      We have
    concentrated on this m atter.

    5, In reaching our decisions we have taken into account various
    advanced as arguments for taking no disciplinary a c tio n on the grounds th                • '^ y
    such action would be unfair and/or oppressive. Amongst such m atters we ret.                - -*»!:
    to the following!

                     a. the passage of time since 15 April, 19S9;

                     b, the various consequences arising from the earlier hearings
                     before Lord justice Taylor and the Coroner;

                     c* the e ffe c t of the extensive media coverage o f the incident
                     Itself, m atters associated, with It and the hearings referred to in
                     b. above;

                     d. the perception th at if any officer is charged he may be seen
                     as a scapegoat carrying the blame for the acts or omissions of
                     others;
                     e* the recent promotion of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
                     the fact th a t he took over the match arrangements devised by
                     someone e lse and his b e lie f th a t th e plan had o p e ra te d
                     successfully before;

                     f. the anguish which both Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
                     Superintendent Murray must have experienced as the result of the
                     tragic and unexpected events on 15 April, 1989, and

                     g, the e ffe c t that disciplinary action against any officer would
                     have on the morale and well-being of the South             Yorkshire
                     Police,
    6. Despite these factors it cannot be denied that the police, under the control of Chief
    Super indent Duckenfield, assisted by Superintendent Murray, were de facto in control of
    the ground at the relevant tim e and had responsibility for the safety of the spectators.
    In t h e opinion of this A u th o r ity there is sufficient evidence to support disciplinary
    charges on the following grounds;

                     a* Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, as the officer in overall
                     command, failed to address himself properly to the problems
                     involved in, and the plans for, crowd control even before the
                     spectators arrived;

                     b. failed to monitor the numbers of spectators entering Pens 3
                     and
                                                                                             PAGE.0 0 4

                      c. failed to take any action when Pens

                      Superintendent Murray, failed to take any                         *

                      that Pens 3 and k were, or were likely to beer •     overcrowded.

     7. In the view of this Authority responsibility for the s-uiety of those in Pens 3 and %
     and blame for overcrowding in those pens should rest with those in the Police Control
     Box from which the pens could be observed, the deployment of police manpower could
     be directed and the decision to open G ate        was made with its attendant responsible
     ity lor controlling those who .entered through it. The Authority are conscious ©f the
     complex circumstances which ma^ have contributed to the tragedy, but we do not
     accept that the fa c t th at there 'may be others who are also in some way blameworthy,
     should cause us to decide against the recommendation of charges under the Regulations
     if,, as here, the evidence is available to support such charges. You will appreciate, th e
     Authority are concerned solely with the evidence in respect of the m atters which are
     the subject of complaint and.not with mitigation which would only become relevant if 3
     breach of discipline were to be proved against an officer who is th e subject of a
     charge.

     8. For these reasons th a t the Authority, have decided to recommend under Section
     93(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 19S§ that the following charges be
     brought against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield;

                     i. Neglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph fr(a) of Schedule 1 of
                     the Police (Discipline) Regulations 198,5 in that he failed to
                     acquaint himself with the planning and problems related to the
                     control of the semi-final.

                     li, Neglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1 of
                     the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to
                     monitor crowd numbers in Pens 3 and 4.

                     ill. Neglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule 1
                     of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to
                     act when Pens 3 and 4 were obviously overcrowded.

                     lv. Neglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 1(a) of Schedule 1
                     of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in that he failed to
                     control the movement of supporters subsequent to the opening of
                     Gate fC f.

    9. We have given separate attention to the degree of responsibility attributable to
    Superindent Murray, We concluded that in view of .Chief Superintendent DuckenfieldV
    very recent appointm ent„and promotion to his position as Divisional Commander,
    Superintendent Murray had a special responsibility to assist and advise Chief Super­
    intendent Duckenfield particularly in view of Superintendent Murray’s greater exper­
    ience of policing a t Hillsborough, He was aware that authority had been given to open
    Gate 'C ,

         , « t th5 ef?re recommend under Section 93(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence
     Act 1984 that Superintendent Murray also be charged with:

                  Neglect of Duty - contrary to paragraph 4(a) of Schedule i of the
                  Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in th at he failed to control
                  the movement o f supporters subsequent to the opening of Gate


     11.   We have also carefully considered the allegation th at Chief Superintendent
    Duckenfield was deceitful and misled senior police officers and members of the public.
    We do not agree with the investigating o fficer's conclusions that this m atter is not
    substantiated. It is clear th at Mr Kelly, Mr Kirtin and Mr Mackrell were told by Chief
    Superintendent Duckenfield th at Gate 'C had been forced, and th at there had been an
    in-rush of Liverpool supporters. JVhile we are aware that he did not wish to encourage
    a hostile reaction which might impede rescue work we share the opinion of Lord Justice
    Taylor th at this did not require anyone being told a falsehood.        This misleading
    explanation led to serious allegations being made against Liverpool supporters in General
    causing grave offence and distress,

    12 We have, therefore, decided to recommend under Section 9X1) of the Police and
    Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that Chief Superintendent Duckenfield also be charged
    with:                                                                 °

                 Discreditable Conduct - contrary to paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 of
                 the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 in th at he acted in a
                 manner likely to bring discredit on the reputation of the force or
                 the police service*

    13. I would be grateful for your response to our recommendations as soon as possible.

    14. If you accept the Authority's recommendations we shall be minded, in view of the
    exceptional circum stances affecting this case, to direct th at the charges are heard by a
    tribunal, in accordance with Section 94(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
    1QB/i

     15,   I would       .cularly request that you maintain the confidentiality, of this
    correspondence until such tim e as the procedures laid down in the Act for determining
    the disciplinary charges to be preferred have been com pleted. This will involve not
    informing those against whom we are agreed th at no charges should be preferred until
    the whole m atter has been resolved between us.

                             HILLSBOROUGH   1989



Friday 10 May 1991 at 1100 hours.

Telephone conversation from Peter Hayes, Deputy Chief      Constable of South
Yorkshire and Mr L Sharp, Chief Constable of Cumbria.      In South Yorkshire,
Assistant Chief Constable G Moore was listening in on a    satellite telephone
as he was now responsible for Complaints and Discipline    in South Yorkshire.

Mr Hayes explained that he had sent a copy of a PCA letter dated 7 May 1991
to Mr Sharp.    In the letter the PCA were suggesting that disciplinary
changes  should be    laid against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
Superintendent  Murray.     Mr   Hayes   was  of   the  view  that  the  PCA
recommendations  were   in  conflict   with  those   made  by  Mr  Sharp  as
Investigating Officer.

Mr Sharp acknowledged receipt of a copy of the PCA letter.

Mr Hayes asked Mr Sharp if he would be prepared to set out the detailed
reasoning which lay behind his recommendations and conclusions in his
reports on the disciplinary aspects of the complaints against Chief
Superintendent Duckenfild and Superintendent Murray.    Mr Sharp agreed to
this but suggested that a copy of the PCA letter should be released to
Detective Chief Superintendent Foster, who headed the West Midlands Police
investigative   team   even  though  the   PCA  letter was  classified  as
"Confidential".   This was agreed and has been done.

Mr Sharp then referred to the PCA letter at paragraph 5(b) and expressed
surprise that the PCA would have been able to study the transcripts of
evidence given at the Hillsborough Inquest before writing the letter.   The
verdict of the Inquest seemed to suggest that the conclusions reached by
the Investigating Officer and the South Yorkshire Police in respect of the
complaints   and discipline were justified.      He   suggested that South
Yorkshire Police should study the transcripts of the evidence given at the
Inquest   because  they   may  provide   additional  evidence   to  justify
disciplinary proceedings, or discredit such a process.

Mr Hayes agreed that he would arrange for that to be done.

Mr Sharp also pointed out that paragraphs 9 and 10 of the PCA letter were
worthy of detailed scrutiny because at first reading they did not appear to
be persuasive.

Commitment made for further communication    with   a   view   to   responding   in
detail to the PCA before 31 May 1991.

DATE: 11 December 1990                           TIME: 12 noon

FROM: Mervyn Jones, DCC Cheshire

TO:




May I speak to Mr Sharp please?



REPLY:      Mr   Sharp   is   not   in   the   office   today



FURTHER:     In that case I will dictate a message that you may wish to pass
to him.

First of all number one priority is to \

I have been speaking to Detective Chief Superintendent Mick Foster and he
had indicated that he intended to attend some of the inquests to hear some
of the edvidence of some of the police officers from South Yorkshire. He
has specifically mentioned those officers in the control box of federated
ranks and suggested there could be discipline implications.

I did not expect such involvement, especially as there is a record of the
proceedings made by stenographers transcript.

The question is, did he intend to come to theinquests himself to hear any
of the evidence of the officers concerned, or did he expect Mr Foster or



any other members of the team to do this?

I do not think it is necessary because Detective Superintendent Beechy
and/or myself are there all the time and could liaise with Mr Sharp if it
became necessary.   Incidentally, Mr Beechy is n ow restored to full duty as
a result of Mr Shar p’s and my involvement.

There is also another issue, that of finance that to increase the size of
the team with the inquests seemingly now being prolonged could cause
financial embarrassment to South Yorkishire Police.    Your early advice
would be apporeciated.

Once again,

You can tell Mr Sharp that I have said no at the moment unless he says yes.

REPLY:     I will pass your message to Mr Sharp.

After speaking to Mr Sharp passed the undermentioned message    to Mr Mervyn
Jones at Sheffield



I have spoken to Mr Sharp and he asked that the following message be passed
to y o u . :

I certainly do not intend attending the inquests and in fact I am no longer
part of the inquiry having submitted all my reports.  I am n o w off the case
and have no more interest in it until I am alerted again.     Mick Foster is
now working to his own Chief Constable, Ron Hatfield, and Mervyn Jones must
deal with any *to-ing and fro-ing* through the Chief Constable of West
Mi dla n d s .

I do not intend attending any of the inquests. There is no reason for Mick
Foster to attend any of the inquests. The person(s) attending ought to be
Mervyn Jones, as coroners officer or other members of the team who have
been specifically picked for it.

I will speak to Mervyn Jones when I get back to the office.




REPLY (from Mervyn Jones)

Thank you. There is no need for Mr Sharp to ring me now I fully understand.

HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS
MONDAY 19TH NOVEMBER 1990 AND ONWARDS

Further to our useful meeting on Monday 29th October 1990, I wish to confirm
the attached appendix as the list of those South Yorkshire Police Officers whom
the Coroner intends to call as witnesses at the resumed inquests on 19th
November onwards.   The purpose of the list is to act as a provisional warning
at this stage and I should be grateful if you would undertake to advise me when
they have all been warned.   Please also note there may be additional officers
to be called and the attached list is, therefore, not necessarily exhaustive.

 As we support the Coroner, we will learn more precisely in which order he intends
 to call your officers, with an indication of the week in which it is possible
 they will be required to give evidence.   Nearer the time we will be able to
 give the day they will be required, operating on a system not too dissimilar to
 Crown Court warning.   It would be helpful if you could indicate which officer
 you intend to nominate as your Liaison Officer to carry out the warnings on our
 behalf acting for the Coroner.

 I am aware that there is at least one officer listed _________________________
 The Coroner will obviously consider this officer's position carefully;    however,
                           ________            -   ________ -.. ._____ a____ ♦ _.1_f_-x._»____a

                       This requirement will also relate to any officers who
 are in a similar position.   Whilst Superintendent Beechey is in overall charge
 on my behalf, Detective Inspector Perkins will be responsible for witness warning.
 If you, or your nominated officer, have any difficulties, please do not hesitate
  to contact me or Mrs                     I

 With regard to the other matter of Mr Spearritt's criticism, I have written to
 Silverman Livermore and I enclose a copy of my letter to them for your information
 and retention.   Like you, I now await a response.   I have copied this letter
 to Mr Sharp, who is still the Investigating Officer, for his information.

  If the matter does lead to a complaint which you wish him to investigate, he may
  well select a senior West Midlands Officer, not connected with the inquests, to
  carry out the investigation.




   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
Continuation Sheet




I trust this letter is of assistance.   If I can help in any other way,
please do not hesitate to make contact by letter or telephone.

Incidentally, I am forwarding this list to you as a convenience to me
and the individual officers and their respective management, so that,
in due course, duty can be adjusted accordingly.

Yours sincerely

        Dear Sirs,

        ADAM SPEARRITT

        I have been shown a letter dated 25th October 1990 from you                          to Me K S ANDERSON, QPM,
        Assistant Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police by him in                          respect of the above
        named.  1 have also been shown a letter from Mr ANDERSON to                          you dated 4th September
        1990 which, in my opinion, amounts to an apology although X                          am far from sure that
        such an apology was necessary.

        I do remember that Mr SPEARRITT did contact me by telephone recently, on Tuesday
        18th September 1990 in fact, when he raised the issue. At that time Mr SPEARRIT.T
        said that he had had the letter read to him and that he was dissatisfied with the
        outcome.   He said at that time he thought there was a 'cover up* about the
        circumstances.   I responded by saying that I failed to see that there was any kind
        of cover up or why there should be a motivation for one especially in the light of
        the apology which it seemed to roe on what Mr SPEARRITT was saying dealt with all the
        detail.   However, X pointed out that if he was unhappy about the outcome he should
        raise the matter with his solicitor who in turn should raise the matter with Mr
        ANDERSON.   That, in sum, is my knowledge only to add that I have spoken to the Vest
        Midlands Police Officer who was in contact with Mr SPEARRITT and he has advised me
         that whilst the criticism was raised be never understood that M r SPEARRITT was
        making a formal complaint} had he done so the Officer would have properly recorded
         the fact in accordance with P.A.C.E.

         It seems to me that the matter needs clarification for the benefit of Mr ANDERSON
         who is responsible in South Yorkshire for recording, such complaints. Perhaps you
         would be so good a» to establish this from your client and advise Mr ANDERSON.

          I hope this is of assistance to you.                     1 have copied this letter to H e ANDERSON for
         his information.



          Your* faithfully,

HILLSBOROUGH 1989

I enclose for your information a copy of a letter I have received from the
Clerk to the South Yorkshire Police Authority in connection with the
complaints made against Mr Walter Jackson, Assistant Chief Constable.

You will see that the Authority has agreed to defer further consideration
of the matter until after the inquests are concluded.   I understand that
the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police has decided not to consider
further the complaints made against the other officers (not of ACPO rank)
until the conclusion of the inquests, but I have not received written
confirmation of that.

        Dear Mr Sharp
        HILLSBOROUGH - ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE, MR WALTER JACKSON
      The Police Authority met today to consider the present position concerning
      the complaints by Mr Trevor Hicks against ACC Mr Walter Jackson. They were
      informed of the decision of the Police Complaints Authority touching on the
      complaints against other officers which is that further consideration is to
      be deferred until after the inquests. In the light of this, the Authority
      also decided to defer further consideration of Mr Jackson’s case. I
      confirm, however, when ultimately they do consider it, they have asked that
      you address them and we can talk about this towards the end of the inquests.

Dear Hr Hayes

HILLSBOROUGH 1989

In response to our recent telephone conversation on 10 Hay 1991 I write to
say that I have now had the opportunity to study the copy of the Police
Complaints Authority letter of 7 Hay 1991.

I have set out, in this letter,   the detailed reasoning which lay behind the
recommendations and conclusions   in my Complaints and Discipline reports in
respect of Chief Superintendent   Duckenfield and Superintendent Hurray.   In
addition, I have made reference   to the points and issues raised by the PCA
in its letter.

It cannot be argued that the PCA is not bound by the decisions of the
Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of the criminal conduct issues
because the PCA has to consider whether or not the complaints are
substantiated and whether disciplinary charges should be laid.  However, it
could be argued that if the evidence required to prove a criminal offence
is identical to the evidence required to prove a disciplinary offence, and
the decision of the DPP is that there is insufficient evidence to prove the
criminal offence, then it follows that there will be insufficient evidence
to prove the disciplinary offence.

The PCA is of the view that the ancient criminal offence of "culpable
malfeasance" is not coterminous with "neglect of duty".    That is to say the
least, arguable.    Every malfeasance or culpable non-feasance of an officer
of justice, which includes a police officer, in respect of his office, is a
misdemeanour at Common Law.      The case-law arises predominently from very
old cases which arose out of failure to do things required to be done
because of the a c cused’s office, (see CROWTHER s CASE (1593) Cro. Eliz. 654
and R v WYAT (1705) 1 Salk 380).    The cases indicate there is an offence of
a public officer wilfully neglecting to perform a duty which he is bound to
perform by common law or statute but the neglect has to be wilful and not
merely inadvertent.     It has to be culpable in the sense of being without


                                       1
reasonable excuse or justification.     In this sense culpability is not
restricted to corruption or dishonesty but has to be of such a degree the
misconduct impugned is calculated to injure the public interest. It would
be for the jury to decide whether the evidence revealed the necessary
degree of culpability in performing a duty badly which would include
"neglect of duty".  (R v DYTHAM (1979) 2QB 722).

It does not appear to be necessary to prove that by so doing, or not doing,
the accused intended to gain some personal benefit or advantage but it may
be that in appropriate cases, e.g. a Registrar, there must be a beneficiary
to whose interest there has been no proper regard.

From that it can be argued that the offence of "culpable malfeasance"
requires proof of a degree of negligence or recklessness which is closely
akin to "neglect of duty".      It is my view that the mental element required
to prove "culpable malfeasance" is the same as for the disciplinary offence
of "neglect of duty".       In view of the D P P ’s decision      in respect of
"culpable malfeasance" it would be quite wrong, in my view, to pursue
disciplinary charges of "neglect of dut y" , particularly as the Inquest Jury
brought in a verdict of "Accidental Death".      The Inquest j u r y ’s verdict of
"accident" taken together with the D P P ’s decision not to prosecute for
"culpable malfeasance" is a powerful argument, in my view, for not pursuing
disciplinary charges of "Neglect of Duty".       It would appear that the PCA
has taken cognisance of the fact that each case should be considered on its
merits and has decided        that in all the circumstances it is "fair and
appropriate" to bring disciplinary proceedings.          I find this view a
difficult one to support but should such proceedings follow then it would
probably be appropriate for any accused officer to be served with a copy of
the D P P ’s letter of decision, after consultation with the DPP.

There can be no argument about the definition of "neglect of duty" which is
clearly set out in Schedule 1 of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985.
The definition, I suggest, is one which rules out any suggestion that it is
one of the disciplinary offences where the mental element necessary for a
finding of guilt is less than that for most criminal offences.  The offence
requires proof of neglect, and it is at least arguable that it is not
sufficient merely to show that the act or omission was caused through a
lack of due care.

The     PCA, in its letter  at paragraph    4, makes   it clear  that  its
deliberations have been centred upon the core of the issue, that is to say
the overcrowding in Pens 3 and 4, but in paragraph 7 of the PCA letter it
is recognised that there were      "complex circumstances which may have
contributed to the tragedy".    My view is that the core issues are too
complex a matter to say that the tragedy would not have occurred had
sensible and simple steps been taken to secure the safety of spectators.
(Para 4 of PCA letter).    Hindsight is not appropriate, foresight is the
is s u e.

The  passage  of   time    since  15  April  1989,  of   itself,  is not an
overwhelmingly persuasive issue, but taken with the decision of the DPP and
the verdict of the Co r oner’s Jury it is certainly very persuasive.

Similarly, the earlier hearings before Lord Justice Taylor should not be
conclusive either to prosecute discipline charges or to discredit them. It
should not be forgotten that those hearings were not based upon sworn


                                        2
testimony, whereas the Coroner’s Verdict of accident, was.          What the
transcripts of the Inquest reveal is a matter for you, as are the words of
the Coroner and his Jury.   I wonder if the PCA have had the opportunity to
study  these   transcripts,  particularly    those  of  Chief  Superintendent
Duckenfield and Superintendent Hurray.     Those transcripts of evidence are
over and above my Investigating O f f icer’s report which received the P C A ’s
certificate of satisfaction before the Inquests were concluded.           The
evidence given at the Inquest was probed thoroughly by skilled lawyers
representing the complainants so they must be relevant to any consideration
as to discipline.

Neither would I dismiss so lightly the detrimental effect that the
extensive,  and  often   contradictory  media  coverage  has   had  on   the
possibility of a fair hearing for any accused officers.    It is the chance
of a "fair trial" which is important, more so than the anguish of the
accused officers or the morale and well-being of South Yorkshire Police.

Now to address the specific    disciplinary   offences   proposed   against Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield.

(i)      Neglect of Duty in that he failed to acquaint himself with the
         planning and problems related to the control of the semi-final.

         The only clue in the PCA letter as      to how this   offence could be
         proved is at paragraph 6(a):-

         "Chief Superintendent   Duckenfield, as the officer  in overall
         command,  failed to address himself properly to the problems
         involved in, and the   plans for, crowd control even before the
         spectators arrived."

         My report at paragrapahs R22 to R47 covers the aspects of written
         instructions available to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield before
         the event.    Paragraphs R48 to R58 cover what he actually did
         before the event.   Although I have not studied the transcripts of
         evidence given at the Inquests, I am       of  the view that Chief
         Superintendent Duckenfield did enough in his planning, orders and
         briefings to satisfy      the requirements of  the South Yorkshire
         Police Standing Instructions.     Time was short;     he was newly
         promoted into an area where Hillsborough events were prominent;
         to a considerable degree he had no reason not to take the well-
         tried and overtly successful South Yorkshire Police System as he
         found it;   he received the best possible advice and followed it;
         and he knew that on the day he would have a very experienced team
         working with him with reserve resources available to deal with
         unforeseen contingencies.   It is difficult to see how the proposed
         disciplinary offence could be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

(ii)     Neglect of Duty by failing to monitor crowd numbers in Pens 3 and
         4.

         I can add nothing to paragraphs R91 to R98 of my report. Given the
         facilities available to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield on the
         day he did not, and could not monitor the crowd numbers in the
         fateful pens.   The issue is linked to the question of whether he
         should have done so, an issue addressed at some length in my


                                       3
         report, and to the South Yorkshire Police policy of the day that
         the crowd would find its own level.

 (iii)    Neglect of Duty by failing to act when Pens 3 and 4 were obviously
         overcrowded.

         Paragraphs R103 to Rill consider this matter and the crucial
         question is whether or not Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was
         aware that Pens 3 and 4 were seriously overcrowded, in time for
         him to take action to alleviate it.      My report discusses this
         issue at some length and raises the problems there would be in
         trying to prove such an assertion.    The overcrowding might well
         have been obvious to others, but that begs the question.

 (iv)     Neglect of Duty by failing to control the movement of supporters
         subsequent to the opening of Gate C.

         In support of this charge I would refer you to paragraphs R142 to
         R143 of my report.   There can be no doubt that the opening of Gate
         C was a life-saving act;       that having opened Gate C, Chief
         Superintendent Duckenfield monitored the situation inside the
         stadium;   that other important matters were competing for his
         attention;  and I draw your attention to paragraphs R147 to R156
         of my report.     Paragraphs R157 to R178 contain the arguments
         setting out the difficulties of proving the charge.


In so far as Superintendent Hurray   is concerned the PCA   is proposing only
one disciplinary charge:-

(v)       Neglect of Duty by failing to control the movement of supporters
         subsequent to the opening of Gate C.

         In support of that charge the PCA points out that because of Chief
         Superintendent Duckenfield’s recent promotion and appointment,
         Superintendent Hurray had a special responsibility to assist and
         advise Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, particularly in view of
         Superintendent   H u r r a y ’s greater experience   of   policing
         Hillsborough.

         It is not absolutely clear but the PCA seems to be suggesting that
         it was right that Superintendent Hurray should act on the orders
         of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield to give directions for Gate C
         to be opened, but he should have gone further by virtue of his
         greater experience, and given orders for police officers to be
         deployed to receive those spectators who entered the ground
         through the open Gate C.

         It  seems   that  the  PCA  takes  the  view  that  either  Chief
         Superintendent Duckenfield, or Superintendent Hurray, or both of
         them should have controlled the movement of spectators subsequent
         to the opening of Gate C.

         The question of individual and subordinate responsibility is
         considered in my Complaints and Discipline Report in respect of
         Superintendent Hurray at paragraphs Rll to R14.   The paragraphs


                                      4
         which relate to this particular disciplinary charge are at R.28 to
         R.36, but particularly R43 to R55 and paragraphs R43 to R55 and
         paragraphs R56 to R 5 8 .

          It could be argued that either the point of view of Chief
          Superintendent Duckenfield is taken, i.e. that he had to rely on
          the officers in the command structure using their discretion to
          act to the situation as they saw fit, or he should have given
          specific orders himself.  If that be so, then it seems quite wrong
          that two senior officers should face a disciplinary charge arising
          from the same failure to act.   The police structure of individual
          discretion, responsibility and accountability suggests that if any
          officer is to be disciplined for this offence, it ought to be one
          or the other.


Finally,  I  turn   to   the   proposal   to   discipline   Chief   Superintendent
Duckenfield for:-

(vi)     Discreditable Conduct by acting in a manner likely to bring
          discredit on the reputation of the force or the police service.

         The PCA feels that it is clear Hr Kelly, Hr Kirtin and Hr Hackrell
         were told by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield that Gate C had been
         forced and that there had been an inrush of Liverpool supporters.
         The PCA accepts there was a need to deter hostile reaction which
         might have impeded the rescue work, but this did not require the
         telling of any falsehoods.

          The PCA suggests that the misleading explanation given by Chief
          Superintendent Duckenfield to the persons named above, resulted in
          serious allegations being made against Liverpool supporters in
          general causing grave offence and distress.

          Paragraph R233 of my report in respect of Chief Superintendent
          Duckenfield addresses the point, and the paragraphs that follow
          indicate some of the possible defences (NOT mitigation) which
          Chief Superintendent Duckenfield could raise should he be called
          to answer the disciplinary charge.

          I am not aware of what was said about the matter at the Inquests,
          if the matter was raised at all.   Also I would draw attention to
          my Complaints and Discipline Report in respect of Hr Walter
          JACKSON,  then   an  Assistant  Chief  Constable,  where  similar
          questions are addressed at paragraphs R47 to R50.  In that report
          there is an explanation as to how a misunderstanding could have
          arisen (paragraphs R53 to R62).  The report on Hr Jackson is with
          the South Yorkshire Police Authority because of the rank held by
          Hr Jackson at the time.

          In my report on Chief Superintendent Duckenfield paragraphs R240
          to R244 discuss the question specifically.

In conclusion, may I say that the PCA letter points out that it is concerned
solely with the evidence in respect of the matters subject of complaint, and
not with mitigation.   Although the Inquest transcripts may bring to light


                                          5
matters not covered in my Complaints and Discipline Reports, the problems of
proving the disciplinary offences proposed by the PCA are formidable.

I hope that this letter will assist you with your considerations.   All of
the  information  contained  therein   is  covered in the  Complaints  and
Discipline Reports already submitted to you.

I shall be considering the PCA letter further in consultation with Detective
Chief Superintendent FOSTER of West Midlands Police and I will contact you
again in the near future.

    Dear ^
    COMPLAINTS BY MR TREVOR HICKS AGAINST ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE MR VALTER
    JACKSON OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE - HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY
    I thought you may like to know the outcome of these complaints. The South
    Yorkshire Police Authority have now considered your report and as it
    appeared to them that no disciplinary offences had been committed, no
    disciplinary action against Assistant Chief Constable Mr Jackson is
    appropriate.
    On behalf of the Police Authority in South Yorkshire may I take this
    opportunity to thank you for the kind and courteous way in which you dealt
    with the matter and have treated the Authority throughout.

                       I am     the    father        of Victoria          Jane    and    Sarah       Louise    HICKS       who

                       died     in    the      Hillsborough          tragedy      on     15    April      1989.        I    am

                       Chairman       of       the   Hillsborough          Family       Support       Group.      It       was

                       either      on the       evening of 5 February                  1990    or on the        following

                       day,    6 February 1990 that my attention was drawn to an article

                       in    the     Sheffield Star Newspaper                dated Monday            5 February        1990.

                       The     article         referred        to    featured       on    several         pages   of       the

                       newspaper and was              also mentioned             in the       editorial column.             In

                       this article the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police,                                          Mr

                       Peter       WRIGHT,       announced          his   retirement          and    he   is   quoted       as

                       saying,        and      it    is   my    belief      he     did        say,    several     remarks
Continued statement of TREVOR HICKS                                                                                        Page 2




                      concerning        evidence        relating            to    the        disaster              and     to    the

                      forthcoming inquests.                  I considered some of these remarks to be

                      a   breach     of privileged            information          and       I        subsequently made               a

                      complaint by letter to the South Yorkshire Police Authority on

                      7      February      1990.In      this       letter     I outlined several                        areas    of

                      complaint which            I will now expand upon.                          I have          been shown a

                      copy    of     the       letter    I     sent    to        the    Police              Authority          and    I

                      acknowledge that it is a true copy.

                      My specific complaints are as follows:

                       (1)     Any    information which               was     in Mr         WRIGHT'S              possession         is

                               confidential           and      I    consider           it        is     a    breach        of    his

                               privileged position for him to have said -

                               and that they were under the influence of drink, but that

                               it had no effect on the events.                                   I found          that a       little

                             The    article          reports       that       - He    found        it hard         to    accept

                             TAYLOR's conclusion that drink h ad no bearing on the r u n ­

                             up    to    the    95    deaths.           "There       is    a   Coroner's           h e ari ng—

                             and I think perhaps                   a different            picture will            emerge"       he

                             said today.

                             These reports both directly and indirectly infer that he

                             had        information           in        his     possession             and        that      this

                             information         related           to    alcohol          levels       among       the     fans,

                             particularly the deceased.                        Even if it did not relate as

                             he    inferred then any such information                              is confidential               to

                             himself       and       the   Coroner's           Office        and   I        consider       it     a

                             breach       of    his    privileged             position         that     he    should        even

                             have       inferred       that     this would paint                a different             picture

                             to’-the conclusions of the TAYLOR report.

                       (2)   I consider that my second specific complaint in my letter

                             is self-explanatory and is again bas ed on the article                                              in

                             the Sheffield Star on 5 February 1990.                                 I accept that the

                             exact       quotation         includes           the    w ord     "may"        and     that    this

                             could be          inferred more             of a suggestion than a                     statement

                             but nonetheless               I believe          this    prejudges             the verdict          of

                             the        Coroner.           This         is    clearly          outside        Mr      WRIGHT'S

                             authority         and     insults          the   jurisdiction             of    the    Coroner's

                             Office.

                       (3)   I     believe       that      Mr      WRIGHT'S          pronouncements               during     the

                             Sheffield Star interview and the rest of the media could

                             prejudice Inquest Jurors who will of course be drawn from

                             the area covered by the newspaper cited.

                       (4)    Mr WRIGHT            infers       in the pronouncements                     in the        Sheffield

                              Star           on   5     February        1990        that        "There      is      a    lot     of

                              information              to come out           that has           not already come            out".

                              He has          therefore failed to do his job.                              If he was        aware

                              of information that was material to Lord Justice TAYLOR'S

                              conclusions he                 should have        ensured           it was     placed before

                              him.            I   accept        that    if    any       information         came        into    his

                              possession               after    Lord Justice            TAYLOR       closed his           receipt

                                  of       written      evidence        then       Mr       WRIGHT        could     hardly       be

                                  expected        to    do     so.     However          I   find     it    incredible          that

                                  there should be              "a lot of information"                 available in this

                                  short space of time.

                       (5)( 6 )        I   will    deal        with    complaints            (5)     and     (6 )       together.

                                  Basically what             I am saying is that                   if Mr WRIGHT has             any

                                  additional           information,          whether         it    relates        to    drink    or

                                  not,      it similarly would be                  confidential            and as        outlined

                                  in complaint (1 ) would be breach of privilege if released

                                  publicly,       if as I suspect this is the same information as

                                  was      available         to TAYLOR       i.e.       - post       mortem       reports       and

                                  Professor USHER'S summary then clearly this cannot be new

                                  or       additional.           Clearly       under         these    circumstances             his

                                  pronouncements constitute a deliberate attempt to mislead

                                  and/or influence prospective jurors.

                       (7)        Despite         the     fact        that    Mr        WRIGHT       is     quoted        in    the

                                  Sheffield Star editorial on the article                                  in the newspaper

                                  as       calling      the     TAYLOR       report         a     "Superb        document"       he

                                  persists        in     claiming        that       the      primary       conclusions          are

                              wrong.      I believe this behaviour to be the application of

                              double      standards         by    the    Chief    Constable        and    I        consider

                                such behaviour to be the worst of unprofessional conduct,

                                and I suspect his motives for doing so.                            I believe he             is

                                trying    to       divert    blame       away    from    the    South             Yorkshire

                                Police and on to the fans.

                       It is my complaint that in making these claims now and publicly

                       Mr WRIGHT has committed a disagraceful act.                             That      this act           is

                       quite clearly not what should be expected from a chief officer,

                       that it could affect the Inquest's                       impartiality and finally it

                       appears    to     be    a    blatant       attempt        to   distort      the        course        of

                       justice.     By    this       I mean       that at       the   time   the pronouncements

                       were made       it was      not known        to Mr WRIGHT        or     anybody else               that

                       the   inqtffests       would     be        non-adversarial,           and     it           could    be

                       construed that Mr WRIGHT'S motives                        were   designed         to       influence

                       the verdict of the Coroner's inquest.

                       I   sign   this    statement          on    the    understanding         that          I    will     be

                       I   am    the    father         of Victoria          Jane    and     Sarah       Louise     HICKS        who

                       day,     6 February 1990 that my attention was drawn to an article

                       The      article          referred        to    featured      on     several          pages     of       the

                       this article the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police,                                               Mr

                       Peter     WRIGHT,           announced          his   retirement           and    he   is    quoted        as

                       saying,         and       it    is   my    belief      he     did        say,     several       remarks

                      concerning          evidence       relating          to     the        disaster         and     to     the

                      forthcoming inquests.                  I considered some of these remarks to be

                      a breach      of privileged             information             and    I subsequently made               a

                      complaint by letter to the South Yorkshire Police Authority on

                      7      February 1990.In this                letter        I outlined          several         areas    of

                      complaint which              I will now expand upon.                    I have         been shown a

                      copy   of     the       letter    I     sent    to        the    Police       Authority         and      I

                      acknowledge that it is a true copy.

                      My specific complaints are as follows:

                       (1)   Any    information which                was    in Mr           WRIGHT'S     possession          is

                              confidential             and    I   consider             it     is   a     breach       of     his

                              privileged position for him to have said -

                              "There is a lot of information to come out that has not

                              already come o u t " .

                              "There will be a lot of additional evidence presented to

                              the    Coroner's          enquiry       which       was       not    presented         at     Lord

                              Justice          TAYLOR'S        inquiry,         which        may       put    a     different

                              complexion on the end product".

                              "What       I    found    difficult          to     understand           was     the    finding

                              that    there was          drinking among a percentage                         of the        fa ns,

                              and that they were under the influence of drink, but that

                              it had no effect                on the e v e n t s .           I found         that a    little

                              difficult to come to terms w i t h " .

                              The article            also reports          that       - Mr WRIGHT            suggests       that

                              additional            evidence,        particularly             about      the      effect      of

                              alcohol         on    fans,     will    present          "a    different         picture"       at

                              the    Coroner's          inquest       into       the    95     Hillsborough           deaths,

                              yet to be held.

                             The    article           reports      that       - He    found       it hard           to    accept

                             TAYLOR's conclusion that drink had no bearing on the r u n­

                             up    to    the     95    deaths.           "There      is    a Coroner's             hearing—

                             and I think perhaps                   a different picture will                        emerge"      he

                             said today.

                             These reports both directly and indirectly infer that he

                             had        information           in        his     possession             and         that     this

                             information           related         to    alcohol          levels       among       the     fans,

                             particularly the deceased.                         Even if it did not relate as

                             he    inferred then any such information is confidential to

                             himself       and        the   Coroner's          Office       and    I     consider          it     a

                             breach        of    his     privileged           position       that       he    should        even

                             have       inferred       that      this would paint             a different picture

                             to the conclusions of the TAYLOR report.

                       (2)   I consider that my second specific complaint in my letter

                             is self-explanatory and is again based on the article in

                             the Sheffield Star on 5 February 1990.                                I accept that the

                             exact       quotation          includes          the    word    "may"       and        that    this

                             could be           inferred more            of a suggestion               than a statement

                             but nonetheless                I believe         this prejudges             the verdict            of

                             the     Coroner.               This        is    clearly       outside           Mr     WRIGHT'S

                             authority          and    insults          the   jurisdiction          of       the    Coroner's

                             O f f ice .

                       (3)   I    believe         that      Mr     WRIGHT'S         pronouncements             during        the

                             Sheffield Star interview and the rest of the media could

                             prejudice Inquest Jurors who will of course be drawn from

                             the area covered by the newspaper cited.

                       (4)    Mr WRIGHT          infers         in the pronouncements                 in the              Sheffield

                                  Star     on   5     February          1990         that        "There     is        a    lot     of

                                  information to come out                    that has not already come                          out".

                                  He has    therefore           failed to do his job.                     If he was             aware

                                  of information that was material to Lord Justice TAYLOR'S

                                  conclusions he            should have         ensured           it was    placed before

                                  him.      I   accept          that    if    any     information           came          into    his

                                  possession         after      Lord Justice           TAYLOR       closed his              receipt

                                  of     written      evidence          then     Mr       WRIGHT      could           hardly       be

                                  expected      to    do     so.       However        I     find it       incredible             that

                                  there should be            "a lot of information"                   available in this

                                  short space of time.

                       (5)( 6 )     I    will    deal        with      complaints               (5) and    (6 )       together.

                                  Basically what           I am saying is that if Mr WRIGHT has                                   any

                                  additional         information,            whether        it    relates        to       drink    or

                                  not,    it similarly would be                  confidential             and as           outlined

                                  in complaint (1 ) would be breach of privilege if released

                                  publicly,     if as I suspect this is the same information as

                                  was    available         to    TAYLOR       i.e.     - post mortem             reports          and

                                  Professor USHER'S summary then clearly this cannot be new

                                  or     additional.            Clearly        under        these     circumstances               his

                                  pronouncements constitute a deliberate attempt to mislead

                                  and/or influence prospective jurors.

                       (7)         Despite       the       fact        that     Mr     WRIGHT is          quoted           in     the

                                  Sheffield Star editorial on the article                                 in the newspaper

                                  as     calling      the       TAYLOR        report        a    "Superb     document"             he

                                  persists      in     claiming         that     the        primary       conclusions             are
Continued statement of TREVOR HICKS                                                                                  Page 5




                               wrong.        I believe this behaviour to be the application of

                               double        standards         by     the   Chief        Constable      and    I consider

                               such behaviour to be                   the worst of          unprofessional conduct,

                               and I suspect his motives for doing so.                                 I believe he is

                               trying        to       divert    blame       away    from     the     South         Yorkshire

                               Police and on to the                   fans.

                      It is       my complaint that in making these                         claims now and publicly

                      Mr WRIGHT has            committed a            disagraceful act.            That this         act is

                       quite clearly not what should be expected from a chief officer,

                       that it could affect the Inquest's                          impartiality and finally it

                       appears     to     be      a    blatant        attempt       to    distort      the     course        of

                       justice.         By   this       I mean       that   at     the    time   the    pronouncements

                      were made         it was        not known        to Mr WRIGHT or             anybody else            that

                       the    inquests         would       be        non-adversarial,            and     it        could    be

                       construed that Mr WRIGHT'S motives were                              designed      to       influence

                       the verdict of the Coroner's inquest.

                       I   sign    this      statement          on    the     understanding          that      I    will    be

                       supplied with a copy at the earliest possible moment.

                        I am the father of Christopher Barry DEVONSIDE who died in the

                        Hillsborough        tragedy    on    15    April   1989.       Sometime      in   February

                        1990   I became aware         of an article which had been published in

                        the    Sheffield     Star     Newspaper       on   5    February        1990.     In    this

                        article the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police announced

                        his    retirement     and     several       quotations       are    attributed     to   him

                        concerning the Hillsborough tragedy and the Lord Juctice TAYLOR

                        report.     Having read the article                I considered that Mr WRIGHT,

                        the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire                       Police,    should not have

                        have made      the pronouncements           and in doing so was             in breach of

                        his privileged position.                  Because of    this       I wrote a letter of

                      complaint to South Yorkshire Police Authority on 3 March 1990.

                      In     this    letter       I outlined       areas       of my          complaint which               I will

                      now     enlarge     upon.        I have       been      shown       a     copy of         the    letter        I

                      sent     to    the Police        Authority         and       I    acknowledge         that       it     is    a

                      true c o p y .

                       (1)          I believe        that    Mr    WRIGHT       has       misused         his     position         by

                                    implying through innuendo,                  insinuation and veiled hints

                                    that additional          evidence,          not      revealed         to Lord Justice

                                    TAYLOR     would       show   alcohol          played          a    major    part       in     the

                                    tragedy.        I quote from the Star Newspaper article.

                                    (a)   Mr        WRIGHT        suggests             that        additional          evidence

                                             particularly about the effect of alcohol on fans,

                                             will      present        "a       different                picture"        at         the

                                             Coroner's       Inquest       into         the     95      deaths,       yet    to be

                                             held.

                                    (b)   He      found     it    hard     to          accept      TAYLOR'S        conclusion

                                             that drink had no bearing on the run-up to the 95

                                             deaths.         "There      is    a       Coroner's         he aring            and     I

                                             think perhaps a different picture will emerge", he

                                             said today.

                                    (c)   "Lord Justice TAYLOR was dealing with evidence and

                                             he      was     emphasising                the        evidence        which           was

                                             available".

                                             "What     I    found     difficult               to       understand       was        the

                                             finding that there was drinking among a percentage

                                             of     the     fans,     and          that       they        were        under        the

                                             influence of drink,                but      that          it had no       effect on

                                             the events".

                                           "I found that a little difficult to come to terms

                                           with".

                                (d)        "There       will       be     a     lot     of       additional         evidence

                                           presented          to   the Coroner's             inquiry which was              not

                                           presented at            Lord Justice              TAYLOR'S         inquiry     which

                                           may        put     a     different          complexion             on    the     end

                                           pr od u c t " .

                                In    my    view        Mr    WRIGHT      is       trying     to      fabricate      a    smoke

                                screen        to      protect       his       officers        and        perhaps    his     own

                                reputation.

                       (2)      Mr WRIGHT'S             apparent attempt              to influence either public

                                opinion          or     the       minds       of    potential            jurors     in     both

                                coroner's          inquests         and       possible       criminal         po roceedings,

                                by    making          sweeping          statements          in     the     Sheffield       Star

                                newspaper,            and elsewhere in the press.

                       My     overall concern           is Mr       WRIGHT'S          misuse,         in my     opinion,        of

                       privileged      information and              of    his       misuse       of     his    position     of

                       power and authority such as to devalue our                                   trust and faith             in

                       the judicial system by exerting persuasive influence.

                       This    complaint           is    made      on     the       basis        that     the      additional

                       information that Mr WRIGHT refers to is available,                                       and if it is

                       not available this adds substance to my complaint.

                        I am the father of Christopher Barry DEVONSIDE who died in the

                       Hillsborough        tragedy    on    15 April   1989.       Sometime        in   February

                      complaint to South Yorkshire Police Authority on 3 March 1990.

                      In     this    letter       I outlined areas             of my          complaint which               I will

                      now     enlarge     upon.           I have been        shown           a    copy of       the    letter        I

                      sent     to    the Police        Authority         and       I    acknowledge            that     it    is    a

                       (1)          I believe        that    Mr    WRIGHT        has      misused         his     position         by

                                             think perhaps a different picture will emerge", he

                                             said today.

                                    (c)   "Lord Justice TAYLOR was dealing with evidence and

                                             he     was      emphasising               the         evidence       which          was

                                             available".

                                             "What     I    found     difficult               to      understand        was        the

                                             finding that there was drinking among a percentage

                                             of     the     fans,     and          that          they     were     under           the

                                             influence of drink,               but       that       it had no         effect on

                                             the events".

                               In    my    view       Mr     WRIGHT      is       trying     to       fabricate      a     smoke

                               screen       to        protect      his       officers           and     perhaps      his     own

                               reputation.

                       (2)     Mr WRIGHT'S apparent attempt to influence either public

                               opinion          or     the       minds       of    potential            jurors       in    both

                               coroner's         inquests          and       possible       criminal          poroceedings,

                               by    making           sweeping         statements          in     the    Sheffield          Star

                               newspaper,            and elsewhere in the press.

                      My     overall concern           is Mr       WRIGHT'S          misuse,          in my    opinion,       of

                      privileged      information and              of    his       misuse       of     his    position       of

                      power and authority such as to devalue our trust and faith in

                       the judicial system by exerting persuasive influence.

                      This    complaint          is     made      on     the       basis        that     the       additional

                       information that Mr WRIGHT refers to is available,                                      and if it is

                      not available this adds substance to my complaint.

                       I am the father of Philip HAMMOND who died in the Hillsborough

                       tragedy on 15 April            1989.       Around   5 February         1990       I was    made

                       aware of an article in the newspaper,                  the Sheffied Star dated 5

                       February 1990.           The newspaper article dealt with the retirement

                       of   the   Chief      Constable       of   South    Yorkshire        Police,       Mr     Peter

                       WRIGHT.     Certain pronouncements              in the article were               attributed

                       to   the    Chief        Constable,        which    concerned         the     Hillsborough

                       tragedy and the Lord Justice TAYLOR report.                           I felt Mr WRIGHT

                       should     not    have      made   these    remarks    and     I    wrote     a    letter      of

                       complaint        to   the    South     Yorkshire      Police       Authority.             In   my

                       letter     I outlined        the matters       I wished      to     complain about.             I

                      have    been    shown     a    copy       of       the        letter       I       wrote    to     the    South

                      Yorkshire Police Authority and I acknowledge this to be a true

                      copy.    The complaints I make are as follows:

                       (1)     I feel that Mr WRIGHT abused his privileged position as

                                Chief    Constable             by        inferring             to        the     Sheffield       Star

                               newspaper        that       he    had              "confidential"               information       that

                               would    come        to    light          in       the    inquest,         and     that    this was

                                derogatory to those who lost their lives.                                         I accept that

                                the word      "confidential"                      is my word and does not                      appear

                                in the article            in the newspaper                       as being attributed               to

                               Mr WRIGHT.            To support                   this    complaint I draw attention

                                to the following parts of the newspaper article.

                                (a)     "There          will    be            a     lot     of          additional        evidence

                                        may         put     a different                    complexion             on      the     end

                                (b)     "What       I     found          difficult             to       understand        was     the

                                        of      the       fans,           and           that     they          were     under     the

                                        influence of drink,                         but     that         it had no       effect on

                                        the     events.              I    found          that       a    little       difficult    to

                                           disaster     which       is     expected         to   last       some       months

                                           reveal "a different picture".

                                  (d)      Mr WRIGHT        said:        "There   is    a    lot   I would want            to

                                           say    about      Hillsborough.               There        are    a     lot     of

                                           comments     I     would       want    to    make       on   Lord       Justice

                                           TAYLOR'S report, but in the circumstances I can't.

                                           There is a lot of information to come out that has

                                           not already come o u t " .

                       (2)   In     this    complaint         I    am     saying       that      if     there      is     any

                             additional          evidence     he    has    failed      to     do his        duty by       not

                             making this evidence known to Lord Justice TAYLOR.

                             It   is my personal view and belief                       that      these      disgraceful

                             proriouncements by Mr WRIGHT,                  could effect the impartiality

                             of jurors        in both        Coroner's       inquest         proceedings           and    any

                             criminal proceedings.                  I feel    that Mr WRIGHT'S actions                     in

                             this       regard    are   not       what    should    be      expected        of     a    Chief

                             Constable and he has therefore abused the privilege of his

                             rank in doing so.

                       to prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything which I

                        I am the father of Philip HAMMOND who died in the Hillsborough

                        tragedy on        15 April     1989.       Around   5 February        1990       I was made

                        aware of an article in the newspaper,                  the Sheffied Star dated 5

                        February 1990.           The newspaper article dealt with the retirement

                        of   the   Chief      Constable       of   South    Yorkshire        Police,      Mr   Peter

                       WRIGHT.       Certain pronouncements             in the article were              attributed

                        to   the    Chief        Constable,        which    concerned        the     Hillsborough

                        tragedy and the Lord Justice TAYLOR report.                           I felt Mr WRIGHT

                        should     not    have      made   these    remarks    and     I    wrote    a    letter    of

                        complaint        to   the    South     Yorkshire      Police       Authority.          In   my

                        letter     I outlined        the matters      I wished       to    complain      about.      I

Continued statement of Philip HAMMOND                                                                                  Page 2




                      have    been    shown   a    copy       of        the     letter          I wrote       to     the    South

                      Yorkshire Police Authority and I acknowledge this to be a true

                      copy.    The complaints I make are as follows:

                      (1)     I feel that Mr WRIGHT abused his privileged position as

                               Chief     Constable            by        inferring           to      the      Sheffield       Star

                               newspaper      that       he    had        "confidential"                  information        that

                               would come         to    light       in        the    inquest,          and    that    this was

                               derogatory to those who lost their lives.                                      I accept that

                                the word      "confidential"                  is my word and does not appear

                                in    the article in the newspaper                          as being          attributed       to

                               Mr     WRIGHT.          To support         this complaint I                   draw attention

                                to the following parts of the newspaper arti c l e .

                                (a)    "There       will           be     a     lot        of       additional       evidence

                                        presented to the Coroner's                          inquiry           which was       not

                                        presented at Lord Justice TAYLOR'S                                   inquiry,       which

                                        may     put       a        different           complexion             on     the     end

                                        pr o duct".

                                (b)     "What      I     found          difficult           to        understand      was     the

                                        finding that there was drinking among a percentage

                                        of    the        fans,          and         that        they      were     under      the

                                        influence of drink,                     but    that         it had no        effect on

                                        the   events.              I found           that       a   little       difficult     to

                                        come to terms w i t h " .

                                (c)    The      article            reports           that        Mr     WRIGHT       said     he

                                        nevertheless                accepted               Lord        Justice        TAYLOR'S

                                        findings,        but the Chief Constable also made clear

                                        he    believes              the        Coroner's              inquest        into     the

                                          disaster     which        is   expected         to   last       some       months

                                          beginning      later this year             or    early     in 1991,          will

                                          reveal "a different picture".

                                 (d)      Mr WRIGHT        said:       "There   is a      lot I would want               to

                                          say    about      Hillsborough.              There        are    a     lot     of

                                          comments     I     would       want   to    make      on    Lord       Justice

                                          TAYLOR'S report, but in the circumstances I can't.

                                          There is a lot of information to come out that has

                                          not already come o u t " .

                      (2)   In     this    complaint         I    am     saying      that      if    there       is     any

                            additional          evidence     he has       failed     to     do his        duty by       not

                            making this evidence known to Lord Justice TAYLOR.

                            It     is my personal view and belief that                         these      disgraceful

                            pronouncements by Mr WRIGHT,                   could effect the impartiality

                            of jurors        in both       Coroner's        inquest       proceedings            and    any

                            criminal proceedings.                  I feel that Mr WRIGHT'S                 actions       in

                            this       regard    are   not       what    should be        expected        of     a    Chief

                            Constable and he has therefore abused the privilege of his

                            rank in doing so.

                        I    am   employed      as    a    newspaper           reporter          by    the      Sheffield         Star

                        Newspaper.         On    Monday         5    February         1990       I    was       told      to    attend

                        South     Yorkshire          Police         Headquarters            to        interview           the    Chief

                        Constable,     Mr       Peter      WRIGHT.             Mr    WRIGHT          was       to    announce      his

                        retirement.         I saw Mr WRIGHT                in his office.               He was accompanied

                        by Superintendent Tony PRATT.                         I interviewed Mr WRIGHT and with

                        his permission tape recorded what was said.                                        At the conclusion

                        of    the    interview         I    returned            to    the       newspaper             offices       and

                        transcribed        the       contents            of     the     tape.              I        submitted       the

                        transcription        to      one    of      the       assistant         editors,            who   wrote     the

                      the reporter               in the copy I have            been shown by Superintendent

                      DARLING       but        the    article       is mine      and my         name   does     appear        in

                      later      editions            of    the    newspaper.           The       article       is    a      true

                      reflection of what was said by Mr WRIGHT and I transcribed the

                      tape     of    the       interview as         accurately     as      I could with             the     time

                      available           to     me before         the news deadline.           The    parts    of           the

                      article        in        inverted          commas   show     they          are    direct           quotes

                      attributable               to Mr      WRIGHT, although           not       necessarily          in     the

                      order he said them.                   I do not believe           they distort the context

                      of the        interview by changing them around                           in this fashion.              In

                      places        to avoid repetition or ambiguity I omitted a word or a

                      clause.         A    few words            I misheard when        I     transcribed        the        tape,

                      but      there-' again          I    do    not   believe     such         changes    altered           the

                        I    am   employed     as    a newspaper             reporter         by    the    Sheffield          Star

                        Newspaper.        On       Monday       5    February      1990       I was        told      to    attend

                        South       Yorkshire       Police          Headquarters         to        interview         the    Chief

                        Constable,      Mr     Peter       WRIGHT.         Mr      WRIGHT      was        to    announce      his

                        retirement.       I saw Mr WRIGHT in his office.                             He was accompanied

                        by Superintendent Tony PRATT.                      I interviewed Mr WRIGHT and with

                        his permission tape recorded what was said.                                   At the conclusion

                        of    the     interview        I    returned         to    the       newspaper           offices       and

                        transcribed       the       contents          of     the     tape.            I        submitted       the

                        transcription         to    one    of       the   assistant          editors,          who   wrote     the

                        leader       column     "The       Star      Says".         I    then       wrote        the       article
Continued statement of Mark HANNA                                                                              Page 2




                      announcing Mr WRIGHT'S retirement.                        Bob WESTERDALE is quoted as

                      the reporter              in the copy I have           been shown by        Superintendent

                      DARLING       but       the    article       is mine      and my    name   does     appear       in

                      later     editions            of    the    newspaper.        The     article       is     a    true

                      reflection of what was said by Mr WRIGHT and I transcribed the

                      tape    of    the       interview as         accurately as         I could with         the    time

                      available          to     me before         the news deadline.      The    parts    of          the

                      article       in        inverted          commas   show     they     are    direct        quotes

                      attributable              to Mr      WRIGHT, although        not     necessarily          in    the

                      order he said them.                  I do not believe they distort the context

                      of the       interview by changing them around in this                         fashion.          In

                      places       to avoid repetition or ambiguity I omitted a word or a

                      clause.        A    few words            I misheard when      I transcribed         the       tape,

                      but    there        again      I    do    not   believe     such    changes    altered          the

                      essence       of what         Mr WRIGHT was        saying.     In any      event        following

                      publication of the article,                     there was no        complaint made by Mr

                      WRIGHT or the South Yorkshire P o l i c e .                  I would also repeat that

                      the leader column quotation "Superb document" was also said by

                      Mr WRIGHT in the interview with me.                        I have handed the original

                      tape    recording of               the   interview to Superintendent DARLING.                     I

                      was   taking       place.       He    informed     Mr    Wright       that      he     had    been

                       appointed     by    the     South    Yorkshire         Police      Authority          with    the
Continued Statement of Hugh Kenneth DARLING                                                                 Page No 2




                      approval   of     the   Police      Complaints        Authority            to   investigate          a

                      number of complaints made against him and that these complaints

                      embraced    allegations        of      criminal        and           disciplinary          matters.

                      Between 11.10am and 11.11am Mr Sharp served three Regulation 7

                      Notices on Mr Wright.            Mr Sharp signed the notices and drew the

                      attention of Mr Wright to the caution printed thereon.                                      He then

                      invited Mr Wright to read the notices.                               Mr Wright then signed

                      the notices and returned them to Mr Sharp,                             retaining a copy of

                      each notice for his own use.                 Mr Wright then handed to Mr Sharp

                      a   prepared     statement     and     a    photocopy           of    an   article         from   The

                      Times   newspaper.        Mr     Sharp       read     the       prepared        statement          and

                      reminded Mr Wright that he had been cautioned.                                  Mr Sharp          then

                      said "I intend to ask you some questions.                              You are not obliged

                      to say anything but anything you do say will be                                 taken down in

                      writing and may be        given in evidence."                        Mr Wright replied,             "I

                      quite understand.         Please       ask your questions."                     Mr    Sharp       then

                      proceeded to ask Mr Wright a series of questions and I recorded

                      the   answers    given by      Mr    Wright.          The        interview        commenced         at

                      11.23am    and    terminated      at       12.05pm.         I    then      read      the    written

                      questions and answers to Mr Wright who then initialled the foot

                      of each page.       The interview was then concluded.

   Dear Mr Johnston

   COMPLAINTS BY MR TREVOR HICKS, MR PHILIP HAMMOND
   AND MR B W DEVONSIDE

   Further to my recent telephone conversations with Stephen Walker I confirm that the
   Police Complaints Authority will supervise these investigations.

   I approve the appointment of Mr L Sharp, Chief Constable of Cumbria Constabulary as
   the Investigating Officer.

   I shall be writing to all three complainants advising them that the Authority will be
   supervising the investigations of their complaints.


   Yours sincerely

My s p e c i f i c c o m p la in ts are a s f o l l o w s : -
     1) Mr. Wright i s g u i l t y o f abuse o f th e p r i v i l e g e o f h i s p o s i t i o n in

    He i n f e r s t h i s r e l a t e s t o drink and or i t s e f f e c t s .
    Assuming Mr.Wright has seen such "evidence" i t i s " c o n f i d e n t i a l " u n t i l
    deemed o th e r w is e by H.M.Coroner and should remain th a t way. C le a r l y a

    2)By s u g g e s t i n g t h a t t h i s "puts a d i f f e r e n t complexion on th e end

    3)1 b e l i e v e t h a t h i s pronouncements co u ld p r e j u d i c e Inquest Jurors,
    who w i l l o f co u r se be drawn from t h e area covered by th e newpaper

     4 ) He g o e s on t o i n f e r th a t Lord J u s t i c e Taylor was not a w are.of a l l o f

Dear Sir

I wish to complain in the strongest possible terms about
comments made by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire,
   Peter Wright, both stated orally and published in
particular, in 'The Star' on 5 February 1990 and 'The Guardian'
6 February 1990. My complaint relates to the following:

1. The distressing innuendo insinuation and veiled hints that
additional evidence, not revealed to Lord Justice Taylor, will
show alcohol played a major part in the tragedy. The post
mortem reports do show that some of the deceased had been
drinking; so what? It is not in a free society, an offence to
consume alcohol, and if police officers were vigilant and
suspected alcohol-related offences outside the ground then no
doubt great play would have been made of those arrest figures.
In my view Mr Wright is trying to fabricate a smoke-screen
after the event to protect his officers, and maybe even his own
reputation.

2. An apparent attempt to influence either public opinion or
the minds of potential jurors by making sweeping statements in
and out of the press. I don't know how the sub judice rule
applies, but the lawyers in Liverpool have advised us strongly
not to allow ourselves to be exerting any persuasive influence.
Surely the same applies to Mr Wright?

tty concern is the misuse of privileged information, or of
positions of power and authority, such as to devalue our trust
and faith in the judicial system.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely

            RE COMPLAINTS AGAINST MR PETER WRIGHT, CHIEF CONSTABLE, SOUTH YORKSHIRE
            BY MR TREVOR HICKS, MR PHILIP HAMMOND AND MR B W DEVONSIDE
            Enclosed are letters from Mr Trevor Hicks, Mr Philip Hammond and Mr B W
            Devonside dated 7 and 8 February and 3 March respectively in which they complain
            about the conduct of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Mr Peter Wright,
            arising out of newspaper articles based upon interviews given by the Chief
            Constable.
            The Police Authority at a special meeting held today, decided that all the
            complaints should be investigated by the Chief Constable of West Midlands under
            the supervision of the Police Complaints Authority. I am aware of the
            difficulties this may create, given the impending retirement of Mr Geoffrey Dear
            but I have agreed with Captain Taylor of the PCA that the resolution of the
            Authority to have the complaints investigated by the Chief Constable of West
            Midlands is appropriate in all the circumstances.
            Will you please confirm that the Chief Constable will carry out the
            investigation.
            Younrs faithfully

          COMPLAINTS AGAINST CHIEF CONSTABLE TO BE INVESTIGATED

      South Yorkshire Police Authority today (Thursday, March 22) ordered
an investigation into complaints arising out of the Hillsborough tragedy
made against Chief Constable Peter Wright.
      The complaints by Mr Trevor Hicks, Mr Phillip Hammond and
Mr B W Devonside arose out of statements made by Mr Wright to the local
press at the time his impending retirement was announced.
      A special meeting of the Authority decided, after studying the
complaints and listening to the advice of the Authority's Solicitor, to
refer the complaints to the Police Complaints Authority to supervise the
investigation. The Chief Constable of the West Midlands will investigate
the complaints, as he has all other complaints arising out of
Hillsborough.
      Agreement to this referral at this stage does not imply acceptance or
otherwise of the validity of the complaints.

Dear Sir

I wish to complain in the strongest possible terms about
comments made by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire,
Mr Peter Wright, both stated orally and published in
particular, in ’The Star’ on 5 February 1990 and ’The Guardian’
6 February 1990. My complaint relates to the following:

   ,. ^ e distressing innuendo insinuation and veiled hints that
additional evidence, not revealed to Lord Justice Taylor, will
show alcohol played a major part in the tragedy. The post
mortem reports do show that some of the deceased had been
drinking; so what? It is not in a free society, an offence to
consume alcohol, and if police officers were vigilant and
suspected alcohol-related offences outside the ground then no
doubt great play would have been made of those arrest figures.
In my view Mr Wright is trying to fabricate a smoke-screen
after the event to protect his officers, and maybe even his own
reputation.

2.  An apparent attempt to influence either public opinion or
the minds of potential jurors by making sweeping statements in
and out of the press. I don't know how the sub judice rule
applies, but the lawyers in Liverpool have advised us strongly
not to allow ourselves to be exerting any persuasive influence.
Surely the same applies to Mr Wright?

toy concern is the misuse of privileged information, or of
positions of power and authority, such as to devalue our trust
and faith in the judicial system.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely




B W Devonside

      I can only refer to my comments above in. relation to sew            iai
      evidentp. Solicitors acting for the South Yorkshire Police have sought
      Information on the matters outlined at 1. from the West Midlands 4’oli.ce

      HM Coroner they have declined to release it,


      ?.     Hr Wright claims to accent_..the findings of the Taylor K.e|?ort:J and
                           "a          oc mns t t t " ,

             Y»‘t_ he per.si.sts in claiming the primary conclusion. Is w r o n g t hat

      I have from the nut set made it d e a r that I accept the findings c»t lgi-c;
      Justice Taylor and as Chief Constable I have ensured that a i l nis
      retommendations have been pursued vigorously and with                  * ntv,

      problems that have attended it over the past decade.

      There Is nothing Inconsistent in accepting the conclusit    *'
      proceedings without necessarily being in agreement with
      expressed or the weight given to the various factors involved. ror
      instance, the South Yorkshire Police accepting the criticisms
      in Lord Justice Taylor's Report agreed to settle compensation <
      Other parties involved who were also criticised declined to a<> < r - j .

      My motives, which Mr Hicks calls into question* are c|ti*t§
      straightforward.  They ate to ensure that all available^ evidence is^
      forthcoming for those investigating the events at Hillsborough ^whet he*. <
      not it is critical of police action. It remains a fact that all the
      evidence has not as yet been publicly presented. It may be twit, when it
      is the conclusions already arrived at will be unaffected. On the otnet
      hand it may present a. different picture of the causal ractoi-a i-oat
      resulted in the terrible tragedy at Rillsboreugtt.


The only matter in Mr Hammond *s letter not covered above is the rather
astonishing claim that my comments were derogatory to those^who lost their
lives,  I am unable to account for how he came to that eoncxueioii.

                 OBTAINED FROM THE SHEFFIELD STAR NEWSPAPER




Reporter     The first question actually was going to be why now.
(Mr Hanna)

Mr Wright    You know that I was President of the Association up to October
             last year.     Two years before I took it on you         - the
             Assocation - as the President, the Vice President which you
             are the year before you're President and the immediate past
             President, before I took it on I wrote and said I would not be
             doing my immediate past presidency two years ago.       It was
             always my intention the moment I'd finished to retire but of
             course with Hillsborough and ongoing things        it was not
             possible so with the publication of the final part of the
             Taylor report, with the knowledge that the investigation would
             be concluded in April I think ... and also it's fairly well
             known throughout the Force and the Service that I was going to
             go.   I think it removes the uncertainty now.   The Force from
             the first of March and under a new Chief can move forward with
             certainty. First of May.  What did I say.

Reporter     March.   How old will you be on the first of ....          You won't    be
             quite sixty-one or will you.

Mr Wright    Almost sixty-one.   I don't look it.

Reporter     I'm trying to work    out   how   many   months   you've    stayed     on,
             another ten or ..

Mr Wright    It s probably another five.          I had to stay on as the
             president.   I had to go on.        I was going to go in July,
             because I was president, I had      to stay on until the .....
             October so really I've stayed on     since October.

Reporter     ........and it was merely that, the publication        of the    final
             report was that the trigger as it were.

Mr Wright    Y e s . In a sense I mean I thought it was up to me to stay on
             to pull together the aftermath of the Taylor Report and in a
             sense provide the leadership to the Force during that period
             from April last year until the final report.      I think I've
             done t h a t .

Reporter     If there is still an aftermath after that as it were there is
             a Chief C on stable.........

Mr Wright    Well it will go on for some time, the Coroner's inquest,
             th&t s not likely to be until the back end of this year, may
             even be the beginning of next year, so the actual knock on
             effects of Hillsborough will be with us for quite some time.
             But I've got no control over those events.
                                             - 2 -


Reporter    It's perhaps still early days but do you think the Force has
            recovered from the trauma of Hillsborough.

Mr Wright   I think the Force, I think individuals within the Force, will
            take a long time.  A few individuals in the Force will take a
            long time to recover but I think the Force has recovered.    I
            think there's   a very    strong  feeling  of  resentment  and
            injustice in the Force as a result of Hillsborough.   It would
            be wrong if that were not so because that's what I pick up
            going round the Force speaking to officers trying to keep
            soundings of what feelings are.  And there is this feeling of
            injustice about it not in a sense that we did everything right
            but simply nobody seems to have grasped the full picture.

Reporter    Do you think the     Force   itself might be   to blame   for that   in
            some w a y s .

Mr Wright   One   of the difficulties I've got Mark in the ongoing          civil
                    in the enquiry is to discuss the detail ....

Reporter    I appreciate that.

Mr Wright   And I'll go as far as I can and say what I can but it's
            difficult for me to give - you know - I've got the Police
            Authority questioning me at every meeting.   There's a letter
            from the Director of Public Prosecutions, I've got a letter
            from our Solicitors saying that I must not discuss the detail
            or pass opinions where under different circumstances I would
            like to be open about it but I can't so you'll have to
            understand that.  Not being evasive, I'm just ....

Reporter    No I appreciate .... one of the things I was going to ask you
            and you    may not take it any further in view      of those
            restrictions but - having just struck me.

Mr Wright   What do you want     and let's see whether I can.

Reporter    At the enquiry it struck me that there was .... overhanging it
            was the possibility of the civil case all the time and in a
            way your   insurers presumably were handling the course of the
            enquiry,   not what individual officers were saying that there
            was a framework which .

Mr Wright   That's a fact.   That was cleared right at the beginning.  The
            question of civil proceedings did not alter any of the
            attitude     I mean the  officers  who went   there  were  not
            constrained by the possibility of civil proceedings - every
            item of evidence that was available was put in - and it was
            all brought out in the open and that's what the purpose of the
            enquiry was.   So as such the officers were just simply saying
            what they had done on the day and why they did it and if that
            revealed evidence supportive of civil proceedings against us
            so be it there was no way that we would seek to hide that.

Reporter    I think everyone was still shocked when the enquiry was taking
            place obviously but occasionally one felt     that the senior
            officers were keeping a rein on themselves not hiding facts
            but they weren't being as emotional as they may have done.   I
                                           - 3 -


            wonder if they'd been more emotional about their evidence and
            maybe t ha t 's .........

Mr Wright   You try.   I mean, I've tried to put myself in their position
            where they were, the senior officers who'd taken action on the
            day, being questioned in great detail about the events that
            took place in ten m i nu t e s, quarter of an hour over a period of
            six weeks nearly and not just that but barristers, highly
            trained barristers, following each other picking and probing
            for any factors that would help their case or reduce their
            responsibilities   and      officers   under   those  circumstances
            naturally were perhaps not themselves.

Reporter    Yes.   Presuming then you don't - I'm not       expecting   you   to
            launch an attack on Lord Justice Taylor.

Mr Wright   No I'm not.

Reporter    But he did say in his evidence that in his findings in the
            interim report that he felt some officers had been - to use
            that phrase - evasive and defensive.

Mr Wright   Yes.   Perhaps if you've made decisions, or taken action or
            made decisions to take action or made decisions not to take
            action and ninety-five people had been killed would you not
            feel a little inhibited in terms of answering questions.  But
            we all had, I don't know whether you can see this, feeling of
            incredible sense of guilt, merited or not.

Reporter    Yes.   Just sticking with this point, I don't expect you to
            name individuals, is it possible for you to say what kind of
            toll it has taken on some individuals without, I mean, what
            kind of things have been happening.

Mr Wright   Well, the point you see they cannot shake off Hillsborough
            because Hillsborough's not gone away it's still with them, it
            will be with them for some time.   They are the subject of an
            ongoing investigation about Hillsborough so consequently it's
            difficult to return to normality under those circumstances.

Reporter    Yes.

Mr Wright   Others suffered as a result of the events there rather than
            being involved in the enquiry and that's part of personality
            inorder, that the individual might be deeply shocked and
            traumatized by Hillsborough.      We've had officers who've
            retired on ill-health whether wholly or in part as a result of
            Hillsborough.

Reporter    Yes.  Do you feel that the Sheffield or South Yorkshire public
            was as critical if you like as Lord Justice Taylor or do you
            feel that their public support is not .....

Mr Wright   It's difficult isn't it.    I mean you can only go off what
            people tell you whether they tell you one thing and someone
            else another but - there seems to be a broader understanding -
            you see Lord Justice Taylor was dealing with evidence and he
            was emphasising the evidence that was available and one
                                            - 4 -


            wouldn't expect him to do other than that.       What I found
            difficult to understand was the finding that there was drink
            amongst a percentage of the fans, and that they were under the
            influence of drink, but it had no effect on the events.       I
            could just find that a little difficult to come to terms with,
            but that was Lord Justice Taylor's findings.  And I accept his
            findings.  He had the responsibility to coming to conclusions
            from   the  evidence  that  was   given  and  those  were  the
            conclusions he came to.   I think his final report is a superb
            document.  I think he recognises all the ills that are part of
            football and in fact were present on the day.

Reporter    Yes I'll move on to the final ..... is there       - I'm not trying
            to read something you're not saying.     Is       there then some
            evidence which with the best will of all the      parties involved
            was not available at the enquiry, on drink        which might have
            been available or which may be available in       any other forums
            if it does come to a civil case.

Mr Wright   I don't know.

Reporter    You've   not    been   in   charge   of   collecting   the   evidence
            obviously.

Mr Wright   No we've not - but - there will be another hearing and that
            will have been the Coroner's hearing and I think it will be a
            different hearing and I think a lot of evidence that perhaps -
            Lord Justice Taylor was not concerned with the rules of
            evidence, that enquiry was not concerned with the rules of
            evidence.    The Coroner's enquiry to some extent will be
            constrained by the rules of evidence and I think a different
            picture will emerge.   What I'm anxious to do is to make sure
            that all the evidence whatever, whether it's for the police or
            it's critical of the police goes forward, because if things
            have been done wrongly then they must never happen again.

Reporter    Moving on from that.

Mr Wright   No It's not come out as I wanted to say it.  It's almost as
            though, - It's almost an admission that they were though I
            wasn't wanting to say that.

Reporter    Do you want the question again.

Mr Wright   What I want to say is that Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry is
            finished.   It is the Coroner who is now going to conduct a
            different enquiry.   He's going to go into the detail.    The
            Coroner's  enquiry will   go on for months    and perhaps   a
            different picture will emerge from the Coroner's enquiry than
            emerged from Lord Justice Taylor's enquiries.

Reporter    Is it true that he will have additional evidence.

Mr Wright   Yes, there will be a lot of additional evidence presented to
            the Coroner's enquiry that was not presented to Lord Justice
            Taylor's enquiry which may put a different complexion on the
            end product.
                                           - 5 -



Reporter    Moving on then to the final report I think the general
            reaction from most parties was that football needed to have
            that kind of broad criticism for a long time.   You say you
            welcomed the reports.

Mr Wright   I welcomed the final report.

Reporter    Do you feel that this is football's last chance, looking at it
            from the police side I don't think there was any particular
            criticism of the way the police operation has built up over
            the y e a r s .

Mr Wright   No.

Reporter    Obviously it has got more sophisticated and more regimented if
            you l i k e .......

Mr Wright   Because of what had happened though in the past decade police
            attention was focussed on disorder and on remedying it.   That
            was the end product of experience in a sense.    What happened
            was a public safety aspect emerged in what - what was never
            really revealed was people have had time to think about it
            over generations.   The safety of Hillsborough, the safety of
            the turnstiles, the numbers going through, the crush.   All of
            the experts within football would have time to think about
            that and have done nothing about it because they've not
            perceived any problem.   And then the problem emerges the only
            ones who seem to be standing there to take responsibility were
            police officers who had at the most a quarter of an hour or
            twenty minutes at the most to deal with a situation in very
            traumatic circumstances.    It took some lawyers that long to
            get to the point of a question.

Reporter    Yes.

Mr Wright   Why was t h a t .

Reporter    Yes.  Do you feel football must change now.    I mean I don't
            know how specific you want to be but are you in favour of the
            all seater stadiums.

Mr Wright   I think we've got to go that way.  There are people who would
            argue that those who are prone to cause misbehaviour will not
            be altered by sitting down but in recognising what the
            problems are Lord Justice Taylor has endeavoured to come up
            with solutions that might work.

Reporter    The football authorities have perhaps as predictable are
            putting up yet another, if I can call it, a rearguard action
            but an effective action any way in saying they can't pay - I
            mean - do you feel that .... keep listening to those arguments
            or do you feel that ....

Mr Wright   That's a matter for football and if it's not seen to do
            something, then if anything else goes wrong they must take the
            responsibility they regard as proper.  But here we are with 36
            years police service and the only thing that matters is
            Hillsborough.  Can't escape it can I.
                                             - 6 -




Reporter      No.  On the other hand, I think this morning I wanted to look
              at Hillsborough, I mean maybe if I'd had more time we would
              have gone over other aspe c t s.

Mr Wright     I only wish that I could be more open in what I've said about
              Hillsborough because in a sense I am constrained by the legal
              situation that I'm in.    But what I would want to say about
              Hillsborough are those comments I would want to make on Lord
              Justice Taylor's report but in the circumstances I can't.

Reporter      I am grateful for what you have said so shall we leave              it at
              that I think.

Other voice   I think you've said a lot more than you've previously                said
              about the - nothing to keep you awake at night.

Reporter      Moving on then looking back over 35 years as a whole would you
              have made the same decision to be a policeman with hindsight.

Mr Wright     No. No I mean obviously the events since Hillsborough have
              been the worst part of my career,    I think, in terms of its
              history as a professional.  But I've literally loved this job.
              I think it's a wonderful service and that's what we're here to
              provide.  We do provide a wonderful service and I've enjoyed
              every minute of it.   There have been ups and there have been
              downs but not more low than the event we've just been talking
              about but you j oin this organisation and whatever level of
              responsibility you carry you meet those ups and downs and you
              meet those problems.    If you don't want difficulties if you
              don't want problems don't join the police service.

Reporter      Are the public now      expecting   too   much   or   have   they   always
              expected too much.

Mr Wright     I think the fact that they do expect a lot shows the response
              that we give them and I want to see them expecting a lot from
              the police   service and I want     to see   their levels  of
              expectation in the police service remaining extremely high
              both in terms of behaviour of police officers, both in terms
              of performance of police officers and the attitude of police
              officers.  We're there to help.   We've got to be  constantly
              perceived as being there to help.

Reporter      On a personal   note.    Have you any     immediate plans      after May
              1990.

Mr Wright     I've got one or two considerations.

Reporter      When you say considerations again not to push you but I mean
              do you want to stay working o r ....

Mr Wright     No.   No.   I think that .... I think you've got to work at
              retirement.  I think - again retirement.  It's not resignation
              it's retirement.  You've got to work at retirement and both my
              wife and I are looking foward to doing the new period of life
              together which is something we've not done a great deal of in
              the past.
                                           - 7 -



Reporter    Would you be staying    in this     area or   is    that part   of    those
            considerations.

Mr Wright   Well, it will be.    It will      be.   We'll      be   remaining    in   the
            vicinity of South Yorkshire.

Reporter    I've to check through some of the ...   Y o u haven't got any -
            again perhaps I'm pushing you too far, but is there any chance
            you might become an Inspector of Constabulary, something like
            that.

Mr Wright   No.    There's no chance of that.

Reporter    That's your own personal preference rather than .....

Mr Wright   Well no its an objective view of the situation.

Reporter    Just quickly looking through.   I mean I didn't particularly
            want to go over the miners' strike and things like that again
            unless .....

Mr Wright   Whatever you want .... What I'd like to do ... please I would
            like  to  project  an optimistic    and positive    note about
            Hillsborough if you could do it that way.    If I've not .been
            able to deal with some of the issues to the depth I would have
            liked to and to say some of the things as strongly as I would
            like to its because of the constraints we're under.

Reporter    Well.   I think in your notes - in your resignation letter
            you're saying that you feel that the morale of the Force is
            high, and the Force is in good heart which is the kind of
            things I was going to ask you.

Mr Wright   Yes.

Reporter    I think you also anticipated my question about .... that some
            officers are frustrated as it were, so I won't go over that
            again.

Mr Wright   And feel a sense of injustice - as strong as that.

Reporter    Just as a matter of fact, I'm not asking you to comment the
            legal situation now is that the Authority has decided to meet
            some claims, without admitting strict liability.   Presumably
            there is now a negotiating process going on.   What about the
            possibility of a three or four cornered fight as it were
            between the Council, Club a n d   .

Mr Wright   Well we'll certainly agree to that.    There'll either be an
            amicable acceptance of responsibility or there will be an
            action - but there's a lot of information to come out that's
            not already come out.

Reporter    So that would then be - you would - the Authority would pay
            damages to whatever hopefully is an amicably agreed level and
            then you would then try and reclaim a percentage of that from
            the various ...........................
                                           - 8 -



Mr Wright    Our action was built to take the weight from the fans - the
             relatives of the fans - to agree with - we felt that that was
             most important and that's why we've done that.   We would have
             liked the others to have gone along with us in that spirit but
             they decided that they were not going to.    It's left for us
             now to have apportionment hearings and actions to decide on
             what level remuneration comes from each.

Reporter     Yes.  You took that in your point when you say the police were
             left standing for the moment ....

Mr Wright    We've taken a high profile, we've not sought to evade the
             issue.    I   found Lord Justice Taylor's    comments about the
             evasion of    chief officers just    a little harsh. I thought it
             was - some   of his comments were    savage, Ithought, but that's
             how he saw it.      But I think they were harsh under the
             circumstances that the officers found.

Reporter     Well ... I think I'll leave it there .....    I think you have
             been very frank and I appreciate that.  I think we'll probably
             be going round and round in circles over the same ground.
             I'll just have a last check through.   I mean I would like to
             pin you down more on your immediate plans but perhaps I'll
             have the opportunity later.

Mr Wright    It is really.   Perhaps there might be an opportunity later.

Reporter     Thanks.

                                               PERSONAL EXPLANATION



I have been appointed                                    investigate a 5e B C ^ ^ 8 gati$gt/complaint which has been made
against you, written particulars of which are set out below :

Trevor HICKS of                                                            Pinner,    Middlesex,             has   made   seven
specific complaints against you.

Mr HICKS says, despite setting aside the national press on the basis that they are
reporting second hand, he considers your action and comments during the interview with
the Sheffield Star on 5th February 1990 to be at best a breach of your privileged
position and at worst a deliberate attempt to divert the course of justice.

Mr HICKS further states that some of the comments can be                             considered as being actions
designed to influence the outcome of the Coroner's Inquest.

His specific complaints are:-

1.     "Mr Wright is guilty of abuse of the privilege of his position in suggesting to
       the Media he was aware that information would come to light in the Inquest, that
       would present "a different picture."

       He infers this relates to drink or its effects.  Assuming Mr Wright has seen such
       "evidence" it is "confidential" until deemed otherwise by H.M. Coroner and should
       remain that way. Clearly a breach of privilege."
                                                                                         (Continue overleaf as necessary)
You are not obliged to say anything concerning the above matter(s) but you may if you wish make a written or oral statement
to the Investigating Officer                       This statement may be made now or later and may be used in any
subsequent disciplinary proceedings. You have the right to consult a friend at all stages of the investigation. This form is
served on you in accordance with Regulation 7, Police (Discipline) Regulations. It does not necessarily imply that
disciplinary proceeq/ngs will be taken bi/t is served to safeguard your interests.

2.   "By suggesting that this "puts a different complexion on the end product"         he
      prejudges the verdict of the Coroner.     This is clearly outside his authority and
      insults the jurisdiction of the Coroner's office."

3.   "I believe that his pronouncements could prejudice Inquest Jurors,           who   will   of
      course be drawn from the area covered by the newspaper cited."

4.   "He goes on to infer that Lord Justice Taylor was not     aware of all facts and "that
      there is a lot of information that has   not yet come out."   He has therefore, by
      his own admission, failed to do his job.     If he is aware of information that is
      material to Lord Justice Taylor's conclusions he should have ensured it was placed
      before him."

5.   "If, as Mr Wright claims, this material relates to drink then presumably             it is
      additional to that contained in the summary document produced by Professor           Usher
      for Lord Justice Taylor (the one withdrawn from circulation) and to the post        mortem
      reports, - in which case we shall be asking our lawyers to obtain details            of it
      and to establish why this was withheld from us."

6.   "If, as I suspect, this is merely the same information, then            Mr Wright is well
      aware that this has been available for many m o nt h s . Clearly       it cannot be "new"
      or "additional" to that considered by Mr Taylor."

     "Under these circumstances his actions constitute a deliberate attempt to mislead
     an offence under the discipline code or worse."

7.   "Mr Wright claims to    accept   the   findings of The Taylor Report,   and even calls    it
      "a superb document."

     "Yet he persists in claiming the primary conclusion is wrong. That is as clear
     an example of "double standards" as one could ever see and serves to underline
     questions regarding what his motives are."

against you, written particulars of which are set out below :

Mr Barry DEVONSIDE of                               Merseyside has made two specific
complaints regarding comments you allegedly made which were published in 'The Star'
newspaper on 5 February    1990 and 'The Guardian' newspaper on 6 February 1990. His
complaints relate to the following:-

1.     "The distressing innuendo insinuation and veiled hints that additional evidence,
       not revealed to Lord Justice Taylor, will show alcohol played a major part in the
       tragedy.   The post   mortem reports do show that some of the deceased had been
       drinking; so what?    It is not in a free society, an offence to consume alcohol,
       and if police officers were vigilant and suspected alcohol-related offences outside
       the ground then no doubt great play would have been made of those arrest figures.
       In my view Mr Wright is trying to fabricate a smoke-screen after the event to
       protect his officers, and maybe even his own reputation."

2.    "An apparent attempt to influence either public opinion   or the minds of potential
       jurors by making sweeping statements in and out of the press.       I don't know how
       the sub judice rule applies, but the lawyers in Liverpool have advised us strongly
      not to allow ourselves to be exerting any persuasive influence.       Surely the same
       applies to Mr Wright?"

                                                                                                               Continued/....

I have been appointed ^toecBftRkt^filicNgfeQfiliSffetetecto investigate a eeps^MaaafoJk/complaint which has been made
against you, written particulars of which are set out below :

    Mr Philip HAMMOND of                                                             Liverpool       has       made      two     specific
    complaints against you.            xney are:

    1.   "In making his pronouncements     immediately after announcing his retirement,
         Mr Wright abused his privileged position by inferring to the media he had
          "confidential" information that would come to light in the Inquest, and that
          this was derogatory to those who lost their lives".

    2.   "He similarily inferred that Lord Justice Taylor was not aware of all of facts
          and "that there is a lot of information that has not yet come out".    He has
          therefore by his own admission failed to do his job".

    It is Mr HAMMOND'S belief that these complaints could affect the Inquests Impartiality
    as well as being a deliberate attempt to distort the course of justice.




                                                                                          (Continue overleaf as necessary)

          I realise may be used in any subsequent proceedings.

                   (C.J. Act, 1967, s. 9; M.C.A., 1980, s. 102; M.C. Rules, 1981, r.70)

         Continuation of statement of               PETER WRIGHT
        I will          now comment on the               specific complaints raised by Mr Hicks which

        also subsume the general complaints made by Mr Hammond and Mr Devonside.




                   1.    Mr Wright         is guilty of            abuse of       the privilege of his position

                         in suggesting to the media he was aware that information would

                         come to light            in the      Inquest,        that would present                "a different

                         picture".




                         He    infers      this    relates         to drink       and/or         its    effects.       Assuming

                         Mr    Wright      has    seen    such      'evidence'          it      is   'confidential'             until

                         deemed       otherwise      by       HM    Coroner        and       should      remain       that       way.

                         Clearly a breach of privilege.




                   Anyone      with    knowledge         of    the     Hillsborough              Inquiry    will       be       aware

                   that evidence not heard at the Inquiry will emerge at the Inquest.

                   The   cause    of       the    barrier      collapse         in    pen       three    and    the    specific

                   place      where    deaths      occurred        are obvious            instances        of evidence not

                   yet    revealed.          Furthermore,           the     West      Midlands          enquiry       on    behalf

                   of    HM   Coroner       has    continued          since      Lord      Justice       Taylor's          Inquiry

                   concluded          on    29    June    1989,      and      following the publication                    of     the

                   Report on      4 August expanded                 to include          enquiries        for    the Director

                   of    Public         Prosecutions.              These      enquiries are still               on-going and

                   may    also        produce      fresh       evidence.           Indeed it         would be    surprising

                   if    nine         months      additional          investigation did not.                      I    have not

                   inferred      that      the    fresh       evidence       relates         to drink      and     would         make

                                      STATEMENT OF WITNESS

                  (C.J. Act, 1967, s. 9; M.C.A., 1980, s. 102; M.C. Rules, 1981, r.70)

        Continuation of statement of                  PETER WRIGHT

                   it quite clear          I have        no knowledge of what specific evidence will

                   emerge.




                   To say as I did that this additional evidence "may put a different

                   complexion on the end product" was a proper comment and not a breach

                   of   privilege,         whatever          that    may      mean.          It    is    essential       for    the

                   well-being and morale of the Force that officers see someone giving

                   public     expression         to    their    views,          and     it       is my    responsibility         as

                   Chief Constable to do so.




                   2.   By    suggesting          that       this     "puts       a   different           complexion      on    the

                        end    product"          he    prejudges         the      verdict         of     the   Coroner.        This

                        is    clearly      outside       his        authority         and    insults       the   jurisdiction

                        of the Coroner's office.




                   In   support      of    his    complaint,          Mr     Hicks      uses       a    selective     quotation

                   which leaves out the qualifying word                            'may'         included in the article.

                   Given     that    additional          evidence will             be produced            and having      regard

                   to   my    role    as    spokesman          for      the      South       Yorkshire         Police,     I    see

                   nothing wrong in expressing the belief that this additional evidence

                   may put a different complexion on the end product.




                   3.   I     believe      that        his     pronouncements                could        prejudice       Inquest

            'First      Tuesday'         programme,             the      suggestion            that       my       statement could

            prejudice jurors is quite simply nonsense.




            4.    He    goes       on    to        infer       that      Lord     Justice           Taylor          was    not      aware

                  of    all       of    the    facts          and     "that     there          is    a    lot      of     information

                  that       has       not     yet       come       out".       He     has      therefore,                by   his     own

                  admission,            failed to do his                 job.      If he is aware of information

                  that is material to Lord Justice T a y l o r 's conclusions he should

                  have ensured it was placed before him.




            All   the    evidence             in    the       possession         of    the      South          Yorkshire         Police

            has   been        handed         to     the       West       Midlands        enquiry.               The       information

            not   presented             to    the        Hillsborough           Inquiry             and    the       basis       for    my

            comments         is    indicated             in    my     response        at       1.    and       I    cannot       add    to

            it.

                                presumably          it   is    additional              to       that    contained        in   the    summary

                                document         produced       by       Professor           Usher        for    Justice      Tayl or      (the

                                of it and to establish why this was withheld from us.




                         I have not claimed that the material related to drink.




                         6.     If,    as    I    suspect,          this       is     merely       the     same        information,       then

                                Mr Wright         is well       aware          that this has              been available for many

                                months.          Clearly       it    cannot           be     "new"        or    "additional"         to   that

                                considered by Taylor.

                                attempt      to mislead             - an       offence           under     the    discipline         code   or

                                            STATEMENT OF WITNESS

         Continuation of statement of                    PETER WRIGHT

                    it.       The only information regarding the inquiry that I have received

                    from       the     West      Midlands        Police      has     been        procedural,       relating      to

                    estimated dates               of    conclusion      and       submission        of    the report         to the

                    Director          of     Public       Prosecutions,            and     information           regarding      the

                    intentions of HM Coroner in respect of the Inquest.




                           Mr Wriqht            claims    to   accept the           findings       of the Taylor Report,

                           and even calls it "a superb document".




                           Yet       he    persists       in   claiminq       the     primary          conclusion       is   wronq.

                           That is as clear an example of                          "double standards"             as one could

                           ever       see    and    serves      to underline          questions          reqardinq what his

                           motives are.




                    I    have        from the       outset     made     it    clear       that     I accept       the    findings

                    of Lord Justice Taylor                     and as        Chief Constable             I have ensured that

                    all       his     recommendations            have         been pursued             vigorously       and    with

                    expedition.             I    have     also      said     that     I    consider        his    Final      Report

                    to    be     a    superb      document       that addresses           all    the      ills of       football.

                    If    the        recommendations           of    the     Report        are     implemented       they      will

                    go    a     long       way     to    ridding      the     sport       of     the     problems    that      have

                    attended it over the past decade.




                    There        is       nothing       inconsistent         in     accepting           the    conclusions       of

                    judicial          proceedings         without       necessarily             being     in   agreement       with

            Continuation of statement of                PETER WRIGHT

                      all the views expressed or the weight given to the various factors

                      involved.         For     instance,       the South Yorkshire Police accepting1the

                      criticisms        contained         in    Lord       Justice        Taylor's            Report       agreed      to

                      settle     compensation claims.                  Other parties               involved who were also

                      criticised declined to do so.


;
                      My motives, which Mr Hicks calls into question, are quite straight­

                      forward.        They         are to ensure           that     all     available             evidence within

                      my     Force    is      forthcoming        for       those       investigating               the     events      at

                      Hillsborough whether               or not       it    is critical             of police            action.       It

                      remains a fact             that all the evidence has                    not as yet been publicly

                      presented.           It      may be that        when       it    is         the    conclusions         already

                      arrived at will            be unaffected.              On the other hand it may present

                      a     different      picture       of    the    causal          factors       that          resulted      in    the

                      terrible tragedy at Hillsborough.




            The only matter             in Mr Hammond's              letter not covered above is the rather

            astonishing         claim       that    my    comments         were       derogatory             to    those    who      lost

            their lives.             I am unable to understand how he came to that conclusion.




            The      interview        I gave       to    'The    Times'         immediately              followed        that     given

            to       'The    Star',     a copy      of    both       printed       accounts             is   attached.          I also

            gave      two television               and two radio       interviews             during which               I expressed

            similar comments.

                               that the opening of the gates was the direct result of

                               fans'       misbehaviour          and not       a     loss    of police          control,

                               and       the    other    two     areas       which    I     feel       is vital      is   in
                               relationship to the place of death and the cause of the

                               collapse of the barrier in pen 3.                            I also hope that the

                               continuing             enquiry       will      have         revealed          information

                               additional to that given to Lord Justice TAYLOR.


                         Q.   Was there any evidence or information gathered by your
                               force          subsequent       to     the     completion           of     the    written

                               evidence of the TAYLOR enquiry.


                         A.   Yes.



                         Q.   Could you give me an idea of the type of evidence.



                         A.   I     have        prevented        my     officers           from        making     direct

                               enquiries into Hillsborough since TAYLOR as this may be

                               said to be             interfering with the enquiry being                          carried
                               out       by     the    West    Midlands        Police.             I    have     received
                                  letters       from    the    public        containing           information        which
                               may amount to evidence and these have been forwarded to

                                  the West Midlands             Police.            Through       our    solicitors        we

                               have sought an independent police view of the events of

                                  the    day     which    will        also    be     presented          to     subsequent

                                  enquiries.


                         Q.   Because that information came to hand after TAYLOR had

                                  completed his report it was impossible to lay it before
                                  Lord    Justice        TAYLOR.             Did     any    of     that        additional

                                  information relate to alcohol consumed by any of their

                                  fans or the effect of alcohol on their behaviour.



                         A.   Every item of evidence that we possessed was fed into
                                  Lord    Justice        TAYLOR.         After        the     conclusion          of      the
                                  TAYLOR       enquiry     all      additional         evidence          received         has
Continued Record of Interview of Mr Peter WRIGHT                                                                    PAGE 3




                               been    fed       into   the        West      Midland        Police.        Some         of    it

                               related to the behaviour of fans.                                 The police         opinion
                               to which I referred is still with our solicitor and I

                               do not think it                has been referred to the West Midlands

                               Police but they                are aware of it.                  My statements to the

                               press       and     those          made       publicly           contain       two       basic

                               elements.           The first            is   I   do         not agree         with       Lord

                               Justice TAYLOR'S conclusion in the interim report that
                               the    behaviour         of        the    fans    outside         the    gates      was       not

                               contributory            to     the       disaster.           The        second      is    that

                               additional evidence not to do with drunkenness will be
                               presented          at        the     Coroner's          hearing          and     for          the

                               information         of       the     Director          of    Public       Prosecutions.

                               These two statements have no link between them and yet
                               it     is   clear        that            those    who       have    complained            have

                               inferred a link.


                         Q.   You must be aware that you in your position carry a lot

                               of    weight       and       your        pronouncements            and    opinions            are

                               given due weight because of your position.                                     Bearing in

                               mind that you realised when you agreed to do the Star

                               interview that Hillsborough would come up you must have

                               realised         that    any       responses       you made          would have           been

                               read with         avid       interest.            It    can be       argued      that you

                               must have          known potential jurors for the inquest were

                               likely      to     read        the        article.           It     could      be     argued

                               therefore         that       your        responses          in    the    newspaper            are
                               likely      to    sway       their        judgement         and    perhaps       influence

                               their decision as jurors at the inquest.                                  That it could

                               be argued is perhaps a contempt of court, an attempt to

                               pervert the course of justice at common law,                                     or a very

                               old common law offence of culpable malfeasance.                                           Have

                               you any response to that.



                         A.   I don't       think having                regard    to what          I said       that         it
                               could possibly be argued that it fell into any of those
                               categories. I have simply said that additional evidence

                               may    be       forthcoming          and    that       I hoped           it    would          put    a

                               different complexion on the public perception.                                            I have

                               not    said what             that    additional         evidence          will       be       and    I

                               think       it    incredible           in    the        light       of        the    weeks          of
                               discussion             and     public       statement           during            the     TAYLOR

                               enquiry, media and individual comment afterwards in the

                               press and the First Tuesday television programme,                                              that
                               my    reasonable             and    necessary          statement         could          possibly

                               influence the course of any judicial proceedings.



                         Q.   Why did you regard it as necessary.



                         A.   As a Chief Constable during the course                                    of these         events
                               I have          been    unable        to    avoid       press       questions             and       in
                               addition to all my other responsibilities there                                           is one

                               of     maintaining             the    morale           of    the     South          Yorkshire

                               Polic e.         The views expressed are the views held within

                               the Force         and it           is right       in my view that the public

                               should be aware of them.



                         Q.    Even       if    the     effect       of     these          statements            may     be        to

                               influence people within the judicial process.


                         A.   I don't see how they can.



                         Q.   Would you go so far then, with the benefit                                      of hindsight

                               to say perhaps your comments were injudicious.


                         A.    No     I    don't       withdraw           any     of       them.             I     cannot          be

                               responsible            for     leaps        of     imagination            of        those       who

                               choose to misinterpret what I said.


                         Q.    So everything you said to the Star was either true fact

                               or true opinion.



                         A.    Yes.            What    I     said     in        all    the     interviews                I    gave
                               represented my views and opinions as spokesman for the
                               South Yorkshire Police.

                         Q.       With the benefit of hindsight would you change anything

                                  you said.


                         A.   No.



                         Q.   Is there        anything else you want to say.



                         A.   No.

                             HANDED TO M R SHARP BY M R WRIGHT.


                             The     complaints              or     the     complainants              question        the

                             veracity          of     your    claim       that    additional           evidence           or

                             information will come out at the                           inquest.         Apart       from

                             what you've said already in your written statement can

                             you give an example.

                         A.    I hope          that     additional      evidence          will       emerge       to    show
                               that the opening of the gates                        was the direct result of

                               fans'       misbehaviour          and not      a     loss       of police          control,

                               and       the     other    two    areas which         I     feel      is vital          is   in
                               relationship to the place of death and the cause of the

                               collapse of the barrier in pen 3.                           I also hope that the
                               continuing              enquiry       will     have        revealed             information

                               additional to that given to Lord Justice TAYLOR.


                         Q.    Was there any evidence or information                                gathered by your
                               force           subsequent       to    the     completion             of    the     written

                               evidence of the TAYLOR enquiry.



                         A.    Yes.


                         Q.    Could you give me an idea of the type of evidence.



                         A.    J     have        prevented       my     officers           from          making     direct

                               enquiries into Hillsborough since TAYLOR as this may be

                               said to be              interfering with            the    enquiry being            carried
                               out        by     the    West    Midlands          Police.            I    have    received
                                letters          from    the    public       containing             information         which

                               may amount to evidence and these have been forwarded to
                                the       West    Midlands       Police.           Through      our       solicitors        we

                               have sought an independent police view of the events of

                                   the    day     which    will       also    be    presented             to     subsequent

                                   enquiries.


                         Q.    Because that information came                       to hand after TAYLOR had
                                   completed his report it was impossible to lay it before

                                   Lord    Justice        TAYLOR.            Did    any        of    that        additional

                                   information relate to alcohol consumed by any of their

                                   fans or the effect of alcohol on their behaviour.



                          A.   Every item of evidence that we possessed was fed into
                                   Lord    Justice        TAYLOR.           After        the    conclusion             of   the
                                   TAYLOR       enquiry     all      additional           evidence         received         has
Continued Record of Interview of Mr Peter WRIGHT                                                                   PAGE 3




                               been    fed       into       the    West    Midland         Police.        Some         of    it

                               related to the behaviour of fans.                                The police         opinion

                               to which I referred is still with our solicitor and I

                               do not think it has been referred to the West Midlands

                               Police but they are aware of it.                            My statements to the

                               press       and     those          made     publicly            contain       two       basic
                               elements.           The       first        is    I    do    not    agree      with       Lord

                               Justice TAYLOR'S conclusion in the interim report that
                               the behaviour            of        the    fans    outside        the    gates      was       not

                               contributory            to     the       disaster.          The        second      is    that
                               additional evidence not to do with drunkenness will be

                               presented          at        the     Coroner's         hearing          and      for         the

                               information         of       the     Director         of    Public       Prosecutions.

                               These two statements have no link between them and yet

                               it     is   clear        that        those       who       have    complained            have

                               inferred a link.


                         Q.   You must be aware that you in your position carry a lot
                               of   weight        and       your        pronouncements           and    opinions            are
                               given due weight because of your position.                                    Bearing in

                               mind that you realised when you agreed to do the Star

                               interview that Hillsborough would come up you must have

                               realised         that    any       responses         you made      would have            been

                               read with         avid       interest.           It    can be      argued       that         you
                               must have          known potential jurors                   for the inquest were

                               likely      to     read        the       art icle.          It    could       be     argued

                               therefore         that       your        responses         in    the    newspaper            are
                               likely      to    sway       their       judgement         and    perhaps       influence

                               their decision as jurors at the inquest.                                 That it could

                               be argued is perhaps a contempt of court,                                an attempt to

                               pervert the course of justice at common law,                                    or a very

                               old common law offence of culpable malfeasance.                                          Have

                               you any response to that.


                         A.   I don't       think having                regard      to what       I said       that         it
                               could possibly be argued that it fell into any of those
                               categories. I have simply said that additional evidence

                               been    fed       into    the       West    Midland          Pol i c e .     Some          of    it

                               related to the behaviour of fans.                                 The police opinion

                               to which I referred is still with our solicitor and I

                               do not think it has been referred to the West Midlands
                               Police but they are aware of it.                             My statements to the

                               elements.           The       first        is    I    do    not     agree        with       Lord

                               Justice TAYLOR'S conclusion in the interim report that

                               the    behaviour         of        the    fans    outside         the    gates        was       not
                               contributory            to     the       disaster.           The        second        is    that

                               additional evidence not to do with drunkenness will be

                               information         of       the     Director         of     Public        Prosecutions.
                               These two statements have no link between them and yet

                               it     is   clear        that        those       who       have      complained             have

                               inferred a link.



                         Q.   You must be aware that you in your position carry a                                              lot

                               of    weight       and       your        pronouncements            and      opinions            are

                               given due weight because of your position.                                       Bearing in
                               mind that you realised when you agreed to do the                                            Star

                               must have          known potential jurors for the inquest were

                               likely      to     read        the       article.            It    could         be    argued

                               therefore         that       your        responses         in     the      newspaper            are

                               may    be        forthcoming          and    that       I    hoped        it   would          put    a

                               different complexion on the public                                perception.             I have

                               not    said what              that    additional            evidence will            be       and    I

                               press and the First Tuesday television programme,                                               that

                               my    reasonable              and    necessary          statement         could          possibly

                               influence the course of any judicial proceedings.



                         Q.   Why did you regard it as necessary.



                         A.   As a Chief Constable during the course of these events
                               I    have       been     unable       to     avoid press             questions            and       in

                               addition to all my other responsibilities there                                            is one

                               of     maintaining              the    morale           of     the    South          Yorkshire

                               Police.           The views expressed are the views held within

                               the Force and it is right                          in my view that                  the    public
                               s*
                               should be aware of them.



                         Q.   Even        if    the     effect        of    these           statements            may    be     to

                               influence people within the judicial process.


                         A.   I don't see how they can.



                         Q.   Would you go so far then,                      with the benefit of hindsight

                               to say perhaps your comments were injudicious.



                         A.    No     I        don't     withdraw          any     of        them.            I    cannot          be

                               responsible              for    leaps        of     imagination            of       those       who

                               choose to misinterpret what I said.


                         Q.   So everything you said to the Star was either true fact

                               or true opinion.



                         A.    Yes.            What     I     said     in        all       the   interviews              I     gave
                               represented my views and opinions as spokesman for the
                               South Yorkshire Police.

                         Q.   With     the benefit of hindsight would        you change anything

                                  you said.


                         A.   No.


                         Q.   Is there        anything else   you want   tosay.



                         A.   No.

COMMUNICATION



Chief         Superintendent              Duckenfield has given his account of his

understanding               of the peril of Leppings Lane entrances.                   He had

a life threatening situation at the turnstiles, the result of a

throng in a narrow space and the requests of an experienced and

va                Officer,        Superintendent          Marshall, for the gates to be

     =.i.           Beyond the gates was ample space.                  The opening of the

gates         would run counter to Policing policy.                        To open the gates

whilst perhaps the obvious course was not a decision,                                it may be

said         easily     taken.             In     the circumstances, whilst foresight

(essentially            the        result        of     hindsight)    might      suggest    that

various             matters        should        have     entered    his    mind,    his    pre­

occupation was with the safety of those outside.                                 It is perhaps

too         easy     here        to say what else he should have done.                 He gave

the order to open the gates.



 CRUSHING


 Given         the     propensity           in the terraces for fans to sway, surge

 and         move    and         that     such     actions    are,    it    is    arguable, in

 themselves            potentially              highly    dangerous    (whether or not any

 barrier            fails        should     anyone lose their footing or fain1'

 may         be     difficult to          for    . any reliable view as to how and when
any     particular             injury          or     death       was    in   fact    caused.   The

situation        may         be      simple         or     may     be highly complex, but the

substantial             injuries           and      death        would    appear     to   have been

sustained          in        Pen     3     and      below the area protected by barrier

124A,         To        arrive at a view that because people went into the

tunnel     upon          the        opening         of     Gate     C    injuries or death were

thereby        caused would require a detailed investigation the like

of     which       has        not,        on     the     occasion        of   this Inquiry, been

attempted.              Whilst perhaps convenient and for certain purposes

attractive such a simplistic view would not, it is submitted be

justified.               This        has       not       been     a trial nor is there, it is

submitted,               the             material          available          upon    which     such

conclusions             might even be tentatively based.                         Whilst it may be

considered           that          notions          such     as    the burden and standard of

proof     may        impede          the       Inquiry process, the fact is that they

have     not       featured              and     that what has been done has been done

whilst evidence and further material are still being sought and

 gathered.         Speculation                 will      not      suffice     although     it may be

 interesting             to          ponder           what        satisfactory       or   sufficient

 explanation            or explanations can be given for, as appears to be

 the     case,          some        deaths having occurred to individuals who may

 have     come          in     at        the     second opening of Gate C.                The Inquiry

 cannot,        it       is        submitted permit the conclusions post hoc ergo

 propter hoc.


 As to the positions in which people may have died we urge that,

 as     has     been indicated will be the case, there should be taken

 into     account             the        material         supplied       by   the South Yorkshire

 Police in relation to Pen 3.
ACTIONS


Criticism is made of the Police action taken upon the nature of

the    problem         being realised,             in this context it is uiged that

it was not unreasonable for there to have been no specific plan

to     deal     with     such         an event.        It was not foreseen.         When it

occurred        it was horrendous and outsi.de anyones expectation but

Police        officers        at    different levels displayed initiative and

acted     whether        or        not they had been previously or were at the

material        time     under instruction             and   direction.       Officers went

to the tunnel within moments and made endeavours to relieve the

throng        and bring out casualties.                 Such was done quite quickly.

The      perimeter       gates           were    opened,     people were helped up and

out.       Endeavours were made to cause the crowd to go back which

 endeavours were not it seems understood or immediately complied

 with.         Many in the crowd were oblivious that any incident let

 alone        some    tragedy        had        occurred although they were close to

 it*


 A     major     incident            was set      in    train,     operation support was

 called,        Ambulance            and help was       summoned.       In so far as there

 was     chaos or confusion                that, in the earlier stages, is perhaps

 understandable.                   People       did    their     best    in   many instances

 without        regard        for     their       personal convenience or wellbeing.

 Officers,           Messrs        Nesbitt, Greenwood and McKay for example set

 about         arranging           and     organising.         The      emergency   services

  attended       and     it must, in the light of the material available,

  be     doubtful       whether any lives or injuries would or could have

  been        saved     in the circumstances by any other course of action

     once it was realised that people were trapped and crushed.

in      our submission, close analysis of the accounts given to the

Inquiry           reveal         that        such     obstacles       as    may    have presented

themselves             to       emergency           vehicles    (for example, non-emergency

vehicles           blocking             in    part     an    access        route   or advertising

hoardings            on         the perimeter of the pitch) were temporary or no

impediment.                     Most significantly, the attention of the Inquiry

is       respectfully              drawn to the account given by Station Officer

Higgins           at      Day      24        page    49C    where he stated that, so far as

SYMAS Ambulances were concerned:



             "X    think it went as smoothly using the first entrance as

             it would hay© done using the in-out method"



 and       then        also       to the account given by Station Officer Easson

 on Day 24 at page 68E which suggests that the in-out method may

 have        been         available           to    such Ambulances from the first or at

 least         from         a    stage        earlier than station Officer Higgins was

 himself aware of.

        Sir

        HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR HO 79/1981:            CONTEMPT OF COURT ACT 1931

        1.   I am directed by the Secretary of State to inform you that the Contempt of
        Court Act 1981 will come into force,-; for all purposes not relating to legal
        aid, on 27 August 198 1.

        2.   Much of the Act implements, with'some modifications, recommendations of the
        Phillimore Committee on Contempt of Court (197^? Cmnd 579*0 • T*10 following
        changes made by the Act are discussed in detail below:- modification of the
        strict liability rule; regulation of the use of tape-recorders in court;^
        provision for punishing contempt in the face af magistrates' courts; variation
        of certain penalties; 'enforcement of fines; and clarification of procedure
        under section 63 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980.           ,

        3.           Othe'r important provisions in the Act are as follows:

                     Section 8 makes it a contempt of court to obtain, disclose^or solicit
                     specified information relating to the deliberations of a jury in legal
                     proceedings;

                     Section 11 empowers a court which (in the exercise of existing powers)
                     allows a name or other matter to be withheld from the public to give
                     directions prohibiting its publication; and

                     Section 13 will make provision for (-.-ranting legal aid to anyone liable to
                     be committed or fined for contempt in the face of the court (whether in a
                     magistrates' court under section 11 of this Act, or in a county court or a
                     superior court).

        Modification of the strict liability rule

        *♦.   Sections 1 to 7 of the Act are conccrnctl with the strict liability rule, whi
        is the rule of law whereby conduct tending to interfere with the course of justic
        rmy be treated as contempt of court regardless of intent. Section 1 defines the
        rule ao set out above while section 2 limits its scope so that it applies only t
        publications which crcate a substantial risk that the course of justice in the
        proceedings in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced. The proceedings
         in nuestic : must be 'active' , as defined in Schedule 1 of the Act, for the rule ^


                                                                 -1-
   ply. It is likely that the courts and the police t.-il] rf-coivr; enquiries from the
 Press who may wish to know whether particular proceedings are active within the
 meaning of the Act. ror the guidance of recipients of this circular a summary of
 the relevant paragraphs of Schedule 1 is attached.

 5*   Sections 3 to 6 modify the cffect of the strict liability rule by providing
 a number of specific defences and savings while section 7 provides that proceedings
 for contempt of court under the strict liability rule shall not be instituted
 except with or by the. consent of the Attorney General or on the motion of a court
 having jurisdiction to deal with it.

 Tape-recorders in court

  £>•   Section 9 contains provisior.s governing the use of tape-recorders in court. It
  provides that it is a conter.;pt ot court (i) to use in court, or bring into court
  for use, any tape recorder or other instrument for recording sound, except with
  the leave of the court; or (ii) to publish a recording of legal proceedings or
Tiii) to use any such recording in contravention of any conditions which the court
 may have attached to the grant of permission to use the machine. The section does
not apply to the making 017 use of sound recordings for purijoses of official
 *;ranscripts. •             •
                             1
?.      The section thus gives courts a complete discretion whether to permit the use
of tape-recorders in court and, if permission is granted, whether to impose
conditions. Circumstances will, of course, vary and there may in particular
circumstances be practical objections to the use of recording machines;      there is,
aowr ver, no objection in principle to their use, especially by those connected
 -ritiv the proceedings. The Secretary of State accordingly suggests that in proper-
casrs applications firom parties or their legal representatives to use tape-recorders
should be given sympathetic consideration (especially when the aonlicant is unable
himself to take a note of the. proceedings), as shoulfi applications from accredited
representatives of the Press or broadcasting organisations.who wish to use a
recording of the proceedings as an aide-memoire in compiling a report of them.
Particular attention should be paid in criminal-cases, however, to any risk that
recordings might be used for briefing witnesses.

8»    Practical objections which might lead to a     refusal to permit the'use ofa
recording machine might include the sensitivity of the subject matter of the
xjroceedings, the nervous disposition of a witness or any disturbance which the
  china might cause in court; and the court should not hesitate to revoke permission
already granted if use of a machine appears to distract any participant in the
proceedings or otherwise cause a disturbance.

Contempt in m a m strates1 courts

'?•  Section 12 gives magistrates' courts jurisdiction to deal with contempt
committed in the face of the court and empowers them to deal with anyone who
wilfully insults any justice, witness or officer of the court, or solicitor or
counsel havin/; business in the court, during his sitting or attendance there, or
who interrupts the proceedings or otherwise misbefiaves in court. Under subsection (2)
uhe court may order any officer of the court or constable to take the offender into
custody and detain him until the court rises, and may, if it thinks fit, commit
the offender into custody for a specified period not exceeding one month, or
impose a fine not exceeding £500, or both. Subsection (3) precludes the making
of an attendance centre order (under section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 19^8)
where it appears to the court that the offender is under 17. Subsection (*Q
provides that the court eray at any time revoke a co.vj:iittal order made under
  subsection (2) and order the offender's discharge, while .'subsection (5) provides
  for the application, in relation to an order under section 11, of certain
  provisions in the Magistrates' Courts Act 1930 (namely section      (restrictions
  on fines in respect of young persons); sections 75 to 91 (enforcement); section 1
  (appeal to Crown-Court); section 136 (overnight detention in default of payment);
  and section 1^2(1) (power to rectify mistakes)).

 Penalties

 10. Section 1*+ and Schedule 2 together amend the maximum penalty for the offences
 in subsections (1) and (2) of section 19 and in section 23 of the Coroners Act 1887
 (failing to appear or serve as a juror; failing to appear or give evidence as a
 witness and, as a medical practitioner, failing to obey a ccroner's sumsons) to a
 fine of £200; and that for the offence in section 97 of the Magistrates' Courts
 Act 1980 (refusal to be sworn, or to give evidence, or to produce a document) to
 one month's imprisonment, or a fine of ££00 or both.

 Enforcement of Fines

 H • Section 16 is concerned with enforcement of fines imposed for contempt of cour'
 by superior courts other than the Crown Court, the Court of Appeal, Criminal
 Division or the House of Lords on appeal from that division. In particular,
 subsection (1) provides that one way in which such a fine way bo enforced is      a n


 if it' were a fine imposed by the Crown Court. Subsection (3) applies the provision,
 of sections 31 and     of the powers of-Criminal Courts Act 1973 to a fine enforced
                       p 2

 in this way.

 Clarification of procedure under scction 65 of thv Magi.-;trnt.es' Courts Act 19#0

12. Section 17 and Schedule 3 establish the mejirts by which proceedings are to be
brought under section b3C3) of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 for punishing
disobedience to an order other than for the payment     money. Subsection (1)
                                                       o f


provides that the powers of a court under section 63(3 ) may be exercised either of
the court's own motion or by order on complaint and is intended to remove any doubt
as to the proper means of invoking these powers. Subsection (2) applies the
provisions of the 1980 Act to such proceedings and, with Schedule ,'3 entures that
tvhere the court proceeds of its own motion certain provisions of the 1930 Act
shall apply as if a complaint had beon made. It is anticipated that this
clarification will facilitate the enforcemant of, for exanole, orders for the
custody of or access to children and for family protection or exclusion from the
matrimonial home'under the Matrimonial Proceedings (Magistrates' Courts) Act i9 60,
the Guardianship of Minors Act 1971 and the Domestic Proceedings and Magistrates'
Court Act 1978.

      FOBTHEH ADVICE TO TEE POLICE ON THE CONTEMPT OF COUBT ACT 1981

      1.    Home Office Circular No 79/1981: Contempt of Court Act 1081,             •
      "brought the Act to the attention of chief officers of police anri
      included a section on the strict liability rule. The purpose of
      this further circular is to enlarge on the advice to chief officers
      about the implications for them of the Act and related matters.

      2.   As was set out in the Annex to the earlier circular, under the
      Contempt of Court Act 1981 criminal proceedings are deemed to become
      active from the time when any of the following has occurred:

                (a)     arrest without warrant      •

                00      the issue of a warrant for arrest

                (c)     the issue of a summons to appear

                (d)     the service of an Indictment or other documents specifying
                        the charge

                (e)     oral charge.

     3.    As soon as criminal proceedings are active, under the strict
     liability rule any communication which is addressed to the public at
     large or any section of the public may be treated as a contempt of court
     if it creates a substantial risk that the course of justice will be
     seriously impeded or prejudiced. Chief officers are reminded that
     although proceedings will cease to be active at the conclusion of the
     trial, they will become active again as soon as appellate proceedings
     are commenced. Eie detailed provisions to determine whether proceedings
     are active are set out in Schedule 1 to the Act.
4    The Secretary of State is particularly mindful of the danger
inherent in press conferences following the questioning of a suspected
person in connection with crimes where there has been intense interest
by the media. Accordingly, he has consulted the Director of Public
Prosecutions who has stated that he considers it right that any guidelines
to chief officers of police on the holding of press conferences or the
granting of interviews in these circumstances should be framed more
broadly than the Contempt of Court Act requires so as to guard not merely
against the risk of contempt proceedings, but against any semblance of
what the public or the courts might regard as improper or irresponsible
behaviour. Hence, the only safe guideline whenever the preferment of
charges is imminent is one that totally prohibits the granting of in erviews
although allowing a brief prepared statement to be issued. The
prohibition should cover, so far as is practicable, all conversation
between the officers in the case and members of the media as well as formal
press conferences. The embargo in interviews should apply whenever it is
expected that a person will shortly be charged with an offence whether or
not he or she has ,been arrested. By "shortly", the Director of Public
Prosecutions has in mind a period of about 24 to 48 hours althougn this
mast be left to the discretion of chief officers.

5." As far as any prepared statement is concerned, the Director of Public
Prosecutions considers that it would be best confined to a formula such
as "A / ~ m a n _ 7 /""womanJZ is being questioned by the police". However, the
statement should also indicate whether or not the person concerned is
under arrest or has been charged. This would signal clearly to the media
whether criminal proceedings were active within the terms of the Act. If
the person concerned has not been arrested or charged, it^might be proper,
if pressed, to give some indication of when a charge is likely to be
preferred or when the suspect might make a court appearance.

6.    The approach set out in the two preceding paragraphs applies with^ even
greater force to any communication by a police officer to the media af^er
proceedings have become active against a defendant.. Information should be
given in brief and neutral terms, eg "A /man_/ £ woman_/ haa ^een charged
with an offence of        ..... J " . Comments which, however indirectly, might
seem to the public to imply guilt, and discussion of or comment upon the
evidence, should be avoided. Special considerations apply, by virtue of
section 6 of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976, to cases in w h i c n a
man has been charged with a rape offence *s defined in section 7 { 2 ) of whe
Acz .  In such cases matter likely to lead members of the public to identify
the person charged as the person against whom the accusation of rape has
been made s h o u l d not be published except in the special circumstances
described in section 6 of the 1976 Act.
7.   The strict liability role also affects communi cat ions such as
"wanted" posters, if proceedings against the person concerned are active
within the meaning of the let, eg where a defendant changed with an
offence     escaped. Chief officers should therefore guard against any
unwarranted implications of guilt in the wording of such posters. Por
example, the description "wanted terrorist" would be objectionable unless
the person so described was wanted in connection with an offence of
terrorism of which he had already been convicted. In appropriate
circumstances, acceptable descriptions could include "wanted for
questioning about f ~terrorist offences_7 ^"serious offences involving
attacks on women_/^. There is 330 objection to the inclusion of
photographs in "wanted" posters worded so as to meet the requirements of
the Act, but chief officers will wish to bear in mind the possible loss of
evidential value of subsequent identifications of the wanted person.

8.   Circumstances will arise in some cases in which it will be necessary
for the public to be warned that a "wanted" person should not be approached
or is believed to be dangerous. Such warnings, if carefully worked to avoid
any unwarranted implication of guilt, are unlikely to be regarded as
prejudicial.

9.   The strict liability rule will not apply to "wanted" communications
when none of the steps listed in paragraph 2 above has been taken, but
even in these circumstances implications of guilt should be avoided.

10. The Director of Public Prosecutions has requested that if a possible
contempt of court is to be investigated by the police, whether or not at the
direction at any- stage of the trial judge, the Director should be notified
as soon as possible, whether or not he has assumed responsibility for the
conduct of the case.

Hillsborough

Throughout the greater part of 1989 all members of the South Yorkshire Police, but
particularly those officers who were directly involved, have been preoccupied with the
disaster that occurred at Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April when 95 football supporters
tragically lost their lives and many others were injured. The then Home Secretary, The Rt
Hon Douglas Hurd, instituted a Public Inquiry and appointed The Rt Hon Lord Justice
Taylor to carry out the Inquiry. Lord Justice Taylor commenced his investigation into the
disaster at Sheffield on 15 May and concluded the public hearings on 29 June. He
published his Interim Report on 4 August and his conclusion was that although there were
other causes, the major reason for the disaster was the failure of police control at the
ground.

In consequence of the strong criticism he directed at members of the Force I thought it
appropriate to submit my offer of resignation to the Police Authority. At a meeting held on
14 August the Police Authority declined to accept it and I continued in office. My
immediate objectives in the aftermath of the Interim Report were to implement those
recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor that lay within the control of the police and to take
such further action as I considered appropriate in the light of the Interim Report. One such
action was the institution of an enquiry to establish if any criminal liability arose as a result
of the deaths, and this will continue into 1990.

The on-going effects of that tragic event will continue for some considerable time to come.
At the conclusion of their enquiries the West Midlands Police will submit their report to the
Director of Public Prosecutions for a decision on the question of criminal liability in respect
of any individual. The Inquest to be held by Her Majesty’s Coroner cannot proceed to a
conclusion until the question of criminal action has been resolved and even on the most
optimistic forecast the Inquest is unlikely to be concluded before the end of 1990. Coupled
with the attendant civil proceedings, the legal aftermath of Hillsborough is likely to continue
well into the 1990s.

The traumatic and lasting effect this tragedy has had on the families of those who died, on
those injured and their families, and on many others involved, together with the safety of all
those likely to attend major sporting events in the future, demanded that the highest level
of scrutiny be devoted to all the various aspects of investigation and legal review. The loss
and hurt so clearly suffered by so many requires this lengthy and detailed consideration
and, regardless of where blame lies, it is essential that the causes should be properly and
fully determined and every measure necessary taken to prevent a recurrence.

The fact that South Yorkshire Police officers stand adjudged to have been contributors to
this terrible tragedy is obviously a source of sorrow and regret within the Force. We have
responded by opening negotiations with those bereaved and injured with the aim of
resolving all bona fide claim s and preventing further grief to them. I have previously
publicly expressed to the bereaved and injured my regret and deepest sympathy and now
do so again.

Cuts in Resources

The shadow of this event has in a public sense all but obscured the normal work of the
Force. Furthermore, the financial cost of Hillsborough has had a marked effect on
resources and consequently upon our effectiveness during the year. Because the financial
year continues until 1 April 1990 the effect on the policing of South Yorkshire will also
continue until and beyond that date.

Many thanks for your letter of 30 April.   It was most welcome because I am
sure you realise that it was not a job I relished or enjoyed doing.    That
is not to say that I did not do it to the best of my ability - I did - but
I would much rather have been able to sit with you over a pint, and y a m
about the past, present and future.   Someone had to do it and I am pleased
that I was able to complete it in time to let you leave the service in
peace.  But you deserve better than that.

I hope sincerely that our paths will cross      again - I feel certain they
will - so until then enjoy your retirement.     Whatever happens now, no-one
can diminish all that you have done, or all     that you have achieved.   The
balance sheet of service and dedication of      Peter Wright will always be
heavily in credit.  More people than you will    ever know, believe that.  I,
for one, know that to be true.

       When complaints were lodged against me following the announcement
       of my retirement, I dreaded the thought that I may have left the
       Service with them unresolved.

       My fears were groundless, and I know that it was entirely due to
       the personal efforts you and Noel Taylor applied.  Knowing the
       pressures you were both under it would have been easy to have given
       the complaint low priority, particularly as I was going.

       It was an important matter to me however and I am most grateful
       that due to your efforts it has been concluded.  It allows me to
       leave the Service, as I do today, with a clear conscience.

       Again, many thanks and every best wish.

                 1. 2     All    of     the    complaints       arise   out   of    articles     published    in    the

                          attributed to Mr WRIGHT.                It is those remarks            and opinions which

In    1975   he     was    appointed       an     Assistant       Chief    Constable         of    the

THE COMPLAINTS
The    three      complainants         made      their    complaints       by       letter    to    the

South Yorkshire Police Authority in February and March 1990.                                        The

complaints were referred to the Police Complaints Authority and on

2 April 1990 I was appointed investigating officer.


I    subsequently         saw    all     three    complainants       and       recorded      written
statements from them in which they repeat the allegations made                                       in

their letters to the South Yorkshire Police Authority.                                     It should

be    noted       that    whilst       making      his     statement           of    complaint       Mr
                                                         Continuation Form                                     Page No 4




                        DEVONSIDE was accompanied by a Mr Ian HARRIS who was introduced to

                        me as a solicitor.



                 4. 3   Mr   HICKS      makes    seven       specific     complaints.           He     alleges       that    Mr

Statement File          WRIGHT has       abused his          privileged position           as    Chief       Constable       by
      1-5               making     public        statements,        which       have      been        reported       in     the

                        Sheffield Star newspaper, concerning the Hillsborough disaster and

                        the enquiry and reports by Lord Justice TAYLOR into that incident.

                        He also alleges that Mr WRIGHT is attempting to pervert the course
                        of   justice,         particularly       with     regard    to     the       pending     Coroner's

                        Inquests, by making such statements.



                 4. 4   Mr DEVONSIDE          makes    two    specific complaints.               He    also    alleges       Mr

Statement File          WRIGHT has       abused his          privileged position           as    Chief       Constable       by
Pages 6 -8              making     such       public        statements     and     that    by        doing     so    he     has

                        attempted to exert persuasive influence on the judicial system.



                 4. 5   Mr   HAMMOND      makes       two    specific     complaints.            He    alleges       that    Mr
Statement File          WRIGHT's statements could affect the impartiality of jurors in any
Pages 9-11
                        related      judicial         proceedings,        and    that     by     making       such    public
                        statements       the    Chief       Constable     has    abused        the    privilege       of    his

                        rank.


                 4.6    It   should      be     noted        that   the    complaints           made     by    the        three

                        complainants are remarkably similar in content.

                      d)     Abuse of Authority.


                 6.   CIRCUMSTANCES
                      I have conducted the investigation into the complaints made by Mr

                      HICKS, Mr DEVONSIDE,          and Mr HAMMOND with the following in m i n d : -



                      (1)     Did Mr WRIGHT make public pronouncements in line with those

                              alleged to have been made?


                      (2)     If he did make such pronouncements,                     what did he say exactly?


                      (3)    By saying       those words did he commit any criminal offence?



                      (4)     Also,     by   saying     those       words,          did    he    commit       a    police

                              disciplinary offence?


                      (5)    In saying       those words did he act in any way injudiciously?



                      (6 )   In publishing Mr WRIGHT'S              words, did any other person commit

                               a criminal offence?


                      I will       discuss   each    question       in    turn      and    in    so    doing,      I    have
                      repeated      and duplicated many          of      the    quotations       and     extracts        for

                      the convenience of the read er :-



                 6.   Did    Mr    WRIGHT    make    public      pronouncements             in    line    with         those

                      alleged to have been made?

                      1990    is    beyond   any    doubt.       There         is   written      evidence         from    Mr

                      WRIGHT       himself   and    from    Mr   HANNA         that   on    that       date   at       South
                      Yorkshire        Police       Headquarters,              Sheffield,         Mr     WRIGHT          was

                      interviewed       by   Mr     HANNA    with     the       intention        of    both       that    an
                      article,       based   upon    the     interview,         would      be    published         in    The

                      Sheffield Star newspaper around that d a t e .                       Further corroboration

                      is supplied by Superintendent PRATT,                      South Yorkshire           Police,        who

                      It was       the    intention of both Mr WRIGHT and Mr HANNA to cover                               in
                      the     interview        and       subsequent          newspaper      article,       Mr    WRIGHT's

                      previously announced retirement but both knew that the subject of

                      Hillsborough inevitably would be raised.



                      Although       neither Mr          WRIGHT     nor      Mr   HANNA    say    so    expressly,      they

                      must    be    taken     to    know     that      the    subjects      of    the    interview were

                      likely       to be     of    such public         interest      that     other     newspapers      and

                      media    would        seek    to     use   the    information         published         through    the

                      normal press          and media network for communication of                            information.
                      In fact this proved to be the case and articles appeared later in

                      other newspapers, eg The Guardian.


                      The only other newspaper interview given by Mr WRIGHT on that date
Document File         was to The Times newspaper in which an article was published based
Page 29
                      upon the interview with The Times reporter.                                Because that article

                      is not mentioned by                any of the complainants, I have                      confined my

                      investigation          to    the     interview with           The    Sheffield      Star    and    the

                      subsequent article in that newspaper.


                6.2   If Mr WRIGHT did make such pronouncements what did he say exactly?



                      Evidence       is available as to the exact words used by Mr WRIGHT                                 in
                      the interview with Mr HANNA of The Sheffield Star because Mr HANNA
                      made a tape recording at the time.                          That tape has been transcribed

Document File         and reveals most of the exact words used by both Mr WRIGHT and Mr
Pages 16-23           HANNA.        Some    few parts        of the tape are              difficult     to hear but no

                      material       part    of    the     interview         is missed because           of    that.     The

                      article which appeared                 in The       Sheffield Star on             5 February      1990

                      has    been        copied,     the    copy    has      been    acknowledged         by    the    three
                      complainants,          by Mr WRIGHT and by Mr HANNA.                        The    Sheffield Star
                      newspaper has a circulation of about 140,000 copies daily, mainly

                      in the Sheffield area.

By saying those words did Mr WRIGHT commit any criminal offence?



The   first   offence          to be    considered         is that          of Contempt             of Court

both at Common Law and in the Contempt of Court Act 1981.


A useful definition of contempt of court is that of Lord DIPLOCK

in Att.   Gen v Times Newspapers                    (1974) A.C.             273; (1973)             3 W.L.R.

298; 117 S.J.          617;    (1973) 3 All E.R. 54:-


              "The due administration of justice requires                                     first

              that all citizens should have unhindered access to

              the        constitutionally                 established             courts            of

              criminal           or      civil            jurisdiction                 for         the

              determination of disputes as to their legal rights

              and      liabilities;        secondly,            that        they should             be
              able       to    rely    upon     obtaining            in     the       courts       the

              arbitrament of a tribunal which is free from bias

              against any party and whose decision will be based

              u po n     those    facts       only    that have             been proved             in

              evidence adduced before it in accordance with the

              procedure          adopted      in courts          of       law;    and     thirdly

              that,       once    the    dispute          has    b een      submitted          to    a

              court       of    law,    they    should be             able       to    rely     upon
              there being no usurpation by any other person of

              the function of that court to decide it according
              to law.          Conduct which is calculated to prejudice

              any       of     these    requirements            or     to    undermine             the

              public confidence that they will be observed is a

              contempt of court."


In the Contempt of Court Act 1981 at Section 1, there is a strict

liability rule whereby conduct may be treated as contempt of court

regardless of intent.


The     strict      liability          rule     applies          to       any         speech,       writing,
broadcast,        cable        programme       or    other       communication                in    whatever

form,     which     is       addressed     to       any    section          of    the     public.        The

"comma" after the word 'broadcast'                        is omitted in the Act.

In Mr WRIGHT's case the giving of the interview to The                                            Sheffield

Star newspaper reporter using the words he chose to use,                                           seems to

be covered by the strict liability rule.



For the rule to apply, however,                     there has to be a substantial risk

that    the    course       of        justice        will          be      seriously            impeded      or

prejudiced.


              "the   risk      that has        to be          assessed          is       that which

              was    created     by     the     publication               of    the       allegedly

              offending        matter          at        the        time        whe n      it     was

              published.         The public policy which underlies                                 the

              strict    liability           rule         in    contempt             of    court        is

              deterrence.              Trial        by        (media)          is    not     to    be

              permitted in this country.                           That the risk created

              b y the publication when it was actually published
              does    not      ultimately           affect          the     outcome         of     the

              proceedings is neither here nor there."


              Evening Standard Co. Ltd (1954) 1 Q.B.                                 578, 582.



The    proceedings      alleged        to   have         been       prejudiced            can     be    in   the

criminal court or coroner's courts, but those proceedings must be

"active"      for the strict liability rule to apply,                                     and the accused

must know that these proceedings are "active."


For criminal proceedings to be "active" the criteria in Schedule 1

of the Act require specified initial steps to have be en taken:-



a)      arrest without warrant;
b)      the issue of a warrant for arrest;

c)      the issue of a summons to appear;
d)      the   service    of      an    indictment             or    other       document         specifying

        the c h a r g e , or

e)      an oral charge.

In        Mr        WRIGHT's      case         it    cannot        be    said        that     any       criminal
proceedings                were   "active"           so     as     to    create       strict          liability.

However,             the    Coroner's         Inquests       into       the   95 Hillsborough                deaths
were       "active"          in that          the    Inquests      had been          opened       on   19 April

1989           and adjourned on 20 April 1989 and Mr WRIGHT knew that.                                          I do

not       need        to     consider          any    civil       actions       which       may       have     been

commenced or stayed except to say that the definition of contempt

is wide enough to embrace improper interference with negotiations
between             parties       to      a    pending       cause       (see       Att.     Gen.       v     Times

Newspapers             (1974)     A.C.         273   ante).         Section         2 of    the Act          limits

strict liability by reference to:-


     i)        the nature of the conduct complained of;

 ii)           the risk of interference with the course of justice;

iii)           the seriousness of the interference if it was to occur, and

 iv)           the stage reached b y the proceedings.


To these I would add that there is an element of public                                                 interest

in general discussion being permitted.


The        "substantial              risk"      that       the     Coroner's         Inquests          would     be

"seriously" impeded or prejudiced does not mean that the risk must

be     weighty,            but    rather        "not       insubstantial"            and    "not       minimal."

Perhaps             a more     useful         explanation would be                  that    if    there was       a
reasonable possibility that Mr WRIGHT's pronouncements might have

seriously              impeded       or       prejudiced         the    verdicts       of    the       Coroner's

Inquests,             then his intention one way or the other is irrelevant.



At this stage then,                    it seems that:-


     i)        The    Coroner's        Inquests           were    "active",         and     Mr    WRIGHT       knew

               that fact;
 ii)           Mr    WRIGHT       published          words       about        the    business          of     those

               In qu es ts ;
iii)           If     that     publication           created       a    substantial          risk       that    the
               business        and     verdicts        of    the       Inquests      would       be    seriously

               impeded or prejudiced,                  then Mr WRIGHT is guilty of contempt

               of court irrespective of his intention.

Because of Mr WRIGHT's national and local position and standing,

it     is     likely          that        anything              he    says        publicly              will        be        of

considerable         public          interest.              The public             are       likely          to believe

that    any       Chief       Constable         has        access         to,     and    knowledge             of,       much

information not               generally known to o t h er s.                           This       is particularly

so    in Mr       WRIGHT's       case          in    respect          of    Hillsborough.                    He     is    the

local       Chief    Constable.                 His        police          force        had       dealt       with        the
tragedy       and both he            and his           force had been                   consistently                in    the

public spotlight throughout Lord Justice TAYLOR's enquiry,                                                          in the
Interim Report of the enquiry and indirectly in the Final Report

of    that       enquiry.           So    clearly,          by       using       the    de    minimus             rule        of
strict        liability             for       contempt,              it     can         be        said        that        the

"substantial risk" element of contempt is present.                                                     He would know
of    the     substantial            circulation                of   The        Sheffield          Star        to    whose

reporter he was speaking.                           He must have known that his words would
be read avidly by a large number of p e o p l e , words which would be
repeated          in various         media          even        though          outside       of       The    Sheffield

Star       and     The    Times          the        words        published          would          be       hearsay           of

hearsay.          He would also know that some of the readers of his words
would eventually be empanelled as members                                         of the Inquest juries.

But     whether          or    not        the       substantial             risk        of        prejudicing             the

Inquests         amounts       to    serious          impediment or prejudice                               needs    to be

considered.              If    Mr        WRIGHT's          words          were    uttered           as       part        of    a

discussion          in    good       faith       or matters                of    general          public          interest

then       they    cannot       be       treated           as    a    contempt          of    court           under       the
strict liability rule                     if the risk of                   impediment             or prejudice                to

the Inquests is merely incidental to the discussion.


For the strict liability rule to apply there must be proved a real

threat to          the    fair conduct or outcome of the                                  Inquests.               In this

regard it has to be borne in mind that a jury is more likely to be

swayed by prejudicial matter                           than a Coroner.                       So    it is always                 a
serious matter to utter words publicly which may prejudice a jury

towards a particular verdict.                              But this does not mean there should

be    no    discussion,          publicly             or    otherwise,             wh en      it       is    simply           the
continuance          of        public          discussion             already           begun           provided              the

continued          discussion            is     not    used          as    a vehicle              to    prejudge              the

                cause.           Prejudgement          may    occur    by       a    direct     assertion       that       a
                particular         verdict        will   be    reached,         or by        stating    a    conclusion

                about a particular issue in a case, or b y making a statement which

                might make          the    Inquest reach one conclusion rather than another.

                The       Inquests,       of course,         are not adversarial so               there can be            no
                question,         in Mr WRIGHT's case of defaming,                       dissuading,         persuading

                or        deterring        any     particular         individual             juror,     witness,          or

                plaintiff.          The question is a difficult one which perhaps                               is best

                addressed          by    considering whether               or    not    Mr    WRIGHT's      words    were

                fair and accurate.


                In order to do             this    it is necessary              to consider          the exact words
                used by Mr WRIGHT                to Mr HANNA,         the       Sheffield Star reporter on                  5

                February 1990,             and not what the reporter chose to publish in the

                subsequent          newspaper          article.       Although Mr WRIGHT has                  stated on

                more       than     one    occasion       that    the quotes directly                 attributable to

                him in the article are a fair reflection of the comments he made,

                they are not in the order that he made them.                                  From a study of the

                full transcript of the interview it is also clear that the direct

                quotes are not in the context they were made.


                From the transcript the following matters can be confirmed:-



                     i)    The     interview was          called      as    a    result      of Mr     WRIGHT's          pre­

                            announced retirement from the Police Service on 1 May 1990;



                 ii)       That     both he and the reporter knew that Hillsborough and the

                            Lord        Justice    TAYLOR       Interim         and     Final    Reports       would be

                            raised;


                iii)        That bo th Mr WRIGHT and Mr HANNA were aware of the legal and

                            other constraints acting upon them both.                              In respect of Mr

Document File               WRIGHT I draw attention to Home Office Circulars 79/1981 and
Pages 58-65                 115/1982       which were         addressed         to     all   Chief     Constables         and

                            which relate          to    the Contempt of Court Act                    1981 and       to    the

                            strict liability rule which is within it.

                 iv)   Understandably                Mr     WRIGHT           saw     a        need      to        explain       any
                       relationship between his forthcoming retirement and the Lord

                       Justice TAYLOR enquiry reports.



                  v)   Mr WRIGHT made it clear that he would go as far as the legal

                       and     other          constraints              would       allow        in      respect          of      the

                       Hillsborough tragedy.                         He even drew attention to advice he

                       h ad    received             from        the     Police       Authority               solicitors          by
                       saying:-



                              " ....          I've     got       a     letter       from        our         solicitors

                              saying that I must not discuss the detail or pass
Document File
Page 17                       opinions          where        under          different          circumstances              I

                              wo ul d     like       to    be     open       about       it    but      I    can't       so

                              you'll have to understand that."


                 vi)   In the interview (and in his letter of retirement) Mr WRIGHT
                       made it clear that all material and information likely to be

                       relevant          to    the        Taylor       Enquiry       had       b ee n       passed       to    West
                       Midlands          Police       which           was     investigating                 the    matter        and

                       servicing the enquiry:-



                              ". . . . every          item       of    evidence          that    was         available

                              was    put       in    - and       it was           all brought           out       in    the

Document File                 open       and       that's       what    the purpose             of    the        enquiry

                              w a s ."



                vii)   When      questioned                during           the     interview               he         speculated
                       reasonably             about       the     performance             of    some of            his        senior

                       officers at the Enquiry without naming them:-



                              "....      I've        tried to put myself                  in their position

                              where       they were,            the senior officers                   who'd        taken

                              action          on     the     day,       being       questioned in                  great

Document File                 detail          about       the    events       that       took        place        in    ten
Page 18                       minutes,         quarter of an hour over a period of six

                              weeks       nearly          and    not     just       that       but      barristers,
                                              Continuation Form                                            Page No 13




                           highly        trained        barristers,             following each other

                           picking       and      probing       for       any    factors         that would

                           help       their case        or    reduce       their      responsibilities

                           and    officers         under      those       circumstances            naturally

                           were perhaps not themselves."


                       It is worth recalling here                     that      the evidence           given at         the

                       TAYLOR Enquiry was unsworn and not subject to the rules of

                       evidence applied b y the c o ur ts .


                viii) Mr   WRIGHT      asserts       that he         was     not     launching         an    attack      on
                       Lord Justice TAYLOR, choosing to refer to the Interim Report

                       rather than       Lord Justice TAYLOR himself.


                 ix)   He defended       his senior officers further when he                               said:-


                           "....       Perhaps      if you've made               decisions,           or    taken

                           action or made decisions                       to take action,              or made

                           inhibited in terms of answering questions.                                      But we

                           all had,       I don't know whether you can see,                                  this

                           feeling       of       incredible        sense       of    guilt      merited          or

                           n o t ."


                  x)   A n important piece of dialogue ensued which requires careful

                       scrutiny       because        it      not     only       appears          in    part        in   The

                       Sheffield       Star       article,      but       also       is    at    the       core    of   the

                       complaints against Mr WRIGHT


                           Mr     HANNA       -   "Do     you      feel    that      the        Sheffield         or

                            Sguth Yorkshire public was as critical if you like

                        Mr WRIGHT       - "It's difficult isn't it.                     I mean you

                        can only go off what people tell you whether they

                        tell you one thing and someone else another but -

                        there    seems      to be    a broader understanding                      - you

. Document File         see Lord Justice TAYLOR was dealing with evidence
  Pages 18-19           and   he      was    emphasising         the      evidence          that      was

                        available and one wouldn't expect him to do other
                        than that.          What    I found difficult to understand

                        was     the    finding that        there    was        drink    amongst         a

                        percentage       of the f a n s ,        and that they were under

                        the     influence of drink,              but it had no          effect         on

                        the     events.       I    could     just find          that        a    little

                        difficult to come to terms with, but that was Lord

                        Justice       TAYLOR's       findings.            And    I     accept         his

                        findings.        He had the responsibility of coming to

                        conclusions         from the evidence             that was          given and

                        those were          the   conclusions he          came    to.           I think
                        his final report is a superb document.                          I think he

                        recognises all the ills that are part of football

                        and in fact were present on the day."


                   At this juncture it is worth noting that the manner in which

                   The Sheffield Star article reports this statement presents a

                   much more provocative meaning                   than    the reasonable words of

                   Mr    WRIGHT present when               set   out   in full.          Of      course     it is
                   only the article to which the complainants had a c c e s s .                               The

                   dialogue co nt inu es :-

                        evidence       which       with    the    best     will        of       all   the

This    is     an    important             question because                    the        response         could

indicate       whether             or    not     the         additional            information,            which

the    complainants                allege Mr WRIGHT mischievously claimed                                     to
h a v e , related to the effects of drink on the f a n s , deceased

or othe rw is e.



       Mr WRIGHT replied - "I don't know."


       Mr     HANNA           -     "You've          not          been        in     charge           of

       collecting the evidence obviously."


       Mr WRIGHT          - "No we've not                      - but     - there will be

       another        hearing             and        that         will    have           been        the

       Coroner's           hearing             and       I     think      it        will        be     a

       different hearing                   and       I    think a        lot        of    evidence
       that        perhaps          -     Lord           Justice         TAYLOR           was        not

       concerned with the rules of ev id e n c e , that enquiry

       was not concerned with the rules of e vi d e n c e .                                          The
       Coroner's              enquiry           to           some       extent           will         be
       constrained by the rules of evidence and I think a

       different picture will emerge.                                    What       I'm anxious
       to     do    is        to    make        sure         that       all     the       evidence

       whatever           whether          it's          for      the    police           or     it's

       critical          of       the    p o l i c e , goes         forward          because          if

       things have been done wrongly then they must never

       happen again."


At this point Mr WRIGHT was clearly uphappy with his answer

because he next said:-


       "No.         It's      not       come     out         as   I wanted           to    say       it.

       It's almost as                   though       - It's almost an admission

       that        they    were          though          I    wasn't      wanting           to       say

       t h a t ."


       Mr HANNA - "Do you want the question again?"

Document File          Mr    WRIGHT    -     "What    I    want      to      say      is     that        Lord
Page 19                Justice TAYLOR's            enquiry      is finished.                 It is the

                       Coroner who          is now    going       to    conduct         a     different

                       enquiry.        He's        going   to     go      into     detail.                The

                       Coroner's       enquiry        will      go      on      for        months         and
                       perhaps      a different picture will                    emerge        from        the
                       Coroner's      enquiry        than emerged            from Lord Justice

                       TAYLOR's enquiries."


                 It is worthy of note               that    this correction by Mr WRIGHT                          is

                 not reflected in The               Sheffield Star article.                     The dialogue

                 continues:-



                       Mr    HANNA      -    "Is     it    true        that        he        will        have

                       additional evidence?"


                 Until now there has been nothing to suggest that Mr WRIGHT,
                 by referring to additional                  ev id en ce , is referring to f a n s ,

                 deceased      or     otherwise,       affected           by    drink.              In    fact,   Mr

                 WRIGHT's      responses       thus    far      in     the     interview            suggest just

                 the    opposite.           The    reply     to      this       question        is        therefore

                 important:-


                       Mr WRIGHT       - "Yes       there will be a lot of evidence
                       presented       to    the    Coroner's          enquiry        that was            not
                       presented       to Lord Justice            TAYLOR's            enquiry which

                       mav     put     a     different        complexion                on     the        end

                       product."


                 It is important to note at this point that the complainant,

Document File    Mr H I C K S , uses part of this quotation as it appeared in the
Pages 4, 7, 19   Sheffield Star article.                  Although Mr WRIGHT and the article

                 use tfee word "m a y " , Mr HICKS ignores it in his complaint and
Statement File   had    to     be     corrected       when        he      was      making           his     written
Page 3
                 statement.

                      There       is nothing in Mr WRIGHT's                                reply,    or elsewhere             in the

                      transcript               of      the        interview,               which      suggests             that    the

                      additional evidence would or might relate                                            to drink but the

                      manner        in which               the article            is presented             in The          Sheffield

                      Star       could           be        interpreted            that       way     by     selectivity            and

Document File         juxtaposition                   in    respect         of    the       quotes.         On       the    contrary
Pages 13-15           there       is       good evidence               as    to what          Mr     WRIGHT believed                the
      30-37
      48-52           additional evidence would be in his letter dated 23 February
                      1990       to        his        Police          Authority;             in     his      prepared             typed

                      statement handed to me when he was                                      interviewed;             and in his
                      answers             to     me        at    interview.                  The     additional             evidence

                      referred to by Mr WRIGHT appears to b e :-


                       i) the cause of the collapse of the crush barrier in Pen 3;

                      ii) the specific places where the deceased fans died;



                      - but he also has made it clear that he has no knowledge of
                      what the additional evidence might be or what effect it may

                      have on the outcome of the Inquests.                                         That may not be clear
                      to a reader of The Sheffield Star newspaper, but that cannot

                      be    the      fault of Mr WRIGHT who has                               no editorial control or

                      influence over what that newspaper publishes.



                xi)   The    interview then continued as a dialogue                                          about the Final

                      Report         and       Mr      WRIGHT         made       it     clear       that    he       welcomed       the

                      Final         Report,            specifically                   correcting          the        reporter,       Mr
                      HANNA,         who       lumped           the   Interim          and    Final        Reports         together.

Docunent File         Despite             this      correction,             the       article       and    the       editorial       in
Page 20               The     Sheffield               Star newspaper                  do    not    make     it       clear    to    the

                      reader that Mr WRIGHT's reactions to the Final Report differ

                      understandably from his reactions to the Interim Report.

                             - * . ....

                      Whatever impression the newspaper article may leave with the

                      reader,             there            should      be        no     doubt       that        Mr     WRIGHT       has

Docunent File         reservations about the Interim Report but regards the Final
Pages 3, 19           Report as a "superb document".                                       The complainants accuse Mr

                      WRIGHT          of       "double          standards"             because,       from       the       newspaper
                                                Continuation Form                                            Page No 18




                      article,       they believe he               describes          the Lord Justice                  TAYLOR
                      Report       as     a   "superb         document"             but     then       criticizes          the

                      fi ndings.         That    is not the case and their misunderstanding

                      arises because of the rather sensational manner in which the
                      newspaper has used the various                           quotes by Mr WRIGHT,                 and in

                      their overriding            interest in,              and emphasis            on,     the     Interim

                      Report which is the one which specifically criticizes                                              South

                      Yorkshire P o l i c e .


                 xii) As     the   interview comes                towards      its end,          Mr WRIGHT returned

                       to the constraints which are upon him:-


                             Mr WRIGHT - "I            only wish that I could be more open
                             in what I've said about Hillsborough because                                        in a
Docunent File                sense I am constrained by the legal situation that
Page 21
                             I'm    in.         But        what    I    would       want     to     say      about

                             Hillsborough         are        those      comments          I would want             to

                             make    on Lord Justice                   TAYLOR's      report but             in    the

                             circumstances I can't."


                             Mr HANNA -          "I    am grateful for what you have said

                             so shall we leave it at that I think."


                             Other voice - "I think you've said a lot more than
                             you've previously said about the - nothing to keep

                             you awake at n i g h t ."


                       The    other      voice        is    believe       to    be        that    of    Superintendent

                       present throughout the interview.


                 xiii) The    interview         continues          about       Mr    WRIGHT's          history      in     the
                       police       service      and        his     future          plans    but       it    returns        to

                       Hillsborough as the interview concludes:-


Docunent File                Mr WRIGHT          - ". . . . please I would like to project
Page 22
                             an optimistic and positive note about Hillsborough

Docunent File        if you could                   do    it   that way.              If     I've not been
Page 22              able to deal with some of the issues in the depth

                     I          would    have       liked      to     and to      say          some       of the

                     things as strongly as I would like to it's because

                     of the constraints we're under."



                And a g a i n :-


                     Mr HANNA - "What about the possibility of a three

                     or          four    cornered          fight      as it       were            between the

                      Council, Club a n d ...... "


                     Mr WRIGHT               - "Well we'll certainly agree                          to that.

                     There'll                either       be    an     amicable             acceptance             of
                         responsibility              or    there will            be    an     action      - but
                         there's        a     lot    of    information           to     come      out    that's

                      not already come o u t ."


                An explanation is provided in Mr WRIGHT's                                      prepared statement

                         "Furthermore           the West Midlands                     enquiry      on behalf

Pages 13, 31             following            the    publication            of        the     Report          on     4
                         August         expanded          to    include          enquiries              for        the

                         evidence.            Indeed it would be                  surprising            if nine

                    and    to    Parliament          later    that    month.            Consequently,           any

                    relevant      evidence        coming      to     light       could       have     been     laid
                    before Lord Justice TAYLOR up to 18 January 1990.                                  However,

                    between 1 August 1989 and 18 January 1990,                              it is true to say
                    that     Lord      Justice       TAYLOR     would          not     be    concerned        with

                    evidence coming to light in respect of individual c a s e s , and

                    it was       in    respect    of    those      that    the       West    Midlands        Police

                    were accumulating information and evidence.



                    I conclude,         therefore,      that the Coroner's enquiries and the

                    criminal      investigation would have uncovered evidence which

                    was    not    laid before          Lord Justice            TAYLOR       between    1 August

                    1989 and the press interview on 5 February 1990.


                xiv) The final quotation which needs to be                           considered is almost
                    at    the end of       the    interview when Mr WRIGHT commented upon

                    Lord Justice TAYLOR's Interim Report:-



                           Mr WRIGHT      - ". . . . I found Lord Justice                     TAYLOR's

                           comments about the evasion of chief officers just
Docunent File              a little harsh.             I thought      it was          - some of his
Page 23
                           comments were savage, I thought, but that's how he

                           saw   it.      But    I    think   they were          harsh       under     the

                           circumstances that the officers found."


                    That was reported in The Sheffield Star:-


Docunent File              "Mr WRIGHT      said he       thought       some      of Lord Justice
Page 4
                           TAYLOR's comments were "harsh" and "savage".


                     The words        published       in the newspaper               do not    do justice        to

                     the actual words            used by Mr WRIGHT              and by       their ambiguity

                     present a danger of misinterpretation among readers.


                     Clearly there are dangers inherent in press interviews under

                     these       circumstances,          particularly             as        there     has      been

                     continuing         intense        interest           in     connection           with      the

                Hillsborough tragedy.                    To be absolutely safe from committing
                a    contempt        of     court        the       interview           should        be    framed           as

                broadly as possible                 and       in such a way              that the public                   and
                the courts would not regard it as improper or irresponsible

                behaviour.            When         proceedings             are    not        only     "active"             but
                imminent        the        only     way       to     be     sure        of     being       safe        from
                accusations          of     contempt          would        be    to    avoid        any    interviews

                where any matter subject to the proceedings                                        is likely to be
                raised.         If    pressed,           then perhaps             a    short        prepared          press

                statement could be issued with no opportunity for qu estions,

                supplementary              or    otherwise,           to    be     asked.           As     to       whether

                proceedings           are       imminent        the       only     guidelines             of    a     legal
                nature     seem            to be    the       view of            the    Director           of       Public

Document Pile   Prosecutions              who has       in    mind a period               of       about       24    to    48
Page 64         hours,     and        the        case        law     which        seems        to     suggest             that
                proceedings                10 months          away would               not     be     sufficiently

                proximate.           Wh en Mr WRIGHT gave his interview on 5 February
                1990 he was under the impression that the Coroner's Inquests

                would     not    be        re-opened          until the          summer        of    1990       or    even

                early in 1991.


                During    the        interview he neither                   identified nor referred                         to

                any    individual except perhaps                       Lord Justice TAYLOR and even
                then     only by           reference          to his        Interim          and    Final       Reports,
                both     of which           are    public          documents.            The        information            and

                opinions        expressed by Mr WRIGHT were neutral                                   to the extent

                that no     individual was                   referred to by name,                    and no          direct

                implication           as    to     the       guilt    or blame           of    anyone          was    made.
                Neither     can       it be         said       that    Mr       WRIGHT        commented             upon    or

                discussed        the        evidence           which        will        be     laid        before          the

                Coroner,    other than in very general terms.                                      There is nothing

                in    the words           used b y Mr WRIGHT which                       can be          construed          as

                inaccurate, unfair,                 irresponsible or unjust.


                I am firmly of the view that the strict liability rule does
                not apply in this case and there is therefore no requirement

                for the papers to be submitted to the Attorney General.                                                     If
                               Continuation Form                                           Page No 22




       that be    so,      then for Mr WRIGHT to be                         guilty of a contempt
       under the Contempt of Court Act 1981,                                or at Common Law,                it
       will be    necessary            to prove       an    intention or               calculation           on

       his   part     to      impede        or   prejudice               the     administration              of

       justice.          Outside           of    the       strict           liability           rule        the

       proceedings likely to be prejudiced or impeded could include

       any    criminal         as        well    as    civil             proc ee di ng s,        including

       Coroner's      Inquests.            Although        the contempt              alleged against

       Mr WRIGHT is not caught by the strict liability rule of the

       Contempt of Court Act 1981 because                             it cannot be shown that

       the course of justice in question will be seriouslv impeded
       or prejudiced,            that does not mean that Mr WRIGHT cannot be

       liable for contempt of court in respect of conduct intended
       to    impede      or      prejudice          the     administration                 of     justice.

       Indeed,    Section 6(c)             of the 1981 Act expressly provides so.

       The   court has         the       power   to    commit            for    contempt where              the
       intention        is       specifically              intended             to     prejudice            the

       administration            of      justice.         In    Mr       WRIGHT's         case       no    such

       intent has ever been expressly avowed or admitted,                                        so if it

       is present it has to be inferred from all the circumstances,
       including        the      foreseeability            of       the        consequences           of    the

       conduct.


       Finally,       the     contemptuous             intent            need    not      be     the       sole

       intention of the contemnor.


There are a number of established facts                              from which we can deduce

the intention of Mr WRIGHT when using the words he did during the

interview with Mr HANNA on 5 February 1990:-


  i)   The    interview          was      ostensibly           in    respect         of    Mr        WRIGHT's

       recently       announced           retirement        on       1    May     1990,        and    not     in
       respect of Hillsborough.                     However,         as discussed previously,

       Mr    WRIGHT     must      have      known      that         Hillsborough          would           almost
       certainly be raised during the interview.                                     Indeed it seems

       clear     that      one      of    the    motivations              was    for      Mr    WRIGHT        to

       explain the relationship between his retirement and the Lord

       Justice TAYLOR Report.

                ii)   During the interview with Mr HANNA it was made clear by Mr
                      WRIGHT that he was constrained as to what he could say about

                      the Hillsborough                  tragedy;          the Lord Justice TAYLOR enquiry;

                      the Interim and Final Reports;                                 and the Coroner's                 Inquests.
                      That    is       not     conclusive            of       innocent          intention,           of     course,

                      because Mr WRIGHT did,                        in fact,         discuss all of those issues

                      with    Mr        HANNA.               Superintendent                PRATT,          present          at    the

Docunent File         interview,            spontaneously             remarked            that Mr           WRIGHT        h ad   said

                      nothing          to    keep       him       awake       at     night.           However,        Mr     WRIGHT
                      would       be    aware          of     the    Home       Office          Circulars            79/1981       and

Docunent File         115/1982;         he     confined himself                     to    general          comments         without
Pages 58-65           mentioning            any    specific           evidence,           additional            or otherwise;

                      he    identified            no        individuals            by     name       or    otherwise         except

                      Lord Justice TAYLOR;                       and when he              speculated,           gave opinion,

                      or put       forward possibilities,                           he made          this      clear by          using

                      words       like        "may"         or     "I've tried             to        put myself in           their
                      position          ..."      or     "perhaps".                 On    the other            hand, there are

                      two    examples          in       the      interview where                the       reporter        seems     to
                      have     finished             with         Hillsborough              and       the       possibility          of

                      additional             evidence            being     available            at    the      Inquests          which

                      was not available to Lord Justice TAYLOR,                                           and yet Mr WRIGHT

                      for no apparent reason returns unprompted to these issues



Docunent File                Mr        HANNA        -       "You've           not        been        in     charge         of

                             Mr WRIGHT            - "No we've not                    - but       - there will be

                             another           hearing             and        that       will    have          been        the

                             Co ro ne r's         hearing            and       I     think       it        will      be     a

                             different hearing                      and I       think      a     lot      of    evidence

                             that           perhaps          -      Lord           Justice TAYLOR              was        not

                             was not concerned with the rules of evidence.                                                The

                             constrained by the rules of evidence and I think a

                             different picture will                           emerge.           What       I'm anxious

                   things have been done wrongly then they must never

                   happen again."


                   Mr HANNA - "Moving on from that."


                   Mr WRIGHT           - "No it's not come out as I wanted to
                   say     it.        It's       almost as           though        - it's        almost     an

                   admission that                    they were       though I wasn't wanting

                   to say that."


                   Mr HANNA - "Do you want the question again."


                   Mr    WRIGHT            -    "What       I    want      to     say   is       that     Lord

                   Justice TAYLOR's                       enquiry    is finished.                It    is the

                   Coroner who                 is now        going      to    conduct        a    different

                   enquiry.            He's          going to go into the detail.                          The

                   Coroner's               enquiry          will     go      on     for      months        and

                   perhaps        a different picture will                          emerge         from    the

                   Coroner's           enquiry             than emerged from Lord Justice

                   TAYLOR's enquiries."


                These answers gave the reporter the incentive to pursue the

                "additional       evidence"                question,         which was           reasonable      under

                the circumstances.                   A n d aga in: -


                   Mr HANNA - "The football authorities have perhaps

                    arguments or do you feel that ...."


                    Mr WRIGHT          - "That's                a matter for football and if

                    it's      not     seen           to    do   something,         then      if       anything

                   years        police    service      and   the       only      thing        that

                   matters is Hillsborough.               Can't escape it can I."


                   Mr HANNA - "No.             On the other hand,               I think this

Docunent File       morning I wanted to look at Hillsborough,                            I mean
Page 21             maybe if I 'd had more time we would have gone over

                    other a sp ect s."


                    Mr   WRIGHT     - " I only wish             that   I    could be          more

                    open in what I've said about Hillsborough because
                    in a sense I am constrained by the legal situation

                    that I'm in.          But what I would want to say about

                    Hillsborough         are   those    comments       I would          want    to
                    make    on Lord Justice            TAYLOR's    report        but     in    the

                    circumstances I can't."


                Once again the opportunity is given for the reporter to r e ­

                open his questioning on the "additional evidence" issue.



                A nd finally:-


                    Mr HANNA - "Just quickly looking through.                             I mean
Docunent File
Pogg 22             I didn't particularly want to go over the miners'
                    strike and things like that again unless                           ..."


                    Mr WRIGHT       - "Whatever you want               ... What I'd like

                    to     do    ....    please    I    would     like     to     project       an

                    optimistic and positive note about Hillsborough if

                    you could do it that way.                   If I've not been able

                    to   deal with        some    of   the   issues        to    the    depth    I
                    would have liked to and to say some of the things
                    as strongly as I would like to it's because of the

                    constraints we're under."

                Here     the    reporter           has    moved         on     to    other           matters      but    Mr

                WRIGHT's response re-opens the Hillsborough issues.


                However,       when asked directly by Mr HANNA if there was                                            some

Docunent File   evidence       of drink which was                      not   available           to Lord Justice
Page 19         TAYLOR but would come out subsequently, Mr WRIGHT replied:-



                       "I d o n 't k n o w ."


                That is not the answer of someone who has a malicious intent
                to prejudice the Inquest verdict.                                 It is questionable as to
                whether Mr WRIGHT would have allowed Mr HANNA to tape-record
                the    interview         if     it       was      his     intention             to     influence         any

                subsequent proceedings, and similarly it is unlikely that he

                would     have    allowed           Superintendent                PRATT         to    be    present       to

                witness it.         Those acts seem to indicate quite the contrary,

                i.e. no criminal intention.


                There     does     not      appear           to    be    any        evidence          of    a    specific
                intention on Mr WRIGHT's part to prejudice any proceedings.

                But should he have foreseen that consequence as a result of
                his interview?              He is a very experienced police officer and
                Chief      Constable          of     long-standing.                   He    must           be    taken    as

                having       knowledge          of       Home          Office       Circulars              79/1981       and
                115/1982.              He      is        aware          that        in     his            position       his

                pronouncements and opinions are of wide public interest.                                                  He

                must have known that whatever reason was                                        given for a press

                interview,        Hillsborough was                     certain       to be           raised and         that

                any     response,           statement             or     opinion           in    respect          of     the
                disaster,        the enquiry,             the Interim and Final Reports,                               would

                be     read      avidly         by       a        considerable             percentage             of     the

                population and              that     some potential                 jurors           at    the   Inquests

                were likely to read the newspaper reports of the interview.
                Such was       the weight that would be put on what he said that

                there      was     a     likelihood               that       it      could           influence         their

                decision as jurors.                      I put      this       to Mr WRIGHT                at    interview

                and he replied:-

Pages 50, 51          it    fell      into       any    of     those       ca tegories.          I    have
                      simply       said          that       additional            evidence      may     be

                      Mr    WRIGHT          -    "As    a     Chief        Constable       during       the

                      course of these events I have been unable to avoid

                      press      questions            and    in addition           to    all my      other
                      responsibilities                 there    is    one       of maintaining          the

                      morale       of the South Yorkshire Police.                              The views
                      expressed are the views held within the Force and

                      it is right in my view that the public                                   should be

                      aware of them."


                      Mr SHARP - "Even if the effect of these statements

                      may     be      to    influence          people       within       the    judicial

                      p r o c e s s ."


                      Mr WRIGHT - "I don't see how they can"


                It    is    worth        repeating          that     Mr     WRIGHT       had    no    control    or

                influence over what was printed in The Sheffield Star.                                          One
                can speculate that he should have realised or expected that

                The    Sheffield           Star would not print                    everything he ha d         said

                and wo uld present the words                         in the most sensational manner

                possible.          That is no more than speculation.

                      (4)   Mr WRIGHT            infers       in the pronouncements                      in the       Sheffield

                                Star       on   5     February        1990        that        "There       is     a     lot    of

                                information to come                 out    that has           not   already come          out".

                                He has      therefore         failed to do his job.                       If he was       aware

                                of information that was material to Lord Justice TAYLOR'S

                                conclusions he             should have        ensured           it was placed before

                                him.        I   accept        that    if    any       information          came       into    his

                                possession           after    Lord Justice            TAYLOR        closed his          receipt

                                of       written      evidence        then       Mr       WRIGHT         could    hardly       be

                                expected        to    do     so.     However          I   find      it    incredible          that

                                there should be              "a lot of information"                  available          in this

                                short space of time.

                      (5) (6)        I   will    deal        with    complaints            (5)      and     (6)       together.

                                Basically what             I am saying           is that         if Mr WRIGHT has              any

                                additional           information,          whether         it    relates         to   drink     or

                                not,      it similarly would be                  confidential and as                   outlined

                                in complaint (1) would be breach of privilege if released

                                publicly,       if as I suspect this is the same information as

                                was      available         to TAYLOR       i.e.       - post        mortem       reports       and

                                Professor USHER'S summary then clearly this cannot be new

                                or       additional.           Clearly       under         these     circumstances             his

                                pronouncements constitute a deliberate attempt to mislead

                                and/or influence prospective jurors.

                      (7)       Despite         the     fact        that    Mr        WRIGHT        is     quoted       in     the

                                Sheffield Star editorial on the article                                   in the newspaper

                                as       calling      the     TAYLOR       report         a     "Superb         document"       he

                                persists        in     claiming        that       the      primary        conclusions          are




                                                                                                                                     4*

                             wrong.        I believe this behaviour to be the application of

                              double      standards         by    the    Chief    Constable        and    I    consider

                              such behaviour to be the worst of unprofessional conduct,

                              and I suspect his motives for doing so.                              I believe he         is

                                trying    to       divert    blame       away    from    the    South         Yorkshire

                              Police and on to the f a n s .

                      It is my complaint that in making these claims now and publicly

                      Mr WRIGHT has committed a disagraceful act.                              That this act             is

                      quite clearly not what should be expected from a chief officer,

                       that it could affect the Inquest's                       impartiality and finally it

                       appears     to    be    a    blatant       attempt        to   distort       the       course     of

                      justice.      By     this      I mean that at             the   time   the    pronouncements

                      were made         it was     not known to Mr WRIGHT               or     anybody else            that

                       the   incpifests        would    be        non-adversarial,           and     it       could     be

                       construed that Mr WRIGHT'S motives were                          designed to            influence

                       the verdict of the Coroner's inquest.

                       I   sign   this     statement         on    the    understanding         that      I     will     be

                       supplied with a copy at the earliest possible moment.

                       I am the father of Christopher Barry DEVONSIDE who died in the

                       Hillsborough         tragedy   on    15    April   1989.       Sometime        in   February

                       1990   I became aware of an article which h a d been published                              in

                       the    Sheffield      Star     Newspaper      on   5    February       1990.        In    this

                       article the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police announced

                       his    retirement      and     several      quotations       are    attributed       to   him

                       concerning the Hillsborough tragedy and the Lord Juctice TAYLOR

                       report.     Having read the article                I considered that Mr WRIGHT,

                       the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police,                         should not have

                       have made       the pronouncements          and in doing so was            in breach of

                       his privileged position.                  Because of    this       I wrote a letter of
Continued statement of Barry William DEVONSIDE                                                                           Page 2




                      complaint to South Yorkshire Police Authority on 3 March 1990.

                      In     this    letter       I outlined areas             of my          complaint which               I will

                      now     enlarge     upon.        I have       been shown            a copy of             the    letter        I

                      sent     to    the Police        Authority         and       I    acknowledge          that      it     is    a

                      true copy.

                       (1)          I believe        that    Mr    WRIGHT       has      misused his              position          by

                                    implying through innuendo,                     insinuation and veiled hints

                                    that additional          evidence,         not       revealed to Lord Justice

                                    TAYLOR     would       show   alcohol          played          a    major     part      in     the

                                    tragedy.        I quote from the Star Newspaper article.

                                    (a)   Mr        WRIGHT        suggests             that        additional          evidence

                                             particularly about the effect of alcohol on fans,

                                             will      present        "a       different                 picture"        at        the

                                             Coroner's       Inquest       into         the    95       deaths,       yet     to    be

                                             held.

                                    (b)   He      found      it   hard     to      accept              TAYLOR'S    conclusion

                                             that drink h ad no bearing on the run-up to the 95

                                             deaths.         "There      is    a       Coroner's          he aring            and    I

                                             think perhaps a different picture will e m e r g e " , he

                                             said to d a y .

                                    (c)   "Lord Justice TAYLOR was dealing with evidence and

                                             he      was     emphasising               the         evidence        which           was

                                             available".

                                             "What     I     found    difficult               to       understand        was       the

                                             finding that there was drinking among a percentage

                                             of     the     fans,     and          that       they         were       under        the

                                             influence of drink,                but      that          it had no       effect on

                                             the events".




                                                                                                                                         7

                                         "I found that a little difficult to come to terms

                                 (d)    "There        will       be     a     lot     of       additional         evidence

                                        presented to             the    Coroner's          inquiry which was              not

                                         presented at            Lord Justice              TAYLOR'S         inquiry which

                                        may        put      a    different           complexion             on    the      end

                                         product".

                                In my     view       Mr     WRIGHT      is       trying     to      fabricate      a     smoke

                                screen     to      protect        his       officers        and        perhaps     his     own

                                reputation.

                       (2)      Mr WRIGHT'S apparent attempt                        to influence either public

                                opinion       or      the       minds       of     potential           jurors     in     both

                                coroner's       inquests         and        possible       criminal         poroceedings,

                                newspaper, and elsewhere in the press.

                      My      overall concern         is Mr       WRIGHT'S          misuse,         in my     opinion,        of

                       privileged      information and            of    his       misuse       of     his    position      of

                       power and authority such as to devalue                              our   trust and faith              in

                       the judicial system by exerting persuasive influence.

                       This    complaint        is     made      on     the       basis        that     the      additional

                       information that Mr WRIGHT refers to is available, and if it is

                       not available this adds substance to my complaint.

                       I am the father of Philip HAMMOND who died in the Hillsborough

                       tragedy on 15 April          1989.        Around   5 February       1990       I was    made

                       aware of an article in the newspaper,                 the Sheffied Star dated 5

                       February 1990.        The newspaper article dealt with the retirement

                       of   the   Chief    Constable       of    South    Yorkshire       Police,      Mr     Peter

                       WRIGHT.     Certain pronouncements            in the article were attributed

                       to   the    Chief     Constable,          which    concerned       the     Hillsborough

                       tragedy and the Lord Justice TAYLOR report.                         I felt Mr WRIGHT

                       should     not have       made    these    remarks    and     I wrote      a    letter      of

                       complaint     to    the    South     Yorkshire       Police      Authority.            In   my

                      have    been    shown    a    copy       of     the       letter       I wrote        to     the    South

                      copy.    The complaints I make are as follows:

                      (1)      I feel that Mr WRIGHT abused his privileged position as

                               Chief     Constable             by     inferring          to        the     Sheffield       Star

                               newspaper       that       he    had           "confidential"             information       that

                               would come          to    light       in the          inquest,       and     that    this was

                               derogatory to those who lost their lives.                                     I accept that

                                the word      "confidential"                  is my wo rd and does not appear

                                in the article            in the newspaper                  as being attributed to

                               Mr WRIGHT.           To support                this    complaint          I draw attention

                                to the following parts of the newspaper a rti cle .

                                (a)    "There          will     be        a     lot    of         additional        evidence

                                        of     the       fans,            and    that        they        were     under     the

                                        influence of drink,                     but    that        it had no       effect on

                                        the    events.              I found          that     a    little       difficult    to

                                  (d)      Mr WRIGHT        said:        "There   is a       lot      I would want         to

                                           say    about      Hillsborough.               There        are    a     lot     of

                                           comments     I     would       want    to    make       on   Lord       Justice

                                           TAYLOR'S report, but in the circumstances I can't.

                                           There is a lot of information to come out that has

                                           not already come o u t " .

                       (2)   In     this    complaint         I    am     saying       that      if     there      is     any

                             additional          evidence     he has       failed      to     do his        duty by       not

                             making this evidence known to Lord Justice TAYLOR.

                             It   is my personal view and belief                       that      these      disgraceful

                             proribuncements by Mr WRIGHT,                  could effect the impartiality

                             of    jurors     in both        Coroner's       inquest         proceedings           and    any

                             criminal proceedings.                  I feel that Mr WRIGHT'S actions                        in

                             this       regard    are   not       what    should    be      expected        of     a    Chief

                             Constable and he has therefore abused the privilege of his

                             rank in doing so.

                        I    am   employed    as    a       newspaper       reporter          by     the    Sheffield         Star

                        Newspaper.       On     Monday        5    February        1990        I was        told      to    attend

                        South     Yorkshire        Police         Headquarters           to        interview          the    Chief

                        Constable,      Mr    Peter         WRIGHT.         Mr     WRIGHT       was        to    announce      his

                        retirement.       I saw Mr WRIGHT in his office.                             He was accompanied

                        by Superintendent Tony PRATT.                      I interviewed Mr WRIGHT and with

                        his permission tape recorded what was said.                                   At the conclusion

                        of    the    interview          I    returned        to    the        newspaper           offices       and

                        transcribed       the      contents           of     the     tape.             I        submitted       the

                        transcription        to    one       of    the     assistant          editors,          who   wrote     the

                        leader      column    "The          Star    Says".          I        then    wrote        the       article

                      announcing Mr WRIGHT'S retirement.                            Bob WESTERDALE is quoted as

                      the reporter              in the copy I have                been shown by         Superintendent

                      DARLING       but       the        article       is mine      and my      name   does     appear       in

                      later     editions            of        the    newspaper.           The    article       is    a     true

                      reflection of what was said by Mr WRIGHT and I transcribed the

                      tape    of    the       interview as             accurately     as     I could with           the    time

                      available          to     me before             the news deadline.        The    parts    of          the

                      article       in        inverted              commas   show     they       are    direct           quotes

                      attributable              to Mr          WRIGHT, although           not    necessarily          in    the

                      order he said them.                      I do not believe they distort the context

                      of the       interview by changing them around in this fashion.                                        In

                      places       to avoid repetition or ambiguity                          I omitted a word or a

                      clause.        A    few words                I misheard w hen        I transcribed        the       tape,

                      but     there'’ again              I    do    not   believe     such      changes    altered          the

                      essence       of what          Mr WRIGHT was              saying.    In any event             following

                      publication of the article,                         there was no          complaint made by Mr

                      WRIGHT or the South Yorkshire P o l i c e .                         I would also repeat that

                      the leader column quotation "Superb document" was also said by

                      Mr WRIGHT in the interview with me.                             I have handed the original

                      tape    recording             of       the    interview    to Superintendent         DARLING.           I

                      sign this statement on the understanding that I will receive a

                      copy.

                     Please ask your questions."                At 11.23am I proceeded to question

      He is the man who has borne the brunt o f.
  devastating criticism after the Hillsborough
  disaster. His force was condemned for ineffK
  clency and Its senior officers came In for
  especially severe criticism.
      The final report by1Lord Justice Taylor
  has not retracted any of that criticism.
      Today,-although still under legal con­
  straints, be has spoken out more frankly than
  ever.before. He- h.as__made dear that he_
  accepts the Taylor report He even calls It a~

   who were under tremendous pressure, both
   oh the day and at the Inquiry.. He under­

       To bis credit, Peter Wright offered to
  resign after Hillsborough but councillors,'
  persuaded him to stay. That was a measure
  of their respect lor his qualities.-He has.
  stayed on “to pull the force together" lor a
  new leader, so that h can go forward with

fao:- R .C .Johnston- Clerk & Financial Officer.             7th February 1990


Dear Mr. Johnston,

re: Chief Constable Mr. Peter Wright.

I wish to file a complaint against Mr. Wright.
I would ask you to cause this to be recorded and, in view of his
forthcoming "retirement", request urgent attention to its resolution.

Despite "setting aside" the national press on the basis that   they are
reporting second hand, I consider his actions and comments during the
interview with the "Sheffield Star" of the 5th instant to be at best a
breach of his privileged position and at worst a deliberate attempt to
divert the cause of justice.

As some comments can be considered as being actions designed to influence
the outcome of the Coroners      Inquest,  1 have copied this letter to
Dr.Popper at the Medico-Legal Centre for his attention.

Similarily, a copy will be forwarded to the West Midlands Police
Investigation Team and because of Mr.Wrights rank, The Police Complaints
Authority.

My specific complaints are as follows:-

   1) Mr.  Wright is guilty of abuse of the privilege of his position in
   suggesting to the media he was aware that   information would come to
   light in the Inquest,that would present "a different picture".

   He infers this relates to drink and or its effects.
   Assuming Mr.Wright  has seen such "evidence" it is"confidential" until
   deemed otherwise by H.M.Coroner and should remain that way. Clearly a
   breach of priviledge.

   2)By suggesting that this     "puts a different complexion on the end
   product" he prejudges the verdict  of the Coroner.   This  is clearly
   outside his authority and insults the juristiction of the coroner's
   office.
   3)1 believe that his pronouncements could prejudice Inquest Jurors,
   who will  of course be drawn from the area covered by the newpaper
   cited.

 COMPLAINTS BY TREVOR HICKS AND PHILLIP HAMMOND

  I refer to your letter of 20 February and the enclosed letters of complaint vy
  Trevor Hicks and Phillip Hammond.  I think it would be appropriate if the
  Authority had some comment from me to consider when deciding ow
  complaint should be pursued.

  To put the complaints in context following the announcement of my retirement I
  gave a personal interview to reporters from 'The Star' and 'The Jim e*
  agree that the direct quotes contained in the articles are   £
  of the comments I made but not necessarily in the order in
  I accept no responsibility for articles that appeared in other newspapers.

  I will now consent on the specific complaints raised by Mr Hicks which also
   subsume the general complaints made by Mr Hammond.

          1      Mr WriEht is ^ h h -v of abuse of the privilege of his position in.
                                       L l l . he vas aware that Information would c o m i T o
                  light in the Inquest, that would present "a different pictu r e ^

                  He infers this relates to drink and/or its effects,       ^asumlng
                  Mr Wriaht has seen such "evidence— i t j j — confident a —          —
                  “r w J a g bv HM Coroner and should remain that w a y . _ C l e a r l ^ a
                  breach of privilege.

          Anyone with knowledge of the Hillsborough Inquiry will be aware
          t S E H e . not heard at t t a Inquiry * 1 1 r ^ a S c l f i c           » h e « de. " 5
          of the barrier collapse in pen three and the specific place wn
           occurred are obvious instances of evidence inot ^  r^ aJirectot of
           Furthermore, the West Midlands enquiry on behalf of ^ e    Jugtice

           IZUr;
           Public Prosecutions and HM Coroner has continued
                    Inquiry conceded on 29 Juno 1989. This en,ulry is £
           going and may also produce £resh evidence. * h»”

              fresh evidence relates to drink and would make it clear
              knowledge of what specific evidence will emerge.

        Continuation of statement of                     PETER WRIGHT
        I will now            comment on the              specific complaints                      raised by Mr Hicks which

        also subsume the general complaints made by Mr Hammond and Mr Devonside.




                  1•     Mr Wright          is     guilty of             abuse of       the     privilege of his position

                         in suggesting to the media he was aware that information would

                         come    to       light        in the       Inquest,        that would              present      "a different

                         picture".

                         deemed       otherwise           by        HM    Coroner        and       should      remain            that       way.

                         Clearly a breach of privilege.

                  Anyone       with       knowledge            of    the     Hillsborough               Inquiry      will         be    aware

                   that evidence not heard at the Inquiry will emerge at the Inquest.

                   The   cause       of     the        barrier       collapse         in    pen       three     and      the      specific

                   place      where       deaths        occurred          are obvious           instances          of    evidence            not

                   yet    revealed.              Furthermore,             the    West       Midlands          enquiry            on    behalf

                   of    HM   Coroner            has    continued          since       Lord        Justice      Taylor's              Inquiry

                   concluded         on    29     June        1989,       and    following            the    publication               of    the

                   Report      on    4 August           expanded          to include           enquiries        for      the      Director

                   of    Public       Prosecutions.                  These      enquiries             are    still      on-going             and

                   may    also      produce            fresh    evidence.             Indeed          it    would       be       surprising

                   if    nine       months         additional             investigation               did     not.           I    have       not

                   inferred         that     the       fresh        evidence       relates         to      drink     and would              make

                                      STATEMENT OF WITNESS

               (C.J. Act, 1967, s. 9; M.C.A., 1980, s. 102; M.C. Rules, 1981, r.70)

                   it quite     clear      I have        no knowledge            of what        specific evidence will

                   emerge.




                   To say as I did that this additional evidence "may put a different

                   complexion on the end product" was a proper comment and not a breach

                   of   privilege,         whatever that         may       mean.           It    is essential       for      the

                   well-being and morale of the Force that officers see someone giving

                   public     expression         to     their    views,      and      it      is my    responsibility         as

                   Chief Constable to do so.




                   2.   By    suggesting          that this       "puts      a    different            complexion      on    the

                        end    product"          he   prejudges        the       verdict        of    the   Coroner.        This

                        is    clearly       outside his         authority          and insults        the   jurisdiction

                        of the Coroner's office.




                   In   support      of    his    complaint,          Mr   Hicks      uses      a     selective    quotation

                   which leaves out the qualifying word                           'may'       included in the article.

                   Given     that    additional          evidence will           be   produced         and having      regard

                   to   my    role    as    spokesman           for    the    South        Yorkshire        Police,     I    see

                   nothing wrong in expressing the belief that this additional evidence

                   may put a different complexion on the end product.




                   3.   Ibelieve      that        his     pronouncements                      could    prejudice       Inquest

                jurors,         who    will        of    course          be    drawn       from the            area      covered       by

                the newspaper cited.




          The   allegation            that       my      comments          could       prejudice              potential         jurors

          again      has    no       basis       when        reflected         against        what       I said during                the

          interviews.            Having           regard           to    all     the       publicity              given        to    Lord

          Justice      Taylor's            Inquiry,           all       that    has     been        said          by    many    people

          publicly         during      and       since        the       Inquiry      and      specifically               the    recent

          'First      Tuesday'         programme,              the      suggestion            that       my    statement            could

          prejudice jurors is quite simply nonsense.




          4.    He    goes       on    to        infer        that      Lord     Justice           Taylor          was    not       aware

                of    all       of    the    facts           and    "that      there        is      a    lot      of     information

                that       has       not     yet        come       out".       He     has        therefore,              by    his     own

                admission,            failed to do his job.                       If he is aware of information

                that is material to Lord Justice Taylor's conclusions he should

                have ensured it was placed before him.




          All   the        evidence         in    the        possession         of     the       South        Yorkshire             Police

          has     been      handed          to     the       West       Midlands        enquiry.               The       information

          not     presented           to     the      Hillsborough              Inquiry            and    the          basis    for     my

          comments         is    indicated              in    my    response          at      1.    and       I    cannot       add     to

          it.

                        presumably          it   is     additional          to    that       contained        in   the     summary

                        document         produced       by    Professor           Usher          for    Justice    Taylor       (the

                        one withdrawn            from circulation)                and to the post mortem reports

                        - in which case we shall be askinq our lawyers to obtain details

                        of it and to establish why this was withheld from u s .




                  I have not claimed that the material related to drink.




                  6.    If,    as    I    suspect,       this       is    merely        the       same    information,          then

                        Mr Wright         is well        aware      that this          has        been available for many

                        months.          Clearly        it    cannot        be    "new"          or    "additional"        to   that

                        considered by Taylor.




                        Under       these    circumstances               his     actions         constitute        a deliberate

                        attempt      to     mislead          - an    offence         under        the    discipline        code   or

                        worse.




                  I    can    only       refer     to    my        comments          above        in    relation      to    new   or

                   it.     The only information regarding the inquiry that I have received

                   from        the        West              Midlands                       Police          has         been           procedural,                       relating                    to

                   intentions of HM Coroner in respect of the Inquest.




                          and even calls it "a superb document".




                          Yet        he         persists                       in         claiming           the         primary                conclusion                    is       wrong.

                          That is as clear                                      an example of                      "double               standards"                    as one could

                          ever         see and                      serves                 to underline                   questions                   regarding                  what his

                          motives are.




                   I     have       from            the            outset                 made        it    clear             that          I accept                   the         findings

                   of    Lord Justice                           Taylor                    and    as        Chief Constable                          I have ensured that

                   all        his        recommendations                                    have             been pursued                       vigorously                     and          with

                   expedition.                       I        have              also            said         that I              consider                 his         Pinal             Report

                   to     be    a      superb                  document                    that addresses                     all        the             ills          of       football.

                   If     the        recommendations                                       of    the       Report               are          implemented                      they           will

                  (CJ. Act, 1967, s. 9; M.C.A., 1980, s. 102; M.C. Rules, 1981, r.70)

        Continuation of statement of                     peter WRIGHT

                   all the views             expressed or the weight given to the various factors

                   involved.           For        instance,         the     South       Yorkshire           Police      accepting         the

                   criticisms          contained              in    Lord        Justice       Taylor's            Report       agreed      to

                   settle    compensation                claims.           Other       parties         involved who were                 also

                   criticised declined to do so.




                   My motives, which Mr Hicks calls into question,                                               are quite straight­

                   forward.        They           are    to       ensure        that    all       available           evidence      within

                   my     Force    is        forthcoming             for        those       investigating              the     events      at

                   Hillsborough            whether           or    not     it    is    critical         of       police      action.       It

                   remains    a fact              that   all       the evidence has not as yet been publicly

                   presented.              It, may       be        that    when        it    is       the    conclusions         already
                                           vr,*

                   arrived    at will              be    unaffected.              On    the       other      hand it may         present

                   a     different         picture           of    the     causal       factors         that          resulted      in    the

                   terrible tragedy at Hillsborough.




        The only matter                in Mr        Hammond's             letter not covered above is the rather

        astonishing           claim         that        my    comments          were     derogatory              to    those    who      lost

        their lives.              I am unable to understand how he came to that conclusion.




        The       interview        I       gave     to       'The     Times'          immediately            followed        that       given

        to        'The    Star',       a     copy       of    both        printed       accounts            is    attached.         I    also

        gave        two    television             and    two       radio        interviews         during         which      I expressed

        similar comments.

        I have        carefully       considered the        comments      I made to all sections of             the

        media        and   being     as    objective   as    I   am    able     I     cannot   find   any   comment

        which,        having regard to the Office I hold,                    I consider improper or would

        wish to withdraw.

                             again made            a public      statement which may                  raise     itself

                             veracity         of    your     claim     that      additional            evidence        or

Continued Record of Interview of Mr Peter WRIGHT                                                                  PAGE 2




                         A.    I hope        that    additional       evidence          will       emerge       to     show

                               that the opening of the gates was the direct result of

                               fans'     misbehaviour         and not        a    loss       of police          control,

                               and     the    other   two     areas       which    I     feel          is vital      is   in
                               relationship to the place of death and the cause of the

                               collapse of the barrier in pen 3.                         I also hope that the

                               continuing           enquiry      will       have        revealed             information

                               additional to that given to Lord Justice TAYLOR.


                         Q.    Was there any evidence or information gathered by your

                               force        subsequent      to      the     completion             of     the     written

                               evidence of the TAYLOR enquiry.



                         A.    Yes.


                         Q.    Could you give me an idea of the type of evidence.



                         A.    J     have     prevented        my     officers           from          making     direct

                               enquiries into Hillsborough since TAYLOR as this may be
                               said to be           interfering with             the    enquiry being             carried

                               out     by     the    West   Midlands         Police.               I    have    received
                               letters        from    the   public        containing              information        which

                               may amount to evidence and these have been forwarded to
                               the West        Midlands       Police.           Through       our        solicitors       we
                               have sought an independent police view of the events of

                               the     day    which     will     also      be     presented             to     subsequent

                               enquiries.


                         Q.    Because that information came to hand after TAYLOR had
                                completed his report it was impossible to lay it before
                                Lord     Justice       TAYLOR.            Did     any        of    that        additional

                                   information relate to alcohol consumed by any of their

                                fans or the effect of alcohol on their behaviour.



                         A.    Every item of evidence that we possessed was fed into
                                Lord     Justice      TAYLOR.             After        the    conclusion          of      the
                                   TAYLOR    enquiry     all     additional             evidence          received        has

                              been    fed       into       the    West       Midland         Police.        Some         of    it

                              related to the behaviour of fans.                                   The police         opinion

                              to which         I referred is still with our solicitor and I
                              do not think it                has been referred to the West Midlands

                              Police but they                are aware of it.                    My statements to the
                              press       and     those           made       publicly            contain       two       basic

                              elements.           The first            is     I   do         not    agree      with        Lord

                              Justice TAYLOR'S conclusion in the interim report that

                              the    behaviour         of        the    fans      outside         the    gates      was       not

                              contributory            to     the        disaster.            The        second      is     that
                              additional evidence not to do with drunkenness will be

                              presented          at        the     Coroner's            hearing          and      for         the
                              information         of       the     Director            of    Public       Prosecutions.

                              These two statements have no link between them and yet
                              it     is   clear        that            those who            have    complained            have

                              inferred a link.



                        Q.   You must be aware that you in your position carry a lot

                              of    weight       and       your        pronouncements              and    opinions            are

                              given due weight because of your position.                                       Bearing in

                              mind that you realised when you agreed to                                     do the Star
                              interview that Hillsborough would come up you must have

                              realised         that    any       responses         you      made     would have           been

                              read with         avid       interest.              It    can be       argued      that         you

                              must have          known potential jurors for the inquest were

                              likely      to     read        the        article.             It     could      be    argued

                              therefore         that       your        responses            in    the    newspaper            are

                              likely      to    sway       their        judgement           and perhaps          influence

                              their decision as jurors at the inquest.                                    That it could

                              be argued is perhaps a contempt of co u r t , an attempt to

                              pervert the course of justice at common law,                                       or a very
                              old common law offence                        of culpable           malfeasance.            Have

                              you any response to that.



                       A.    I don't        think having                regard         to what       I    said      that      it
                              could possibly be argued that it fell into any of those
                              categories. I have simply said that additional evidence

                               may    be        forthcoming          and        that       I    hoped        it    would          put    a

                               different          complexion          on the public                  perception.              I have

                               not    said what              that    additional                evidence       will       be       and    I

                               discussion              and     public           statement            during            the     TAYLOR
                               enquiry, media and individual comment afterwards in the

                               press and the First Tuesday television programme,                                                    that

                               my    reasonable              and    necessary              statement          could          possibly

                               influence the course of any judicial proceedings.



                        Q.    Why did you regard it as necessary.


                        A.    As a Chief Constable during the course                                         of these events
                               I have           been    unable        to        avoid press             questions             and       in

                               addition to all my other responsibilities                                           there       is one

                               of     maintaining              the     morale              of     the    South           Yorkshire

                               Police.           The views expressed are the views held within
                               the Force          and it           is right           in my view that                   the    public

                               should be aware of them.



                        Q.    Even        if    the     effect        of        these           statements             may    be        to

                               influence people within the judicial process.



                        A.    I don't see how they can.



                        Q.    Would you go so far then,                          with the benefit of hindsight

                               to say perhaps your comments were injudicious.



                        A.     No     I        don't     withdraw           any        of        them.            I     cannot          be

                               responsible              for        leaps        of     imagination                of    those        who

                               choose to misinterpret what I said.


                        Q.    So everything you said to the Star was either true fact

                               or true opinion.



                        A.     Yes.            What      I    said         in        all       the   interviews               I     gave
                               represented my views and opinions as spokesman for the
                               South Yorkshire Police.

                         Q.   With     the benefit of hindsight would        you change anything

                                  you said.


                         A.   No.



                         Q.   Is there        anything else   you want   tosay.



                         A.   No.

            COMMUNICATION



            Chief        Superintendent             Duckenfield has given his account of his

            understanding             of the peril of Leppings Lane entrances.                                He had

            a life threatening situation at the turnstiles, the result of a

-■          throng in a narrow space and the requests of an experienced and

            valued        Officer,          Superintendent            Marshall, for the gates to be

            opened.         Beyond the gates was ample space.                              The opening of the

■x          gates     would run counter to Policing policy.                                To open the gates

            whilst perhaps the obvious course was not a decision,                                       it may be

            said     easily          taken.          In     the circumstances, whilst foresight

3           (essentially         the         result       of    hindsight)           might        suggest       that

            various         matters           should      have        entered        his     mind,      his       pre­

             occupation was with the safety of those outside.                                     It is perhaps

0           too     easy       here        to say what else he should have done.                             He gave

             the order to open the gates.



             CRUSHING

1
             Given       the     propensity           in the terraces for fans to sway, surge

O           and     move       and     that     such       actions         are,       it     is    arguable,        in

             themselves          potentially           highly         dangerous            (whether or not any

             barrier        fails          should     anyone lose their footing or faint), it

 •-.»       TOay    be     difficult to form any reliable view as to how and when



                                                                 28
any     particular          injury          or    death        was    in   fact      caused.   The

situation       may     be        simple         or     may     be highly complex, but the

substantial           injuries         and       death        would    appear       to   have been

sustained        in     Pan       3    and        below the area protected by barrier

124A.           To arrive         at a view that because people went into the

tunnel     upon        the       opening          of    Gate     C    injuries or death were

thereby        caused would require a detailed investigation the like

of     which     has     not,         on     the       occasion       of   this Inquiry, been

attempted.            Whilst perhaps convenient and for certain purposes

attractive such a simplistic view would not, it is submitted be

justified.             This       has       not        been    a trial nor is there, it is

submitted,             the            material           available         upon      which     such

 conclusions          m i g h t even be tentatively based.                     Whilst it may be

 considered          that        notions         such     as     the burden and standard of

 proof         may impede          the       Inquiry process, the fact is that they

 have     not     featured            and        that what has been done has been done

 whilst evidence and further material are still being sought and

 gathered.        Speculation               will       not     suffice     although       it may be

 interesting            to        ponder           what        satisfactory         or   sufficient

 explanation           or explanations can be given for, as appears to be

 the     case,       some        deaths having occurred to individuals who may

 have      come in          at        the    second opening of Gate C.                   The Inquiry

 cannot,        it     is     submitted permit the conclusions post hoc ergo

 propter hoc.


 As to the positions in which people may have died we urge that,

  as    has     been indicated will be the case, there should be taken
  into     account          the       material          supplied      by    t h e   South Yorkshire

  Police in relation to Pen 3.
ACTIONS


Criticism is aafle of the Police action taken upon the nature of

the     problem        being realised.                      In this context it is uiged that,

it was not unreasonable for there to have been no specific plan

to     deal     with        such         an event.                      It w a s     not foreseen.        When it

occurred        it was h o r r e n d o u s and outside anyones expectation but

Police        officers           at    different levels displayed initiative and

acted        whether        or        not they had been previously or were at the

material        time        under instruction and direction,                                      officers went

to the tunnel within moments and made endeavours to relieve the

throng        and bring out casualties.                                         Such was done quite quickly.

The      perimeter          gates        were           opened,                    people were helped up and

out.         Endeavours were made to cause the crowd to go back which

 endeavours were not it seems understood or immediately complied

 with.         Many in the crowd were oblivious that any incident let

 alone        some     tragedy          had     o   c   c   u   r   r   e   d    although they were close to

 it.'



 A     major     incident               was set             in              train,     operation support was

 called,        Ambulance               and help was summoned.                              In so far as there

 was        chaos or confusion                that, in                      the earlier stages,         is perhaps

 understandable.                      People        did                 their        best    in    many instances

 without        regard           for     their              personal convenience or wellbeing.

 Officers,           Messrs           Nesbitt, Greenwood and McKay                                for   example set

  about        arranging              and   organising.                              The    emergency      services

  attended           and    it must,          in the light of the material available,

  be        doubtful       whether any lives or injuries would or could have

     been     saved        in the circumstances by any other course of action

     once it was realised that people were trapped and crushed.

in      our submission,            close analysis of the. accounts given to the.

Inquiry          reveal         that        such     obstacles      as    may    have presented

themselves            to       emergency           vehicles (for example, non-etncrgency

            "I     think it went as smoothly using the first entrance as

             it would have done using the in-out method"



 and       then       also       to the account given by Station Officer Easson

 on Day 24 at page 6SE which suggests that the in-out method may

 have        been         available          to     such Ambulances from the first or at

 least         from        a    stage        earlier than Station Officer Higgins was

 himself aware of.

       Sir

       HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 79/1981:            CONTEMPT OF COURT ACT 1931

       1.   I ara directed by the Secret.-ury of State to inform you that the Contempt of
       Court Act 1981 will come into force,■;for all purposes not relating to legal
       aid, on 27 August 1 9 8 1 .

       2.   Much of the Act implements, w i t h ’some modifications, recommendations of the
       Phillimore Committee on Contempt of Court (1 9 7 ^ 7 Cmnd 579*0.  '^ie following
       changes made by the Act are discussed in detail below:-      modification of the
       strict liability rule;   regulation of the use of tape-recorders in court;^
       provision for punishing contempt in the face af magistrates 1 courts;      variation
       of certain penalties;  ’enforcement of fines;     and clarification of procedure
       under section Sj> of the M a g i s t r a t e s 1 Courts Act 1 9 8 0 .                      ,

       3«      Other important provisions in the Act are                as follows:

                Section 8 makes it a contempt of court to obtain, disclose^or solicit
                specified information relating to the deliberations of a jury in legal
                p roc eedings;

                Section 11 empowers a court which (in the exercise of existing powers)
                allows a name or other matter to be withheld from the public to give
                directions prohibiting its publication;  and

                Section 13 will make provision for granting legal aid to anyone liable to
                be committed or fined for contempt in the face of the court (whether in a
                m agistrat es 1 court under section 11 of this Act, or in a county court or a
                   superior court) .

       Modification of the strict liability rule

            Sections 1 to 7 of the Act are conccrnctl with the strict liability rule, whi<
       is the rule of law whereby conduct tending to interfere with the course of justicf
       may be treated as contempt of court regardless of intent.        Section 1 defines the
       rule as set out above while section 2        limits its scope so that it applies only tc
       publications which crcnte a substantial risk that the course of justice in the
       proceedings in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced.        The proceedings
       in nuestic ■. muct be ' a ctive1 , ;is defined in Schedule 1 of the Act, for the rule t



                                                           -1-
      ply.  It is likely th/it the courts and the police will n-ooivr; cnuuiries from ^
    Press who may wich to know whether particular proceedings a m activc within the
    meaning of the Act.  i-’or the guidance of recipients of this circular a summary of
    the relevant paragraphs of Schedule 1 is attached.

    5»   Sections 3 to 6 modify the effect of the strict liability rule by providing
    a number of specific defences .and savings while section 7 provides that proceedings
    for contempt of court under the strict liability rule shall not be instituted
    except with or by the, consent of the Attorney General or on the motion of a court
    having jurisdiction to deal with it.

    Tape-recorders in court

 6 .  Section 9 contains provisions governing the use of tape-recorders in court.       It
 provides that it is a contentpt of court (i) to use in court, or bring into court
 for use, any tape recorder or other instrument for recording sound, exceat with
 the leave of the c o u r t ; or (ii) to publish a recording of legal proceedings or
 (iii) to use any such recording in contravention of any conditions which the court
 may have attached to the grant of permission to use the machine.      The section does
 not apply to the making 027 use of sound recordings for purposes of official
 transcripts. •                                                *

?.     The section thus gives courts a complete discretion whether to permit the use
of tape-recorders in court and, if permission is granted, whether to impose
conditions.        Circumstances will, of course, vary and there may in particular
circumstances be practical objections to the use of recording machines;          there is,
howrver, no objection in principle to their use, especially by those connected
-'ith the proceedings.       The Secretary of State accoi'dingly suggests that in proper
casos applications £rom parties or thoir legal representatives to use taue-recorders
should be given sympathetic consideration (especially when the applicant is unable
h imself to tivke a note of the^proceedings), as shoulfi applications from accredited
representatives of the Press or broadcasting organisations, who wish to use a
recording; of the proceedings as an aide-memoire in compiling a report of them.
Part i c u l a r attention should be paid in criminal-cases, however, to any risk that
recordings might be used for briefing witnesses.

8 .    Practical objections which might lead to a     refusal to permit the'use ofa
recording machine might include the sensitivity of the subject matter of the
■oroceedings, the nervous disposition o f a witness or any disturbance which the
    chine might causa in court;  and the court should not hesitate to revoke permission
already granted if use o f a machine appears to distract any participant in the
p roceedings or otherwise cause a disturbance.

C ont e m p t in m a ^ s t r a t e s 1 courts

     Section 12 gives magistrates' courts jurisdiction to deal with contempt
committed in the face of the court and empowers them to deal with anyone who
wilfully insults any justice, witness or officer of the court, or solicitor or
counsel having business in the court, during his sitting or attendance there, or
who interrupts the proceedings or otherwise misbehaves in court.     Under subscction (2)
the court may order any o fficer of the court or constable to take the offender into
custody and detain him until the court rises, and may, if it thinks fit, commit
the offender into custody for a specified period not exceeding one month, or
impose a fine not exceeding £500, or both.   Subsection (3) precludes the making
of an attendance centre order (under section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 19^+3)
where it appears to the court that the offender is under 1?.     Subsection (k)
provides that the court ray at any time revoke a co.Vini ttal order made under
  subsection (2) and order the offender's discharge, while subsection (5) provides
  for the application, in relation to an order under scctior. 11, of certain
  provisions in the Magistrates' Courts Act 1 9 S 0 (namely section 3 6 (rc-Etrictions
  on fines in respect of young persons);     sections 75 to 91 (enforcement);    section 1
  (appeal to C rown-Cour t); scction 1 3 6 (overnight detention in default of payment);
  and section 1^2(1) (power to rectify mistakes)).

 Penalties

 10*   Section      and Schedule ^ together amend the maximum penalty for the ox'fences
 in subsections (1) and (2) of section 19 and in section 25 of the Coroners Act 1 8 8 7
 ( failing to appear or serve as u juror;    failing to appear or give evidence as a
 witness and, as a medical practitioner, failing to oboy a coroner's summons) to a
 fine of £200;     and that for the offence in section 97 of the Magistrates' Courts
 Act 1 9 8 0 (refusal to be rworn, or to give evidence, or to produce a document) to
 one month's imprisonment, or a fine of £ 5 0 0 or both.

 Enforcement of Fines


        Section 1 6 is concerncd with enforcement of fires is-posed for contempt of cour
 by superior courts other than the Crown Court, the Court of Appeal, Criminal
 Divi s i o n or the House of Lords on appeal from that division. In particular,
 subsection ( 1 ) provides that one way in which such a fine may be enforced is sn
 if it were a fine imposed by the Crown Court.      Subsection (3) applies the provision
 of sections 31 and J>2 of the Powers of -Criminal Courts Act 1973 to a fine enforced
 in this way.

 Clarification of procedure un d e r scction 6 3 of the- Kap;i.-,tr.,it.es' Courts Act 1 9 8 0

 12*     Section 1? and Schedule 5 establish the means by which proceedings are to be
brought under section b'j>(j>) of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1 9 8 0 for punishing
disobedience to an order oth er than for the payment of money. Subsection (1)
provides that the powers of a court under section 6 3 (3 ) roay be exercised either of
 the court's own motion or by order on complaint and is intended to remove any doubt
as to the proper means of invoking these powers.          Subsection (2) applies 1.he
provisions of the 1 9 8 0 Act to such proceedings and, with Schedule .'3 ensures that
where the court proceeds of its own motion certain provisions of the 1 9 8 0 Act
shall apply as if a complaint h a d been made.      It is anticinated that this
clarification will facilitate the enforcement of, for exaraole, orders for the
custody of or access to children and for family protection or exclusion from the
matrimonial home-under the Matrimonial P r o c e e d i n g (Magistrates' Courts) Act 1 9 6 0 ,
th.e Guardianship of Minors Act 1971 and the Domestic Proooedings and Magistrates'
Co u r t Act 1978.


                                                             I am, Sir

      Sir

      HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 115/1982
      PUEEHEE ADVICE TO THE POLICE ON THE CONTEMPT OP COUBT ACT 1981

      1.    Home Office Circular No 79/1981: Contempt of Court Act 1081,               •
      ■brought the Act to the attention of chief officers of policeanH
      included a section on the strict liability rule.The purpose of
      this further circular is to enlarge on the advice to chief officers
      about the implications for them of the Act      related matters.

     2.   As was set out in the Annex to the earlier circular, under the
     Contempt of Court Act 1981 criminal proceedings are deemed to become
     active from the time when any of the following has occurred:

              (a)      arrest without warrant

              (b)      the issue of a warrant for arrest

              (c)      the issue of a summons to appear

              (d)     the service of an indictment or other documents specifying
                      the charge

              (e)     oral charge.

    3.   As soon as criminal proceedings are active, under the strict
    liability rule any communication which is addressed to the public at
    large or any section of the public may be treated as a contempt of court
    if it creates a substantial risk that the course of justice will be
    seriously impeded or prejudiced. Chief officers are reminded that
    although proceedings will cease to be active at the conclusion of the
    trial, they will become active again as soon as appellate proceedings
    are conmenced. Use detailed provisions to determine whether proceedings
    are active are set out in Schedule 1 to the Act.
4    The Secretary of State is particularly mindful of the danger
inherent in uress conferences following the questioning of a suspected
person in connection with crimes where there has been intense interest
hy the media. Accordingly, he has consulted the Director of Public        ^
Prosecutions who has stated that he considers it right that any guidelines
to chief officers of police on the holding of press conferences or the
granting of interviews in these circumstances should "be framed more
broadly than the Contempt of Court let requires so as to guard not merely
against the risk of contempt proceedings, but against any semblance o
what the public or the courts might regard as improper or irresponsible
behaviour. Hence, the only safe guideline whenever the p r e f erment _of
charges is imminent is one that totally prohibits the granting of interviews,
although allowing a brief prepared statement to be issued. The
prohibition should cover, so far as is practicable, all conversation
between the officers in the case and members of the media as well as formal
press conferences. The embargo in interviews should apply whenever it is
exDected that a person will shortly be charged with an offence whether or
not he or she has ,been arrested. By '’shortly'1, the Director of Public
Prosecutions has in mind a period of about 24      43 hours although t is
must be left to the discretion of chief officers.

5.   As far as any prepared statement is concerned, the Director of Public
Prosecutions considers that it would be best confined to a formula such
as "A / ~ m a n _ 7 / " w o m a n_J is bei ng questioned by the police". However, the
statement should also indicate whether or not the person concerned is
u n d e r arrest or has b een charged.  This would signal clearly to the me d i a
whether criminal proceedings were active within the terms of the Act.         If
the person c o n c erne d has not been arrested or charged, it might be proper,
if pressed, to give some indication of when a charge is likely to be
preferred o r w h e n the suspect might make a court appearance.

6.      The appr oach set out in the two preceding paragraphs a p p l i e s with^even
greater force to any communication by a police officer to the media af^e r
proceedings have become active against a defendant.         Information should be
given in bri e f and neutral terms, eg "A £ man_/ £ v o m a a J has been charged
w i t h an o ffence of £ ...... J " . Comments which, however indirectly, mignt
seem to the public to imply guilt, and discussion of or comment upon the
evidence, should be avoided.        Special considerations apply, b y virtue of
section 6 o f the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976,          cases in whi c n a
m a n has b e e n ch arged with a rape offence *.s defined in section 1{2) of *he
Acr.     In such cases matter likely to lead members of the public to iden^i-y
the person charged as the person against whom the accusation of rape has
b e e n made should not be published except in the special circumstances
described in section 6 of the 1976 Act.
7.   1516 strict liability rule also affects communications such as
"wanted" posters, if proceedings against the person concerned are active
within the meaning of the Act,  eg where a defendant charged with an
offence has escaped. Chief officers should therefore guard against any
unwarranted implications of guilt in the wording of such posters. Por
example, the description "wanted terrorist" would "be objectionable unless
the person so described was wanted in connection with an offence of
terrorism of which he had already been convicted. In appropriate
circumstances, accentable descriptions could include "wanted for
questioning about /*"terrorist offences_J7£ aerioua offences involving'
attacks on women_7".   There is no objection to the inclusion of
photographs in "wanted" posters worded so as to meet the requirements of
the Act, but chief officers will wish to bear in mind the possible loss of
evidential value of subsequent identifications of the wanted person.

8.   Circumstances will arise in some cases in which it will be necessary
for the public to be warned that a "wanted" person should not be approached
or is believed to be dangerous. Such warnings, if carefully worked to avoid
any unwarranted implication of guilt, are unlikely to be regarded as
prejudicial.

9.   The strict liability role will not apply to "wanted" communications
when none of the steps listed in paragraph 2 above has been taken, but
even in these circumstances implications of guilt should be avoided.

10. The Director of Public Prosecutions has requested that if a possible
contempt of court is to be investigated by the police, whether or not at the
direction at any. stage of the trial judge, the Director should be notified
as soon as possible, whether or not he has assumed responsibility for the
conduct of the case.

                        Tours faithfully,

                                Chief Constable’s Foreword
Hillsborough

Throughout the greater part of 1989 all members of the South Yorkshire Police, but
particularly those officers who were directly involved, have been preoccupied with the
disaster that occurred at Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April when 95 football supporters
tragically lost their lives and many others were injured. The then Home Secretary, The Rt
Hon Douglas Hurd, instituted a Public Inquiry and appointed The Rt Hon Lord Justice
Taylor to carry out the Inquiry. Lord Justice Taylor commenced his investigation into the
disaster at Sheffield on 15 May and concluded the public hearings on 29 June. He
published his Interim Report on 4 August and his conclusion was that although there were
other causes, the major reason for the disaster was the failure of police control at the
ground.

In consequence of the strong criticism he directed at members of the Force I thought it
appropriate to submit my offer of resignation to the Police Authority. At a meeting held on
14 August the Police Authority declined to accept it and I continued in office. My
immediate objectives in the aftermath of the Interim Report were to implement those
recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor that lay within the control of the police and to take
such further action as I considered appropriate in the light of the Interim Report. One such
action was the institution of an enquiry to establish if any criminal liability arose as a result
of the deaths, and this will continue into 1990.

The on-going effects of that tragic event will continue for some considerable time to come.
At the conclusion of their enquiries the West Midlands Police will submit their report to the
Director of Public Prosecutions for a decision on the question of criminal liability in respect
of any individual. The Inquest to be held by Her Majesty’s Coroner cannot proceed to a
conclusion until the question of criminal action has been resolved and even on the most
optimistic forecast the Inquest is unlikely to be concluded before the end of 1990. Coupled
with the attendant civil proceedings, the legal aftermath of Hillsborough is likely to continue
well into the 1990s.

The traumatic and lasting effect this tragedy has had on the families of those who died, on
those injured and their families, and on many others involved, together with the safety of all
those likely to attend major sporting events in the future, demanded that the highest level
of scrutiny be devoted to all the various aspects of investigation and legal review. The loss
and hurt so clearly suffered by so many requires this lengthy and detailed consideration
and, regardless of where blame lies, it is essential that the causes should be properly and
fully determined and every measure necessary taken to prevent a recurrence.

The fact that South Yorkshire Police officers stand adjudged to have been contributors to
this terrible tragedy is obviously a source of sorrow and regret within the Force. We have
responded by opening negotiations with those bereaved and injured with the aim of
resolving all bona fide claim s and preventing further grief to them. I have previously
publicly expressed to the bereaved and injured my regret and deepest sympathy and now
do so again.

Cuts in Resources

The shadow of this event has in a public sense all but obscured the normal work of the
Force. Furthermore, the financial cost of Hillsborough has had a marked effect on
resources and consequently upon our effectiveness during the year. Because the financial
year continues until 1 April 1990 the effect on the policing of South Yorkshire will also
continue until and beyond that date.

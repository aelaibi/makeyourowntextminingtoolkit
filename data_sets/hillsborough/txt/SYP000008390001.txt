          sure      I felt           a    slight            pulse        on       his     carotid       artery           but       it    was       faint.

          The      doctor         followed             onto         the       third        body    and       also        said       it    was       too

          late.          T h e y ’d       been       placed          there          without        any       sheet        over          their       faces        and

          I ’d     naturally              assumed            they        were       still        alive.           Thats        why       I tried          to

          revive         them.

          It     was     only        when       the     doctor               pronounced           them       all       dead        that       he    pulled

          It     d i d n ’t     register             then          that       they        were    dead       even        then.           T h e y ’d      looked,

          full      of    life.           It    was     a     hopeless              shame.

          Straight            away         I approached                  a    young        policeman           who       was       walking          around

          in     shock.           1 asked            him      if     he       wanted        to    get       the     names          and    addresses              of

          the      casualties               that       were         in       my    book     in    order        to      placate           anxious

          relatives             then        went       off

As    I entered, the                g y m j/i t h     the       young       officer         I saw        a       group    of

There        were    all       sizes,          some     children,            many        adults.             The    police

Inspector           who       I was       directed           towards         appeared          very          busy       and    I decided

not     to    b o t h e r h im .

Before        leaving          the       morgue,        where         the    atmosphere            was           uncanny       very-

quiet        and    unreal,          I    initially             attempted           to    console            a    woman       who

identified           a        relative from amongst                     the    deceased.              She         was      then given

to    the     attentions             and        c a r e of   the       official          club     Chaplain.

Again        I did       a    check       on    the     casualties             in    the      corridor             leading          to    the

first        aid    room.           The    majority             of    the     seriously           injured           had       been       taken

had gone.            Until          this       point     he had          been a jovial                spirit,            trying          to

A    Policeman           came       into       the    room       and     cried       openly.             He       was    in    deep

shock.         I    comforted             him     for    a      while.        He     later       thanked            me    and       left.,

Furtherrriore            every       casualty           had      someone          looking        after            them,       nobody          was

It     was     actually            pushed          into        his    abdomen.              From         observations                   I couldn't

say      how       deep      the    actual           intrusion           into        the        flesh         was.        I    c o u l d n ’t

make        out      what     it    was.           He     was    in    shock         and        d i d n ’t a p p e a r         to       know

about         it.      He     was       soon       transferee!           to     hospital.

only        the      police        and     St      Johns        Ambulance            were        left.

             1    left       Hillsborough                 by    ambulance             at        about    6.00        pm    (1300)        and       arrived

             home       at    '7.00      pm    (1900).,

             From       my    own      point         of    view          I feel       a     certain              amount    of     guilt       in     the   way

             that       I feel         that     despite              all       my    training,,                  I wish    I could          have

             h ro u g h t     these        th re e        p e o p 1e      b a c:k    to     I if e , a 11 h o u g h        in     h i n d s ig h t    I k now

             they       were        dead      prior        to       my    arrival.

                                                    I saw       a    documentary                 on   television            last        week       about

             the       Nasi      Holocaust scares                        at    the    death-camps.                   The    sight        of    the

             mounting           dead       piles          bought          it    all       back.         These        three        men    all       looked

             so    well,        I     c o u l d n 't      grasp          the    fact        I    lost    them=            I *ve      been     told      since

             by    a    doctor         that     their           ruddy          colour           was   attributed            to       their     causes

             uf    death         by     way     of c r u s h i n g .            I still           see    the        vomit       on    the     mouths «

             It    was       u n r e a l . I ’ ll    never          forget           that       day     in          April.

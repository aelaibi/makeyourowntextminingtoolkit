  ENFORCEMENT OF FOOTBALL EXCLUSION ORDERS


  The Home Secretary has seen your submission of 30 July.


  2    The Home Secretary takes the view that if exclusion
  orders are to be of any use   at all they need to be enforced.
  SinlfjP^ encouraging the courts to make more orders, which are
  then not enforced, would achieve very little.     He is not
  convinced that a simple 'signing in' scheme would not work.
  Most football fans travel at least some distance to the
  football ground and the Home Secretary thinks that a
  requirement to sign in at, say, 3.30 pm on a Saturday at their
  local police station would make it very difficult, if not
  impossible, for those subject to exclusion orders to go to
  football matches.   A signing in scheme such as this would
         the resource implications for the police service.


  3    The Home Secretary would be grateful if you could give
  further thought, to an enforcement scheme for exclusion orders
  along these lines and provide further advice.

              I am a m ar r i e d           man and        I live        at     the a b o v e       address.

              I am      a Ng/ttingham F o r e s t               s u p p o r t e r and        have    been       so   for    fi fty years,

             although          these        days     I only attend               matches         once      or    twice      a year.

              I did      not a t t e n d H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o t b a l l             ground     on S a t u r d a y     April       15

              days      events,        but       I did a t t e n d       the     same        match    last       y e a r and    in f a c t

              contacted            the C h i e f     Constables           Dept        at     South Yorkshire               Police     to    pass

              on m y     congratulations                 to     h im    in the w a y          that    the       game    had    been      handled ■

              In    particular             the    fact     that        there     wa s      plenty     of P o l i c e m e n     about       who

              were      all    good        humoured,           there     were        mounted        officers         forming       the     fans

              into      queues        outside        the       Leppings         Ln    turnstiles.               My   ticket     on

              that      o c c a s i o n was       for    the     seating         above        the L e p p i n g s      Lane    terraces          and

              we w e n t      through        the        turnstiles             with     no    problem       at a l l . A f t e r     half       time

                                                                                                                                         SI 068

             I w as      very     impressed with            the w a y         that, o f f i c e r s      went     to       the    front

             rows     of    the    s e ats    and     removed Liverpool                 fans       who    ha d    climbed          up       from

             the    terraces         and     taken    seats.After              the    game     I asked a Policeman                         how        I

             could       get a     bus     back     into S h e f f i e l d a n d        he    explained           to me          how      I would

             have     to w a l k     perhaps        a third        of a m i l e       away     from       the     g r o un d ,     and       then

             turn     r i ght     towards       the    b u se s    w h i c h were       taking        Notts       Forest          supporters

             into     Sheffield City              c en tre,       to    the    railway        station.            Several          buses          set

             off    in     convoy      escorted        by s e v e r a l       Police        motor     cyclists             thus    ensuring

             that     a no n      s to p   j ou rne y was         made    into       the     town     c e n tre.           The    whole

             Police        presence        through        the     afternoon          ha d    left     me w i t h       a    lasting

             impression which                is w h a t    u r g e d me       to   contact         the   Chief         Constable.

             At    that     time     I was     a Justice           of    the P e a c e       but    resigned           last       year.

             During        my   twelve       years    as    a Magistrate              I have        dealt        many       times        with

             football           hooliganism.

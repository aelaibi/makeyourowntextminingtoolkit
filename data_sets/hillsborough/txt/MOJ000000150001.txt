                 Dear Miss Buxton

                 Hillsborough Inquest - Judicial Review

                 I am just writing to let you know the date has now apparently been fixed for
                 the judicial review hearing of 1st November 1993.

                 I understand that Mr Terence Coghlan QC has been instructed but it has
                 primarily been Dr Popper and the Sheffield City Council Legal Department who
                 have been involved in the matter thus far and I do not know a great deal
                 more.

                 I am writing to let Dr Burton know the date as well.

                 Yours sincerely




                 H M Coroner

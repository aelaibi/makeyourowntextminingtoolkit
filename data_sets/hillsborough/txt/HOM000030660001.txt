D ear Ms Adlington

HILLSBOROUGH

Thank you for your recent correspondence about docum entation held by South Yorkshire Police. I am
sorry for the delay in replying. As I indicated in my Fax o f 5 O ctober, I have been pursuing the points
raised in your earlier correspondence w ith South Yorkshire Police.

Following the com m encem ent o f the private prosecution, the South Yorkshire Police took legal advice that
it should defer voluntary disclosure o f material related to the prosecution until the outcom e o f the CPS
review was known. The force has accepted that this does n o t preclude it from fulfilling the H om e
Secretary’s com m itm ent to place copies o f all the police statem ents in the H ouse o f Com m ons Library.

I understand that South Yorkshire Police have now forwarded to the H ouse o f Com m ons Library the
original statem ents of:

Chief Inspector Beal    R317
PC G ilm our            QOR393
Inspector Sykes         R109 [Together w ith a print out o f a supplem entary statem ent • R109A]
Sgt. Crawford           R170A [in print out form]

and

PC H ood                R427 A m ended

Copies o f the parts o f the following statem ents which were missing or illegible have also been forwarded to
the Library.

PC Cran                QOR259          Page 2
Sgt France             R343            Page 3
PC Sapsford            QORR173         Page 1
D /S g t Lindley       R174            Complete
PC H ooson             R198            Page 3
    Insp. White              R215A          Pages 1-3
    Insp. Purdy              R217           Complete

    The statements were sent direct to the House of Commons Library and I would suggest that you to contact
    the library direct in respect of these statements.

    The force have not traced any additional statements for:

    PCAucland                R ll
    PS Payne                 R47
    PS Taylor W              R169
    PC Fenwick               R203
    PC Raybould              R300
    PC Keenan                R444
    PC Crookes               R377
    PC West                  R380
    PC Coney                 R430
    PC Cawkwell              QOR25

I   Additionally, South Yorkshire Police have supplied the following statements:

    PC Huckstepp             R336 original
    PC Illingworth           R293 together with print out of statement
    PC Wild                  QOR84 original
    Sgt Higgins              R516 both statements
    PC Bromley               both statements

    These are enclosed with the hard copy of this letter and have also been forwarded to the Library.

    The force indicate that D/Chief Inspector Brooke (R566) made no statement about the events on the day
    of the disaster itself. R566 relates to a subsequent report received from DCI Brooke.

    The force have not yet been able to provide an explanation of the terms QOR and FIO

    I hope this will assist you.
                                            Yours sincerely

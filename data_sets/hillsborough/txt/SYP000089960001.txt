                 of

The    journey V a h e f f i e Id took a p p r o x i m a t e l y two hours and we a rr iv ed

at a design at ed        coach    park    near to the     railway about a ten mi nute walk

from the ground.

There were       no delays whatsoe ver          en-route    to S h ef fi eld and we ar riv ed

at our de st in at ion at         12 noon     <1200).     I eat the       refreshments       I had

taken with me and together with                         and the others and most of the

other    lads on the       coach we       caught a bus to the outskirts           of Sh ef fie ld

where we then went          for a drink at an unknown              public    house.     We

remained at the          pub later than we should have              not    realising    how far

away    the ground was,                          and    I were   two of the     last    to leave

wh ic h would be arou nd 2.30             pm (1430).      We were    unable    to catch any

form of transport and eventu all y ar ri ve d at the St ad iu m at be twen                       1505/

1510 hours.                had tickets        for the Lep pings Lane         standing area so

we se pa rat ed and went to our             respective     places.

I can honestly state             that    I saw no excessive        drinking    by supporters           or

fighting     on the      route    back to the ground.            I cannot    remember       seeing

any Police aro un d due to the fact we were                     late and were    not

parti cul arl y       looking at what was        going    on aro un d us.

On arriving at the Lep pings Ln end of the ground                         1 saw no Police or

St ewards    present at the turnstiles.                 There was a stewa rd on the other-

side    of the turnstiles who             dir ected me to my seating area.              I

experien ced      no di ffi cul ty entering         the ground and         I handed my ticket

    over to the operator.          Once    inside   the ground there was         no fighting or

drunkenness       taking    place.        I made my way along and und er ne at h the

the front of th q/ Nor th stand alm os t               exactl y opposite      the Centre       line.

I     rejoined              &            who were al r e a dy    in their seats.

On joining the other             two they     informed me jokingly that Liverpool                had

scored there          had been a pitch invasion and the              players    had left the

                                                                                                                   S 3422

             field.        This    time wo uld be about                 hours.      I remained seated and

             w a t c h e d what was      unfolding      in front of me           I formed the opinion that

             the    centre       pens were    far    too full and the fans             inside    knowing       this

             were    trying       to escape.        I had no idea at this time that a tragedy was

             unfolding       in front of me.

             At about       1520 hours       I saw fans demolis hi ng           the adv er ti si ng      hoardings

             behind the goal area to use as make                   shift stretchers             the    supp orters

             loaded injured fans onto               the hoardings and           ran past the N o r t h stand.

             I also saw a Police Offic er               running away from the Le ppings Lane

             carrying a fan           in his arms - more an d more              fans    could be seen climbing

             over    the front        perimeter     fence and onto        the    playing surface          in fact

             the    IS yard box out to the touch               lines was        full   of supporters and

             Po 1 i ce.Duri ng the above            proceedings a large          number of Pol ic e officers

             were    brought       into the grot/nd and        placed as far as           I could see along

             the entire          lengthfspf tlye N o rt h s t a n d .   By this time word had got to us

             that a supporter            na d/d ie d and most      of us in the stand wa tch ed                in

             disbelief       that the         Polic e   in front of us ap pe a r e d      not to be ass isting

             with the       injured      in any way.       I then told                  and             [ could

             wa tch this         no longer    I could see fans were             very dis tr es se d      so    I jumped

             down    in front of the stand and started to kick down one of the

             hoardings,          two Police     officers    remo ns tr at ed with me and              infor med me to

             return to my seat.                I expla ine d to them that help was required on                        the

             pitch and both the               officers wa l ke d away. This        signaled the

             op po rt uni ty for other supporters              in the stand to follow my example and

                     and               joined me together with a,large                 number of other

             supporters.I          along with about four others             carried a hoarding                in

             towards       the    penalty spot where        I saw a young         g i r l kneeling on the


A            ground,       she was     holding a young Jboy of between                 16 - 20 ye ars of age,

             white    in colour,         slim build,     fare had short brown           coloured hair and was

or jacket on.         I would say from his dress                  that he    probably       lived
                                         S
outside    of Liverpool.           He was unconscious and             I could see the girl was

in a very di str ess ed          state.     I informed her w*"' should take                 the youth

to the first Aid          post, where he wou ld          i^ceive medical            help.     Myself

and other    fans then          placed him on^/tne hoarding and                  ran towards       the

corner between the Spion K o ^ ^ n d N o r t h              stand where other          fans had been

conveyed.        On arr iv in g    there a Police Officer             or first a i d atten dan t

cleared a pathway to a ll ow us access                  to the      rear of the No rt h stand.

A Police    officer       informed us to          leave the body there and ire w ou ld be

cared for,       I was    not satisfied with this act io n and                    I informed       the

officer    of this.       I could see the youth was               desparaC ely       in need of

medical attention.              He was    still    unc ons cio us ^ n d app ea re d        to be

lifeless.        We con tinued on into t h e ^ y r n n a ^ T u m a r e a , and were met by

anoth er Police officer.               Thi> of f i ce\ Vook the           lads   pulse and     I did

likewise.        We both    l o o k e r at each other and shook our heads.                     The

officer    said,     “H e ’s g p e "     and went to go away.             I then decid ed          the

best    course of act >6 n would be to see               if I could rescusitate               the    lad,

so I commenced rryouth to mouth for a few seconds.                           The Police       officer

and    I tool tunms       until    the    lad ap p e a r e d to    come    round.     His    eyes

opened momerftarily and closed a ga in as this occurred                            I was    in the

process of       performing       rescusitation.         The      lads breath came          out and

exhaled    into me and          I then knew that he was dead.                    I did not know what

else   to do and by this           time    I myself was distressed.                 I looked around

the gym and       could see about 40 bodies              1 ined up against           the back wall.

I returned       to the    pitch and       left via the        players      tunnel    in order       to

inform my parents,          whi ch     I did.      I then    returned to the          pitch and sat

down    in disbelief at what had occurred,                   I was    given a drink of water

by a young ball          boy.     I located             who was      distraught as his brother

        had gone to the Leppings Lane                I remained with                  taking him

back    to the    coach where we were ev ent ual ly joined by ail                      the others

             at about 5 pm           C1700).   We    left S h e f f i e l d shortly after   this   to return

             to _____________ .During          the time      I was at the ground,        I never w i t ne ss ed

             any thi ng       I consider    to be a criminal         offence.

             I was     not     injured at the mat d if        neither did I att en d hospital,         my

             views and obse rva ti ons a^tfer the ma tc h was               stopped are that        the Police

             were wrong ly deploye/r in front of the No rt h s t a n d , when they would

             have been of moi\r use assi st in g              the dead and        injured fans.

             1 would also          like to add that Liverpool            should have been al l o c a t e d a

             larger      number      of tickets and the other          end of the ground.

             On ar riving        back at the        coach   I was   surp ri sed   to find about    four of

             our    party who had been to the match were                  still     in po ssession of their

             entire m a t c h ticket.          This may      indicate they entered either           illegally

Mr Tommy Smith

Dear Tommy,

You may remember me as the Guy who passed the mints to you at
Hillsborough last Saturday, when we watched in disbelief, and without
knowledge, the occurrances behind the Liverpool goal.

Having relived the horrific scenes on "Match of the Day", T.V. and
Radio News coverage throughout the week end, I am absolutely saddened
and sickened at the terrible tradegy which has now fully unfolded.

Only now do we fully understand the extent of the mayhem and carnage,
and the reasons for what seemingly appeared to be a pitch invasion,
the seriousness of the disaster.   The courage of the supporters who
assisted medical and Police Officers, and the quantity of the people
who sustained injuries, or who sadly died.

Our prayers and sympathies are assured to the bereaved, and the City
of Liverpool.

However, I cannot overlook the abuse which you suffered from 2 or 3
of the contingency of Forest Supporters seated in front of you, and
on behalf of the majority, I apologise for their actions and insulting
behaviour.

Hopefully the implementation of the Identity Card System will eliminate
this type of individual and leave the majority of people to watch and
enjoy football without tollerating such unruly behaviour.

Yours sincerely,




Supporter of Nottingham Forest Football Club.

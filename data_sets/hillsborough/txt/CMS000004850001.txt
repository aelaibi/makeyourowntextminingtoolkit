Secretary             State


You will recall that we met the football au th or iti es on 14
N o v e m b e r 1989 to discuss the na tional m e m b e r s h i p scheme and other
football issues.          It was agreed that we w ou ld meet them again
before long and you have s u b s e q u en tl y said that you w o u l d see
them if they w a n t e d a meeting.

There have no w been              two separate     requests   for Mi nis ter ial
meetings.            Bert Millichip, Chai rma n of the Football Association,
has w r i t t e n to the Home Se c r e t ar y asking for a me e t i n g to discuss
the next steps in taking forward the Taylor re co mm en dat ion s and
the Football League have a p pr oa ch ed us at official level to ask
for a m e e t i n g w i t h you.         The League    say that they wo uld
p a r t i c u l a r l y like to talk about the pl an ni ng imp lic ati ons of a
move to a ll -s ea te r stadia (ie ne w sites on the edge of towns).
Not for the first time, the FA and the League seem not to have
told each other that they were asking for meetings, though each
has asked to include the other in its meeting.

I u n d e r s t a n d that Home Office offici als have advi sed the Home
S e c r e t a r y to agree to see both bodies and to invite me to attend
the meeting, and that he is content.                 If you also agree, I am
in clined to go along w i t h this approach.            It w o u l d be excessive
for both you and the Home Se c r e t a ry to see them; he has yet to
meet them for the first time; and I can deal wi t h the plann ing
issues w h i c h they wi s h to raise.           We could perh aps offer the
pr o sp ec t of a further m e e t i n g wi t h you at a later date, if one is
needed.

If you are h ap py wi t h this approach,         I will make     the n e c es sa ry
ar ra n g e m e n t s w it h the Home Office.

Report of the Clerk and Treasurer


FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


1.    Purpose of the Report

To update the Authority on discussions relating to the provision of financial assistance to
Mr David Duckenfield and Mr Bernard Murray.



      2.     Recommendations

      The Authority are asked to note the report.




3.    Provisions of Financial Assistance

3.1   Following the special meeting of the Authority on the 21 May last, Garretts, the
       Authority’s advisors, wrote to the Solicitors acting for Mr David Duckenfield and Mr
       Bernard Murray informing them of the decisions taken on the applications made by
       the former police officers for the provision of financial assistance in connection with
       various legal proceedings. Copies of the letters are attached as appendices 1 and
      2.

3.2   Both firms of Solicitors acting for the former police officers are in discussion with
      Garretts concerning the information required to enable Garretts to satisfy
      themselves that the costs and disbursements claimed in relation to the criminal
      proceedings before the Leeds Magistrates Court up to the 5 February 1999 have
      been properly and reasonably incurred.

3.3   In relation to the proceedings in the Leeds Magistrates Court from the 5 February
      1999 to the end of the committal, again both firms are in discussion with Garretts
      concerning the information which they require to draw up a costs agreement. The
      difficulties faced by both firms in providing estimates is highlighted in the letters
      attached at appendices 3 and 4. It will also be appreciated that at the present time
      their attention is very much focused on the forthcoming committal hearing.
      Notwithstanding, Mr Murray’s Solicitor has confirmed over the telephone that his
      client accepts in principle, the terms set out by the Authority for the provision of
      further financial assistance. He has also indicated that Mr Duckenfield’s Solicitor is
      also able to give this confirmation. Garretts are pressing for written confirmation.
3.4   Mr Duckenfield’s Solicitor in discussing the terms on which financial assistance is
      provided has proposed that a blended rate of £125 is used as opposed to separate
      rates according to the advisor undertaking the work involved. Advice on the
      reasonableness of this approach will be sought from the costs draftsman retained
      by the Authority.

3.5   The Solicitors for Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have asked whether theAuthority
       would consider a payment on account in respect of the costs incurred up to the 5
       February this year. The Clerk and Treasurer has agreed to pay 50% on account
       reserving the right to recover any excess or deduct the same from future payments
       if the costs are settled for a lesser amount.

3.6   South Sefton Criminal Proceedings

      The Clerk to the South Sefton Magistrates Court has finally conceded that Mr
      Duckenfield and Mr Murray did incur costs in these proceedings. Accordingly, they
      are entitled to have their costs assessed and, subject to that assessment, paid out
      of central funds.

4.    Financial Implications

4.1   The financial implications of the provision of financial assistance to Mr Duckenfield
      and Mr Murray were addressed at the Authority’s meeting on the 21 May last and
      will be the subject of regular reports to the Authority.

                                   Leeds criminal proceedings and your costs and expenses in relation to the Judicial

              Dear David

              South Y orkshire Police Authority - Financing o f Defence costs - Mr D D uckenfield

              Many thanks for your letter o f 28 May detailing the decision.

              I w ill work through the requests for further information with our costs consultant to provide
              as much information as possible but you w ill appreciate from previous correspondence that
              this may take some time.

              I will also be providing a copy o f the correspondence to both our Counsel so that w e can
              give as much information to the Authority in regard to future costs.

              I am enclosing herewith recent correspondence from the clerk to the South Sefton
              Magistrates Court and you w ill be pleased to note that he has finally conceded the point in
              regard to costs, and our costs consultant is continuing to liaise on this matter. There are one
              or two fundamental points in issue, such as the rejection o f any Counsel’s fees and our
              present view is that if the clerk maintains his view on this w e w ill ask for the assessment to
              be reviewed.

              I should say that I have seen Walker Morris' letter o f 2 June to you regarding the conduct o f
              proceedings and wholly endorse their comments about the difficulties we face. Any
              estimates w e give will be o f course a genuine best attempt to assist the Authority, but the
              history o f this matter has constantly proved that it is impossible to predict the degree o f
              work involved and that all estimates have tended to be subsequently proved conservative by
              reference to reality.

             Finally, given the amount o f costs that are presently outstanding, and that have been
             incurred since 5 February, 1 am bound to ask whether the Authority would consider a
             payment on account. A s you w ill know, the lawyers have bome the risk and the financial
             implications o f conducting the defence from the tim e o f the issue o f the first Summons in
             June 1998 until now. On any view I do believe a payment on account, given the principal
             matters resolved at the recent meeting is both justified and fair. Having discussed this with
             Richard Manning o f Walker Morris, we would jointly suggest 75% o f the fee estimate to 5
             February 1999. This should leave a safe margin for the Authority in terms o f any costs that

The costs draftsman may think unreasonable, costs that may be recovered from other sources
and otherwise which w ill not form the part o f the reimbursement agreed by die Authority. I
have seen Richard’s letter to B ill W ilkinson and share his views.

can provide any more detailed information in regard to your request I will.

              Dear David

              REQUEST TO SOUTH YORKSHIRE                                              POLICE              AUTHORITY        FO R
              FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
              OUR CLIENT : M R B M URRAY

              Thank you for your letter o f 28 May and I have noted the decisions.

              I rather thought that you already had from me a detailed breakdown o f costs and
              disbursements incurred to 5 January 1999 and a separation out o f the costs and
              expenses in relation to the Judicial Review o f the DPP’s decision. If that is not
              correct, I w ill get these extracted for you.

              I also gave you an estimate o f the likely costs in the Leeds Criminal proceedings
              hence forward but I w ill include the costs already incurred from 6 February. I think
              the most important aspect is that the Authority are confident that Mr Murray and Mr
              Duckenfield are having the best possible defence but in the knowledge that the
              Solicitors acting are not profligate and are not seeking to extract huge and unnecessary
              costs from the Authority. I f you had been asked to predict the time that your firm has
              spent on this matter and give an estimate o f your fees, I am sure that never in your
              wildest dreams would you have anticipated that you would have been involved in all
              o f the work that has been necessary. So it is here. Let me just give you an
              immediate example. Only in this last few moments have I received a fax from HFSG.
              They w ill not be serving their opening note proposed admissions and bundles o f
              documents until 7 June. They now say that a substantial part o f the documents are
              those which they have obtained from the Crown Prosecution Service this year. There
              is clearly going to be a substantial addition to the committal bundle. I have no idea
              o f the extent or how much work this is going to cause to us and Counsel. I am sure
              that you understand this and I want B ill Wilkinson and die members o f the Authority
              to understand die massive difficulties. Albeit that HFSG complain that w e are trying
              to outspend them, the feet o f the matter is that they have raised at least half a m illion
              pounds. They continue to raise money and to sell cassettes, videos and memorabilia.
              They are intending to embark on further fundraising. Before we ever knew what was
              happening they had retained Mr Alun Jones QC and Junior Counsel and they have

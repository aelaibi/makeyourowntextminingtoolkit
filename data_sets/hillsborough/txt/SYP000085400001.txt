                                                                               a t H i 11 s b p r o u g h w h & n

                                                                        this game          I was     posted to wo

                 the turnstiles at the L e p p 1ngs            end of the ground where th

                 Liverpool    fans were to enter the ground.

                 As far as my recollections of the day go I remember that the flow of

                 fans to the ground was         in an orderly manner up unti1/around £ . 3 0 pm

                 (i430)»   It was at this time that a 1arge mass oj/supporters arrived at

                 the ground and started to back up from thsk-^rtjfrinst i 1 es back onto

                 Lappings Ln. This        crowd became bigger and the queues merged into o n e .

                 At one stage       pressure built up to such an extent that at one                            point,            a

                 horse was needed to break the crowd up into some semblance of order.

                 It was during this stage that           pressursr at the turnstiles was such

                 that I was       pre s s e d up w it h my ba ck against the w a l 1 of the g roun d an a
                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                         S2966

       * I was unable to move. After the horse had broken up the crowd,                  the

         pressure subsided and the crowd entered the ground.As far as

         supporters    trying to enter the ground without        tickets   I can

         remember three youths      in their mid teens who tried to jump over the

         turnstiles.

         After the crowd had entered the ground I was directed to the centra.!.

         pen at the Leppings Ln end and,         after   literally having to force my wa

         into the    crowd,   I became   pinned up against    the rear wall of the stand

         and unable to move.      I then left the stand and spent the rest of the

         match at the back of the stand between the turnstiles and the tunnel

         into the ground.

         Throughout the day I was accompanied by PC 2528 HUGHES

                                                                   £5 B e a rd s h a 11 SIG N E D

                Further to my report dated 5.6.89            (050689),   I would like to add the

                following amendments.

                1.    Up until    the use of a horse to break up the crowd it appeared that

                all that was happening was that the fans were pushing to get at any

                turnsti 1e .     The effect of the horse was to channel           them so that they

                were heading      in a more positive direction towards one or two

                turnstiles only.        This   in my opinion eased the crush c o ns i d er a b l y .

                2.     I would say that the horse had the effect of easing the crush

                which,    I would say,    lasted a total      of around 5 - 1 0   minutes.

                3.     I have,   I must also add,     seen a short    clip on national     television

                showing the differences         between 88 and 89 and,      from that few seconds       £

                could see that the problems of 88 were no/thing or nowhere as bad as 89

                 I am a T o t t e n h a m F o o t ball Supporter,             and a few years ago went to all

                 the home      games a n d most         of the a w a y games.            I have   lived     in Corby

                 since      I was   nineteen years of age.                   At   the   present   time    I only a t t e n d

                 two or three games a year.

                 In 1981      <0000815      I a t t e n d e d a Semiyfinai               tball m a t c h at

                 H i l l s b o r o u g h Sheffield.      One or^the          teams         Tottenham but           I am not

                 sure of the other           team.       I t r a velled to the m a t c h on the train with a




                 I cannot      remember what          time we got         to S h e f f i e l d but we had terrace

                 tickets      for the L e p p i n g s Lane end.              I cannot     remember any trouble

                 getting      into the ground           if there had been a particular                   probli         m
                                                                                                       PAGE

sure    I w o u l d have       r emembered        it.     I do not know what         time      1 ente r e d

the ground but we made                 our way to the            perimeter     fence ar ou nd        the

pitch.         I cannot       remember       how many      people were       on the terrace at              this

time    but     I da not       remember any          problem      in getting     to the front.              we

were    not behind the goal and did not use                           the tunnel    to    reach the

terrace.

As far as        I can remember we were                  near    the edges     of the     pitch between

the Nest        terrace and the North S t a n d ? and                  immediately       in front      of me

was a gate        into the          track ar ou nd the          pitch.

I remained        in the       position by the            gate for about        ten m i n u t e s , the game

had started.

The    next     thing    I remember was            people       shouting    that a girl        had    passed

out and she was              then being moved along               from my left towards            the gate

in front        of me.       When she        reached me         I put my hand up onto           the gate

and    pushed back           into    the    crowd behind me to make             room for the girl                to

get out the gate.

S ome o n e   opened the        gate and         the girl       was   helped onto the       pitch,         the

gate was       then     closed       by the Police and my hand was trapped in                         the

gate.         I shouted and          the gate      opened a gain so that I could               get my hand

out.      It was my left             hand w hich had been trapped                in the gate, and it

was    very swollen.

Beca u s e of the        injury       1 was      took straight         to the a m bu la nc e    room at the

far end of the ground.                     The   people    in the a mb ulance       room wa nt ed ms to

go to hospital           but    I wa nt ed to w at ch the g a m e , so they bandaged                       it up

and gave me           some    tablets,       after      this    I sat on the touch         line      in front

of the N or t h Stand           near the Hop end.                1 w a tc he d the whole       of the       game

We    later     got    the train to Corby.                I did not attend my Doctor                 at Corby

             not working at the              time   so did not    lose any time,;    There was       no broke

             bones     in my hand and was            vary badly bruised,

             I have      not w ri t te n to the F .A»      or the Football       Club about    the       injury

             and    1 did not           complain to anyone      on the day or since about          the    injury

             The    injury was a pure accident             the girl    had to be got out and             I was

             not   quick enough            in taking my hand down when         the gats was    closed.

             At the time         I was      standing   in the    terrace    I did not feel    crushed or

             uncoiTif o r t a b i e .     1 certainly did not teal         in any danger,    and    1 could

             push the       crowd back when the girl             had to be    passed out    the gate.

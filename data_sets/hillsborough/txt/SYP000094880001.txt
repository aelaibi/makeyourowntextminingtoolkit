Questions: [ I WAS AT THE LEPPING LN END AT THE MATCH    Y   L   TRAIN    I  LEPPINGS LN
STAND    ST   WE ARRIVED INSIDE THE GROUND AT ABOUT 2.3 0 PM AND HAD WALKED STRAIGHT IN.
WE WENT TO THE CENTRE OF THE STAND AND IT GOT REALLY PACKED. AT ABOUT 2.45 PM, I COULDNT
BREATH BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH. THE CROWD WERE SHOUTING NO MORE ROOM. WE JUMPED OVER THE
BARRIER INTO THE SIDE AREA OF THE STAND.   THERE WAS LOST O ROOM. EVERYBODY WAS WELL
BEHAVED. AT ABOUT 2.55 PM, THE CRUSH IN THE CENTR GOT WORSE.      Y    ED   I TRAVELLED
WITH 2 FRIENDS                                                      I
                                                  |(HE WAS IN THE LEPPINGS LN TERRACE)
EVERYONE WAS PUSHING LIKE MAD TO GET IN, IF THERE'S BEEN POLICE THERE MAKING PEOPLE FORM
QUEUES IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO BAD. WHEN WE GOT INTO THE GROUND THROUGH THE TURNSTILES,
IT WAS BAD PUSHING TO GET IN, AND I WAS BRUISED THE NEXT DAY. THERE WERE 2 5 - 3 0
POLICEMAN INSIDE THE TURNSTILES DOING NOTHING, WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER EMPLOYED AT THE
TURNSTILES.   THAT'S WHAT STARTED THE TROUBLE, IT'S THE ONLY GAME I'VE BEEN TO WHERE
THERE'S BEEN NO POLICE AT THE TURNSTILES.   I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THERE WERE BEER CANS
ALL DOWN THE ROAD TOWARDS THE GROUND.   I THINK THE POLICE SHOULD BREATHALYSE PEOPLE
BEFORE THEY'RE ALLOWED IN AND ARREST THEM IF THEY'RE DRUNK, AS THEY GET VIOLENT.

Necessary to have statements from as many as possible o f the officers

deployed including all senior officers. For all officers it will be

helpful to have statements indicating WHEN they came on duty, to WHOM

Resume o f points covered in telephone conversation between Miss

 1.    Albeit, SYP have asked for copies o f statements taken

from SYP officers by West Mids. team, we should get

self-taken statements from RELEVANT officers.

Relevant = officers in Leppings Lane are and all

senior officers on duty. May be 50-100 officers.

2.     No statements required from lay individuals about the

events o f 15.4.89. But, stats are required from

officers who can provide history o f Hillsborough

and the policing o f matches there.

Suggest C.S. Duckenfield, Supts. Marshall and Murray

and C/I Beal may be best placed. The latter 3 are

in best position to review history.

PLUS Mr. M ole can provide useful information on

history and ticket allocation etc.

Self-taken statements can and should be obtained

from these officers. Should relate to F.A. semi

last year and another previous F.A. semi and one

or two league games. Statements should also set

out their function at these games, thereby providing

a general and specific guide to policing and senior

officer involvement in football matches at

Hillsborough.

3.     All relevant documentation - ie operational orders etc

etc should be collated and 'flagged' re. most

important regulations and sections to be considered

by counsel. Also require to know, at this stage,

whether there are any regulations not actually

complied with on the day.

4.     Counsel cannot, technically, see the individual

senior officers until they make formal request.

Solicitor will see them in first instance on

Wednesday 26.4.89.

GRAHAM MCKAY

DETECTIVE SUPERINTENDENT

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE, ECCLESFIELD POLICE STATION




In April 1988, as Detective Superintendent at 'F' Division, I

attended a football match being played at the home ground o f Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club, Hillsborough. The game was a Cup Semi-Final

and was played between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC. There

was a capacity crowd and admission was by ticket only.

M y remit on that day was to organise and supervise all elements o f

crime prevention and crime detection.

At about 2.40pm that day I found m yself outside the ground in the

Leppings Lane turnstile area. The crowd using those turnstiles were

mostly good natured but, about 2.50pm, there was a build up in the

numbers o f people using the turnstiles and a sizeable queue

developed. There was increasing evidence o f drunkenness amongst the

supporters who were all Liverpool fans. There was a good deal of

pushing and shoving and police officers on horses were necessary to

control the crowd. An ideal opportunity for pick-pocket activity.

It took this build-up o f supporters several minutes to clear through

the turnstiles but without problem.

On Friday 14 April 1989 I took part in a 'phone in programme with

Radio Merseyside, when I spoke with the presenter o f that programme

in relation to the Semi-Final to take place on the following day and

passed on various pieces o f advice for fans who were travelling to

Sheffield. One o f the areas which I stressed was that it was an all­

ticket match and that fans who did not have a ticket should not come.

At 3.00pm that same afternoon I gave similar advice, by telephone,

which was recorded by a member o f staff at Radio Nottingham.

On Saturday 15 April 1989 I was responsible for all matters in

relation to crime at the Cup Tie Semi-Final between Liverpool FC and

Nottingham Forest FC. As it was a carbon copy o f the match which had

been played before it made sense to use what had previously been

successful arrangements as the bulk o f the supporters would have

attended the previous match and would be aware o f the locations o f

the various facilities and the various systems operating at the ground.

On the day my staff were split into two teams. A team o f 12

officers, under the command o f Detective Inspector Towell, who were

to operate in and around the ground. Eight o f those officers were to

be engaged on observations, looking out for pick-pockets.

Outside the ground Detective Inspector Scaife had charge o f a team o f

14 officers who were to be responsible for the prevention and

detection o f street crime. Two o f these officers were in plain

clothes on non-descript motor cycles and it had been envisaged that,

whilst the game was in progress, these officers would patrol the

quiet streets lined with parked cars in an effort to prevent and

detect theft from cars.

I attended the briefing at Sheffield Wednesday FC at 10.00am and

following this briefed my own detectives. I was accompanied through

the first part o f the day by Police Constable 2439 Bocking, who was

in civilian clothes.

At 10.50am, together with PC Bocking, I went to a mobile police radio

control, who were monitoring all CID transmissions on channel 19.

This caravan was placed on land at the side o f Hillfoot bridge and

only a few yards from the frontage o f a public house called 'The Owl',

Even at that stage supporters were queuing outside, waiting for the

Owl to be opened, and at 11.00am the bars opened.

I remained in and around that location for some 40 minutes and during

that period, trade at the public house increased as football fans

gathered there.

The location o f this public house would lead me to believe that the

majority, if not all, o f these fans were Nottingham Forest

supporters. I had nothing to do with them and cannot say for certain.

I patrolled in m y own vehicle with PC Bocking and at about 1.00pm had

a meeting with Detective Inspector Scaife and some o f his staff in

the parking area for W adsley Bridge Section Station. This lasted a

few minutes and after the departure o f Detective Inspector Scaife and

his staff I was joined by the two motor cyclists and I gave them

further instructions.

At about 1,30pm I went to the South Yorkshire Police Sports and

Social Club at Niagara as traffic was building up and it was my

intention to leave my car in the car park there and spend the time

between then and the start o f the match, on foot. Whilst at that

location I went into the Club with PC Bocking and sought out the

Deputy Head o f M erseyside CID, a Detective Superintendent Baxter - a

man who I knew would be lunching at the Club with some o f his family

and for whom I had arranged nearby parking. I had not met Mr. Baxter

before and, having introduced m yself as a matter o f courtesy, PC

Bocking and I left the Club.

Whilst I was in the Club I noticed that there was a large number o f

supporters o f both football clubs who, I assumed, were all police

officers. It was apparent that most were dining or waiting for meals

they had ordered or having a casual drink.

About 1.50pm PC Bocking and I went to the gymnasium at Sheffield

Wednesday FC where we had a meal and, at about 2.15pm, we left and I

decided to spend the remaining time until kick-off outside the ground

in the vicinity o f the Leppings Lane turnstiles, as I considered this

to be the most likely place for pick-pocket activity.

With PC Bocking I walked out onto the perimeter track surrounding the

ground and walked across the front o f the Spion Kop, where the

Nottingham Forest supporters were gathered. There was still plenty

o f room in the Spion Kop but, nevertheless, there was a large number

o f spectators present and there were very few barren places.

In contrast, looking over to Leppings Lane end o f the ground there

appeared to be very few spectators in evidence in the terraces or the

stand at the back o f the goal. Equally, the seating in the North

Stand was sparsely occupied. I went down the players tunnel and

through on to the service road and car parking area at the rear o f

the South Stand. We made our way through a sterile area up to a

light portable barrier which was near to a pair o f metal concertina

type gates, marked 'C' at the Leppings Lane turnstiles area.

This turnstile serves the North Stand and the West Stand and terraced

areas behind the goal. There are three lots o f turnstiles and it

immediately became apparent that the seven turnstiles, serving the

terraced area and between the concertina type gates marked 'B' and

the ones previously referred to marked 'C', were in heavy demand.

A large crowd was backed up right out on to Leppings Lane and there

was angry pushing and shoving taking place. There were several

police officers in evidence and in particular two mounted officers

who I believe were from Merseyside. The officer in charge o f a

serial o f men was Inspector Purdy, a man I have known for a number o f

years and recognised immediately. Inspector Purdy and his serial

were having a great deal o f difficulty in controlling the crowd at

this point. The turnstiles A-G were arranged on the left by the

gates marked 'B' set into a high wall and on the right by a metal

barrier some 20 yards long and at chest height, the crowd was

contained behind this barrier.

It was apparent that the turnstiles were not coping efficiently with

the crowd, which was swelling by the minute.

Throughout the next 30 minutes or so I remained mostly at that

location but, on two occasions, walked back through the sterile area

to where a serial was employed at another barrier at the Nottingham

Forest turnstiles into the South Stand. They were having no

difficulty with the people in that area and I spoke to a man I know

as Sergeant Hodgett and told him that I anticipated that, as the

crowd increased at the Leppings Lane turnstiles, more police officers

would be required and I asked him to post an officer from his serial

nearer to the turnstiles at Leppings Lane and in view o f the

turnstiles in order that he could respond should the occasion demand.

At Leppings Lane the build-up o f crowd increased, tempers became

frayed and evidence o f drunkenness became more and more pronounced.

I remember at one time, Inspector Purdy standing on the barrier with

his back to the turnstiles, while in the manner o f a tight-rope

walker, vainly trying to address the crowd. He was beginning to look

frightened and, frankly, I was not surprised.

A young boy o f some 10 or 12 years climbed to the top o f the wall

near to gate 'B' but apparently what he saw on the other side

deterred him from dropping over and he returned to the crowd on this

side. I was dismayed to realise that in this swelling mass o f people

there were such young children. There were many people standing

about not attempting to join the queue, (if it can be described as




1401020199Q25     hehlmOlc                        KG931            Printed on:   23 March, 2000   10:57   Page   6   of   20

such) and I wondered at that time whether they had arranged to meet

friends; whether they were waiting for the rush to die down or

whether, in fact, they were opportunists without tickets. The gates

marked 'C' were opened and closed on a number o f occasions by

stewards on the other side, either to allow officials and police

officers to enter or leave the ground, or to admit people who were in

distress. I remember on at least three occasions these gates were

opened at the request o f police officers outside to admit people with

injuries. One o f these was a child who was carried bodily in and who

had been removed from the crush at the turnstiles.

At some stage, I would guess at about 2.40pni, I saw Superintendent

Marshall directing police operations in this crush. He was having to

shout to make him self heard on the radio and I heard a shouted

request from Inspector Purdy for the gates to be opened to relieve

the pressure on the turnstiles. Even at that stage I could

understand the reason for this request. I did not see Superintendent

Marshall again. I was later to learn, in fact, that he remained

there continuing to direct operations in the area o f the Leppings

Lane turnstiles but such was the thronging mass o f people that I did

not see him even though he must have been a matter o f yards from me.

Not long afterwards I spoke to Inspector Purdy and said I thought the

gates should be opened.

At some stage it was decided that some large wrought iron gates which

lead out into Leppings Lane should be closed in order to prevent the

now seething mass o f people in Leppings Lane from continuing to apply

pressure to the queue to the turnstiles. This was done successfully

but it seemed to be only minutes before the gates were forced open

again and the pressure resumed. At one stage, still pre-occupied

with the pick-pockets, I moved nearer to these blue gates but

immediately became engulfed in the crowd and I had to push and




1401020199Q25     hehlmOlc                       KG931             Printed on:   23 March, 2000   10:57   Page   7   of   20

struggle to get back into a relatively clear space near to the light

portable barriers.

During these few brief moments I was frightened for my own safety and

it made me realise what conditions must have been like in the more

severely packed area behind the barrier leading to the turnstiles. I

was getting quite concerned and remember remarking to PC Bocking that

they were going to have to open the gates.

PC Bocking was carrying my radio at this time which was tuned to the

channel designated to CID, number 19. Uniformed officers were being

directed from control on channel 25.

Conditions deteriorated, missiles were thrown, a beer can with a drink

spilling from it striking a police officer on horseback. There was

another surge from the crowd which appeared to be a concerted attempt

to unseat this same officer and the horse started dancing about in

fright. Throughout I could hear demands over a loud speaker system

pleading with the crowd to stop pushing, to be patient. I could

recognise the speaker as PC 1035 Ryan.

As it got nearer to 3o'clock it became apparent to everyone that it

was impossible for this vast crowd, which now stretched out o f my

sight in both directions o f Leppings Lane, to gain access to the

ground before kick-off and I heard some uniformed officer remark that

kick-off had been delayed for 15 minutes.

The crowd became more and more unruly and nasty and I could hear

officers, who were caught in the press, yelling frantically into

their personal radios.

I began to have grave fears that the situation could only end in

disaster. The crowd were beginning to swarm over the walls into the

ground. People in the crowd were shouting and screaming for

assistance and yet the thrust from Leppings Lane continued.

At various times during this period the mounted police officers had




1401020199Q25        hehlmOlc                     KG931             Printed   on:   23 March, 2000   10:57   Page   8   of   20

been supplemented by a number o f others and I would estimate there

being in the region o f 8 to 10 mounted officers in that small area.

They were, for the most part, engulfed in the crowd and unable to

contain it.

A few minutes before 3 o'clock, perhaps three or four, I heard the

message given over a uniformed officer's radio "Open the gate" and

almost immediately the concertina doors o f gate 'C' were opened. I

was standing only a few yards from the gate. I should say at this

point that these gates had never been under severe pressure as the

crowd had recognised that there was no probability o f entering

through that gate. The people in the immediate vicinity o f the gate

began to go through it and it seemed to take the bulk o f the crowd 30

seconds or so to realise what had occurred.

The trickle o f people going into the ground through this gate

increased and for a short period there was containable entry through

the gate. It was a relief to me to see the gate opened and, at this

point, I remarked to PC Bocking "That gate should have been opened

ten minutes ago".

Over the next two or three minutes the flow through this gate

increased and it was apparent to me that the situation at the

turnstiles would soon be eased. It was about this time that I heard

a roar from the crowd inside the ground and assumed that either the

players were out or that the match had commenced. This surprised me,

having thought that the game was going to be delayed. This roar

increased the urgency o f the people entering the ground. I turned to

walk back with PC Bocking down the service road and made my way to

the south east comer o f the ground, where I walked onto the

perimeter track o f the pitch, behind the Spion Kop goal.

The game was in progress and as I looked up towards the Leppings Lane

end I could see the crowd spilling out from the terraces onto the




1401020199Q25     hehlmOlc                        KG931          Printed on:   23 March, 2000   10:57   Page   9   of   20

pitch. I could not understand this but, as there were large numbers

o f uniformed officers making their way along the perimeter path in

front o f the North Stand towards that area, I assumed that the matter

would be contained and I left the pitch at the north east comer.

I walked back to the gymnasium which was being used as a dining room,

where I spoke to Detective Inspector To well, and a few minutes later

someone called to me that play had been stopped and that there were

injuries.

Uniformed officers were hurrying out o f the gymnasium and I returned

to the north east comer o f the pitch to see what was happening.

The scene was one o f confusion at the Leppings Lane end with some

people climbing from the terraces into the seated stand above and

people continuing to spill out onto the pitch through gates in the

fencing which were now open. It appeared to be an invasion o f the

pitch which should be contained by uniform officers but, after a

minute or so, I decided to walk over. I had gone only about 40 yards

when I met Detective Sergeant 727 Lindley coming the other way and he

called to me "There's about 20 dead in there boss".

I went immediately to the Police Room under the North Stand, from

where I contacted Detective C hief Superintendent Addis by telephone.

I would estimate the time to be somewhere in the region o f 3 .15pm. I

informed Mr. Addis that I believed there were deaths and we discussed

that we would need to be thinking in terms o f setting up an Incident

Room and activating a Casualty Bureau.

I have to say that from that time I have no clear recollection o f the

sequence o f events or o f any time scale. I returned to the gymnasium

and my return coincided with that o f Chief Inspector Beal who shouted

"We are going to set up a temporary mortuary in here, clear these

tables."

One half o f the gymnasium had been set up as a dining area and there




1401020199Q25     hehlmOlc                        KG931           Printed on:   23 March, 2000   10:57   Page   10   of   20

was a temporary partition down the centre o f the gymnasium. It was

this area that was cleared and there was a rush by police officers to

put tables to one side. I believe that Detective Inspector Towell

was in the gymnasium at that time and I am certain that I was the

senior officer present.

People started arriving into the gymnasium carrying victims. The

first victim to arrive was a young man and I believe he was carried

in by two police officers and a civilian. He was taken to the wall

opposite the door and laid down. Other people were now flooding into

the gymnasium carrying victims. The first man was apparently dead

and I touched one o f the officers, introduced myself, and explained

to him that that body was his responsibility and that under no

circumstances was he to leave that body. He was to ensure that no

one else had any dealings with the property or clothing or

identification o f that body. These were instructions that I was to

repeat dozens o f times on that afternoon.

Brought in with the dead were the injured and these were directed to

the far end o f the gymnasium at the other side o f the partition. The

dead were arriving in such numbers that it was impossible to try to

establish whether, in fact, they were dead, but I have to say that

every body that I saw bore what I recognise to be classic signs o f

asphyxia and I am satisfied that every body that I saw and directed

into the area designated as a temporary mortuary was, in fact, dead.

Although I saw most o f the bodies I have to say that I did not see

them all. Indeed they were arriving in such numbers and with such

frequency that on many occasions it was impossible to give

instructions before the officers who had brought the body in had

departed.

Some o f the bodies were carried in by members o f the crowd. Some o f

these people were distressed, weeping openly, screaming, aggressive




1401020199Q25     hehlmOlc                        KG931          Printed on:   23 March, 2000   10:57   Page   11   of   20

and I saw several fights and scuffles break out in the area around,

between and over the bodies that were being deposited.

Some drunks were assisting to bring the dead and injured persons into

the gymnasium and it has to be said that they were not all causing

trouble. Officers and civilians were attempting to resuscitate some

o f the victims and I saw at least two such groups attempting to

revive, what were quite obviously to me, dead bodies.

O f the people arriving in the gymnasium many were standing around,

rem aining there. Police officers were going back out to fetch more

casualties and the scene was one o f general confusion with bodies

being put down haphazardly.

At some stage I saw Detective Inspector Charles, apparently having

come into the gym with a body, about to leave the gymnasium. Mr.

Charles had attended the match on duty in full police uniform. I

shouted to Mr. Charles and when he came to me I told him that this

public order situation in the gymnasium had to be controlled and told

him to get some men and get on with it. He immediately started

gathering police officers to him and giving them instructions and I

noted that he gave priority to the gymnasium floor. It was

impossible to count the bodies as they arrive, but when there were

about 2 0 1 remember thinking that there could not be many more dead.

As the bodies were laid nearer and nearer to the gymnasium door

someone, I believe it was Detective Sergeant M cSloy, said to me "If

we don't start laying the bodies out neatly we will never get them

all in". I told him to grab some men and get on with it.

Two officers in uniform from the Underwater Search Unit came to me at

some time. They were carrying a hand-held video unit. They told me

that they had been recording the scene in and around the area o f the

Leppings Lane goalmouth but that they had been assaulted on two

occasions by football supporters and they had had to retreat for

their safety. I recognised need for evidence gathering and told them

to start filming the scene in the gym. I do not remember seeing them

again.

I find it very difficult to recall the events in the gymnasium. My

overall perception is one o f dead bodies arriving and being carried

by shocked and perspiring police officers; by distressed people who

were obviously friends and relatives and by drunken people, some o f

whom were shouting and wanting to fight. Injured people were

arriving and being directed to the far end o f the hall and the scene

was one o f increasing confusion.

Some degree o f regulation began to take place as Inspector Charles

and his team regulated the people in the gym and ejected the unruly

ones, it would have been folly to try and separate the grieving

relatives and friends from the bodies and many, many people were left

standing around in the gymnasium helplessly, in all stages o f distress.

On several occasions I went through to the Police Room to make use o f

the telephone which was in there, but the Police Room was busy, the

telephone was in use and when I bullied my way to the telephone the

numbers I tried to get were engaged or unobtainable.

At some stage I recall having seen a police officer sat on a chair by

the telephone in the Police Room. He had a big tear in his

trousers. He was weeping openly. He was quite obviously shocked. I

had a few words with him which seemed to me to be totally inadequate

and left him.

At a very early stage I had deputed someone to arrange for the major

incident boxes to come from Hammerton Road and Ecclesfield and I asked

Detective Inspector Scaife, at some stage, to contact the Medico

Legal Centre, assess their available capacity for bodies and to ring

round the various hospitals and mortuaries in the district with a

view to establishing the available capacities for dead bodies.

I had also asked for the Coroner to be informed - which seemed at the

time to be an absolutely incongruous request.

At some stage, I think after half an hour, I needed to make contact

with the control box inside the ground to inform them o f the

situation in the gymnasium and as I was unable to contact them by

telephone and I knew that any radio message passed would be relayed

over every officer's radio in the ground, I went on foot. I am now

informed by Detective Inspector Towell that he accompanied me, but my

recollection o f events is so blurred and distorted that I cannot

remember him doing so, although I have no reason to doubt that he did.

At the Police Control Box I spoke to Mr. Addis and, whilst I cannot

remember what I said to him, I must have told him the situation in

the gymnasium. I do remember speaking to the ACC Operations, Mr.

Jackson, and mentioning that amongst other problems we would have

were the press, who were present in numbers. Mr. Addis asked me to

take him back to the gymnasium and as we left the area o f the Police

Box I remember hearing the Liverpool Manager, Kenny Dalglish,
                                                                     4



addressing the crowd and a ripple o f applause went round the ground.

Other than that I have no idea o f what time it was.

On my return to the gymnasium with Mr. Addis I saw senior ambulance

officials, in particular Alan Hopkins who I introduced to Mr. Addis

and we discussed the eventual removal o f bodies from the gymnasium

and who would be responsible.

Mr. Addis then took charge in the gymnasium and after a few minutes

o f assessing the situation he stood on a chair, called for order in

the hall, and told police officers what he intended to do. The

gymnasium floor was littered with rows o f bodies and I remember

someone telling me when I asked how many "Seventy odd and more at the

Northern General".

Most o f the bodies by this time had been draped with what appeared to




1401020199Q25     hehlmOlc                         KG931            Printed on:   23 March, 2000   10:57   Page   14   of   20

be white shrouds and I remember wondering where on earth they had

come from. I was later to learn that they were, in fact, the paper

tablecloths which had been removed from the wooden tressle tables,

now piled up at the side o f the gymnasium.

It was about this time that I remembered that my youngest son was

somewhere in the crowd and almost all o f the bodies, the feet o f

which were protruding from under these tablecloths, seemed to have

trainers on identical to his. I had to resist the urge to go and

look at each o f the bodies.

It was decided that I should return to Hammerton Road, assist in

setting up a Major Incident Room there and also arrange for the

friends and relatives to be bussed to Hammerton Road Police Station.

I arranged to be taken to Hammerton Road by a marked police car and

Detective Inspector Towell travelled in what I believe was the prison

bus, with anxious relatives and friends.

On arrival at Hammerton Road I found the place under virtual siege.

Liverpool supporters were wanting to make urgent enquiries, many were

standing around not knowing what to do and someone had put out a call

for all off-duty social workers to report to Hammerton Road and there

were many social workers. M y first reaction was one o f dismay at the

thought o f so many social workers being directed to this area but, in

a very short time, it became apparent that they were to be invaluable

and provided a buffer between distressed relatives and fans, who had

lost contact with relatives and friends in the crowd, and the police.

I called together the Incident Room staff, who had arrived at the

Station to set up the Incident room, and briefed them as to what had

occurred at the ground and the situation there. I should say here

that I was aware that arrangements had been made for the Casualty

Bureau to be activated. I was shortly to be informed however that

all numbers to the Casualty Bureau had already gone out over the




1401020199Q25     hehlmOlc                         KG931           Printed on:   23 March, 2000   10:57   Page   15   of   20

radio, jamming all o f the lines, and as a result there was to be no

police contact by telephone with the Bureau for many hours.

Having told the Incident Room staff what had occurred they went about

the business o f setting up the Incident Room at Hammerton Road.

I tried to make a telephone call to my home but could not get an

outside line. I later went to an adjacent building where I knew

there was a direct outside line. I telephoned home and established

that my son was safe. I think the time was then about 6.30pm but all

I can say for certain is that it was still daylight.

I was surprised to see Superintendent Sleath at Hammerton Road Police

Station in civilian clothes and he told me that he had responded to a

call for all off-duty police officers to go either to Hillsborough or

the closest police station. Mr. Sleath had assumed responsibility

for relatives; liaison with Social Services and with the temporary

mortuary.

During the course o f the evening there were three other events

unconnected with this incident, which required my attention. One was

a potential firearms situation in 'F1' Sub-Division; another was a

potential firearms situation in 'F2' Sub-Division and the third

involved the body o f an old lady which had been found in a fire at

her home under suspicious circumstances. I asked Detective Chief

Inspector Addison to go to Ecclesfield Police Station and deal with

the body and deputed Detective Inspector Scaife to deal with the

firearms incident there.

I needed to speak to Detective Chief Inspector Addis on many

occasions during the evening but contact with him was only possible

by contacting people with him on channel 25 o f the police radio and

then requesting him to return to channel 19, in the hope that our

conversation would be more secure.

At some time during the evening, but not long after Mr. Addison had




1401020199Q25      hehlmOlc                            KG931      Printed on:   23 March, 2000   10:57   Page   16   of   20

left for Ecclesfield, I returned to the gymnasium for a conference

with Mr. Addis and found that the Coroner, Mr. Potter, and the Home

Office Pathologist, Professor Usher, were in attendance. Professor

usher said that there was little he could do at the scene and agreed

to go over to Ecclesfield to look at the scene and the body there. I

arranged transport for him.

The scene at the gymnasium was now much more orderly. The bodies had

all been certified dead. There were a number o f doctors in

attendance; there were social workers; many grieving relatives and

many many police officers, all o f whom looked shocked, drawn and tired.

I believe that it was at this stage I saw a man I recognised as Dr.

Duckworth, Psychologist, who lectures at police establishments on

trauma connected with major incidents and, in particular, in his

involvement with police officers following the Bradford fire.

Mr. Addis discussed with me his plans to photograph, with a polaroid

camera, each o f the bodies; to display these on a wall at a different

part o f the gymnasium and to have relatives brought, one lot at a

time, to the gymnasium to be shown the photographs and, if a

photograph was picked out, to have the body relating to that

photograph removed from the hall into a temporary viewing room and

identified.

We also discussed at that time our priorities and decided that no

police enquiry could commence that night and it was imperative that

all police efforts should be directed towards the situation at the

gymnasium; identification o f the bodies and providing what

assistance was possible to the relatives.

I returned to Hammerton Road Police Station and closed down the

Incident Room, which had already commenced feeding the basic

Order o f the football match.

During the evening the relatives had been removed first to

Hillsborough Boys Club premises across the road from Hammerton Road

Police Station, and then to the Church Hall on Forbes Road.

The only information I can definitely set a time for is 9.00pm when I

had a conversation by telephone with the Deputy C hief Constable,

Mr. Hayes, to update him o f the operation.

He requested that a conference be set up o f all senior officers

involved with a view to being able to supply the Chief Constable with

a factual account o f events in order that he could be properly

prepared to meet the inevitable barrage for information from the press.

Mr. Hayes asked me to arrange for all senior officers concerned to be

at the Conference Room at Headquarters for 11.00pm. I remember

looking at m y watch at that stage to assess how much time I had.

I had at least two other conversations, during the evening, with ACC

Mr. Jackson to update him, but I cannot remember the content o f the

conversation.

I returned to the gymnasium at Hillsborough, spoke to Mr. Addis and

told him o f the conference.

I decided that I ought then to have a look at the stand and terraces

where the disaster had occurred, (even though it was in darkness) in

order that I could be properly informed for the conference which was

to follow. Although the light was not good it was light enough to

give me some indication o f the devastation which had occurred. I was

accompanied by Detective Inspector Towell.

We went from there through the tunnel and round to the turnstile area

and on our way back to the gymnasium saw the Chief Constable with a

group o f people at the scene.

I informed the C hief Constable o f the meeting being set up at

11.00pm. I returned to the gymnasium. I had a further conversation

with Mr. Addis and the C hief Constable then visited the gymnasium. He

was obviously looking at the scene carefully and was speaking to as

many officers as he possibly could, offering words o f encouragement.

I believe shortly after this I returned with Chief Superintendent

Addis who had not had the opportunity to visit the area o f the

disaster and together we went from there into the service road at the

back o f the South Stand where we discussed the prospect o f

approaching the many television crews now in attendance with a view

to obtaining video recordings taken by them. Mr. Addis decided

against it.

After I had returned to the gymnasium I went to Hammerton Road Police

Station with D etective Inspector Towell. I made arrangements for

video recordings to be available at the Conference Room at Police

Headquarters. I travelled to Headquarters with Detective Inspector

Towell only to find that the conference had been cancelled for that

night and was re-arranged for 9.00am the following morning. I

returned to Hammerton Road Police Station and went o ff duty at around

2.15am.

On arrival home at about 2.30am I discovered that my youngest boy had

picked up two distressed Liverpool fans, one o f whom had been parted

from his brother, and these two young men were sleeping at m y home.

I returned to work for 7.30am the following day and during the days

that followed I was in charge o f the Incident Room at Hammerton Road

Police Station.

At 12.30pm on Tuesday 18 April 1989, as a result o f a conversation I

had with Inspector Sykes, I returned to Sheffield Wednesday Football

Club and examined the blue wrought iron perimeter gates which I have

previously mentioned. These gates had by this time been turned into

a shrine and flowers were piled up against them and scarves tied to

them. I saw that one o f the bolts, which secured a gate by dropping

into a hole in the asphalt, was bent and that another such bolt on a

different gate had gouged out a groove in the asphalt some 18" to 2'

long, and that this damage was quite obviously recently caused. I

returned to Hammerton Road Police Station and made arrangements for

the gates to be photographed.

At 2.30pm that same day, at a conference between Mr. Jones, Assistant

Chief Constable o f West Midlands Police, C hief Superintendent

Bevington o f that Force, Detective C hief Superintendent Addis and

m yself, Mr. Jones formally assumed responsibility for the enquiry

into the disaster and an entry to that effect was made on the

H.O.L.M.E.S. Management Policy File.

Kevin Laurence RICH Police Constable 1685




On Saturday 15 April 1 9 89 ,1 commenced duty at 9am at W ombwell Police

Station. Together with other officers I travelled to the

Hillsborough Football Ground in respect o f the Nottingham Forest v

Liverpool football match.

I was to join part o f serial 15 which was commanded by Police

Sergeant 1757 Bums.

On arrival at the ground I attended a general briefing, in the North

Stand, from the various Commanders. On completion o f the briefing I

went with the serial, and also serial 14, Police Sergeant Crawford's

serial, to the Leppings Lane Terraces. There we had a specific

briefing from the Section Inspector, Mr White.

Whilst standing on the terracing Mr White pointed out the layout o f the

terracing. He made reference to the fact that for normal matches the

access gates between the enclosures north/centre north and centre

south/south were kept locked and were manned by Police Officers.

However, in anticipation o f difficulties with this game then the

gates were locked in the OPEN position.

Mr White briefed the serial and instructed that we should be

positioned inside the ground, alongside turnstiles 9-16. The duties




1401020199Q25     hehlmOlc                       KG931          Printed on:   23 March, 2000         10:59   Page   2   of   7

were to supervise entry, search people for alcohol and other

contraband (flags etc). On completion o f entry the serial were then

to enter the Leppings Lane terrace at the rear, and supervise crowd

behaviour. On completion o f the game we went to assist in the

clearing o f the ground. Mr White in closing said that in an ideal

situation he would have used our two serials in the terracing to help

locate and distribute the crowds within the enclosures.

The serial took up position in front o f the Gate 'B' and Tumstyles

9-16 at around 1 lam . The tumstyles at this stage were not open and

the time was used to familiarise ourselves with the club officials,

and other facilities that were present in the area, snack bars,

programme sellers etc.

The turnstiles opened at about noon and from this time onward there

was a steady trickle o f fans entering the ground. The great majority

at this time had already been searched prior to entry into the

ground. However, there was no animosity and the second search

afforded a certain amount o f rapport with the fans. It was noticeable

that all the people entering the ground at this time were honest,

decent people, well dressed and w ell behaved. One or two came

through with cans o f 'pop' but they quickly dispersed o f this in a

proper manner when challenged. On two occasions I took possession o f

items that I considered unsuitable for use in the terracing, one a

pair o f sticks from a banner, and the second a stone bottle, but once

again the fans accepted my decision in good part, and agreed to

collect their property after the game.

From the opening o f the tumstyles at 12 noon until sometime after

2pm the entry flow to the ground gradually increased, without

problem, like any other football match.

Sometime during this time the turnstiles 9 and 10 were barriered off

to the Leppings Lane end and used for the entry to the North Stand.




1401020199Q25     hehlmOlc                        KG931           Printed on:   23 March, 2000   10:59   Page   3   of   7

This reduced, by two, the number o f turnstiles available.

As the time progressed I became gradually aware o f a build-up o f

supporters outside the ground. Though my view o f the proceedings was

limited to what I could see through the turnstile. As the crowds

built up I became conscious o f people having difficulty in entering

through the turnstile. The crush outside was such that the

turnstiles, on occasions, were unable to function properly, and

people were being injured in the turnstile passage. More than one

man emerged from the tumstyle bent double and I saw one man

physically sick.

From these people entering the ground I began to understand that

there were difficulties outside the ground, and it was about this

time that I became aware o f people banging, shouting outside and many

appeared to be kicking and banging on the concertina gates. Given

all this information I formed the opinion that there were great

masses o f people outside, although I was not aware o f any specific

difficulty.

It was about this time that a youth appeared on top o f the wall above

the turnstiles. He was told to get down, but he was shouting that

people were in difficulties outside the gates. He attempted to gain

entry to the ground, but I took hold o f him and ejected him through

Gate 'C'. I did not use Gate B because I was aware o f a vast number

o f people outside. On my return to position I saw that the roof and

surrounding wall were literally covered with supporters who had

climbed into the ground. Some were endeavouring to enter the ground,

and some were complaining o f the crush outside, and others were

brandishing valid entry tickets. It was about this time that we were

joined by an Inspector and other officers. I do not know his name,

he was not our section Inspector. He climbed on to the roof o f the

turnstile, and beckoned other officers to do so, but none did. This




1401020199Q25      hehlmOlc                      KG931            Printed on:   23 March, 2000   10:59   Page   4   of   7

Inspector began helping people into the ground, and at one stage the

turnstile roof was literally covered with spectators. At this stage

I received an instruction from whom I know not, that provided these

spectators had tickets then we should admit them. The persons on the

roof then began to enter the ground. The majority o f people had

tickets but many did not. The persons who had gained access then

began to pass the unchecked tickets back over the roof and over the

wall.

At one stage one person who was attempting to gain access came into

my grasp, he began saying "I've got a ticket, I've got a ticket", he

also showed me a M erseyside Police Warrant Card, the name on it, I

believe                or similar. I made comment to him about having more

sense, and he became quite angry complaining about the things that

were going on outside, and the lack o f professionalism on the part o f

South Yorshire Police. As he passed into the ground I made comment

to Police Sergeant Bum s that he was a Police Officer.

I became aware o f a general upsurge in activity both inside and

outside the gound, and that people were still climbing in and passing

unused tickets backwards. The banging on the metal gate increased,

when I saw one o f the club stewards on the gate go to the opening

mechanism, I looked at him and he said "I'm opening this gate, I'll

take responsibility" and proceeded to open the concertina gate. I

did not see who assisted in the opening. As the crowds entered the

ground I had to take refuge alongside Turnstile 16. Several hundred

people entered the ground, and I was amazed that the rush stopped and

there was only a few people outside. As the gates were being closed

I looked outside and saw that the Mounted Section were holding a

large crowd back in Leppings Lane.

A large number o f those admitted through Gate 'B' were hanging around

the turnstile area. I saw people attempting to throw unused tickets




1401020199Q25     hehlmOlc                        KG931          Printedon:   23M arch,2000   10:59   Page   5   of   7

over the gates, pass them under the gates or through the gap in

between the gates.

It became obvious to me at this stage that we had lost control o f the

ticket situation, and this seemed to be reflected by the turnstile

operators who seemed to be allowing anybody in, with or without

tickets. I had no idea o f the time but some time after the gates had

been opened, several minutes, I heard a cheer within the ground, and

I assumed this to be the kick-off. I continued to watch people enter

through the turnstiles when I saw the gate open again and a number o f

Police Officers rushed into the ground, saying that there was trouble

on the terracing.

A few moments later Police Sergeant Bums ordered us as a serial to

enter the terraced area at the Leppings Lane end. I entered through

the centre tunnel under the West Stand. As I passed down the tunnel

I was met by various groups o f people rushing up the tunnel carrying

injured persons to the rear o f the stand. Some o f the spectators

were very angry and began screaming at Police Officers saying there's

people dead down there is it's your fault. A s I was making my way

forward to assist in the rescue and removal o f the injured, I was

confronted by angry fans waving tickets, and saying "We've never been

checked, these tickets are unused, you've let too many in here,

you're responsible". I assisted to the best o f my ability in the

removing o f some dead and numerous slightly injured persons to the

rear o f the main stand. I then went through the crowd and on to the

pitch in order to find other members o f my serial.

Whilst making my way through the crowd I was confronted by a range o f

emotions from "Your responsible - it's all your fault" to "It's not

your fault personally". Many spectators remained in position and

were asking "What time w ill the kick-off be".

Whilst at the entrance to the tunnel I saw fans in the West Stand




1401020199Q25       hehlmOlc                       KG931            Printed on:   23 March, 2000   10:59   Page   6   of   7

begin to rip hoardings from above the terraced area. The fans on the

terrace below complained that they were being showered with debri,

but I heard someone say "Tell the press we're not all hooligans,

these are for stretchers".

From this point I coaxed people to leave the ground, but many were

refusing to leave without refunds for unused tickets.

I later reformed with my serial, and attended a debrief in the North

Stand. It was at this point I made my point to a Senior Officer that

Gate B had been opened, apparently without Police instruction. I

then accompanied Inspector White and Calvert to the area o f the

turnstiles.

Whilst walking through the North Stand I was sickened by the number

o f empty beer cans and spirit bottles that had been apparently

smuggled into the ground.

In the period that I was engaged on searching persons I found no

alcohol at all but as the time approached 3pm then cans and bottles

began to appear on the floor o f the turnstile. When I returned to

the scene later I was confronted with quite a quantity o f empty and

part empty cans in and around the turnstile.

Prior to attending the debrief we were standing as a serial alongside

the turnstile when I saw a small group o f people, very upset walking

towards the exit. A woman said "Get rid o f him, please, I'm

trying to find my husband". I saw a youngish person carrying a

notebook. I said to him "Who are you?" He said "I'm from the Star,

I'm only after a story". I told him to leave the woman alone as

she was obviously distressed. He went towards Police Sergeant

Bums, who also told him to go away.

BENJAMIN ARTHUR FIDLER

POLICE SERGEANT 102




On Saturday 15 April 1 9 8 9,1 commenced duty at 5.30 a.m. I was

working in connection with the semi-final between Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest. M y duties were the supervision o f civilian staff

regarding the placing o f cones, barriers and the preparation o f the

gymnasium for the issue o f radios and snack meals. In overall charge

was Inspector Bennett.




I worked with Police Constables 3018 Shelton, Police Constable 3082

Fletcher, Police Constable Martin Horn and Police Sergeant Sewell.

In practice 3018 Shelton and m yself worked this particular duty on

all large matches and we instructed the others in what to do.




The issue o f radios in the gym was to all supervisory ranks. At the

time o f the radio issue, meals tickets were given out to each

Inspector and to each serial Sergeant for his serial. He also had to

collect snack meals for his serial.




Police Constable Shelton and m yself issued radios to Serials 1-21 as




1401020199Q25     hehlmOlc                        KG931          Printed on:   23 March, 2000       11:02

they were to hand in the radios at the gymnasium on completion o f

duty and Police Constable 3082 Fletcher and Police Constable 538 Horn

issued radios to Serials 22-64 as they would be finishing at

Claywheels Lane. A number o f earpieces had been provided which were

to be issued to Senior Officers and to officers working in the ground

after the Senior Officers had received theirs. I did not have a

great deal to do with the issue o f the radios as I was issuing meal

tickets and snack meals. I did assist but I cannot be sure as to who

I issued radios to, or to be exact to whom I handed them to whilst

Police Constable 3018 recorded them. I know that all the ear pieces

were issued as we had one or two requests for them after we had

issued them all. A ll this took place up to about 10.30 to 10.45.

Things seemed to go very smoothly, one or two radios exchanged.




The gym was prepared for meals about 20 tables were set up. The

catering staff came and cooked meals. They started to serve hot

meals from about 1.00 p.m. and several people had them.




Police Sergeant Sewell was listening to radio traffic and said that

it sounded as if there was trouble at Leppings Lane. Before this

at about 2.00 p.m. C hief Inspector Beal returned his radio for a

change o f battery as he said the radio traffic sounded as if it was

underwater. W e changed the battery, but the sound was the same. I

saw a communications man called             rnd he listened and said that

there was a possible fault on the base transmitter. Chief Inspector

Beal took him out to go to Control.




Police Sergeant 467 Sewell then said that there was trouble at

Leppings Lane and I donned my full uniform and went out to see if I

could assist. As I approached the entrance to the playing area near

to the disabled section o f the ground I saw several officers run into

the ground. They asked me for instructions, I told them to go onto

the track and report to a track Inspector for deployment. I saw

Inspector W allace standing by with a serial o f men and I saw 6

Mounted Officers ride in and stand by at the entrance to the track.

At this time Inspector Sewell saw me and instructed me to return to

the gymnasium. When I returned several officers came in from bus

escort duties. They went in and sat waiting for thie meals. They

were mostly 'D' D ivisional officers.




Inspector Sewell came in and instructed the Sergeants to report to

the Admin desk and report how many men they had. Police Sergeant

Sewell listed them. Inspector Sewell informed control and we were

instructed to deploy all the men in the gymnasium onto the track.

This we did. A few minutes later C hief Inspector Beal came to me and

instructed me to prepare the gym to receive bodies. This we did by

moving the tables and chairs out o f the way.




Minutes later a policeman came in carrying the body o f a child

obviously dead. Inspector Bennett, m yself and Detective Constable

Dynes took the child and we eventually placed him at the back o f the

gym. As we put him down other bodies were arriving carried by Police

and by civilians. Police Constable Shelton and I started to number

the bodies and take down a description. We used sticky labels and

the property book. I searched the bodies in a cursory manner for

items o f identification.




Police Constable 3253 Campbell came into the gym and she started to

help in recording the details o f the dead. Detective Constables

Askew and Lilley came and they started to lay the bodies out in rows

o f 12. Police Sergeant 467 Sewell joined us and by this time the

body count was quite high so Police Sergeant Sewell took bodies 13-

24, the CID took details o f the next row and Police Constable Shelton

and m yself took the next row and so on.




Inspector Charles had arrived and took charge. Inspector Tingle was

also there. The first bodies I searched were in some cases soaked in

urine on the upper body which I found so unusual that I commented

that they must have been lying strangely. A Police Constable said

"No Sarge they were peeing on us as we were pulling them out". I took

him to mean other fans.




I worked in the gymnasium throughout the night and went o ff duty when

the last body was taken to the Medico-Legal Centre at 5.30 a.m.




Because the gymnasium had been taken over as a temporary mortuary, I

believe that the radios were handed in at the Police Room under the

North Stand.

Following the Hillsborough Disaster a Video and Photographic Section was

formed, as part of the Major Inquiry Team, to look at all aspects of

visual evidence available from various sources.




As such between 19 April 1989 and 9 May 1990 I was responsible, on a full

time basis, for the supervision of this particular team of officers.                                                   Our

primary function was the collation and examination of such material

initially for the Judicial Inquiry and latterly for the Coroner’s

Inquests.




Video recordings, both prior to the event, during and ultimately showing

the aftermath, were obtained from a number of agencies.                                       This material,

which varied both in content, quality of picture and evidential value, was

viewed by members of the T.eam, copied and scheduled.                                    Each film and

photograph was given a unique reference number.                                 The schedules prepared

were in themselves a precis of the events shown on film.

Continuation ofstatement of MICHAEL LAYTON             - 2 -



Ultimately a composite film was prepared in conjunction with the Treasury

Solicitors Department which was shown at Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry.

This film was designed to show what was felt to be the most important

scenes and sequence of events.




Likewise, photographic material was obtained from various sources, which

was examined and scheduled in the same manner.




Continuity in respect of all this material is not necessarily complete,

since the person handing over the material to the Police is not

necessarily the person originating that material.




In an effort to analyse the contents of the visual evidence for the

purpose of the Inquests, some of the material has been grouped into a

number of key areas.




As such the sequence of events as referred to in this statement do not run

in a strictly chronological form, rather it deals with a number of

specific points.




Having regards to the movements of people at the Leppings Lane End of the

Ground, I can make the following observations with regard to the Visual

Evidence.




Video film reference TB 2 was filmed on the South Yorkshire Police CCTV

system using an operator set database, i.e. shows the date and time on

the recorded film.             This camera has pan facilities.                         It should be noted

that videos RJH 1 and RJH 2 have no such time clock.                                     These relate to

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club’s video system.                                   In order to try to

establish the times of the events shown on these tapes, a comparison was

made from events that occurred on the RJH 2 tape, which are also shown on

video ref TB 2 taken from almost identical positions and shows almost

identical footage.




To be specific at 1447.38 hrs on tape ref TB 2 a youth is seen to jump

from the roof of turnstiles A - G into the concourse area, this same scene

can be seen on tape ref RJH 2.




On tape ref TB 2 again at 1452.30 hrs a youth is seen standing against a

wall near to gate C with his arm raised.                            An identical scene is shown on

tape ref RJH 2.




The timings of other events as they appear on tape ref RJH 2 can then be

calculated using a ’real time’ counter on the video player from either

side of these fixed points.




By using this method of calculation it is estimated that the tape ref RJH

2 would have been switched on at 1256 hours.                               The same will apply for all

the tapes ref RJH because they were all switched on at the same time by PC

1421 GUEST, South Yorkshire Police, who has since retired.




On the Video tape referenced TB2 timed at 1200.48 hrs supporters are shown

arriving in a slow trickle and entering the ground at the Leppings Lane

End.     At 1340.00 hrs on the same video a steady flow of supporters are

seen entering the ground and at 1356.33 hrs on the same tape the volume of

supporters has increased.              At 1435.30 hrs there is a very dense crowd in

the courtyard and perimeter gate area.                       A view of the courtyard is also

shown on the BBC tape, referenced MAP 9 with a digital reference of 06.02,

estimated time 1435 hrs.




Again on MAP 9 at a digital reference of 08.42 a crowd is gathered in

Leppings Lane and the courtyard is full.




At a digital reference of 09.06 Superintendent MARSHALL is shown amongst

the crowd.




At a digital reference of 10.34 youths are shown climbing over a metal

jribbed gate onto the roof of turnstile 16.




Between a digital reference of 12.12 and 12.39 Superintendent MARSHALL is

shown outside the gates in Leppings Lane the whole area of which is

heavily congested.

database on     the film.        In the initial stages only an estimated time                                can be

worked out on the basis that the BBC cameraman,                                              states that

filming took place outside the ground at the Leppings Lane end between

1435 hrs and 1450 hrs and there are also apparent breaks in the filming.

In respect of subsequent filming inside the ground this was accurately

timed based between 1503.30 and 1516.58.

On video tape reference RJH2 at an estimated time of 1446 hrs, a number of

youths are seen to climb onto the roofs of turnstiles A-G from

outside prior to dropping into the Stadium.




On the video tape TB2 at 1455.21 hrs supporters are shown in the concourse

area moving towards the tunnel.                 A number of these change direction

towards the gap in the wall which gives access to the Northside of the

ground.




On video tape RJH2 at an estimated time of 1505 hrs the turnstile area and

outside courtyards are clear of incoming supporters.                              An officer in a flat

cap and two Police Constables are seen to run from outside Gate C along

the perimeter drive towards the South Stand.                         Seconds afterwards a Police

Constable runs through Gate C towards the West Stand closely followed by

all other officers from the turnstile area.




In respect of vehicle movement at 1408.20 hrs on video Tape referenced TB1

a South Yorkshire Police video, traffic flowed quite freely and continues

to do so until 1433.08 hrs where it can be seen that no traffic is able to

flow due to pedestrian congestion in Leppings Lane.                             At 1433.27 on TB1 a

bus and two cars are seen moving slowly through the crowd in the roadway.




At 1435.56 hours on TB2 another bus moves through the crowd and at 1436.24

a car.

white roofed vehicle is seen arriving in Leppings Lane immediately behind

a bus, from the direction of Pennistone Road.




At 1445.03 this bus passes another one coining in the opposite direction

but the white roofed vehicle remains stationary in the crowd.




From research of the written evidence I believe in fact that this vehicle

was a police landrover being driven by PC 1863 Buxton of the South

Yorkshire Police.




No further vehicles, apart from this one, are seen until at 1455.35 hours

a bus and a car are seen, and a further vehicle at 1457.25 hours.




These latter two vehicles come to a halt in Leppings Lane and remain

stationary.




In the tape RJH2 the vehicle believed to be the police landrover drives

through the courtyard area past Gate ’C ’ on the perimeter drive at an

estimated time of 1506.49 hrs.




In relation to the perimeter gates that separate the turnstile area from

Leppings Lane, I can make the following observations with regards to the

Visual Evidence.

At 1435.22 hrs on Video Tape TB2 the perimeter gates are open giving

access to turnstiles and area near to Gate ’C ’.




At 1440.26 hrs on the same video all of the                       perimeter gates appear closed.




At 1452.57 hrs on TB2 people can be seen                      to be climbing over the closed

perimeter gates.




At 14.53.40 hrs the second gate from the left as you look at the screen

opens and supporters enter the turnstile area in front of turnstiles A-G.




At 1453.44 hrs the left hand perimeter gates are opened.




At 14.55.17 hrs the right hand perimetergates                       can be seen open.

clearer and police officers can be seen holding the crowd back to the

roadside of the perimeter gates.




At 15.02.11 hrs there is a close up view of the perimeter gate area which

shows that they are open and relatively clear, with supporters entering

the ground.

set of perimeter gates as you look from the ground side towards Leppings

Lane.     These photographs are referenced as D.P.P. 190.




In respect of visual evidence relating to Mounted Officers at the Leppings

Lane end of the ground, the video tapes that cover this area are South

Yorkshire Police CCTV, Reference TB2, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

CCTV RJH2 and BBC             TV Outside Broadcast, Reference MAP 9.




At a digital reference 06.02                     estimated time 1435 on video MAP 9 two

Mounted Officers can be seen directly in front of turnstiles A - G                                                   near

Gate B.

At 1435.22 hrs on video ref TB2 two Mounted Officers can be seen

apparently talking to supporters in front of turnstiles A - G .

Between digital references 08.39 to 08.47 on video MAP 9, nine Mounted

In order to try and analyse the visual evidence available in respect of

the openings of concertina gates referred to as A,B and C, it is necessary

to refer in particular to three video tapes.




Video tapes, reference RJH 2 and RJH 1 are black and white video of poor

quality and with no sound.                RJH 2 refers to a fixed site camera which

overlooks the rear of the turnstiles A - G                       and the concourse area.                 RJH 1

is also part of this system and covers the area of Gate A and concourse

area.




With particular reference to the concertina Gate C it is apparent from the

visual evidence that on the day in question it was being regularly used as

an entrance and exit point for a number of reasons, i.e. the ejection of s

TB 2 timed at 1439.31 hrs a                 boy is carried through Gate C by police,

officers.       The gate appears            to be closed at 1440.45 hrs.




On the video tape ref RJH 2, with an estimated time of 1448.04 hrs Gate C

was opened to eject a supporter.                     At this stage a large number of

large number of supporters entered through it into the ground.                                         At 1457.40

hrs as shown on tape ref TB                 2, Gate C is closed.




On the video tape ref RJH 2                 at an estimated time of 1459.12 hrs Gate C is

again opened with supporters entering the ground.




In respect of Gate A on video tape ref TB 2 it is apparently open at

1458.09 hrs, with supporters entering via it.                             At a time estimated at 1458

the same      scene is shown on video tape ref RJH 1.                          On video tape ref TB 2

at 1458.23 a line of police are shown supervising the supporters through

Gate A.




There is no clear visual evidence of openings in relation to Gate B.                                         The

At 1459.51 hrs Gate 1 was opened to allow supporters from the track area

into the enclosure.




From a photograph taken by South Yorkshire Police at a time shown as 1503,

Gate 3 can be seen open.                 Photograph reference PR1/10A specifically

refers.




At a time shown as 1504 Gate 4 can still be seen open, photograph ref

PR1/22A specifically refers, again taken by South Yorkshire Police.




I have been unable to establish any visual evidence to suggest that these

perimeter gates were closed after these times.




It should be noted that the times shown on these photographs were set by

the individual camera operator by reference to his own watch, they were

not synchronised nor were they verified, e.g. a photograph ref PR1/1A

shows a time of 1501 whilst a clock on the photograph in the ground shows

1500.




Having viewed the main video recording ref MAP 1 I sun able to give the

following information in relation to events on the pitch:-




At 1451.08 the Liverpool team was announced, followed at 1451.47 by the

Nottingham Forest team.                 These announcements caused obvious excitement

amongst the supporters.

Video evidence was also obtained from the FA Cup Semi Finals held at

Hillsborough in 1981 and 1988.




With regards to the 1981 Semi Final, this match was filmed by Yorkshire

T.V.      There is no database on the recording, however, at commentary time

15.11 pm the commentator remarks about supporters being on the pitch

behind the goal at the Leppings Lane end and supporters can be seen

climbing the perimeter fence onto the pitch.                           There then follows views of

supporters sitting on the touchline behind the goal, marshalled by police.




At half time         the supporters on the pitch run up the                      pitch towards the

Spion Kop.        A police cordon is subsequently placed                        around the pitch and

there are no         further points of interest.




With regards         to the Semi Final held on 9 April 1988                      there is video

evidence available from South Yorkshire Police C.C.T.V., reference TB5/2

and TB5/3 and BBC TV referenced J61 and JG2.




The video tapes are available and show extensive coverage of the build up

and match coverage.




As a comparison exercise a composite video tape was prepared which shows

crowd scenes at Leppings Lane outside the ground between 1400 and 1502

hours, on both 9 April 1988 and 15 April 1989 (Refernce SDB1).

From this video it can be seen that at 1400 hrs in 1988 the perimeter

gates nearest the River Don are closed creating a sterile area along the

side of the turnstiles A-G towards Gate ’C ’ where as in 1989 these gates

are open and people can be seen moving freely in this area.                                    At 1416 hours

in 1988 there is a build up of supporters in front of turnstiles A-G and

back along Leppings Lane.               In 1989, the build up is more severe and the

area near to Gate ’C ’ has              become very crowded.




In 1988 at 1429 hrs the roadway in Leppings Lane remain relatively clear,

although crowded, whereas at 1430 hrs in 1989, the Leppings Lane area has

become very congested with supporters spilling into the centre of Leppings

Lane and blocking the road.




At 1446 hours in 1988, although it is very crowded, traffic is still able

to pass and the perimeter               gates are still closed. Whereas at 1446                      hrs in

1989 the area in front of               the turnstiles and Leppings Lane is totally

blocked.




At 1452 hours in 1988 the area adjacent remains sterile, whereas 1452 hrs

in 1989 the concertina Gate ’C ’ was opened to allow supporters into the

ground.




At 1501 hours in both 1988 and 1989 the crowd in Leppings Lane is very

similar in size and under control.

During the course of the preliminary Inquests I gave evidence in respect

of locations at which it was believed that the deceased were either alive

or dead or both in enclosures 3 and 4.                    Plans were produced in respect of

individual deceased.            Subsequently, composite plans were prepared of some

of these locations based on my evidence, by Miss Dawn Goodall, Senior Plan

Drawer, West Midlands Police.               Because of the problems associated with

trying to put all locations of deceased on these two plans, they actually

only show the last position established alive and the first where believed

deceased.       I produce a composite plan reference DR69 in respect of the

location of the positions of the deceased alive and a composite plan

reference DR610 where they were believed to be deceased in the enclosures.




As I have already stated the events outlined in this statement are not in

chronological order.            To assist with this particular aspect a schedule has

been prepared, reference SB1, which seeks to place some of the events into

chronological order.            I produce this schedule.

                             YTV DOCUMENTARY




NARRATOR      Sergeant John Morgan arrived at Hillsborough at 9.30, he

              policed many matches there before.




SGT MORGAN    I have been a Sergeant in Sheffield North Division for ten

              years.    I have worked hundreds of matches, I would say in

              excess of 150 football matches at Hillsborough.




NARRATOR      That morning all officers policing the match attended briefing

              at the ground.




SGT MORGAN    I believe there were something like 800 officers on duty around

              the ground and inside, the main emphasis of the briefings was

              towards public order, I believe, rather than any suggestion

              that there would be any difficulty with the crowd on the

              terraces.




INTERVIEWER   Was overcrowding as an issue mentioned at all?




SGT MORGAN    No it w a s n ’t.




NARRATOR      Liverpool fans approached Hillsborough along Leppings Lane.

              Sergeant MORGAN and other officers took up their positions here

              at the turnstiles where the Liverpool fans would enter.       Ten

              thousand of them would then go to the Leppings Lane terraces.

    SGT MORGAN    The atmosphere was very pleasant.    There was no hostility

                  people were expectant of the game.   They were looking forward

                  to a good match.




    SGT MORGAN    I could see a mass, a sea of people, there were cries of pain

                  as individuals were pressed up against the turnstile gates and

                  I was approached by several people who grabbed hold of my
                                       \
                  clothing and shouted into my face, "There are people getting

                  crushed out there, do something."    I climbed onto the bars of

                  one of the turnstiles and tried to assist people who were

                  actually being crushed up against the bars, trying to pull them

                  free. I tried to reason with the people who were pushing to

                  stand back, but it was hopeless, in a lot of cases they

                  weren’t, they weren’t able to do anything they were locked in

                  position and were, and even if they had wanted to respond to

                  that they were unable because of the crush behind them.




    INTERVIEWER   Did it seem to you that people were in danger of their lives

                  outside those turnstiles?




    SGT MORGAN    Definitely, definitely.

                                        -   3 -




    SGT MORGAN    Had the decision been taken to delay the kick off and a message

                  broadcast on the tannoy system so that everyone was able to

                  hear it, that may have had the desired effect of calming the

                  crowd and preventing them from crushing.    There was an urgency

                  amongst the people to get into the ground at any cost.




    INTERVIEWER   Do you know why that didn’t happen, announcement wa s n ’t made.




    SGT MORGAN    No, I have no idea, I have no idea.




    NARRATOR      2.47 fans climb the wall to escape the crush.    In the crowd

                  police could do little to help.




    SGT MORGAN    I believe that there were upwards of 50 police officers

                  actually deployed in that area to deal with crowd reception and

                  in those numbers we could not deal with four or five thousand

                  people crushed into a small area.




    INTERVIEWER   So did it seem to you that the police had lost control?




    SGT MORGAN    Yes, w e ’d lost control, yes.




    SGT MORGAN    I was already aware that the only way we could have admitted

                  people to the ground without any further injuries being caused

                  to the supporters was to open the big gates. I ’d already made
                                     - 4 -




              an independent decision in my own mind that had those gates not

              been opened I was prepared to open them myself, there was no

              way round it.




INTERVIEWER   Would it have been possible to seal off that tunnel leading to

              those pens fairly easily?




SGT MORGAN    Yes it would have been, there are some gates that can be

              secured and it would have been quite a simple task to put

              officers across the gate and also horses if necessary. Yes, it

              would have been quite an easy task to achieve.




SGT MORGAN    Suddenly, I heard a message being passed over the radio to the

              effect that all available officers were to go to the track

              because the fans were invading the pitch.




SGT MORGAN    What greeted me when I reached that position I will never

              forget so long as I live because there were people being

              pressed up against the fence, their faces were blue, their

              tongues were lolling out of their mouths, there was mucus and

              blood, arms pressed up against the fence, cyanosed, blue, they

              were being pressed up against the netting and it was bulging

              under the pressure, the weight, and they were being obviously
                                     -    5 -




             maintained in an upright position, although I believe that some

             of them may have already been dead at that stage.     It was a

             devastating thing to see.     There were officers tending injured

             people, I could see people climbing backwards into the West

             Stand, being hauled upwards by the people who were up there,

             people climbing over the fence on to the track, it was an

             amazing sight.'




SGT MORGAN   Quite quickly I decided that the best thing for me to would be

             to go round to the tunnel and I called to a number of other

             officers who were standing at the edge of the pitch, to join

             me, I asked them to follow me.     I started to go down into pen

             3, pushing people back, grabbing hold of them and pushing them

             back down the tunnel behind me and I was followed down the

             terrace by other officers.     I worked my way down to the front

             of the pens again to be confronted by a horrific sight which I

             shall never forget, which I think about every day.     A pile of

             bodies crushed up against the wall, waist deep.




SGT MORGAN   The bodies were laid on the grass to be tended by firemen and

             St Johns Ambulance personnel and I assisted them to do that, I

             think I carried two or three bodies by that means to that end

             of the ground.

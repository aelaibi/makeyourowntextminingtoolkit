            open      on P e n i s t o n e    R o a d.       The      Royal       Hotel       was    one.        I cannot          remember

            the     name     of    the     other.          It w a s        apparent          to me     from the         start       of    this

            time        I was       in t h e r e g i o n       of     the L i v e r p o o l                 goalmouth.                 B y t hi s     time        it

            was        apparent          that          all     those          involved were being                      a t t e n d e d to a n d             there

            was        little       I could           do.       I was         fortunate              that     the w o r s t            was     o ve r       and     I

            did        not     encounter             some      of    the      terrifying               scenes          of    people           being

            trapped            up a g a i n s t       the f e n c e       and      dying           t ha t    have      been           described             to

            me     afterwwards.                  I    d i d not      witness            any          of     the    fans          pushing           o t h e r s in

            the        Liverpool           pens       whilst          I was         there.            Most        of   them           seemed        to   be on

            th e       field       and     this       was beginn ing               to        cause        another        problem.

            I assisted              fans     tearing            down a d v e r t i s i n g            boards           around          th e    perimeter

            to     use       as    make     shift          stretchers.                  I saw        that     a temporary                   first        aid

            po st       had       been     set       up at      the       far      end       of t h e       North Stand                on     the      pitch

            being         carried.           It w a s          at    t h is     point          that I r e alised                      the full        scale

            of t h e         disaster.                 It w a s       hard         to    see w h e r e       help was             most urgently

            needed.               In m y    opinion            all    was       being         done        that     could          be       done      in the

            circumstances                  but       the    crowd         in t he        N o r t h S t a n d were                far       from

            satisfied.                There          were      constant            taunts          form      them and m an y were

                                                              .
At 8 am on Saturday 15 April 1989 I paraded for duty at Mexbrough Police Station
and was subsequently transported to the Hillsbrough Football Ground at Sheffield
for football duties re the FA Cup Final Liverpool v Nottingham Forest.

At 9.^5 am that date I attended a briefing in the Northstand at the ground. I was
in Serial 60. PS 2019 Thompson was in charge of the serial.

The briefing was concluded at about 10,50 am that morning and after it I had my first
meal (provided) in the North Stand.

At approx 11.10 am date I left the ground with my serial on foot to take up duty
in Pennistone Road from Borough Road to Burton Street. We worked in pairs and I was
in the company of PC.7 6 .Durham.

Our foot patrol was mainly done between two public houses which were open on Pennistone
Road. The Royal Hotel was one. I cannot remember the name of the other. It was
apparent to me from the start of this duty that large numbers of football supporters
were begining to gather outside these premises. The licenseeof one of them ( the one
I haven't named) was even patrolling with his rockweiller dog. It was a warm sunny day
and there was a lot of alcohol being consumed by many of the fans, outside these pubs.
The bulk of supporters appeared to be coming from the direction of the city centre
and most of them were Nottingahm Forest fans. Many appeared to have been drinking
scores of them were still carrying beer glasses with beer and larger still inside,
others were drinking from cans and bottles as they passed. In the event I never once
witnessed any trouble. The mood appeared good humoured. Though I was told that the
licensee of the Royal Hotel was suspected of selling 'crates of beer' to the fans from
the 'back door of the pub' I never once saw him doing this.
                                         with       I
Between approx 1, pm that date and 2.^5 pm,PC DurhamAperforme'dv traffic duty
at the junction of Pennistone Road with I think Owlerton Grange* Traffic lights at this
junction had been switched off and we took it in turns to stand in the roadway.
All this time the passing fans many on foot and in vehicles continued to be well
behaved.

At 2 A 5 pm that date we left our traffic poi$t and together with PC Durham and my serial
we started to walk towards the ground where according to our orders we were to board
a coach which would be taking us for our second meal at Claywheels Lane. We never got
to that coach. Within a few yards of the ground (main entrance on Pennistone Road)
PS Thompson, who had the only radio in the detail started to pick up a distorted message
from ground control to the effect that there were serious problems inside the ground
and would every available officer make their way there. I would say the time now was
just after 3 .pm. With my serial we walked through the main entrance sliding doors
and then we were told to 'standby' in a small enclosure between the North Stand and the
Spion Cop.. There were a very large number of other officers there. I could not see the
pitch and for a time no body was quite sure what was happening. I would be stood in
this position for about 5 to 7 minutes. We were then instructed to go onto the pitch
The reason was not made clear at this time, and I did not know what I was going to be
doing. I just follwed the remainder of my serial and our sergeant. As we walked ont©
the pitch I saw large numbers of fans together with police officers, firemen, first aide:
rs etc tending to scores of injured persons who were lying on the ground. Dozens of othej
s were rushing around giving what assistance they could. I saw some persons being
conforted by others some were gasping for their breath and others had a gastly look
on their faces which were either very pale/ white or purple in colour. Many were holding
their chests. I still was not sure what our duty on the field was so I went amongst
many of the injured fans to see if I could be of any assistance. By this time
I was in the region of the Liverpool goal mouth. By this time it was apparent that all
those involved wbre being attended to and there was little I could do. I was fortunate
that the worst was over and I did not encounter some of the terrifying scenes of
people being trapped up against the fence and dying that have been described to me
afterwards. I did not witness    any of the fans pushing others in the Liverpool pens
whilst I was there. Most of them seemed to be on the field, and this was begining to
cause another problem.
I assisted fans tearing down advertising boards around the perimter to use as make shif
Stretchers. I saw that a temporary first aid post had been set up at the far end of
the North Stand on the pitch and it was towards that point that many of the dead and
dying were being carried. It was at this point that a realised the full scale of
the disaster. Itwas hard to see where help was most urgently needed. In my opinion
all was being done that could be done in the circumstances but the crowd in the
North Stand were far from satisfied. There were constant taunts from them and many
were screaming abuse at thepolice on the field.They appeared to be blaming us for what
had happened. I felt at one time that a rather dangerous situation was developing
in the crowd. It crossed my mind for one brief moment that fans from all points of
the ground were going to rush the pitch and assault or cause serious harm to manypolice
officers. Tension and feelings were running extremely high. Taunts and geers from
the Nottingham Forest stand (Spion Cop) caused a rush of Liverpool supporters
across the field and at this point I was ordered by a Superintendent together with a
large number of other officers to form a cordon across the whole width of the field
to keep rival fans apart. It was whilst I was doing this that large numbers of
injured and dead persons were carried through the cordon on boards /stretchers
to the North Stand. An anouncements was then made to the effect that the match had
been cancelled, and fans were to remain in position until arrangements could be made
for their safe exit from the ground. At this point I was again instructed to leave
the ground and go onto Pen .istone Road outside the main entrance to supervise fans
boarding buses taking them into the city centre. This was to prevent any rush and
further injury in a pannick situation.

It was whilst I was performing this duty that I was approached by Det Inspector
Alan Timms. By this time I had become totally detached from my detail. D.I Timms
arrived outside the ground on     istone Rd near the main entrance in a police vehicle
and he asked that I and five other officers, whose names I do not know assist him
in carrying a large filing cabinet into the Gymnasium from the police vehicle. As I
went inside the gym the full horror of the disaster struck me. In all my twenty years
service in the force I had never seen death on such a large scale. I saw well over
60 bodies on the gym floor. I was saddened to see that many were so young. The
atmosphere inside the gym was very tense and unnerving. When I left I joined PS
Sherratt. He asked me what I was doing I told him that I had become detached from
my detail and because his men were also depleated he instructed I stay with him.
We then formed a cordon across the entrance to the gym preventing unlawful access
to the building which was being used as a make shift mortuary. Press in particular
were kept well away. It was whilst I was there that I saw many more bodies being
taken from ambulances and then carried into the gym. Relatives of the dead and injured
were by now begining to gather in numbers. It was a very distressing sight. I assisted
in directing some of them to a nearby desk in the north stand which had been set up
as a missing persons bureau. Eventually at about 6.30 pm we were stood down from
our position. Other officers too over. I then returned to Claywheels Lane and to
Mexbrough Police Station via Doncaster DHA. I wetired from duty at 8 pm that night#

                              HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM




                         EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURE:



The following notes of guidance sire prepared and issued to assist all
official stewards and others in a position of responsibility at the
Hillsborough Stadium on the action to be taken and procedures to be followed
in the event of the possibility of evacuation of the stadiun during the
playing of a game when spectators are present. The notes are not intended to
be e. comprehensive list of all the action necessary, but are for personal
issue to each steward and for retention b y the steward for immediate ref­
erence all tho time h^/she is on duty at the stadium.

It is appreciated that the ::>:asons evacuation may become necessary are many
and varied, but the most obvious are fires-or information that explosive/
incendiary deviccs have been placed somewhere within the stadium/ground.
That information may be received or discovered either by members of the staff
at the stadium, or by telephone to the stadium., police., local or national
newspapers.

IT IS STRESSED THAT WHENEVER SUCH INFORMATION IS RECEIVED THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE DECISION TO EVACUATE ALL OR PART OF THE GROUND RESTS WITH THE SENIOR
MANAGEMENT OF THE CLUB.  (The senior police officer or. duty will be in a
position to advise as to whether the ’bomb call' is likely to be genuine or
not) .

Whenever such information becomes known, ?, message viill be relayed to the
police officer on duty in the ,:P. A. Commentary Box" at the ground, who.- on
instructions from tho senior police officer, and irrespective of whether
the match is in progress or not, will cause the record                             to
be played over the loudspeaker system.                       V d T Ttt£ K e T T b e Obi

The playing of that record will indicate to everyone present at the around,
other than spectators, that a possible emergency situation exists.

N.B.   As part of the regular pre-match brief of referees and linesmen and
       both teams, this information should be passed to then so that the
       game officials are also aware of the possibility of aun interruption in
       play and the significance of the playing of the record.

On hearing that record all club stewards will make their way to their des­
ignated duty points on gangways/gates/exits, etc. Those on exit gates will
open the gates and remain at that point. During this period senior
officials will consider the nature of the emergency alleged and will decide
to evacuate all/part of the stadium.    Once that decision has been taken, but
not until, the senior police officer on duty will cause a spoken message to
be relayed over the :,P. A. System'’ which will have the effect of:-

(1)    Stopping the game and removing players from the field of play;

(2)    Informing the spectators/officials of the precise nature of the
       emergency and its location if known, and requesting all or specified
       sections of the public to leave their seats and make their way out of
       the ground by the nearest normal exit route unless specifically directed
        to do otherwise by means of the :!P. A. System".



                                                                                          (3
                                     -   2   -




IT IS STRESSED THAT NO EVACUATION WILL TAXE PLACE EXCEPT IN EXTREME
EMERGENCY AND ALTHOUGH THE PREPARATORY WARNING RECORD 'THREE BLIND MICE'
MAY 3E PLAYED, THERE IS EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT INITIAL ENQUIRIES WILL
ESTABLISH THE PERPETRATION OF A HOAX, ETC. , AND Hi THAT CASE, INSTEAD OF
A SPOKEN MESSAGE TO EVACUATE: THE FACT THAT THE EMERGENCY HAS PASSED
WILL BE INDICATED BY THE PLAYING OF THE RECORD - 1I    f   f   :P(J£®ZX\'  A Zona cC

 Dear

 I refer to your letter dated 24 March 1986, in which you make reference to
 difficulties with the West Ham United fixture on 12 March 1986.

 In dealing with the situation regarding the elevated standing area on
 Leppings Lane, I can only repeat my earlier comments that there was confusion
 regarding the use of this area on that occasion and the ground commander saw
 fit not to open it initially, but subsequently, on my instructions, did so.
 I can only add that it is not my intention to regularly close the elevated
 standing area and that, as agreed in the past, either I or John Freeman would
 discuss the position prior to a match and if there was such an intention then
 you would be informed accordingly.

 So far as the use of the television gantry is concerned, I would point out
 that whilst it may be alleged that police officers were uncoperative my
 information suggests that the television cameramen, and in particular the
 editor present, were most uncoperative and did not see the need for the
 presence of my officers at all.   I am sure you will agree that public safety
 is of greater importance than the media coverage and if we are jointly to
 achieve our objectives of ensuring the safety of the public at such splendid
 sporting events then the need for preventative measures, such as the
 attendance of my Scenes of Crime officers, is essential.   I know that you and
 I have discussed the- position and in fact one of the officers was removed
 from the gantry at our agreement but this did not satisfy the television
 cameramen.  Whilst I appreciate they have priorities, we too have priorities,
 and I hope that by mutual discussion such situations will not arise in the
 future.

 I am not aware             of whether or not             you will have T.V. coverage on Saturday for
 the match with             Liverpool, but it             is my intention - subject to your agreement -
 that my Scenes             of Crime officers             will be present once again because I feel
 their presence             is essential if I             am to deal adequately with instances which
 may arise.

 I trust this information will be of assistance to you.

 Yours

         B e fo r e the start of next season I want you to arrange a Seminar for
stew ards and programme sellers so that th e y can be informed e x a c t l y o f their
duties.

               It is important that you draw up a list of stewards and their
r e s p e c t iv e duties, and similarly with programme sellers. In the c a s e of
programme sellers they must be instructed that this job is a selling job and
they must go out to our supporters to sell and make some v o c a l contribution to
it. They must be str ate gic ally placed and their perform ance m onitored.

         Many of the above requirem ents apply also to stewards.

         Do you think it would be rewarding if other people such as our
turnstile operators w ere also properly instructed along these lines?

Dear Brian,

As you w ill be well aware the in structional evening fo r gatemen and stewards
was held at Hillsborough la s t night and I am sure your o ffic e rs w ill have
reported back to you upon the success of th e ir part of the evening.

 I in actual fa c t attended and addressed the tu rn s tile operators whilst the
instructions fo r safety and evacuation procedures were being dealt with
downstairs with the stewards. There were one or two points which were
j u s t i f i a b l y raised by the t u r n s t ile men a ll of which r e la te to the security,
of the cash and I would be obliged of your assistance in one or two areas.

1. Concern was expressed over the question of the 'stopper s t i l e s ' where,
as you know, t u r n s t ile operators remain on duty u n til h a lf time. The basic
problem is that when the match has started there is a mass exodus of Police
personnel leaving the remaining t u r n s t ile operators completely vulnerable
to any problems from possible t h e f t . Equally so the new cover over the Kop
would appear to be ideal fo r intending trouble makers to be able to lurk around
un-noticed. In both cases I enquire whether or not you w i l l be able to include
in your orders a Police presence at both ends of the ground u n til such a time
as a ll cash has been removed via security transport. .

There is , however, a p o s s ib ilit y that the 'stopper s t i l e s ' at Leppings Lane
w i ll need to have to physically carry th e ir cash to the security room and
i f this were the case an attendance of a Police Officer to escort them round
would indeed be a necessity.


                                                           cactinued
2.    Door ' H* at the rear of the South Stand persistently causes us problems
with the very presence of children waiting to be taken in on shareholders
passes. This matter has been looked into by our own security s t a f f which,
at la s t nig h t's meeting^ concern was expressed at the safety aspect of the
presence of these children and in the i n i t i a l few games of the forthcoming
season I would be obliged i f you could give consideration to arranging for
o ffic e rs to keep th e ir eye open in this area and where necessary remove the
children to.enable ease of access.

I await your observations at your e a r lie s t convenience.

Yours sincerely,   -

           Dear

           Thank you for your letter of 20 August 1986, and I agree that the instructional
           evening for the gatemen and stewards was a success and must be considered as
           time well spent.

           As far as the other matters which you raise are concerned, I would make the
           following comments:

           1.     The potential for crime at the ’stopper stiles' has already been
                  identified and a police presence will be maintained at both ends
                  of the ground.  However, as far as the actual escort of the cash
                  to the security room is concerned, in my view this is a task for
                  the private security concern employed, and not police officers.


                  Once again, I do not consider the problem regarding the children
                  at Door 'H' as a task in which police officers should be specifically
                  involved initially.  Whilst we will of course give every assistance
                  regarding this matter, I would suggest that this is a problem that
                  could adequately be dealt with by stewards, who would of course engage
                  the advice or assistance of a police officer should the particualr
                  circumstances demand that course of action.

           Yours sincerely,

                          ’F' DIVISION




During the past few years we have witnessed some terrible scenes of
unwarranted disorder at football matches throughout the world.   In some
ar^as the reputation of football supporters has been tarnished to such
an extent that many ardent supporters have been frightened away from
this, our national sport. We must not let thistrend continue.

Here at Sheffield Wednesday, we have all tried to overcome this
reputation, particularly during the run up to the Cup Final, and have
shown that football can take place without disorder and that families
can attend football matches inLtlie confidence that everything will be done
on the part of the club and my officers toallow enjoyment of the sport
to be the order of the day.

I am aware that there is still a small proportion of so called supporters
who would wish to spoil that reputation, however, I believe that
with the efforts of loyal supporters and the club officials and players,
we can overcome the anti-social behaviour of these individuals and I look
forward to a good season at Sheffield Wednesday during 1987/88.

I would wish to place on record my congratulations to our supporters for
their actions during the past season and from the numerous letters received
from visiting clubs during the year know that our reputation stands us in
good stead.  I would wish to continue in that way and seek your support in
this endeavour.

In an effort to encourage family involvement I am again continuing our
policy of community policing at the ground and will have regular officers
working the same areas throughout the season so that you can identify with
them and pass on any comments or observations you may wish as to our
policing policies.

You will be aware that the stadium has one of the finest television
monitoring systems 'in the country for control both inside and outside the
ground and I would remind everyone that this is used at all matches to
ensure that any difficulties are quickly overcome to the benefit of all
concerned.

Once again I seek your support for a good year and would remind you that
not only-are the players a 'team1, but so are we - you the supporters, the
club, and the police - and if we are to continue to succeed, we must work
together and I am confident that w e will.

     Dear

     SEASON TICKET HOLDERS - WEST STAND

     During recent years we have expressed concern over the fact that a number
     of Sheffield Wednesday season ticket holders continue to be accommodated in
     the West Stand.  As you are no doubt aware, it is our policy that we should
     make every effort to maintain segregation and this area is specifically
     designated for 'away' supporters.

     I appreciate that on occasions we utilise part of the West Stand for home -
     supporters on match days which do not anticipate large numbers of visitors.
     However, it is on the occasions when big matches take place that we find
     some difficulty in trying to accommodate those few ardent Wednesday fans
     who seek to maintain their position in the West Stand.

     I would ask that serious consideration be given to refusing season tickets
     to Wednesday supporters in the West Stand in the interests of safety, and
     seek your assistance in this matter, please.

     Yours sincerely

             measure this has been due to your positive direction.   I
             look forward to continuing good relationships and would
             wish to place on record my sincere appreciation for your
             particular support during this your first season with the
             club.

             Every good wish for the future.

            Dear

            I refer to my telephone conversation with        in your
            absence, concerning the fixtures for the forthcoming
            season, and in particular the fixtures between Derby on
            28 December 1987 and Everton on 1 January 1988.

           As indicated, I would ask that these matches be scheduled
           to be played at 12 noon on those dates instead of 3.00pm.
           The reason for my request is based upon the need to
           maintain public safety and to avoid licensing hours,
           bearing in mind the Bank Holidays on these two dates.

            I trust you will be able to comply with my request.

           Yours                    **7

                                                                        ?? April 1989
             R e port of events on 15 April 1989 at Hillsbcrugh
             Football Ground Sheffield----------             °~




    At around 3.15pm on Saturday 15 April, I ( p Schofield) was
    at home and switched on the television to watch the foot­
    ball match, at Hillsborough. It was immediately apparent
    that a large scale disaster had occurred, though little
    hard information was reported. Believing the Barnsley Area
    ambulance may be able to assist, I travelled to Oakwell
    football ground, knowing that I would be able to muster a
    crew from the members present.

                °aky ell,at, rpproxlmately 3 -|5°Pm . I informed the
                   5 1! Supt                  l°f ^ e circumstances..
    and she acceeded to my request for
    to accompany me to Sheffield.

    We three then travelled to Cudworth and transferred to the
    Area ambulance. Using lights and sirens we made best speed
    n? nio ^ ° J ° t S enc;un tering standing traffic at the junction
    of Doe Royd Lane and Halifax Road. Police traffic controllers
    waved us to the "wrong" side of the dual carriageway, thus
     Y                .traffic and we procceeded to the traffic island ‘
    at the J u n c t i o n of Penistone Road Nth and Leppings Lane. Traffic
    n? ihp ?nn?L?iireCted,U3 t ™ * TdS the Leppings^ Lafe entrance
    of the football ground, where we joined a queue of waiting
    ambulances, the time being approximately 3.55pm. After some
    five minutes. Police instructed us to go to the other side
    of the ground, where, we were told, the injured had been
    taken.

                m(ptorcycle eaC0I"t» we drove via Parkside road
    to the east side of the ground where Police directed us to the
    internal access road, leading to an access point between the
    south and west stands. The ambulance was reversed to the access
    ramp and made ready to receive casualties. The three of us made
    our way onto the pitch and although there were numerous people
    obviously suffering from shock and exhaustion, we were informed
    by Police that all casualties had been removed to the Sports
    H al l.

           Fencing - It was reported that the St. John Ambulance Brigade

approached with a view to getting ideas on likely costs.

        " Mr.    Strange"                        John        Strange        CEng,FIStructE,

                                                 Associate in the Firm.



3.      This statement is intended to be read in conjunction with

a    bundle      of    copy      documents       extracted          from    the      Firm7 s      files

which       accompanies           this       statement.             When    referring            to    an

individual        document,            I shall      add the        relevant page           number in

the bundle.



4.      I    have      been       involved       with        football       stadia         including

Hillsborough             for          many    years.           My        first       contact          with

Hillsborough           was       in    the   late     1950's       whilst       I    was   a     Senior

Lecturer         at    Sheffield         University.           I    advised         them    on    minor

matters.         My major involvement with football stadia came when I

joined      Husband          &    Co    as   Managing        Partner.            That      firm       were

Consulting            Engineers         to    the     Club,        Sheffield         United       F. C. ,

Southampton F. C. , Nottingham Forest F. C. , Swindon Town F. C. and


                                                 - 2 -
Rotherham United F.C.                 Whilst at Husband & Co I took particular

responsibility           for     their      work    at     these     grounds     and    I    was

involved in the construction of new stands at both Nottingham

Forest F. C. and Swindon Town F. C.                   During this period there was

the disaster at Ibrox Park.                   In the aftermath of this disaster,

I was     involved in liaison with the Police concerning capacity

of     football    stadia.            Handrails     and     crush     barriers    were       the

subject      of   much    discussion         and    I designed        equipment        to   test

crush barriers which was used at the stadia of the six football

clubs mentioned above.



5.      It must be remembered that all this took place before the

1975    Act and the        1976 Guide.             Both the    1975 Act and the             1976

Guide were a product of the "Wheatley Commission" of 1972 which

was    set    up to    examine        the   safety of sports           grounds    following

the Ibrox disaster.              Sir Walter Winterbottom,              former Manager of

the    England    Football        Team,      chaired      a working party to            advise

the Wheatley Commission.                    That working party spent a day with

me discussing safety at football stadia.



6.      Eastwood & Partners              are retained as Consulting               Engineers

to     the     Club,      Sheffield           United       F.C. ,Sunderland         F. C. ,

Chesterfield          F. C. ,    and    Rotherham        United F.    C.    The firm        also

does    occasional work for Hull Rugby League F.C. , the Sheffield

Sports       Stadium     which    has       Greyhound      Racing,     Rugby     League       and

until     this    season        had    Speedway      and    also     the   County      Cricket

Ground at Scarborough.
7.       I    am     a       very    interested       football        supporter          and     have   two

seats in the south stand at Hillsborough very close to the West

Terrace.                 I     attend       matches       frequently,              usually       with    my

grandson,          who is now aged 12.                   He has been attending matches at

Hillsborough with                   either me or his father since he was aged 8

and      I    have       never       had    occasion       to    feel      that     we    were    in    the

slightest           physical          danger,       or    that       the     Police       were    in    any

difficulty.                  The    most    recent    fairly large crowd prior to the

F. A.    Cup       Semi-Final          on    15th April         1989 was           the match between

the     Club       and       Liverpool      on    14th January             1989.     I attended the

match that day and the Liverpool fans were in the West Terrace.

I pass the Leppings Lane end turnstiles every time I enter the

ground.



RETAINER OF EASTWOOD & PARTNERS

8.       The       firm       was    first       retained       by    the     Club       as    Consulting

Engineers          in        1978.         The    only    formal      letters         regarding         that

retainer are those to my firm from the Club dated 25th October

1978 and 1st December 197 8 (pages                              4 and 7).           The firm were to

act      on    behalf          of    the    Club     in    their      dealings        with       the    SYCC

and/or the Sheffield Metropolitan District Council Hillsborough

in      respect      of the          structural          aspects      of the        ground      following

its designation under the 197 5 Act.



9.       I have been Director in charge of all work done on behalf

of      the    Club.           During       our    continuous         retainer        since       December

1978         I have been ably assisted by Mr Strange of the firm.                                         He

was      a Senior            Engineer,       and has been an Associate of the                           firm
since        about        1982.          He    has        been   a    regular        attender     at

Hillsborough since he was a boy.



10.     Pages       1/2 in the bundle are a list of all the jobs which

my firm has done for the club since December 1978 (page 3 lists

those particular jobs which may be relevant for the purpose of

the    Inquiry        and    from    the       files       relating      to    which    have    been

abstracted the documents of which copies appear in the attached

bundle).         The jobs did not only involve work required under the

1975    Act,       but also general up-grading and modernisation of the

ground.          Almost      every       year    there       has     been     some     significant

improvement of the ground.



11.     In liaising with the Club I have found that they have been

very willing          to spend money to improve the ground and I have

found       that    the     Club's       Board       of   Directors      in particular          have

been very easy to work with.                      Mr.      H. McGee has been Chairman of

the Club throughout this time,                        and he has taken a keen interest

in safety matters including attending some of the meetings with

the    Working       Party        (which I shall            describe in paragraph              16 of

this    Statement).               I have       had    frequent       personal        contact    with

him.         He has       always     stressed the need                for the ground to be

safe and has been a driving force in getting work done.



12.     Of    the     Directors,          Mr     Whitehead         was    the    Director       with

special      responsibility for the ground at the time of the early

meetings.           He played        an active part              until    he    ceased to be       a

Director in approximately                     1983.       He was succeeded by Mr K Addy

and    Mr    E     Baron.         They    have       a particular         responsibility         for
ground matters as Directors.                 I have had frequent meetings with

them on major matters and have found their attitude to be very

co-operative at all times.



13.     There have been three Club Secretaries since the firm was

first retained by the Club in                  1978.     The first was                  Mr E

England.       He was a highly experienced man and was much involved

in the works         at the ground.          He was succeeded by                      Mr R H

Chester       who    was    also    an   experienced       Club      Secretary        having

previously been Secretary at Sheffield United F.C.                           and Lincoln

City    F. C. .     The present       Secretary is        Mr G Mackrell.              I have

always found it very easy to work with him.



THE 1975 ACT. THE 1976 and 1986 GUIDES AND THE "WQRKTWn PARTY"

14.    It    may    assist    the Inquiry if I make some comments                      about

the relevant details of the 1975 Act and the 1976 Guide.                                Both

the    1975    Act    and     the    197 6   Guide     came     about      following      the

"Wheatley         Report"    into     the    Ibrox     disaster.           The   1975    Act

contains      no    technical       details.      These       were   all    to   be     found

originally in the 1976 Guide.                  The current edition of the Guide

was    published      in    1986.     However,       for most of the time I was

working under the 1976 Guide (not I believe 1973 as referred to

in error in the preface to the 1986 Guide).



15.    Section       1 of the       1975 Act permits the Secretary of State

to designate as a stadium requiring a Certificate,                           referred to

in the Act as a "Safety Certificate",                    any Sports Stadium which

in     his    opinion        has     accommodation        for     more      than      10,000

spectators.         As indicated the original retainer of the firm by
the    Club    in     1978     followed    the designation of Hillsborough                           as

such    a     stadium.          Section       2   of   the      1975      Act    sets       out     the

required contents of Safety Certificates.                             An application for a

Safety Certificate is made to a Local Authority                                  (as defined in

the 1975 Act) and is governed by Section 3, which also requires

that copies of the application be sent to the Chief Officer of

Police      and     the   Building      Authority         for       the   area    in which the

stadium       is    situated.          These      bodies       are    consulted            about    the

terms and conditions to be included in the Safety Certificate.



16.     A Working Party was set up in Sheffield to deal with such

applications which involved representatives of the Police,                                         Fire

Service,      Building         Surveyors      Division and the Legal                   Department

of the Local Authority.                 The relevant Local Authority was SYCC

until    198 6 when the SCC took over.                    Representatives of the Club

would also attend some meetings of the Working Party when the

Safety Certificate concerning Hillsborough was discussed.



17.     The Guide is a voluntary code and has no legal force                                       (see

paragraph          1. 1 1976    Guide     and paragraph             1 of the       1986 Guide).

Neither of the Guides is rigid,                     and they both contemplate that

deviation          from        their     recommendations willnot                  necessarily

detract       from     the     overall        safety      of    a    ground.           A    flexible

approach       is      encouraged        in       order    to        take   account          of     the

particular          circumstances       at individual               grounds.       The relevant

criterion when assessing the adequacy of safety for spectators

in new work or               re-construction is that of areasonable degree

of     safety.               Both      Guides       use        the words         "it       would     be

unreasonable,          even if it were practicable,                    to seek the absolute
safety of everyone attending a ground"                           (see paragraphs 1. 4 and

1. 5 of the 1976 Guide and Paragraph 8 of the 1986 Guide).                                    The

1986 Guide goes on to state in paragraph 6 that "the Guide does

not    attempt        to    set     a     minimum     standard"        for    any     particular

ground.           Rather,           it     attempts        "to   take        account     of   the

constraints       and difficulties with are present within"                             existing

sports grounds             (see paragraph 7           198 6 Guide).



18.     I shall        deal later in this              statement with the provisions

in     the     Guides       regarding         such     matters     as        crush     barriers,

perimeter        and       radial        fences.      However,     I    set     out    here   the

relevant paragraphs in both the 1976 and 1986 Guides: -



        I tem                     1976      Guide                       198 6    Guide

19.     There are no material differences between the 1976 and the

1986         Guides    with    regard        to their comments           on terraced steps

and     crush         barriers.             Other     sections     have         been    extended

                                                   - 8 -
following       the     Bradford        fire       and      to    take    account      of      their

application to sports grounds other than football grounds.                                       The

section     regarding          radial fences          has        been     extended        so    that

paragraph       103     now    states that         such          fences "should       be of the

strength of the crush barriers".                       Paragraphs 7.9.1 and 7.9.2 in

the 1976 Guide regarding perimeter fences have been replaced by

new    paragraphs        214     and    215     in       the     1986      Guide.         Finally,

additions        have     been       made     in      the        1986      Guide      concerning

estimation        of     safe        ground     capacity.               However,      the      basic

formulae remain the same.                   The 1986           Guide contains examples of

use of the formulae whereas the 1976                             Guide did not.



CRUSH BARRIERS

20.     When the firm was first retained by the Club in 1978 there

were barriers          at the         Leppings Lane end of the ground but they

were    fewer     in    number         than recommended by the                  1976 Guide.        I

cannot    speak        from    my own knowledge,                 but I believe that these

barriers    had been           installed in 1965 at the time when the West

Stand was constructed                 just prior to theuse of Hillsborough for

Group     Matches       in     the      1966       World       Cup,or    at an     even     earlier

date.



21.     I refer to my           firm's      plan No.           1610/64E.         This is dated

January     1980,       but    has     been updated over the years                    to reflect

changes.              The original barriers which were in place in 1978

are     marked    in     red    on    the     plan.            They were        insufficient       in

number     to    comply        with     the    recommendations             as    to   spacing      of

barriers in paragraph 7. 7. 2 of the 1976 Guide.




                                                - 9 -
22.     Such spacing recommendations are contained in paragraph 12

of    the    197 6 Guide.               They       are    dependent     upon    a   number     of

factors:              the    gradient         of the terrace;             the    area of the

ground       in    which     they   are       situated        ("peak    viewing     areas"     or

"other viewing areas");                   and the strength of the barriers.



23.     Under paragraph           12. 2 of the 1976 Guide peak viewing areas

are described as the most popular parts of the terraces such as

behind the goal areas.                  The central pens at the Leppings                     Lane

end of Hillsborough fall within such category.



24.     As will be seen from the tables under paragraph 12 of the

1976 Guide,         (and Table 1 at page 38 of the 1986 Guide) barriers

may either be Class A or Class B as defined in the tables under

paragraph 13. 2 of the Guide.                      Class A barriers must be designed

safely       to    resist     a   force       of    5.OkN/metre      width      (3401bs    /foot

width).            Such     barriers      must       be   capable of resisting a test

load of       6. 0 kN/metre width              (4001bs       /foot width) in accordance

with Appendix C of the Guide.                            The equivalent design and test

loads       for Class       B barriers         are respectively 3. 4kN/metre width

(2301bs       /foot        width)       and        4.3kN/metre       width     (2901bs     /foot

width).           It is to be noted that the test loads are overloads,

being       approximately         20%     and       27%    greater     than   the   respective

design loads.



2 5.     When the then Secretary of the Club,                        Mr. England,        wrote to

my     firm on      25th October           1978      (page    4)   he sent a copy of the

guidance notes issued by the then Licensing Authority under the

1975 Act,          S. Y. C. C.    (pages      5-6).          Paragraph 5 of those notes
refers to the need to test crush barriers by an approved method

and in the presence              of    appropriate            officers          of the   Licensing

Authority.



26.     In the     first     instance my              firm    considered the number and

spacing    of     the    existing         barriers           in    regard       to which (and of

course other matters)             we      reported to the Club                   on 12th January

1979    (pages    10-22).             I refer in particular to sub-paragraph

(b) under the heading "Standing Accommodation"                                   (pages 14-15).

We were then uncertain of the strength of the original barriers

and in particular whether they were Class A.                                    We did, however,

recommend       the     installation             of     extra       barriers       to    permit     a

capacity     of    7,200     persons        on the West             Terrace       (including the

lower    level          at the    North-West corner)                  which,       it    should    be

remembered,       in     1978    was      not     sub-divided into               pens    by    radial

fences    (with the        history of which I shall deal                           later in this

Statement).             Our calculations               of capacity,             in the light of

our    recommendations           for      extra        barriers,          was     carried out      in

accordance with           the relevant          formula in            paragraph 15.4 of the

1976    Guide.            In     our      report to the Club we summarised                        our

recommendations          (page 21-22) The second recommendation involved

making     firm proposals         to       the        relevant            authorities          for the

installation of new crush barriers together with computation of

capacity.          The details            of our calculations               are recorded in a

document dated January 1979 (page 23).



27.     Our scheme for new barriers was prepared on the basis that

they     would     be     Class       A    and        that        where    necessary          existing

barriers would also be brought up to Class A.                                     The spacing was
designed by reference to the table in paragraph 12 of the 197 6

Guide,    taking account



28.     With        the   approval          of    the    Club      we   submitted    our    formal

report to the Police,                  Fire Service and the Licensing Authority

on     17th    January         1979    (pages       24-32).             The relevant       section

dealing with the West Terrace is to be found at pages                                      27-28.

With    the        report      we    submitted our drawing No.                   1610/2X showing

the position of the existing barriers and that of the proposed

new barriers.



2 9.     The working party                  met    on    2nd April        197 9 and the Minutes

(pages        33-37)      record       under      Section B in            respect   of the West

Terrace that the proposals were accepted with regard to the new

barriers.                 On    8th June          1979    S. Y. C. C.   forwarded a Schedule

formally confirming all matters which had been discussed within

the     working       party         and which       S. Y. C. C.     felt required         attention

(pages        43-49).               paragraph      E2     records       the    agreement    by    the

Police        of    a capacity of            7, 200 persons          in respect of the West

Terrace provided that the additional barriers were installed.



30.      The work in the latter respect was put in hand.                                    The new

barriers           are    marked       in    blue        on   plan      No.    1610/64E.          The

barriers were designed by my firm (a different design from that

of     the     existing             barriers)       and       we   supervised       the    work     of

installation.



31.      During the events in question on                           the       afternoon    of     15th

April     1989 two spans               of a total length of about 4. 3 metres of
barrier       No.    124A       on plan     1610/64E      collapsed         under    the    crowd

pressure.            The horizontal          rails of part of barriers                    128 and

137 were permanently bent but the barriers remained upright and

effective.               All these three barriers were existing barriers

in 1978, when the firm was appointed.                       None of the new barriers

designed       by    the        firm   either     failed    or    suffered          significant

permanent deformation.



32.     Work        on        construction         of      the        new      barriers         and

maintenance/strengthening of the original barriers was carried

out between June and November 19 79.                       All the existing barriers

were tested prior to the strengthening work in order to define

which needed improving.                   All the improved barriers and the new

barriers      were tested after completion of the works.                                 The firm

carried       out    tests       in    accordance with Appendix                C of the         1976

Guide.



3 3.     In    order       to     carry    out    the    tests     we       designed      and    had

constructed at our own expense a testing "rig".                                  A photograph

of the rig will               be found at page .                 Our rig incorporates              a

system of pin joints to ensure that the imposed load is spread

reasonably          uniformally         along     the    barrier       rail.             This     is

important because without such a system the middle of the rail,

under     load,      will        deflect    (move       away)    horizontally            with    the

result that the major load is then taken up by the part of the

rail     closest to the stanchions where of course the ability of

the      barrier         to     resist     pressure        is    at     its     greatest.

Misleading          results       would    then    be    obtained,       which      is    not    the

case with our rig.
34.     During the course of testing we had been liaising with the

Building Surveyors Department of SCC, as the appropriate member

of    the     working        party     (see    for     example      our    letter    of     19th

December 1979 - page 59).



35.     On 28th January 1980 my firm prepared a final report with

regard       to testing        (pages       60-63).     Under paragraph           (b) of the

section       headed        "Crush    Barriers"        - page       61)   we   describe      the

result       of tests        carried    out to the existing barriers                    and the

works    of    repair/maintenance which had been implemented.                                 We

also    record        that    all    the     strengthened       barriers       had   been    re­

tested satisfactorily as also had been the new barriers.                                      We

did    not    re-test        those     barriers       which   had    already passed          the

initial tests.                In this context I refer to the test as being

that applicable to Class A barriers.



36.     S. Y. C. C.    indicated that they wished to have                       l/5th of the

total       number     of    crush     barriers       throughout      the      ground     tested

each year so that each individual barrier should be tested once

every 5 years.                 On    15th July 1980 my firm wrote to S. Y. C. C.

(pages       64-65)     to    indicate        that it would be            easier to test        a

block of barriers constituting l/5th of the total number at the

ground rather than to do so on a more random basis.                                       We had

previously       discussed           this    proposal    with Mr.         Sheriff    of     SCC's

Building Surveyors              Department       (a member of the working party)

and he       agreed.           S. Y. C. C.    agreed;     see    their letter of             18th

July 1980       (page 66).
37.     Within      the    relevant        5 year    cycle,       indeed after       3 years,

the barriers in the West Terrace were tested again in 1983.                                  I

refer to the firm's report dated 29th June 1983 to Mr.                                Sheriff

(pages 95-96).



38.     I should explain at this point that with the installation

of    new barriers         in all terraces within the ground,                        the firm

carried       out    a process       of re-numbering           of barriers       in January

1980    as    recorded        on    our drawing       No.     1610/64E.        All    reports

thereafter,         including that of             29th June        1983 refer to the new

numbering.            I would also mention that the firm no longer has

copies    of the detailed Record Sheets in respect of the testing

of the individual barriers in 1983.                          It will be seen,        however,

from the last paragraph of our letter of 29th June 1983 to Mr.

Sheriff that these were sent to him at the time.



39.     Again in accordance with the 5 year cycle,                         the barriers in

the West Terrace were                tested in       1988.        As part of the       firm's

own checking procedure,                   it so happens       that just beforehand we

arranged       for    an     independent      Company,        Sheffield     Testing      Works

Limited,       to check the calibration of our rig.



40.     The    calibration          was    carried     out    on    8th July     1988.      The

Certificate           dated        15th    July     1988     and     the   record      of   the

calibration tests             are to be found at pages                195-197.         It will

be     seen    that    the    gauges       were     shown    to    be working     correctly.

The rig was then used to test the barriers on all terraces                                   at

the west end of the ground.                         The individual test records are

at pages        198-205.              We    reported to the Club,            on 2nd August
1988    (pages        206-208).                    All     barriers       in       the   central         pens

including that which failed and those which deformed slightly

on    15th    April        1989,       met       the     requirements          of    the     1986    Guide

(which as I have indicated remain unaltered from those of the

1976 Guide).



PERIMETER AND RADIAL FENCES.

(a) Perimeter Fences

41.     The    perimeter              fences      were     already       in     position       when       the

firm was       first        instructed            in     1978.     I am not sure when they

were     erected,           butit       was       probably        soon         after          the    Ibrox

disaster.            The    fences          are    at    the     east    and west           ends    of    the

ground       only.         There       are       no perimeter           fences      in   front      of the

north    or     south        stand,          which       have     relatively          low     reinforced

concrete walls.



42.     By the       provisions             of    paragraph         7. 9. 3 of the 1976 Guide,

because       spectators                 could lean            on the     perimeter fences,               we

deemed        them     to        be      crush barriers            and        so     they     had to       be

strengthened.               The       perimeter          fence    at     the    front       of the west

terrace was           a vertical            wire mesh fence about 2.7 metres high.

It was        strengthened             in    1979       both by the provision of bracing

against the existing perimeter concrete wall and the anchoring

of the wall itself with inclined steel stays fixed to concrete

block foundations.                     This work was required and approved by the

working        party        as    set       out     in    the     list     of       matters    requiring

attention prepared                    in June          1979 by    S. Y. C. C.        at paragraph          G. 1

 (page 45).
43.    At     some        later        date     the        Club    arranged         for     cranked

extensions        to     be    fitted        onto    the    top   of   the perimeter          fence

leaning      towards          the    spectators        at    an   angle   of    45*       with    the

steel mesh cut so as to leave spikes sticking out of the top.

The firm was not asked to advise on this change and we were not

involved in its design or installation.                             I believe that it was

installed         at     the        request     of     the    Police,     but        I     have    no

(b) Radial Fences

44.    By the       early       1980's it was becoming a common practice to

try to separate visiting supporters                           and home supporters.                The

Club were         keen      for such a separation and I believe that such

view was shared fully by the Police.                               I wrote to S. Y. C. C.          on

2nd September            1981       (pages    69-70)       to say that I had been asked

by    the    Club      to       arrange       for     the installation         of    two     radial

fences in the west terrace.                         These two     fences are marked 1 and

2 on plan 8945/1A.                   The relevant provisions in the 1976 Guide

are found at paragraph 7. 6.



45.     There were advantages perceived by the Club in installing

radial      fences.           It     meant that they            could have     both home           and

visiting supporters                 in the west terrace but that they could be

segregated.            It would also assist the Police in crowd control.

As indicated           in my letter to S. Y. C. C.                dated 2nd September 1981

(page       69)   gates        were    proposed        at the      rear   of    each       fence    to

allow       access       for        policing        during      matches   as        well     as    for

maintenance.             I pointed out in the letter that the gates would

be left open,            but fastened back,                to connect the areas during a
game if adjacent areas were to be occupied by supporters of the

same    team.          Approval          for the installation of the two radial

fences was given by S. Y. C. C. in their letter of 14th September

1981    (pages 76-77).              The approval was subject to the condition

(paragraph       I.e.    at page 76) that the gates at the rear of the

fences should be under Police control.



46.     The     installation             work    was    carried        out   by     a    firm     of

Contractors,           Blessvale,         in    October        and    November      1981.         In

places the crush barriers passed through the radial fences and

there was        discussion between Mr Strange                        and Mr England           about

this,    as recorded in the memorandum of 4th November 1981                                    (page

79).      There        was    further          discussion       between      them   about        the

relevant barriers             on 13th November 1981                  (page 81).     The Police

wanted    those        barriers      which       passed through the            radial       fences

removed       because        otherwise         spectators       might use     them to          climb

over     the    radial        fences.           Neither       the    Club,   nor    Mr    Strange

wished the barriers                to be removed because to do so might have

affected safety.              If the relevant barriers had been removed,                          an

uninterrupted           "channel"          would       have     been     created        along    the

radial    fence from the top of the terrace down to the perimeter

fence.         Also,    spectators         tend to congregate at the top of the

west terrace           rather than at the bottom by the perimeter fence

because        their view will             not be obscured by the small mesh of

the     perimeter.            It    was     agreed       in    the     discussions        on     13th

November        1981    that       the    barriers      would       remain in position            for

the next match to see what happened.
47.     The next discussion between Mr Strange and Mr England took

place following the match on 17th November 1981                                      (page 82).          The

Chief       Constable            had     seen     the       barriers        in    position        and    was

content       that         they        should     remain        because          there   had      been    no

problems          at   the       match.          It    was,     therefore,          agreed      that     the

barriers      would          remain       in position passing through the                          radial

fences as they are today.



48.     I    wrote          to     S. Y. C. C.    on     14th       December        1981       (page     83)

updating          them      on    progress        regarding          the     installation          of    the

radial       fences         and     security          gates.        S. Y. C. C.     replied       on    20th

January      1982          (pages      84-85).        That letter recorded doubts still

being voiced by the Police concerning the crush barriers which

passed       through             the    radial        fences.           I    therefore          wrote     to

S. Y. C. C. on 26th January 1982 (pages 86-88) with my views as to

why I felt that the relevant barriers should not be terminated

short of the radial fence.                        I pointed out the aspects of safety

and segregation which were involved and felt that what had been

done        was        a    "reas o n a b l e         compromise            between       the     various

interests".                These matters          were discussed at a meeting of the

working party held on 4th February 1982                                  (pages 89-91).             It was

agreed       at    that          meeting    that       it     was   preferable           from a safety

point of view to retain the crush barriers which passed through

the radial fences.



49.     The installation of two further radial fences in the west

terrace       were          considered           in     1985.        These        were     part    of    the

reorganisation               of     the west          terrace which          I shall       refer to in
more     detail          later      in     my statement.                       For the moment,        I shall

concentrate on the radial fences.



50.    I wrote to the Club on 2nd April 1985 enclosing the firm's

drawing No              6705/2 which provided for one further radial fence

adjacent           to       one    of    the        existing         radial        fences     to    create      an

obvious        corridor of               "no        mans'          land"        (pages 107-108).          (This

further        fence          is    numbered             3    on     drawing        No.    8945/1A).           The

drawing was forwarded to S. Y. C. C. on 9th April 1985 (pages 109-

110)     with           a    request          that           the     working        party     consider         the

proposals           at       an early           date.                A    copy      of the    drawing       was

forwarded by the Club to the Police.                                      The Police response was to

suggest        a    central             fence       to   divide          the     middle      section of the

west terrace,                rather than to create the "no mans land".                                      This

is recorded in my letter to the Club of 19th April                                                 1985   (pages

113-115).               There       were       various         discussions           between Mr Strange

and    Mr      Chester             concerning            the       location         of a    further       radial

fence as recorded in the memoranda of 20th April                                              1985 and 25th

April        1985       (pages          116-117).



51.      S. Y. C. C.         provided           their         comments          in their letter of             2nd

May     1985        (pages         123-125).             The Police suggestion of a radial

fence to separate the central area of the terrace was accepted,

but      a     different                location             for the           fourth radial        fence      was

suggested.                  There       was     further            correspondence            and    discussion

concerning              the       location          of       these       fences     during     May    and      June

 1985.        On 13th June 1985 I met Chief Superintendent Moseley and

Councillor              Smith       (who        I    believe             was    deputy     chairman       of    the

 Police       Committee             at that          time)         to discuss         the     further radial
fences.          The outcome of this meeting was recorded in my letter

of     17th      June      1985       to     the     Club       (pages     138-139).             Chief

Superintendent             Moseley         was     favourably        disposed          towards       the

creation of a "corridor"                    of "no mans'          land" with a gate to the

pitch,      following the experience of his                         officers at the recent

match between the Club and Liverpool F. C.                                The corridor would

provide       an    easy       access      for the        Police to the pens                on either

side,    via the gates at the rear of the radial fences.                                      I wrote

to    the    Police       on    25th       June    1985     about    these proposals                (page

142).         Mr    Strange         then     received       a   telephone        call        from    the

Police on 27th June 1985                    (page 144) in which there was further

discussion          about       the     radial      fences       necessary       to     create       the

corridor "no mans'              land"       and also a central radial fence in the

west     terrace.               I     added a      manuscript        note       to    Mr Strange's

memorandum of the telephone call agreeing that a central fence

should      be     installed         for the       time being,        provided that it did

not     make       the     packing          of     spectators in          the        west     terrace

"impossible".



52.     Application            for     planning          consent was      made by        a    letter

dated       5th July       1985       (pages       145-148).        Detailed drawings               were

submitted to S. Y. C. C.                on 25th July 1985             (pages         153-154).        The

relevant         drawings       are     numbered         6705/6     and   17.        The proposals

were     agreed      by          S. Y. C. C. in     their       letter     of    30th July          1985

(pages       155-156),           subject to         the     addition of         extra gates.           I

wrote to S. Y. C. C.on 1st August 1985 (pages                              157-158) to clarify

the position            regarding the             extra     gates    because         I was     unclear

what SYCC required.                 There was a meeting of the Working                        Party at

the     ground       on     7th August            1985    (pages 160-162)            which     amongst
other matters discussed the extra gates.                                The positions of the

extra gates were duly clarified and agreed and I confirmed the

position to the Club in my letter dated 15th August 1985 (pages

163-165).          The       two        extra    radial        fences      were    subsequently

installed that summer.



(c )    Gates

53.     There are seven gates                   through the perimeter fence of the

West Terrace.            These are shown on drawing 11424/2.                             When the

firm was appointed Nos.                  1, 2, 4 and 6 were certainly already in

place and have not been modified in the meantime other than by

the addition of a quick release bolt so as to ensure that the

gates    could be opened quickly and easily in emergency even if

the gate is subjected to the same pressure as a crush barrier.

(This    type     of    bolt       is    fitted       to    all   gates     in    the   perimeter

fence at this ground).



54.     We also believe that No.                  5 is also an original gate                  (pre-

1978) but when the access corridor was created by installing an

additional radial fence in 1985,                       steps were added on the inside

to provide easier access for the Police.



55.     The origin of gate 7 is not known.                              It is not recorded as

being in place in our drawings of the ground in 1978.                                     We have

not    been     able    to    find       in     our    files      any    record    of    it   being

constructed under our control.                         There is a possibility that it

has    been     there    since          before    we       became   the    Club's       consulting

engineers,       but we think it more likely that it was constructed

on the Club's instructions sometime between 1980 and 1988.                                       We
know that it was in place in 1988,                             because when we ordered the

quick release bolts for the gates in 1988                                   (to which I refer in

paragraph          61)   it was       discovered that we had ordered one less

than was required.                   An extra one had to be made.



56.     The    gate      number          3 was       constructed under             our     control       in

1985.          It was      specifically requested by the Police,                                and was

approved by the licensing authority before installation.                                                 It

was    made    to match gate No.                    4, which was in the other half of

the old central pen.



57.     The width of each of the gateways is as follows: -



Gate No.                      1          2           3         4        5          6        7

58.     The width          of     gates        in the perimeter fences                  had been the

subject       of     discussion           on       various     occasions        between      1978        and

1985.         The Police and the fire service both have an interest

in this matter.                   From the Police point of view,                       they are most

likely        to    need      the     gates         to   get   onto     the     terrace      to     quell

unruly behaviour.                   Various senior officers have said over the

years    that the gates should not be too wide because that would

make    it easy for troublemakers                        to spill out onto the pitch if

the Police          open the          gate to get into the terrace.                             The fire

service are naturally mindful of the possibility that the gates

may     have       to    be       used       for    evacuation         of    the       terrace      in    an
emergency.                Hence,      at Bramall            Lane      ground where          there    is    a

stand part           of which         has    some         timber in its         construction,          the

gates        from       the    terrace       in      front      have     been    made       wider    than

normal,       so as to assist rapid evacuation of spectators onto the

pitch.



59.     It    should          be   remembered that              at all        relevant      times,     the

1976     Guide,         which      contains          no    recommendation         as     to width         of

gates        in    perimeter         fences,         was       in    force.        The      1986    Guide

suggests          at paragraph         215 that such gates should be a minimum

of 1100mm wide.                    The size of the gates in the perimeter fence

at Hillsborough was                  of course approved by the Working Party.

As    indicated,          the Police in particular have said that they do

not     want        gates      which      are     too       wide      because     of     the    risk      of

spectators           rushing onto the pitch at times when the gates may

be    opened        by    the      Police       to    gain      access     to    the    terraces       for

crowd        control      purposes.               All      gates have been discussed with

the     Police          and    Fire    Service            at    least     once    a    year.           The

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club has always willingly provided

whatever gates have been requested by the licensing authority.

We      as        the     Club's       engineers               have     prepared       drawings           and

specifications                to give what we understood was being requested,

and     the        drawings        have     then      been          submitted    to    the     licensing

authority.                The drawings have been considered by the working

party,            including         Police        and      Fire       Service,        and    have      been

approved.                The Club have then had the gates                         constructed,            and

installed under our supervision.
60.     Although the gates are not marked, they are very obvious.

They cannot be operated from the inside.                       They are designed to

be under the control of the Police.                  Therefore, they can only be

operated from the pitch side.                 Once the gate has been opened by

the Police its position is obvious.



61.     I personally had a concern about the ability to open the

gates with pressure of spectators against them (they originally

had simple bolts).           Of my own initiative in 1987 I designed a

"quick    release       mechanism".     The       design     can    be   seen    from the

drawings prepared by Mr Strange in August 1987 (pages 190-191).

This    design was       forwarded      to    SCC    on    19th August       1987     (page

189).      They    replied      on   15th October          1987    suggesting        that    a

prototype be manufactured and fitted to one of the gates                                   for

testing purposes.          This was done and a meeting was held on 25th

February       1988 with SCC and the Police to see the prototype in

operation.        The    prototype was            approved     and installed in all

gates    on the     perimeter        fence.        We   have    recently     tested        the

opening     of    gate    No.    3 with       a    test    load    applied      to    it    of

6kN/metre.        It could be opened with the arm extended so as not

to be in line with the gate when it suddenly opened.



TUNNEL RAMP TO WES T TERRACES



62.     I understand that it has been pointed out by Counsel for

the Inquiry that part of the floor of the tunnel,                               leading to

the     West    Terraces    slopes     downwards          towards    the   pitch      at    an

inclination which is greater than 1 in 10 the figures mentioned
in paragraph 87 of the 1986 Guide (formerly paragraph 9.7.2 of

the 1976 Guide).



63.    The    tunnel    and     ramp were     already in existence when the

firm    was    commissioned        by     theClub   in   1978   to    assist   in

obtaining      the     Safety    Certificate.            The    tunnel   had   been

constructed as part of the West Stand development in time for

the World Cup games in 1966.



64.    The firm has carried out a survey of the levels within the

tunnel.        These are shown on the attached drawing 11424/3.                     It

will be seen that on entering the tunnel from the direction of

the turnstiles,        there is an upward slope for about 4m.                  There

is then a smooth transition leading to a downward slope which

gradually increases to about 1 in 12 at 12%m into the tunnel,

about     1 in 8 at      14*m,        and finally at about      1 in 6    for a 3m

length    between      16 and      19m.       The   ramp then levels out to a

quite gentle inclination where it passes between the gates at

the entrance to the terrace.                 The ramp is steeper than 1 in 10

over a length of about 6m.



65.     Although I had been very heavily involved in safety work

in     football      grounds     in     1970-72,    including   the    Hillsborough

ground,       the invitation to help the Club in 1978 was the first

occasion on which I had used the 1976 Guide.                    In studying it I

made manuscript notes of important points.                      These notes were

placed on file.            Attached at page 6(A) is a photocopy of one

of the two sheets             of notes which I wrote.            It will be seen
that the recommendation concerning slope of ramps is one of the

points in the 1976 Guide about which I made a special note.



66.    On   3rd November         1979      as     evidenced in my letter of 27th

October      1978    (page      6(B))       I    met    the    Chairman    of     the    Club,

Mr. McGee to discuss our appointment.                          I also made a detailed

inspection of the ground.                       Amongst the many matters which I

remarked was the part                of the ramp which had a slope of more

than 1 in 10.             It was noticeable that instead of creating a

constant incline, which would have had a slope of about one in

15. 4m, the designer had chosen to align the floor of the tunnel

so that      there was         an upward slope to              a hump,     followed by a

downward slope which was therefore steeper than would have been

necessary without the hump.



67.    At that meeting I was given a list of drawings of various

parts of the ground.                 This list had been provided in September

1977 by Husband & Co.                the Club's previous consulting engineers

at    the   request       of   Mr.    R.    Whitehead         a director of the          Club,

(pages      6(C)    to    6(K)).            It will      be    seen that        the   list    of

drawings      refers      almost exclusively to the North stand,                        and to

the    West    stand       including            the    terrace    and     the    North    West

terrace,      all    of    which      had       been   designed by Husband              & Co.

There are 67 drawings referring to the West terrace and stand,

and the North West corner stand.                          Those of which I requested

copies      were    ticked,          and    were       included    in     the    list     which

accompanied my letter to Mr.                      England dated 6th November                 1978

 (pages 6(H) and (M)).
68.     One of the drawings for which I asked was number 24A which

is entitled ' Section Through Access Tunnel' .                             I felt that the

ramp in the tunnel needed investigation.



69.     I recall that the Fire Service representatives also noted

the slope in the tunnel              floor at an early date.                     I remember

having a discussion with them during a walk round the ground in

one of the early meetings.                      It is possible this was on the

occasion of the very first meeting of the Working Party with

the Club representatives at the ground on 13th December,                                  1978.

The Fire Service were represented at that meeting,                             according to

a note on our file               (page 9(A))         by Mr.     B.   Dunstan and Mr.         B.

Jones.      There are no minutes of this meeting on our file, and

I     believe   it   was    mainly       for    the       purpose     of    inspecting      the

ground and expressing preliminary views regarding safety works.

However,    there were various subsequent meetings over the four

months December 1978 to April 1979, with senior members of the

Fire Service at the ground,                during which we inspected the West

stand     and the tunnel.                Some of these were                meetings     of the

Working     Party,         and    some     specially            arranged       meetings     for

detailed discussions with the Fire Service,                          and on one occasion

the     Building     Surveyors       Department            of    S. Y. C. C.   as   well,     to

discuss any improvements which either we or they felt might be

needed.         The various meetings and inspections at the ground at

which the Fire Service were represented were as follows: -

70.    At one of the meetings listed above, but I cannot specify

which,      I     recall     discussing          with       the     Working    Party,   three

matters      involving       ramps.             In    chronological          order we   first

discussed the ramp through the tunnel to the West terrace.                                     We

then discussed desirability of adjusting the exit from the Kop

through      a    tunnel     at    the     North      East    corner       of the    ground.

Third,      we discussed changes to the existing ramp forming part

of    the    exit     from   the    back        of    the    Kop.          These   latter    two

matters         are   mentioned       at    various         times     in    the    Minutes     of


                                            -    29   -
meetings,       but because the general            feeling was that no change

was to be made to the ramp in the West terrace tunnel,                            it is

not minuted.             Generally,      it was    only the respects           in which

action was required which were recorded.



71.    Since     1979,     the    complete    Working         Party    consisting    of

experienced          senior     representatives         of    the    various    parties

involved has toured the ground on many occasions.                            During the

time   S. Y. C. C.    were the licensing authority,                 these inspections

were made systematically twice per year.                       Since SCC have been

the Licensing authority,             the inspections have been reduced to

one per year.           So far as I know, during these ten years, there

has    never     been    any     suggestion       by    any   member    of     theWorking

Party,    or    anyone     else    for that matter that the ramp in the

tunnel    should be altered,             even if this were to be reasonably

practicable.



72.    In my     view there is a lack             of clarity in the            1976and 1986

Guides.          Neither differentiates            between a ramp in which the

"heavy crowd flow" is downhill,               and one in which it is uphill.

The Guides       are     clearly meant to cover only the case in which

the spectators           have       to     go downhill,        tightly packed,      at the end

of a match.              They       acknowledgethat the period of "greatest"

(the     1976    Guide)       and "great" (the         1986 Guide)      risk to crowd

safety at football grounds is at the time of leaving.                            That is

the normal situation with spectators descending from stands or

embankments       to     ground level.         Exactly the opposite position

applies in the           case       of     the rampthrough the tunnel of the West

stand.

                                          - 30 -
7 3.    When   spectators         leave    the    West terrace,    there     will    be

congestion and jostling as they converge on the space between

the     two    wing      walls at    the     start    of   the    tunnel.           The

constricting of the crowd flow at the start of an exit route is

in line with the thinking in the 1976 Green Guide,                          paragraph

6. 3,    and the      1986 Guide,     paragraph 50.          Once the spectators

have entered the parallel               sided tunnel,      the    flow will settle

down to a steady rate.               There is a gentle upward slope for a

distance of about 4m between the wing walls and then the tunnel

walls,     before the main ramp is reached.                 When the spectators

are going up the ramp to leave the ground they will be safer

than if they were walking downhill.                   It is to be expected that

if the ramp had a downward slope and someone tripped,                       it would

be very difficult for the people immediately behind to stop to

give     him   time    to    recover.            Furthermore,     the   people   even

further behind have a downhill momentum which will be difficult

to resist.



74.     If the same density of spectators were leaving the ground

along a route of the same width,                 but with no slope,      conditions

would be reasonably safe.                 If someone trips, it will be easier

for the people behind to slow down or stop momentorily to let

him recover.           But if the same density of spectators were going

along a route          of the same width,          but with an upward        slope as

here,     conditions     are likely        to be safer still.            If someone

falls,     the person immediately behind will               find it much easier

to     stop,   and    also   to   bring     to   a halt the people who are a

little further behind.
75   .   In my view it would                probably be safer to progress                  in a

heavy crowd of people up a 1 in 6 slope, than to be in the same

crowd going down a 1 in 10 slope.



76.      Spectators entering rather than leaving the West terrace,

do, of course, have to progress down the slope which over about

a 3m length is at 1 in 6, and for a further 3m is about 1 in 8.

But the rate at which spectators enter the ground is controlled

by the          turnstiles.          The    maximum rate           at which they         can be

expected to enter is perhaps equivalent to filling the ground

in say one hour or rather longer.                           There should be no "heavy

crowd      flow".            They    will    be    fed      down    the    ramp   in     limited

numbers         over    an   extended       period      (contrast         evacuation     of   the

ground in an emergency).                      Individuals,          or little groups           of

people,         are in no danger in passing down a 3m wide ramp which

has a slope of 1 in 6 over a short length.                                If one of them did

trip and fall,           there would be no question of a mass of people

piling on top of him.



77.       Paragraph      88 of the          1986 Guide        (paragraph 9.7.2.           of the

1976 Guide)            says "The maximum gradient acceptable will depend

on the ramp's length,                purpose and usage but a ramp subject to

heavy crowd flow should preferably, not exceed a gradient of 1

j_n      io".          The   Guide    also        brings     into    account      'the    ramp's

length' .           In the present case the total length of ramp which

has a slope of steeper than 1 in 10 is only 6m, and the length

which is steeper than 1 in 8 is only about 3m.

78.     Apart    from these       matters,         in considering whether it was

possible for the ramp to be broken out and replaced with one of

constant       slope,     there    were       structural         considerations.             I

surmised       that     the    consulting          engineer      who    designed      it   had

presumably had a reason for giving it an initial upward slope

when entering          from the    turnstiles.                I do not now have the

drawing ofthe tunnel which was loaned to me in 1979.                                 This and

others were returned to Mr.                  Whitehead under cover of a letter

dated    14th November          1978     (page      6(0)).        I recollect however

that    the     drawing       showed    that       the    ramp   needed      to   avoid    the

foundations of the tunnel walls.                         The rear part of the tunnel

clearly       existed    before        the   West     stand      was   created      in about

1966.         The     brick walls        in the rear half              are   old,    and are

obviously part of an earlier structure, whilst new brick walls

were    constructed in the             front       (terrace)     part of the tunnel.

The foundations of the older walls are at shallow depth so that

the ramp could not be sloped down without chopping off the edge

of the     foundations,         and also having to underpin them.                          This

would    have     been     complicated even hazardous                  to    a degree,      and

expensive.            Questions of difficulty of works and cost did not

however enter the equation,                  from my point of view,               but rather

the fact that any alternative arrangement                          (reversing the slope

or even levelling it) would not have led to greater safety.



79.     For     example,       another       way    to    reduce       the   slope    of    the

steepest 6m length of the ramp would have been to break out the

relevant section and to introduce some steps.                                But in my view

that would have produced a hazardous situation.                                   Indeed both

the 1976 and 1986 Guides say 'The gradient should preferably be
constant and not broken by steps'                       (paragraph 9. 7. 1 of the 1976

Guide and paragraph 87 of the 1986 Guide).



80.     To summarise,           the Guides        should not be misinterpreted.

The guidance regarding the slope of ramps is expressly stated

to    apply    to     ramps      which     have    a     downward    slope   when       being

traversed by a heavy crowd flow, that is at the time of leaving

the     ground      not    when    filling        it.         The    circumstances        are

obviously much safer when the heavy crowd flow is going uphill

as in    the case of the tunnel.                  Bearing inmind the relatively

short    length of ramp which is                  steeper than        1 in   10,    and the

fact     that       when the     ground     is filling up             spectator flow          is

light,    because it is controlled by turnstiles,                        I believe that

the ramp is consistent both with the spirit and the letter of

the Guide.


GENERAL R E A R R A N G E M E N T S AT LEPPINGS LANE END (TURNSTILES. ETC....1



81.     In the summer of 1981 Mr.                 England approached the firm for

a discussion of the entrance arrangements at the Leppings Lane

end of the ground.                 We opened a file on 13th August                      1981.

The arrangements            as they then existed can most easily be seen

 from    a drawing number           6705/1        (page     146)    which     was in      fact

prepared by my firm much later in 1985.                            I should mention that

wall     shown      on    the    drawing     running        from    turnstile      No    23     is

 slightly mis-drawn.               In fact it runs to the column                   (the small

 square)      shown       on the    left    (south)       side of the drawing.                The

 drawing should be read in conjunction with notes prepared by Mr
Strange       in or about August/September                       1981 which describe the

then system in force.



82.     The two sketch drawings numbered 35 63/1/ and 2 prepared in

August       1981    (pages 73-74) show my firm's preliminary ideas for

alternatives              involving         extra     turnstiles          and,     to     varying

degrees,       segregation of crowd once access had been gained via

the turnstiles.



83.     So far as I am aware the initiative for this study came

from the Club, though it is possible that one of the interested

authorities had raised the matter without our knowledge.                                        The

Club were of course interested in crowd control/management in

all    parts        of    the     ground,      not    just   in    the     spectator       areas,

including the areas of access to the turnstiles.                                   Egress from

the ground was also considered.                            Indeed paragraph 6.2 of the

197 6    Guide       says       that     the   period       of    greatest       risk    to    crowd

safety is at the time of leaving the ground.



84.     In     the       event,    the      firm     was    not    asked    to    develop       its

embryonic       schemes         any further in 1981.                   I presume that,          the

Club     did not see the matter as being of priority at that time

This     was    understandable             in my view.            It     must be remembered

that     they       were     carrying       out      extensive      works    to     the       ground

overall        year        by     year      (described       by     me     earlier       in     this

statement).              At the time they were also in                   the Second Division

with     the        consequence          that attendances at             their    home    matches

were smaller than they were after their promotion to the First

Division.                Nor to the best of my own knowledge had there been
any serious       difficulties at matches with regard to ingress to

or egress from the Leppings Lane end of the ground.                                      Neither

in 1981 nor later in 1985 was it ever suggested to me by the

Club or by any other body represented on the working party that

a     scheme     of     rearrangement          was        required        to    alleviate        any

difficulties of that sort.



85.     In     1985,    by    which      time       the     Club         were   in   the      First

Division,        Mr. Chester,           successor          to      Mr.     England       as     Club

Secretary,        wrote      to    me    on        22nd    February         1985     (page       100)

resurrecting           the   question         of    possible         improvements          at    the

Leppings       Lane end.           I do not have any specific recollection

but believe           that   the   letter      followed         a brief mention of the

matter in informal discussions a day or two beforehand.



86.     A meeting was arranged with Mr. Chester on 6th March 1985.

My    staff     prepared      a rudimentary               sketch    showing        the   existing

lay-out        (page 101).         Before the meeting I sketched a possible

alternative lay-out by marking up the sketch as shown at page

102.         A new drawing showing those amendments was prepared for

the purpose of my meeting with Mr. Chester (page 103).                                     At that

meeting I made further manuscript markings on the sketch (page

104).



87.     I then worked up a scheme (drawing 6705/2) two versions of

which appear at pages               105 - 106.               Three copies were sent to

Mr.     Chester under cover of my letter of 2nd April                                1985       (pages

 107-108).             The principles,             as reflected in my letter of 2nd

April 1985 involved the segregation of home and away supporters
not merely within the ground itself,                              but also after access had

been    gained       via       the    turnstiles            (as     indicated,         this      was     of

particular        concern            to    the       Club    and,        as    I    understood         the

position,      the Police).                 Flexibility was               also provided by the

possibility          of   allocating            either a large                or a small         viewing

area to visiting supporters.                          With the separate "channelling"

to the       various       divided parts              of the west stand and terraces

account had to be taken of the need to provide extra lavatories

and refreshment areas.



88.     As will be apparent from our drawing No.                                   6705/2 (page 105)

and drawing No.            6705/1 (the then existing layout)                           (page 146) we

proposed six extra turnstiles.                         Two of the existing turnstiles,

numbered 17 and 18, were to be demolished.                                          By dividing the

remaining sixteen by an additional internal fence incorporating

gates     (one       fence      already          existed)         Nos.     1/6 would        serve      the

north stand,          Nos.      7/12 the north-west terrace and Nos.                               13/16

part    of     the    seated         area       of    the west           stand      (that   stand was

itself       to be divided                into two).              A new bank of turnstiles

(numbered        17/21     on drawing             6705/2)      was proposed to serve the

central area of the terrace with a new wall being constructed

from     the     corner        of     turnstile          No.       16    in    effect       to    make       a

fundamental division between turnstiles 1/16 and the areas into

which they fed on the one hand and the rest of the turnstiles

on the other.              For those turnstiles to the south we suggested

a further three with internal fences which would constrain the

spectators        to      go    up        the   stairs      to the southern half of the

stand seating.                 The remaining turnstiles led to the south-west

terrace.             Each of the areas so created was to have exit gates
of the appropriate width to permit evacuation of the ground in

less than eight minutes.



89.   Under cover of a letter dated 9th April                               1985 drawing No

6705/2     showing       the     proposals        was        sent      to     S. Y. C. C.   for

consideration by the Working Party (pages                           109-110).         It will

be seen    that Mr.      Chester had already supplied a copy of the

drawing    to    the    Police    with    whom         he    had    been     in     discussion

concerning        the    proposals.               This        is     in      line    with    my

understanding that,            of all    the authorities              concerned,        it was

the Police who were most involved because of their particular

interest    in     crowd       management     and           control,        especially      the

segregation of home and away supporters.



90.   On 12th April 1985 Mr Strange had a conversation with Mr.

Chester as recorded in his note which appears at page 111.                                   It

will be seen that the Club              were still considering the question

of the number of turnstiles to be incorporated in the scheme.

On 17th April 1985 Mr Strange had a discussion with

      a senior assistant on Mr. Chester's staff with particular

responsibility for ticket sales.                       Mr Strange's note appears at

page 112.                         suggested that there should be a total

of 34 turnstiles:              a further four to supplement the existing

six serving the north stand,                  an extra two to supplement the

six which we had suggested should serve the area assigned to

home standing supporters,                and a reduction of one in the two

banks of turnstiles to be used by visiting standing supporters,

                wished the turnstiles to be in pairs.




                                         -   38    -
91.     We duly revised the drawing of the proposed scheme.                                            On

19th    April        1985      Mr   Strange         wrote       to    Mr.       Chester        enclosing

drawing No.         6705/3       (pages 113-115).               As will be seen from such

drawing       we    accurately         reflected                                      suggestion      for

numbers of turnstiles,                and we included necessary alterations to

proposed walls and fences to ensure segregation and channelling

of supporters.



92.     On 20th April 1985 Mr Strange had a telephone conversation

with Mr.      Chester who indicated that he was still not satisfied

that    the    number          of proposed          turnstiles            was    right.          He was

still having discussions with his colleagues at the Club (page

116).



93.     On    25th        April        1985         there           was     another        telephone

conversation between Mr Strange and Mr.                                   Chester       (page    117).

By then Mr.          Chester had returned a copy of drawing No.                                   6705/3

with various manuscript markings of his own.                                            We cannot now

find in our files that particular copy.                                         We believe that it

will have been used by our draughtsman,                                                     to revise

the negative of drawing                    6705/3 to produce drawing                       6705/4      (it

will be seen that the signature and date are identical in both

drawings).               In    all probability the marked up copy received

from    Mr.        Chester      was    then         destroyed.                    Mr.    Chester      had

suggested          that       there    should         be       an    area       in      front    of   the

turnstiles          to    be    used       by   visiting            supporters          separate      from

those     areas       leading         to    the      turnstiles           to     be     used    by    home

supporters.          He wished to have gates enclosing this area.                                        He

also proposed four banks                    of three turnstiles                      together with a


                                                -    39    -
gate which he suggested might be used to let spectators into

the    ground     at    all    ticket        matches.         It will     be seen on         Mr

Strange's       note     that       the     latter    wrote        "disaster"      in    square

brackets       against        this    suggestion.                   The   square      brackets

indicate that this was Mr Strange's reaction to that particular

suggestion.          I should also explain that as I am Chairman of the

firm and also Director in overall charge of work done on behalf

of the Club,          Mr Strange's notes of telephone conversations are

all    placed      before      me. They           have the dual       function        both   of

recording what had been discussed and incorporating,                               always in

square brackets,          Mr Strange's comments/views where appropriate

in order        that I shall be aware of these before he                      and I come to

have our        own           discussions. In the circumstances Mr                      Strange

did    not      indicate       to     Mr.     Chester       his    personal     view of      the

proposal        that     a gate       should be used to permit                entry to the

ground for all-ticket matches.                        If anybody was to communicate

those     views,       then    it was        for me to        do so.          Moreover,      the

moment was not appropriate because we were still working on our

proposals.           Anyway we knew that once a scheme had been agreed

in principle with the Club it would have to be submitted to the

Working Party,          a process which indeed we had already begun,                          as

I     have    indicated,       on9th April           1985     by    sending     our     drawing

6705/2 to S. W. C. C.



94.     Following the conversation with Mr. Chester on 25th April

 1985 we sent to him new drawing No.                         6705/4 on 26th April            1985

 (pages       118-119).          On    1st May 1985 Mr. Chester telephoned to

ask     for    our     "guess"       of     the    likely    cost    of   implementing       the

scheme in its then form (page 120).                               This was for the purpose
of a meeting of the Club Board of Directors due to take place

the    next       day.            On    the     following    day,     2nd       May    1985,    we

delivered our letter (pages 121-122) with our broad estimate.

This was          £66, 600.     in respect of the proposals                    for changes to

turnstiles,            fences     and        gates   appearing       on    drawing        6705/4

(including the proposed radial fence on the west terrace), such

figure       to    include       professional        fees;          and    £60, 700. ,     again

including         professional          fees,    for the     necessary          consequential

works to lavatories and refreshment areas under the west                                  stand.

We also mentioned certain other                      separate works.             However,      in

relation to the re-organisation scheme the total cost estimate

was £127, 300.



95.     On    2nd May         1985     S. Y. C. C.   confirmed      (pages      123-125)       that

our    earlier           proposals       submitted      to    them        in    the     form    of

drawing 6705/2,             which by now had been overtaken, was generally

acceptable to the working party subject to an additional gate

being provided between turnstile No.                         16 and the wall proposed

to    abut        it   as     shown     on    drawing    6705/2.          Requirements          for

minimum widths of gates in the areas outside the stadium itself

were    also indicated,               I understand at the request of the Fire

Service.            The relevant measurements are shown in manuscript on

the copy of drawing 6705/2 which S. Y. C. C.                         returned to us

(page        125).       Other    conditions         were    also     imposed          concerning

radial       fences       and extra gates in the perimeter fence                         (aspects

with which I have dealt elsewhere in this statement).



96.     At    this       time    we     were    involved     in   discussions           with    the

Police primarily concerning the radial fences.                                        We were due
to have a meeting with them on 8th May 1985.                                 On the previous

day,    however,            we       received a telephone           callfrom Mr. Chester

(page    120)        to indicate            that the Club's         Board     felt unable to

expend £120,000.                on the general scheme as it was then proposed.



97.     On     13th       May    1985       Mr.   Chester wrote          to me asking for a

meeting        at    Hillsborough             "to    consider      the    full    implications,

operations and costings" of the proposed scheme.                                   It should be

remembered that this was the Monday following the Saturday on

which     the       fire        at    Bradford       City   Football       ground      had    taken

place.        I duly met Mr. Chester on Friday 17th May 1985.                                 It is

my     recollection             of    such meeting that Mr.               Chester voiced the

concern of the Club's Board at the likely cost of the proposed

scheme.             He      was       looking for areas       where         savings     might be

effected.            He said that the scheme needed to be considerably

simplified,              also that          the existing turnstiles               (twenty-three)

were     adequate               in    number, but he        requested        that      two    of the

turnstiles which served the west stand should be re-allocated

to     the north stand.



98.      At     this                 juncture it is         appropriate           to    give      my

understanding of the Club's position with regard to the cost of

 ground improvements.                       I believe that the Club had built up a

 reserve        for        the       proposed       works    of     re-arrangement           at   the

 Leppings Lane end and for other major works in the ground.                                       The

 fire     at    Bradford             Football       Club    took    place    as    indicated       on

 Saturday       11th May 1985.                    The south stand at Hillsborough had

 timber        decking.               The     Club    therefore          realised,     after      the

 Bradford fire,             that works would have to be carried out to the
south stand.               In the event the decking had to be covered with

continuous          steel    sheets      with non-slip surfaces                 at a cost of

£59,280       exclusive          of   professional         fees.      This        was     a    new

commitment which, of course, had to be and was met promptly.



99.     Moreover,         during that 1984/85 season the firm had reason

to inspect          the    cantilever roof of the south stand which was

leaking.           When some of the roof sheeting had been removed we

found that the main bottom chord steel member of the cantilever

trusses were badly rusted.                    There had been significant loss of

metal.         It    was     essential        in   the    interests        of    safety       that

removal       of the rust and repainting be carried out during the

Summer        of     1985.              The   cost       was    £67, 900        exclusive       of

professional fees.               Curing of the leaks cost another £12,640.



100. After the meeting with Mr. Chester on 13th May 1985, I was

away for a few days and was unable therefore to inform

Mr     Strange      of    what    Mr.    Chester     had       discussed with           me.     Mr

Strange's note of a telephone conversation with Mr. Chester on

22nd May 1985             (page 132) refers.              The writing at the foot of

the note is mine, indicating to Mr Strange that he and I should

set aside time for discussion on 28th May 1985.



101.     By 4th June 1985 we had prepared a                          revised schemeinline

with     Mr    Chester's         requests.         The     scheme    is     illustrated         in

drawings       numbered respectively               6705/5 and 6705/8A             (pages      135-

136)     which were sent to the Club under cover of ourletter                                   of

that     date (page 133-134).
102.    The difference between the two drawings is merely that in

drawing     6705/5        existing    turnstiles             Nos.   17        and   18     were   to

remain but       the alternative            in drawing 6705/8A involved their

removal and the realignment of the fence which at that time ran

from the     corner of turnstile                 No.       18 to the      iron gates which

formed the boundary of Hillsborough itself adjoining Leppings

Lane.       As my firm's letter of 4th June 1985 indicates, we had

discerned        a    potential      "pinch        point"       when          spectators      were

leaving the ground.                Were turnstiles Nos.                  17 and 18 and the

fence to remain in position the scheme in drawing 6705/5 would

provide     inadequate        space     for       spectators             leaving      the     south

stand,    the    south west        terrace and the west stand.                            The exit

time would have been in excess of the eight minutes recommended

by the 1976 Guide.             The revised scheme in drawing 6705/8A gave

a greater width            (an extra iron gateway) for spectators leaving

the ground at that point.               We also proposed that the realigned

fence should be constructed from metal sheets so that home and

visiting supporters would be unable to see each other as they

queued to enter the ground.



103.     On the 12th June 1985 Mr. Chester of the Club acknowledged

our      letter        and   the     accompanying               drawings            showing       the

alternative schemes.                 He was due to be away until 19th June

 1985 and he asked me to liaise with the Police and/or S. Y. C. C.

 (page    137)       to   ascertain    their           views.            We    were      uncertain,

however,     which scheme he wished us to put forward.                                      On 17th

June      1985       Mr Strange      rang                           of    the       Club    seeking

 clarification but           she was        unable to help               (page      140).         Upon

 Mr. Chester's return he informed us that the Club preferred the


                                             -   44    -
scheme        shown    on        drawing       No.     6705/8A.              Because     of   the

particular        interest           of       the     Police      in    any     proposed      re­

organisation,          on    25th       June     1985 we        submitted      a copy    of our

drawing No.       6705/8A to them requesting comments                           (page 142).

Approval was given orally by Inspector Calvert in a telephone

conversation with Mr.               Strange on 27th June 1985.                         We sent a

full set of drawings to Mr.                      Chester with our letter dated 8th

July 1985       (page 151) and told him of the oral approval of the

Police.



104. On 5th July 1985 we had submitted a Planning Application

for the scheme to SCC as the Local Planning Authority                                     (pages

145-148).                   On    the     same       day   we    had    also    submitted      an

Application for Building Regulation approval to the Director of

Design and Building Services of SCC.



105.     At     that    stage       the        firm    were      involved      in   urgent    and

intensive work in the preparation of detailed working drawings

both     to    place    before          the    working      party      and    for use     by the

contractors who were to carry out the work.                                  The Applications

for     Planning        Permission             and     Building        Regulation       approval

required only the submission of outline drawings.                                       S. Y. C. C.

were,     however,      aware of our Application as will be seen from

their letter to us of 18th July 1985 (page 152).                                    By 25th July

198 5 we had prepared the necessary detailed drawings which we

submitted to S. Y. C. C.                under cover of our letter of that date

 (pages       153-154).                 Approval       of the working party             given at

their     meeting       on       29th     July       1985 and was       intimated to us          in

S. Y. C. C's letter of 30th July 1985 (pages 155-156) to which I
have    already       referred        in detail     in connection with             fences.

Paragraph       (b)     of    that      letter     refers       specifically           to    some

aspects of the proposals in connection with the turnstiles,                                   and

to realignment of hand railing.



106. There       followed         a   meeting     of     the    working        party    at    the

ground on 7th August 1985 at which the Deputy Secretary of the

Club and I were present.                       Minutes      are to be found at pages

160-162.              The    working       party       were     able      to    witness           the

construction of the new works which were being carried out to a

very tight programme so as to have them completed by the start

of the next season later in August.                          They were duly completed

in time.



107. At a meeting of the working party on 22nd January                                       1986,

after    more     than       half      a   season      of      experience,       the        Police

reported        that        the       scheme     for     the        revised      segregation

arrangements          at the Leppings           Lane end "worked well on by far

the majority of occasions"                 (page 173).




TF.STS TO C R U S H B&RRTF.RS FOLLOWING THE EVENTS OF 15TH APRIL 1989



108. I was not at the match on 15th April 1989.                                  I arrived at

the     ground    at        approximately        4. 40      p. m.   and    carried          out     an

inspection        in    the       immediate      aftermath.               With    the       Club s

approval the firm did tests on some of the crush barriers the

next day,        Sunday      16th April.          The crush barrier of which two

spans collapsed and those of which one length of the horizontal
rail    had visibly deformed,               had not been designed by my firm,

but    were    original       barriers      (probably           from   1965      or earlier).

The radial fences and perimeter fence were all intact although

there    was       some    deformation       of    the      framing of the            perimeter

fence.         I    understand       that    parts         of   the    wire      mesh    on   the

perimeter fence were cut away by spectators and/or the rescue

services on 15th April in order to gain access to the terracing

and to allow spectators to escape onto the pitch.



109.    The two barriers which were permanently deformed on 15th

April Nos.         128 and 137 were tested in turn.                        In each case the

load was applied in increments of one-quarter of the test load

until    the test load of 6kN/metre specified in the 1986 Guide

was     reached.             The   forward        deflection          of   the    barrier     was

measured.            It was found to be behaving elastically,                           with the

deflection increasing proportionally to the applied load.                                     The

deflection was within the range expected for a barrier of this

type which is in good condition.                           When the load was released,

the deflection of the barrier was fully recovered.                                    It should

be noted that some permanent deflection is allowed by the 1986

Guide     (the recovery only needs to be 75% - see Annex C of the

Guide).            The test load was reapplied so as to give the three

cycles of loading,             each of five minutes duration,                     specified in

Annex     C.         Each     time   the    load was            removed,      there     was   full

recovery.



 110. It       was    then    decided       to    determine        the     approximate        load

which had been applied to the barriers during the incident on

 15th April.              It is possible to infer what this load had been

 Dear Sir,                                                              w ^ -‘i‘*i-


 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

 I have now received the detailed comments of all of the disciplines
 represented on the Working Party.

 These have been collated into the attached schedule which, together with
 plans, confirm formally In writing the matters discussed by the Working
 Party with the Club over the se r ie s of meetings held so far and which
 the County Council feel require attention so as to secure reasonable
 safety at the Ground.

 They are, of course, individual requirements on specific matters and are
 additional to the general requirements set out In the specimen form of
 General Safety Certificate forwarded to the Club with my letter of                                [£*. '
 8th December, 1978, and discussed at the meeting held on 13th December,                           U jJ t
 1978.

 After the Club has had the opportunity of considering the schedule, perhaps
 you would let me know which of the requirements you feel will be able to
 be carried out in the close season.

 Should you have any queries, M r. D. Vaughan of my staff (ext. 422) would
 be happy to discuss them with you.

                                           Yours faithfully,

               taken place.

    j.        F ire Extinguishers

              Fire fighting hand appliances are to be installed where indicated by a triangle
          I   on the attached plan. The colour of the triangle determines the type of
              appliance required. (Please see attached legend). It may be that equipment
              is already provided in the building, and the plan shows the final complement
              of appliances.

              Two gallon water extinguishers to be wall mounted so that the handle is
              approximately one m etre from floor level. The 5lb. dry powder extinguishers
              and glass fibre blanket to be wall mounted, the extinguishers being mounted at
              approximately light switch level.

              General Fire Precautions

              1.      All walls and ceilings inside the stands and along escape routes to be
                      c la ss *0* surface spread of flame.

                      the point adjacent to the escape route from the counter area.

              3.      Quantities of waste paper were discovered under the seating in the
                      stand. This should be removed and placed in a satisfactory storage
                      area.

     L.       Training of Safety Stewards and Staff

              To ensure that the Safety Stewards and Staff are conversant with the safety
    P         precautions they w ill be expected to administer, a m eeting should be arranged

                       rectangle containing the letter 'E'.

               2.     If the proposed rewiring of the emergency lighting system is adopted
                       as discussed by Mr. Clough and Divisional Officer Jones then, with the
                       reduced lighting output, it may be necessary to provide a number of
                       illuminated exit boxes.

Emergency Procedure

Emergency procedure notices should be placed at strategic points throughout
the ground.

A ccess for Emergency Vehicles

1.       Adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct
         access can be obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of            *
         the stadium.
                                                                                 ■z»      ■


2.       Ensure that parked vehicles will not obstruct emergency vehicles on
         these access roads.

Public Address System

The existing public address system to be upgraded, with the Police having an
over-ride facility from their Police Room.

Police Facilities

A suitable permanent P olice Room (with facilities as shown on the sketch plan        ✓
marked AA ) to be provided in the 1980 clo se season*

F irst Aid F acilities

(i)      Structure

         The existing facilities are considered to be below an acceptable standard
         and it is suggested the Club consider providing a more permanent
t.       structure which is not likely to require up-grading for a very long tim e.
         The internal finish, particularly of the Treatment area, should be of an
         impervious nature so that it can be ea sily cleaned and rendered fairly
         sterile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by the use of
         tiles or form ica type finish e t c .. . .

(li)     Waiting Area

         The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to m inim ise .
         the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

 (iii)   Treatment A rea

         The Treatment Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
         patients at any one time, and consideration should be given to the needs
         for privacy w i th i n the treatment area, bearing in mind that the three
         patients may w ell be lying on couches.
(iv)     Lighting

         Good lighting is essential and strip lighting would be satisfactory. The
         provision of a power point would also be a basic requirement.

(v)      Water

         A supply of hot and cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
         for drinking. A hand basin and a large Belfast type sink should also
         be provided. The Club might consider whether It would be cheaper in
         the long run to provide stain less steel basins which are not subject to
         chipping.

(vl)     Toilet Requirements

         The Club should provide at least one male and one female toilet, for
         the use of the public, and should consider whether they should provide
         an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

(vll)    Storage

         Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and for two sets of
         wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen. This storage should
         be lockable.

(vlll)   Equipment

         The following is a minimum lis t to provide a basic service:-

         Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
         on space available and/or number of cubicles, if the accommodation Is
         cubicled.



         Two sets of stretcher w heels.
         20 Blankets.
         Six Pillow s.
          One Minute-Man R esuscitator.

(ix)     Telephone F acilities

          A telephone facility would appear to be basic In 1979. This could be
          achieved by an extension from the main switch, or by sharing with
          police.




                                     6.

Dear S ir,
                                                                 2 3 AUG 1979
Safety o f Sports Grounds A ct, 1975                       -....................................................

A s I think you are aw are from the conversations which M r. D. Vaughan o f m y
sta ff has had with you from tim e to tim e, the County Council has always had in
mind that if p ossib le the C ertificate in r e sp e c t o f the Hillsborough Stadium would
be issu ed in Septem ber. T his p o ssib ility was based on the assum ption that the
required works would be coop le ted by that tim e, and a lso the Club's request
that the Stadium be certificated to m axim um capacity by the sta rt o f the 1979/80
Season.

H ow ever, it is obvious that d esp ite a ll the p rogress to date, it will not be possible
for the Club to conp le te in the next few weeks all o f the work s e t out in the
Schedule o f M atters Requiring Attention forwarded with m y le tte r o f 8th June. The
County Council has p articu larly in mind the structural and fire resistan ce works
required to the South Stand, and the O fficer Working P arty is endeavouring to le t
M e s s r s . Eastwood and P a rtn ers have com m ents by 3rd September a s requested
by th eir le tte r dated 10th A ugust.

The County Council would be loath e to is s u e a Certificate in September with a
r e s tr ic te d capacity, and I b e liev e such a step would a lso not be In accordance with
the Club's w ish e s.

With th ese facts In m ind, I think i t would be m ore re a listic to aim to issue the
C ertificate at the beginning o f D ecem b er, and so allow the Club m ore tim e in
which to com plete the required w o rk s. It would a s s i s t If you could le t me know
the Club's program m e for the com pletion o f the required w orks.

An extra copy o f this le t te r is attached f o r your u s e should you wish to p ass it for
com m en t to M e s s r s . Eastwood and P a r tn e r s.

     Dear Sir,

     Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

     As was discussed at the meeting cn 12th Novenber between representatives of
     the Club and the Officer Working Party, the question of the issue of the
     General Safety Certificate and the fee to be charged was put to the County
     Canmittee concerned this morning.

     Subject to the outstanding points being satisfactorily resolved, the
     Committee has approved of the issue of the Certificate and has recannended
     that the question of the fee to be charged should be discussed with another
     Carnittee before a decision is reached. This approval will, of coarse, be
     subject to forrral confirmation by the County Council on 19th Decerrber.

     The principal outstanding matters are still those relating to the South Stand
     discussed on 12th November, namely, remedied works to the steel oolums and
     the energency lighting system. I understand that little or no progress has
     been made cn these two matters.

     Vtiilst the County Council recognises the Club's co-c^eraticn in carrying cut
     by far the majority of the measures reocranended by the Officer Working Party,
     I am sure you will appreciate the position viiich will be created should
     progress not be       quickly cn these two outstanding major items.

                                                            Yours faithfully,

Dear ____________ [
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
        As promised in my discussion with Mr, Sherrif yesterday,
I write to record the load tests which have recently been
carried out.      We have not yet finished writing up the
report on the testing of all crush barriers but I can give
an assurance that all barriers except one were brought up
to standard during August and that the remaining barrier
has recently been tested and satisfactorily passed the green
book requirement.
        We have also managed to apply test loads at two or three
places along the boundary fence adjacent to the tunnel exit
from Spion Kop and in each case, the fence withstood the
required sideways load for handrailing set out in the green
book.
        W e have also test loaded the wall in the small
triangular area below the tunnel exit front Spion Kop to the
full 6 kN/m requirement.
        In the South stand we test loaded on a 2m length at the
foot o f each of the access gangways with the full crush barrier
load o f 6 kN/m length.     We have also test loaded every
complete spam of the balustrade under a load of 3 kN/m length.
In all cases the load was withstood without distress.
                                            Yours sincerely,

  Dear Mr. England,
                             Certificate of Ground Safety, 1979
                    Test on Crush Barriers,                      Balustrades and Fences
            We have pleasure in presenting a formal report drawing
  together the results of all the load tests on crush barriers,
  fences etc. which were carried out between June and December
  1979.


^ Z r u s h Barriers
            The first series of tests were made on all the barriers
  existing at the time of the application for a safety certificate.
  These are shown on the attached prints of drawings Nos. 1610/61 and
  62.       The barrier numbers used in the following descriptions of
  the tests are as shown on these two drawings.


  (a)       A     total of 19 barriers failed to carry the specified test
            load of 6 kN/m length when first tested.                                  Seven of these
            failures        (Nos. 40, 41, 42, 57, 58, 62 and 68) were caused
            by defective retaining clips on the horizontal rails.
            Seven failed because the horizontal rail suffered permanent
            deformation            (Nos. 34, 87, 91, 92, 93, 97 and 98) and five
               failed because of bending of vertical posts (Nos. 4, 18,


                                            Registered In England —No. 1134831
                                                                  SHEET



EASTWOOD &> PARTNERS




         19, 37 and 38).
              During the course of the testing careful inspection
         was made of each barrier and it was found that, although
         they passed the test, a number of barriers had minor
         defects mainly due to corrosion.     A total of 32 new clips,
         eight new rails and five new posts were fitted in addition
         to strengthening of those barriers which failed the test.
         All protruding or sharp edges were removed.
              One further barrier was modified because it was initially
         significantly lower than the minimum height recommended in the
         green Code of Practice.
              Following construction of the new additional barriers on
         Spion Kop and the completion of repairs to the old barriers
         a second series of tests was made.     All the new barriers
         and all the repaired barriers now passed the test.


   (b)   Lepplngs Lane
              In the first series of tests six barriers   (Nos. 104,
         105, 106, 107, 110 and 123) had failures of the tube
         retaining clips.    Five barriers (Nos. 107, 114, 115, 121 and 130)
         suffered permanent deformation of the horizontal rail.
              All these barriers were repaired.     In addition 13 new
         clips and five rails which were badly corroded were replaced,
         and any protruding or sharp edges removed.
              After construction of the new barriers, they and all
         the repaired barriers were tested and all withstood the
         test load satisfactorily.


   (c)   North West Corner
              The initial testing of the first few barriers in this
         corner showed that all of them were only capable of taking
         about half the test load.    The rails deflected excessively
         and the holding down bolts were also inadequate.


                                                                          /
                                                                      SHEET   3



EASTWOOD f t PARTNERS




                 Major strengthening in the form of extra posts to
          shorten the span of the rails and to share the load with
          the existing posts were installed.     A new type of holding
          down arrangement was devised.
                 When re-tested all existing barriers plus all the
          new barriers successfully withstood the specified load.


^   ?he Safety Cage
          When the first series of tests were made on the crush
    barriers it was found that the safety cage along both ends of
    the ground had defective supports.      It was found that certain
    holding down bolts had not been fixed when the fence was
    installed.     There was also a need for support from the
    concrete perimeter wall in some places.     After appropriate
    remedial work the fence was successfully test loaded in 4m sections
    along both ends of the ground using the normal crush barrier
    loading of 6 kN/m length.


    Boundary Fences
^         Concern had been felt for the boundary fence along the
    .idge of the ramp from Spion Kop.     Any failure of this fence
    as the crowd leaves the ground could result in people being
    spilled down a steep bank.     The whole length of this fence
    from the score board down to the bottom was therefore tested
    using the lateral force specified in the green Code of 2.74 kN/m.
    The whole length carried the load satisfactorily.
          The continuation of this fence round to the north-east
    c o m e r of the pitch, plus the two lines of fence which protect
    the island of spectators to the west of the tunnel were also
    appropriately tested (the lengths marked in red on the attached
    print of drawing 1610/11).     All the sections successfully
    carried the test load without signs of distress.
          It was also found to be possible to test load five sections
    of the boundary fence round the top of Spion Kop as shown by the
    short red lines.     The load applied was again that appropriate to
EASTWOOD f t PARTNERS




  the lateral force on exit routes.     Again the load was
  satisfactorily resisted.


  South Stand    Balustrade
         The final testing was on the south stand    balustrade.
  At the foot of every gangway a length of 2m was subjected
  to the same test load as crush barriers i.e. 6 kN/m length.
01n   every case this load was resisted without distress
         In between the gangways, the   balustrade was subjected
  to a test load of 3 kN/m length applied to the whole spam
  between successive pairs of supports.      Again the load was
  everywhere satisfactorily resisted.


  Future Numbering of Crush Barriers
        Many of the barriers have been lengthened and also
  additional barriers have been installed.      It is obviously
  inappropriate to continue with the old numbering system.
  We therefore include prints of two new drawings 1610/6 3 and 64 which
  show a new numbering system for Spion Kop and the whole of the
  *?est end of the ground.    It is proposed that these numbers
  will be used in all future reports.


                                      Yours sincerely,

    Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 -
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited

    I thank you for your letter dated 15th July.

    After consultations with the Building Authority and in view of the fact
    that all of the barriers were tested prior to certification, the County
    Council is able to agree this year with the course of action which you
    propose. However, I would stress that this agreement is conditional
    upon it being recognised and accepted that it is without prejudice as
    to what may be required in future years under the provisions of paragraph
    25(2) of the Safety Certificate.

    May I also mention the Certificates by:-

    (a)     a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer (as required by
            paragraph 24 of the Safety Certificate) as to all structural
            parts of the Stadium, excluding crush barriers and handrails;

    (b)     an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
             26 of the Safety Certificate) as to the electrical installation
            within the Stadium; and

    (c)     an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
             12(2) of the Safety Certificate) as to the condition of the
             Emergency Power Supply.

    I take it that if the Club has not already done so, they will shortly be
    requesting you to supply these.

                                                             Yours faithfully.

      Note of a Visit to the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield,
                        on 8th June, 1981

PRESENT:   Representing the' Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

           E. England (Secretary)

           Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

           C. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
           F. Davis (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
           R. Grimshav (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

           D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
           D.I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1.     Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981. The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2.____ Inspection of         Stadium

The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

(a)    South Stand

The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel
trusses referred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, in
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be g\ven.

It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
be provided.

(b)    West Stand

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars' supporting the steps at the rear of the
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
had been made good.

As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
(nearest to the South Stand).

Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand.
An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
when these had substance.

                                       6 7
(c)   North-West Terrace

The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take place after
treatment had now been satisfactorily treated*

It was also noted* that the tie bars through the upper level concrete
area to the rear had been/protectively wrapped.

(d)    North Stand

The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
Kop) had been made good.

(e)    Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
original exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would
be attended to shortly.

The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of the
new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.

(f)    General

It was noted:-

(i)    that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the
rear of the Butcher's Shop on Penistone Road required attention because of
corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall between the Spion
Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

    South Yorkshire County Council,                 2 September, 1981
    County Hall,
    BARNSLEY, S. York*.
    S70 2TN.

    For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan.


    Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                  Radial Fences at Loppings Lane End
         We have been Instructed by the Club to organise the
    installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the
    Lepplngs lane end of the ground.
         It is intended that these fences are so positioned
    that they divide this section of the terrace into
0   approximately three equal areas, each served by its crwn
    entrance.
         By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
    should result. A visiting team with only a few followers
    will be allocated one section, with the other two sections
    retained by the hone supporters.
         Larger contingents of visiting spectators could bo
    accommodated In two or all three areas as their numbers
    dictate.
         A 1.15 aotre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
    each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
    during a gama. The gate could be left open, but fastened
    back, to connect the areas during a g a m if adjacent ones



                                       69
are accupled by supporters of the sane teas. When establishing
the height we have considered that the views to the corner
flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
present by the perimeter fence. Ve therefore propose that the
top of the fence should be approximately 1080mm above the
terrace.
     This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
but should eliminate a mass invasion from one area to the other.
Fences this height appear to work successfully at St. James's
Park, the home of Newcastle United.
     Ve would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
within the Working Party and your comments forwarded to us.
     Also to be included in the same contract are some gates at
various locations around the north stand. Now the gymnasium is
open to the general public security toother parts of the ground
must be maintained. It is proposed that gates are provided at
the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road end of the
stand. A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to
prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
Leppings Lane.
     Six copies of our drawing 3963/1 together with two copies
of our drawings 3563/2 and 3 (for reference only) are enclosed.


                                      Tours sincerely,

For the attention of Hr. D. Vaughan


Dear Hr. Vaughan,
                      Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
    As previously intimated to you we carried out tests
oti approximately one fifth of the crush barriers in July and
also made a preliminary inspection in company with Mr. Shertff.
    One or two of the crush barriers showed signs of distress
under the test load and along a length of the boundary fence of
the Kop at the North East c o m e r it was discovered that certain
of the stays were rusted through.      Remedial work has now been
carried out and the defeotive crush barriers have been successfully
subjected to the test load.      We shall be inviting Mr. Sheriff
t o inspect the remedial work in the next few days following
which Z will issue a certificate on the lines of that which I
sent to you last year.


                                        Yours sincerely,

 Dear sir,                                  Lllslvvcod 6c Partners
 Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 ,                     15 SEP 1981
 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club    ~                              --.

 Referring to your letter of 9th September, the Officer Working Party
 (Sheffield District) has considered the proposals referred to in your
 letter of 2nd September and accompanying plans.

 1.     Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst welcoming the increased control on the Terrace which should
result, concern was expressed as to the problems which could occur with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or at the entry/
exit gates. However, it was felt that only experience would show
whether this would prove to be a reality and, if realised, whether the
problem was of such a small scale that it could be easily coped with by
the police.

Accordingly, the Officer Working Party at this stage sees no objection
to the proposals to instal two 1680 mm high radial barriers, with 1.15
metre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject to:-

| (a) the further calculations required by the Building Authority being
       satisfactory (Hr. Sheriff to contact you direct);

 (b) confirmation that adequate headroom will be available at the rear
      of the Terrace after installation of the barriers and gates, and

 (c) the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being under police
      control.

 2.     Security Gates around North Stand

The Officer Working Party fully recognises the Club’s need to provide
security for the remainder of the stadium when only the gymnasium is in
 use-                                              U   cJ J
Provided that the gates and/or their Supports, hinges, etc. do not
impinge on the existing critical ramp widths and the gates are secured
in the fully open position on match days, the Officer Working Party
sees no objection to the erection of security gates around the North Stand.

Dr. W. E a s t v o o d          - 2 -                 14th S e p te n b e r ,   1 9 81 .




3.     Other Matters

Two other matters were also raised by the Officer Working Party relating
to the Police and First Aid Facilities and the siting of certain of the
Lottery Ticket Boxes..

(a)    Police and First Aid Facilities

       It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first
       aid facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim
       basis on the understanding that the Club would provide purpose built
       replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

       It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are
       still continuing, but it is felt that the Club should be asked to give
       a firm indication when the new police and first aid facilities are to
       be provided.
 (b)   Lottery Ticket Boxes

       Concern was expressed as to the blocked egress which could result if
       the timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps
       were to be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

        The Officer Working Party felt that the Club should be requested to
        re-site the boxes in a less critical position.

I attach an additional copy of this letter for your use.

                                         Yours faithfully,




                                          Chief Executive.

Dear Eric,
                  Safety of Sports Grounds Act
    I enclose a copy of a letter fran David Vaughan dated
14 September frcm which you will see that the proposal to
inatal the radial barriers on the West terrace and to
provide security gates round the North stand are accepted,
although with sane reservations in the case of the radial
barriers.    Twoothers matters are also raised, that of the
Police and first aid facilities and also the lottery ticket
bcoees.
     I intend to walk round the ground at the end of the week
to inspect the various minor works associated with strengthening
crush barriers and boundary fences before issuing a certificate
for this year's testing programme.    I will telephone before
I come so that we can have a chat for a few minutes.


                                 Yours sincerely,

Tor ths attention oi Mr. D, Vaughan

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
           Sheffield Vednesdav Football Club
          Radial Fences at Leppings Lane Knd
                and Security Gates
      The work on the radial fences and security gates
indicated on our drawings 3563/1-3 which ve sent to you on
2 September 1981, is now substantially complete.
      Three first teas hoae gaaes have been played since the
fences were erected. Ve have not beard any Zonal coasents
fro* the Vorking Party about the 9peration of' the fences and
their access gates but we understand that representatives, of the
South Yorkshire Police have Inspected the vork and they are fiBHi
satisfied with the new arrangements.                    j
      To increase security it is proposed that pairs of gates
are installed at the bottoa of the two staircases at the back of
the Vest Stand.      copies of our drawing 3563/4 are enclosed
showing details of the gates.



                                  Yours sincerely,

100       u^*t*        In reply to your letter dated 14th December, 1981, I understand that
                     ^ the Building Authority has contacted your office direct for clarification
                       on a small number of points regarding the proposed installation of pairs
                       of gates at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of the West
                       Stand. Subject to the satisfactory resolution of these points and, of
                       course, to the gates being secured in the fully open position during the
                       time the public parts of the stadium are occupied when matches are
                       being played, the Officer Working Party has no objection to the proposals

                         As regards the radial fences installed on the West Terrace and the
                         security gates around the North Stand, the Officer Working Party wishes
                         to make the following comments

                         (a)      Radial Barriers on West Terrace

                         The matches played at the stadium since the installation of the barriers
                         confirm that they appear to be working well and satisfactorily effect the
                         segregation of opposing groups of fans. However, the entire section of
                         the Terrace has yet to be given to one group of fans.

                          The Police inform me that, on installation of the new radial barriers,
                          the existing crush barriers have been extended in some places up to and
                          completely through the new radial barriers at a height of A'6" or so
                          from the ground. The effect is to make it very easy for fans to climb
                          from one pen to another. In other places the existing crush barrier
                          rails have been cut off short of the radial barriers in a maimer which
                          leaves dangerous pieces protruding into some of the gangways.

                           (b)   Security Gates around the°North Stand

                          You will recall that my letter of 14th September, 1981 stated that,
                          provided that the gates and/or their supports, hinges, etc., do not
                          impinge on the existing critical ramp widths, the Officer Working Party
                          saw no objection to the erection'Tof the~security gates.

                          I am informed that the manner in which the gates have been installed    ^
                          has resulted in each gate's hinge impinging at least 7j^ into the width
                          of the ramp. This means that there is a 15" reduction in width of the \

As the Annual winter inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium is due
to take place anytime   around now,I would suggest    theopportunity be
taken to discuss these matters at the inspection.

Perhaps you would contact Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff (extension 422)
so that the necessary arrangements may be made.

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                 Safety of Sports Ground AcC
        Thank you for your letter of 20 January.
        I believe the small number of points needing
clarification have already been discussed between
John Strange and Mr. Sheriff.    One of these refer to the
need for a goal post type frame over the gates but this is
in fact already provided by the sheeting frrfae.   There is
also a small amount of rust staining arising from misplacement
of reinforcement in the 100m thick retaining wall.     There
is no immediate danger arising from this and an appropriate
maintenance repair will be carried out.
        Turning now to the radial barriers on the West
terrace it is of course accepted that where thers is a
crush barrier passing through or close to the radial barrier
it will make it easiftr for anyone who so wishes to climb
over.   Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable to
leave the crush barriers as they are.    If all barriers
were removed back to a distance say 1.2m from the fence it
would mean a 2.4m wide gap which is not protected by barriers.
There would be a consequent loss of calculated spectator
capacity which is undesirable from the Club's ptlnt of
view.   However from the point of view of safety a strip
of that width without a single crush barrier would be a
major hazard*
        It should be kept in mind that the introduction
of these radial barriers has effected a very great
improvement froa the point of view of segregation of
spectators but to achieve perfection from the point of
view of segregation brings with it other disadvantages*
I believe that what we have done is a reasonable compromise
between the various interests.
        In the second paragraph on this subject you
refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding from the
crush barriers.   I have not had am opportunity to check
this since receiving your letter but I am Informed that
the word 'dangerous* is a little exaggerated and they
do not of course protrude into a gangway as there is no
gangway at this position.
        With regard to the security gates around the North
stand the point at issue is whether the encroachment into
the gate width is at all critical.   The remaining clear
width is 3.300mm which is equivalent to a six unit exit.
Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in
eight minutes using the green book figure of 60 people
per minute per exit width is 5,760 shared between the two
routes*   The stand capacity is of course 10,000 and in
practice more than half the number tend to use the lower
exits since most spectators are reluctant to walk uphill
to the upper set of exit stairways.   The picture is that
fewer than 5,000 people will be trying to get out of
exits which can accommodate 5,760 in eight minutes*
        Cher* were very good structural reasons for placing
the gates in this way.   The theoretical exit capacity has
not been changed since it was always a six unit gateway.
There is no funnelling effect# and there is a good
'reservoir* area upstrean of the gates*
        Z telephoned your office yesterday but gather
you were on leave and have again telephoned this norning
with a view to agreeing a tentative date for the winter
meeting of the working party.   Z will try again in the
next day or so.

                               Yours sincerely.

    1.     Purpose of Meeting
                                              %

    The purpose of the meeting was to discuss*£he apparent difference of opinion
    on certain aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
    and the security gates at the top of the North stand ramps, as well as to
    carry out the usual winter inspection of the Stadium.

    2.     Ground Inspection

    A.     West Terrace

    Whilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches-played since the
    erection of the radial barriers indicated that generally they worked well and
    satisfactorily effected the segregation of opposing groups of fans.

    However, the police pointed out that in places the existing crush barriers
    had been extended up to and, in some cases, completely through the new
    radial barriers, which had the effect of making it relatively easy for anyone
    who wished to do so   to climb from one pen to another.  Also, in the pen
    nearest to the South Stand, a small length of existing  crush barrier had been
    left unsupported.

    IT WAS AGREED -

    (i)   That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
    prevent crowd surge by the existing barriers being extended up to and/or
    through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
    able to climb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of the
    current season.

    (ii)   That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
J   be cut off.

                                             - 1 -

                                                                                  I


    B.    West Stand ■

    One of the security gates which the Club wished to instal at the bottom of
    the two staircases had now been erected.

    IT WAS AGREED     that this could, be regarded as satisfactory.

    C.    North Stand

    The Fire Service felt that the manner in which the security gates had been
    installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available.

    The Club's Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
    of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
    applied in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the top
    of the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or not.

    IT WAS AGREED   that, as the point might well have been covered in the
    initial consideration of the Club's application for a General Safety
    Certificate, the point would not be pursued at the moment.

A         NOTE - A search of the file subsequentlyrevealed   that, as
                  suspected, the point had been considered at a
                  meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.2.79,
                  the relevant part of the Note of the meeting reading:-

                      "the construction and width of the ramps being
                       such that they could quite-properly be
                       regarded as elevated roadways".

    D.    Spion Kop

    It was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on
    the left of the original exit at the top of the Kop had taken place; that
    the boundary fence at the top of the Kop had been reinforced, and that the
    existing barriers had been permanently extended and the area at the foot
    of the new Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)
    levelled off as agreed.

     E.   South Stand

     The agreement to visually inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection
     after exceptional gale or snow loadingconditions  wasrecalled.

     F.   Items of General    Maintenance

     IT WAS AGREED     that the following items of general maintenance required
     attention:-
     (i)   The rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
     the exit at the southerly end of the West Stand (to be done that day), as
J    well as the rounding off of the brackets to the North Stand security gates.

     (ii)    The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
     fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
     o
     Gate « "O'
             "n"

    /                                          -   2-




                                             So
(iii) The cracks‘in the concrete terracing of the Spion Kop to be filled.

(iv)  The wooden support to the electrical line between the brick built
refreshment point and the Owls Club to be fixed more securely.

(v)     The brick wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop (nearest
to the South Stand)       to be pointed.

(vi)  The concrete supporting strut to the wall between the Spion Kop and
the South Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) to be protected (cracks and
exposed b a r ) .

G.      Temporary Structures

Concern was expressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability
of temporary structures, such as scaffolding used in connection with
television transmissions.

Paragraph 20 of the Club's General Safety Certificate required T.V. cameras
and portable equipment to be placed only in such positions   asmay be agreed
between the Police and the Club.   The Club also were generally required to
ensure that the Stadium complied with good engineering and building practices
and with the relevant British Standard Specification or Code of Practice.

IT WAS AGREED  that the question of temporary structures should be kept
under review, and that the Club's Consultants should give advice to the
Club.

3.      Future      Developments

A.      Police      and First Aid Facilities

It was likely that, following continuing consultations with the Police, the
Club would shortly be in a position to formally notify the County Council
that the new Police and First Aid Facilities would be provided in the
forthcoming close season.

B.      Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate in Penistone Road

The Club hoped to formally notify the County Council shortly of the i r_
intention to proceed in the forthcoming close season with the demolition of
some of the existing toilets on the Penistone Road side of the Stadium in
order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate on that side of the
Stadium.

C.      Widening of Walkway and Erection of New Fence

Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the
rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Owls Club) had h a d to be removed.
When settlement was complete, it was intended to widen the existing
walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.

Hillsborough,

S6 1SW.
For the attention of Mr» E. England

Dear Eric,
               Annual Certificate of Ground Safety
     We have completed the testing of the remainder of the
barriers at the Spion Kop end of the ground excepting
those bar*i*«s which because of their position cannot be
subjected to the test load.    Z an pleased to say that all
the barriers withstood the load but unfortunately in a number
of cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed
considerably.    It is inevitable thatwwater gets under
these clips and they rust thus becoming weaker with the
passage of time.    In one or two cases the clip actually
snapped as the final load was taken off.    A total of 25 new
clips are needed on Spion Kop including a few on the barriers
at the top which have not actually been tested.    John also
inspected the Leppings Lane end and 10 clips are sufficiently
corroded to make it wise to change then rather them wait until
they are tested during the next ^twj^ears^^Jfe are using
a heavier gauge metal for the re inferneme ^ clips so that the
future life expectancy will be increased.
     The metal in the tube beneath the clips is also subject
to corrosion and 11 lengths each about 8ft. long on Spion Kop
are clearly nearing the end of their life.    We have to bear
in mind that the corrosion which can be seen on the outside may


                                                                  /
be matched by corrosion inside the tube which cannot
of course be painted.    Whilst all 11 lengths successfully
carried the test load you may think it prudent that they
should be replaced now because they could become dangerous
within five years.
     If all this work is carried out (new clips on both
Spion Kop and Leppings Lane plus 11 new lengths of barrier
top rail on Spion Kop) the likely cost is between £1250
and £1500 exclusive of professional fees*    I should be
pleased to have your view as ttowhether we should carry out
the whole of this work or merely replace the clips on
Spion Kop which deformed under test in which case the cost
of the work would be approximately halved,
     John has already walked round the ground and he tells
me that some splitting and spelling of the concrete columns
it developing at ground floor level at the back of the
South stand.   I* shall be making my inspection in company
with the Building Surveyors department representative during
this month and it is likely he will raise the matter.    In
any case it is important that splitting of this kind be dealt
with reasonably quickly so as to retard the* rate at which the
reinforcement corrodes.    I will discuss this matter with you
when I have seen the damage myself.

                                   Yours sincerely,
                                                                  £ » *              > * • €

Dear Ur. 8herrlff,
         Sheffield Wednesday Football Clab Ltd..
                Barrier Testing 1983
      Over June 2 0 - 2 4 , crush barriers 121, 122, 123, 124,
124A, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134,
135, 136 (part), 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144 (part),
145, (part), 146 (part), 147, 148, 149 (part), 150, 151, 152,
153 and 154 (part) at the Lepplng Lane end were tested In
accordance with the procedure laid down In the Guide to Safety
at Football Grounds. The layout of the barriers is shown on
the enclosed print of our drawing 1610/64B.
      8pans 3 and 4 of barrier 136 could not be loaded because
of the recently Installed radial fence. Some spans of
barriers 144, 145, 146, 149 and 154 could not be tested because
being towards the back of the terrace the absence of a suitable
reaction point or obstruction prevented Jacking.
       In all but one case the barriers sustained the test load
although In two cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube
deforaed. These^were on barrier 136 between spaas 6 - 7 and
8 - 9 . New clips have been fitted. On barrier 129 the tube

has been welded onto the clip to give a worm positive
fixing, but nevertheless the test load was resisted.
     The only failure was the centre support of barrier
141. The angle leg, which was corroded round the top
rivets, parted during the first load application. The
angle has been plated and new bolts inserted to coaplete
the connection. This is shown on our enclosed sketch,
4644/2.
     Also enclosed are single copies of our record sheets
ahewing the results of the barrier tests.

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the /             ,
Stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football   foj
League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

2.   Ground Inspection

A.    South Stand

The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
had been completed since the "summer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

(ii) That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit" sign in the Match
Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

(iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
should be infilled with mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly
with the appropriate Regulations.

(iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

B.    West Stand and Terrace

The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
temporary barriers. This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters
of the West Stand and Terrace. On those occasions when the number of
visiting supporters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
obviously desirable to allow home supporters access to a sheltered area.



                                        ° [1
IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the Club would consider at some future date a scheme for
permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
being submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party in the
usual way.

(ii) That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.

(iii) That the apparent rusting of the steel columns at the rear of the
Stand should receive appropriate treatment by the Club.

C.   North West Terrace

No comments.

D.   North Stand

IT WAS AGREED that so long as larger, not easily combustible, materials
continued to be stored in the timber screened store area under the Stand,
the area would be regarded as acceptable.

E.   Spion Kop

It was noted that the remedial work to the roof of the tunnel exit from
the Kop had stabilised its condition for the time being (pending the
Club's development proposals proceeding'; that the loose coping stores
had been removed from the top of the wall between the Spion Kop and the
South Stand, and that the damaged corrugated metal sheeting between the
Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i) That the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop should
continue to be monitored.

(ii) That the Club would carry out the pointing work to the outer perimeter
wall on Penistone Road once the frosts had ceased.

F.   Lighting Pylons

The visual inspection of the lighting pylons (first mentioned at the
inspection on 29th February, 1984) had yet to be carried out by the Club.

IT WAS AGREED that the visual inspection of the lighting pylons would be
carried out by the Club in the near future (weather conditions permitting).

3.   Public Address System

The Club pointed out that an improved public address system had been installed,
and the Police confirmed that reports received indicated that it was noticeably
better than the previous system.
4.    Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Officer Working Party confirmed that plans for the revised catering
facilities at the rear of the West Stand had been received from the Club's
Architect and had been formally approved.

The Club reported that the scheme for the general up-grading of toilet and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand) was shortly to be
considered by the Board.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would submit the proposals for improved toilet
and catering facilities for approval in the usual way, subject, of course,
to the Board's decision whether to proceed with the scheme.

turnstiles (Hoe 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various ruas of fencing

Dear Dick,
                        Turnstllee at Lepplngs Lane
     After sp e a k in g to        frast Wednesday about th. nu»ber ?*
turnstile, required to serve .pectator. using th. t*ppin^iiiis
end of the ground ve have altered our proposed layout aooordingly.
Three prints of our drawing 6705/3 ar. enclosed.
     The eighteen existing turnstiles will rsnain. I M will serve
th. North stand and sight th. terrace. for th. hon. supporters.,
in addition to four turnstiles from (A - B), which can be r»-tts«i,
tw.lv. new turnstiles will be r^uir.d. Four eaoh of these .will b.
for hone and away spectators using th. West stand, four for_vlslting
supporters using the terrace under the score board and four.         .
primarily for away supporters to the centre terrace, but th.y.,could
b. used for home supporters if the need arises. Ne under.tand th.
polio, hav. suggested a central fence to divid. the oiddle.ectlon
 rather than provide a 2 m wide sterile area to one side. ;,This nay
 work providing you are happy having home and **“ ? *uppor-

 saute area outside.
       Would you and       be kind enough to bave i l w k at the
 drawing becaus. I would like to hear your comments before proceeding
 further, though la the neantiam w    are pressing on with the toilet
 facilities.
      We have spoken to Mayor Turnstiles Ltd who supplied the
 turnstiles on Penistone Road and they have told us that if the
 new turnstiles are wanted during the cloae season they will want a
 letter of intent within the next few days. Other clubs are busy
 Installing new turnstiles and their order book is getting full. He
 can deal with this on your behalf but an indication that the nuobers
^shown are correct would be useful.

                               Yours sincerely#

    Dear Dick ,

                           Turnstiles at Leoplngs Lane

         Thank you for returning the marked copies of our drawings
    6705/2 and 3. After our telephone conversation yesterday we
    have altered the layout accordingly. Two print* of our drawing
    5705/4 are enclosed for your comments.
         We have equalised each combination of turnstiles and gate
    as requested but each gate needs to be at least 2.75 m for exit
    purposes.
         Zf this arrangement is satisfactory, or*even if you wish us
    to make more alterations, we would be available to have a meeting
    with you and South Yorkshire Police sometime nest week to discuss
    the proposals in detail. .   _______ .
                                  Yours Sincerely, •

    Dear Dick,
                         Re-organisation of Turnstiles
                  and Mew Toilet Facilities at Lepplngs Lane
            As requested we have now prepared an estimate for the
   cost of works envisaged at the back of the West stand for the
   segregation of visiting spectators.
            The scope of the work falls into two categories, firstly
^ t h e turnstiles, fences, walls and gates, and secondly, the
   toilets and refreshment facilities.
            The proposed layout of the turnstiles etc. at the back
   of the stand is shown on our drawing 6705/4, a copy of which is •
    enclosed.    Including the radial fence on the Vest terrace, we ;
    estimate that the cost of this work, including professional
    fees, is likely to be in the order of £66,600.     This
    assumes that five of the existing turnstiles can be re-used,
        seven new turnstiles are purchased.
            Also enclosed is a print of our drawing 6705/7 showing i
    the proposed layout of the new and refurbished toilets beneath .-
    the West stand. We estimate that the cost of the toilets, .
    agaAAnincluding professional fees, will probably be around •.
    £60,700.    This includes stAinless steel fittings which' are fairly
    resistant to abuse but are expensive. The saving if vitreous
    china is substituted for stainless steel urinal troughs and     :
sinks m i d be about £2,200.   If the items of qalnte&BOBe
work, listed by S.Y.C.C. Working Party on their last vis£t
and agreed to be dons i.e. investigate the condition of the
concrete frame at the back of the South stand and the corrosion
of stanchions at the back of the West stand, repointing the
boundary wall on Penistone Road and providing the mesh infill
on the bridge to the kitchens are added to the sane contract
we suggest that an allowance of £3,000 be made for this.       '
        The total expenditure for the whole scheme plus
the mainteannce work is therefore likely to be about £130,$00
including professional fees and Building RBgulations fees. '’v

        Dear Sirs,

        Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1985
        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

        In reply to your letter dated 9th April, whilst a meeting of the
        Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) was held on 18th April
        to consider the proposals which you outlined, the County Fire
        Service requested additional time to consider the means of escape
        aspects.

        I am now able to say that, subject to the incorporation of the
        following points and to the submission of detailed plans and
        calculations under both the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and
        Building Regulations, the proposals outlined are regarded as
        generally acceptable:-

        (a)    additional gates being provided between the turnstile
               numbered 16 and the wall of the inner access road;

        (b)    the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral
               area or visiting supporters’ terrace) being divided in
               half by a new central radial fence running from the tunnel
               entrance to the pitchside security fence with gates erected
               so as to permit entry to be diverted to either half as
               appropriate (the proposed new secondary radial fence
               adjacent to the existing fence indicated on the plan to be
    J          abandoned);

        (c)      the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters’
                 terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial
              p. fence running from back to front with two gates (the existing
                 radial fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral
                 area and home supporters •• to have a second gate installed); y

(d)   the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit
      gates installed - one in the neutral area and one in the
      home supporters area;

(e)   certain gates to have the minimum widths (in metres) indicated
      on the attached plan and to them being fully supervised.

                          Lepplngs Lanei
           I understand, following John Strange** telephone conversation
  with you yesterday, that South Yorkshire County Council did not send
  you a copy of their letter to us dated 2 May.   A copy is now
^bnclosed.
          A number of things that they request.have already been
  incorporated since we wrote to them on 9 April.   However I do
  not think that it is realistic to ask for the gates in the radial
  fences and have written to David Vaughan accordingly.

                                 Yours sincerely.

    For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan •

   Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
           Thank v°u for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
  of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
   to you on 9 April.
4)          Zn the interim period several of the points which you
  raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
  which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.     However I
   would'"ask that further consideration should be given to the
   request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a Second gate to
  be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
  barrier which you have asked for to have two gates, /if these
   gates are meant for use in emergency It would mean having    a
   steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
  would hardly be justified. Zt is our view that in the event of
  emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the
  gates o a to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
  We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
  Fire Officer's staff should you so wish*
                                              Yours sincerely,

 which you will see that ay protest about     the gates in * * * : £ ':
 radial fences has had s o ~ effect.  But     we will need to
^discuss this with the Working Party. If      they still want two
 gates X would see »ore sense in one gate     per radial fence
 rather than two in one fence and none in     the other.

    Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

     In reply to your letter of 8th May, the extra gates referred to in paragraph
    ^(c) of my earlier letter of 2nd May were included primarily at the request
     'f the South Yorkshire Police.

    Provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
    are incorporated in the latest proposals (yet to be considered by the Club),
    the Police are prepared to concede the request for two gates per radial fence
    in the right hand area of the Leppings Lane End Terrace (indicated as home
    supporters' terrace on the plan).


                                                      Yours faithfully,




                                                       Chief Executive.

Dear Dick,
                 Alterations at Lepplnqs Lane End
     We have pleasure in enclosing two prints of each of our drawings
6705/5 and 6705/8 showing two possible alternative arrangements for
the turnstiles and toilets at the back of the West stand.
     Both drawings show the following turnstile arrangements.
          Turnstile Nos 1 - 8 - North stand
                          9 - 13 - North west terrace, home supporters
                        14 - 16 - West stand, home supporters
                         17 - 19 - West stand, away supporters
                         20 - 23 - South west terrace, away supporters
     The proposals for the toilet and refreshment facilities are also
the same on each drawing. You will see that we propose to build a new
ladies toilet for away supporters using the end of the existing
refreshment bar. The existing ladies toilets will be refurbished for
the use of home supporters. The existing gents toilets will b«
divided and refurbished.
     Drawing 6705/5 indicates present turnstiles housings (17 t 18)
remaining with the ajoining fence covered with sheeting to completely
separate the home and away supporters. However, doing the calculations
for the evacuation of the ground reveals that there is a pinch p<     at


                                 I
the two external gates on the left hand side of the row of six.
Zt could take over 20 minutes to evacuate that end of the ground
depending on how many people leave the South stand from that side.
We, therefore, show on drawing <705/8, an improvement to that
arrangement by demolishing the two end turnstiles (17 & 18) and
constructing a new dividing wall angled across to enclose three
gates on the left hand side instead of two.
     We believe that the cost of the scheme on drawing 6705/5 will
be about £57,500 and for the one shown on drawing 6705/8 around
€59,500, both including professional fees.- To these figures add
say another £3000 for the maintenance work mentioned in our letter
of 2 May.
     Zf a decision to proceed with one of the proposed schemes is
given within the next few days it may be possible to have the work
substantially complete by the start of next season. This is not
certain but we would have a go.

                             Yours sincerely,




                                                                 /

fence was necessary. I suggested that we should have a double
fence with a gap between so as to Keep the spectators apart
and to provide a space in which his officers could stand.
Fewer policemen would be needed if the spectators had a .
gap between thea.    It so happens that right alongside the   ? -
existing fence there is a gate on to the pitch and if the ^
 second fence were placed on the other side of the gate, it
will provide an easy access gangway for the police and they
will be able to »ove in and out of the gap depending on the
 situation.   Mr. Moseley was clearly very pleased by this
 suggestion and subject to your approval, we are including
 the work in the contract for segregating the spectators at
Leppings Lane end.
      I should point out that It will Bean losing about * »etr.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

I thank you for your letter dated 12th June.

Taking into account all the factors which you mention (particularly the
steel sheeting of the wooden decking of the upper seated area by the
start of the forthccming season), the existing roof of the South Stand
will be regarded as acceptable on a temporary basis until the end of
the 1985/86 season. At that time, either a new roof must be constructed
or the under-roof timber cladding of the existing roof replaced by the
start of the 1986/87 season.

Details and plans of the work will, of course, be required in the usual
way.

Yours faithfully,




                                               t v ./n

    For the attention of Inspector C. Calvert.

    Dear Mr. Calvert,
                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
          Further to .'our telephpne conversation on 24 June we have
    pleasure in enclosing two copies of our drawing 6705/8 showing
    the proposed arrangement of the turnstiles and fences and gates
    at the rear of the West stand.
a         It is also proposed, but not shown on the drawing to
    install a single barrier rail, just above head height down
    the centre of the seated area and also a fence approximately
    2m away from the existing radial fence.on the right hand side
    of the terrace (looking from the pitch),to separate standing
    spectators. The fence will be just like the ones aai*ady installed.
          Although Dr, Eastwood has discussed the proposals in
    outline with Chief Inspector Moseley we would also appreciate
    receiving your comments.
          Perhaps the work can be completed ready for the start
    of the season if the scheme meets with your approval.

                                   Yours sincerely,

  Dear Sirs,

#     Thank you for your letter of 25 June regarding the roof
  of the South stand. I am sure the Club will be very appreciative
  of the co-operative attitude of the County Council.   The
  breathing space which has been provided will be adequate for
  the Club to take action by the start of the 1986/87 season.

                               Yours faithfully,

Dear Dick,
                     Alterations at Leppings Lane End

     We have pleasure in enclosing a set of prints of our drawings
showing details of the work at the Leppings Lane End.
     Drawing 6705/8A is worth a look at because it shows the proposed
layout of the turnstiles and fences. South Yorkshire Police have
given their approval to the scheme though we have not received
anything fran then in writing.
     Tenders are due back on 11th July, 198$.
                              Yours sincerely,

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

As requested by your letter dated 16th July, I have written a confirmatory
letter to the Club regarding the steel sheeting and non-slip surface of
the timber deck to the South Stand upper seated area (copy attached for .
your infornation).

I understand that applications for building regulation/planning approval
have been made by the Club in respect of (i) re-organisation of fences
and turnstiles and alterations to toilet facilities at the rear of the
West Stand, Leppings Lane, and (ii) erection of roof and enclosure to the
Spion Kop Terrace.

The Officer Working Party considered and gave approval in principle to the
rear of the West Stand re-organisation proposals in May but, other than
brief mentions by the Club or yourselves at routine meetings of the
possibility of the Spion Kop being enclosed, no outline plans or details
of such proposals have been considered to date.

As on previous occasions, I am assuming that you will submit the necessary
detailed plans, specifications and calculations for Safety of Sports Grounds
Act approval (bearing in mind the General Safety Certificate requirement
to give the County Council at least 21 days notice of any proposed
alterations or extensions at the Ground) should the Club decide to implement
the proposals after building regulation/planning permission consideration.

                                                   Yours faithfully,

 It will be necessary for all crush barriers, railings and walls to be tested by
 an approved method to simulate crowd pressure, and It will be required that all
 or some of these tests should be carried out in the presence of the appropriate
 officers of the building authority.

 Every effort will be made to ensure that when It is necessary to inspect the
 ground, following the submission of an application for a safety certificate,
 arrangements are made for the P olice, the Fire Service, and the Building
 Control Officer of the appropriate District Council to carry out their Inspections
 at the same time, In order to avoid undue Inconvenience to applicants, although
 it appears likely that testing of crush barriers will of necessity take place on a
 separate occasion.

Dear Mr England
                  Certificate of Safety
        I enclose a list of drawings which are likely to
give the information we need concerning the North Stand,
the West Stand and the North West Terrace and Stand. I as
sending a copy direct to Ur Whitehead so that he can sake
his enquiries of Mr English.
        Since Friday I have given some thought to the overall
situation and I think that you should proceed a step at a
time so as to reduce any unnecessary expenditure to a minimum.
        I         am confident that in considering the granting of a
Certificate the Local Authority is unlikely to raise any
difficulties with regard to the North Stand and the West Stand.
You may be vulnerable so far as splon cop is concerned since
there may be a significant reduction in the number of
spectators permitted, unless there is an increase in the
number of    barriers or possibly some strengthening. The
South Stand may also be questioned with regard to its fire
resistance and the consequent need for speedier evacuation of
spectators.
        As a first step, I suggest you commission an outline
survey of the standing accommodation plus the South Stand,
which should only be taken sufficiently far as to give you an
idea of the possible loss of spectator capacity if no remedial
work is carried out, and also to give you an idea of the
possible cost of remedial work if the present capacity is to
      Should you decide that it Is appropriate to commission a
first stage survey and report on these lines, I would suggest
that an expenditure limit of say £500 should be Imposed on.
whoever you employ to carry out the work.
      I        am sure that If there is any aspect of the matter
which you would like to discuss you will not hesitate to give
me a ring.
      Yours sinckrely,
          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited

Dear Ur. Whithead,
                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
     I      have pleasure in returning the prints of drawings
obtained from Husbands.   Even though one or two are still
missing, the great majority of the information we would
need in an application for a Certificate Is contained in
the ones we already have.   We should need to have enlarge­
ments made but this presents no difficulty.
     It would of course still be necessary to survey the
South stand and Spion Cop before an application could be
submitted. However, as we agreed last week, in the first
Instance you need only commit yourselves to a limited
amount of expenditure smy not exceeding £500 in order to
get sufficiently far to see whether you have any major
problems, and what the effect would be on your capacity if
 any remedial work were carried out.

                                          Yours sincerely,

      Dear Sirs,
                                     Certificate of Safety - Interim Report
                   We have now progressed sufficiently far with our
      survey and assessment to be able to submit an interim report
      covering the probable ground capacity and the likely costs of
       improvements which will be required by the certifying authority.
                   The green guide has been used as a basis for our cal­
       culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
®      will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
       guide.          Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of
       the fire officer and the police.


       Standing Accommodation
       (a)          Spion Kop
                           The general layout of Spion Kop is good.                                      It
                    has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
                    well below the maximum laid down in the guide.                                      The
                    slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements for
                    good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                           The only questions therefore are the adequacy
                    of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
                    permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of

                                                                          \r\

          the exits.
                 Where the barriers are adequate in strength
          and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
                                                       2
          of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m       of plan
          area.   Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
          Kop is approximately 3120m2 which would provide
          accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                  Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
          standards.    Category A must be able to withstand a
          test load of 6kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
          and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
          In 1973 you had tests made on all the barriers by
          Toft and Brocklebank Ltd.    Of the 101 barriers on
          Spion Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb
          and a further 15 carried the load but had some actual
          or incipient defect which needed attention.        Most of
          those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
          would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
          On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of
          a long barrier which was weak.    The general situation was
          satisfactory compared with most grounds.
                  Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
          barriers up to a uniform category A standard.        It
          should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
          the tests and there will have been some deterioration
          due to rusting.    Most of the barriers are made from
          2§" diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
          inches when new.    Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield’s
          atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
          to more rusting than others and we must expect some
          increase in the number needing attention.
                 Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/m,the
          maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
          guide varies between 5a for slopes of only 5       to 2.9m
                                                                                    SHEFT 3.

           for slopes of 30°.              These figures apply to ’peak
          viewing' areas.                Spion Kop has an average slope
          of about 17° for which the recommended spacing is
           3. 6m.
                     In calculating spectator capacity each barrier
           is assumed to cater for an area of ground immediately
           behind it which is either 3.6m wide or up to the
           next barrier, whichever is the smaller.                   We have
           surveyed the Kop, and our drawing 1610/1 attached
           shows the proportion of the Kop which will be
           admissible in the spectator calculation if all the
           barriers are brought up to category A standard.                     It
           will be immediately apparent that the great majority
           of the available area will qualify.                   Our calculation
           shows that the permitted number of spectators should
           be about 13,900 i.e. the number of places ’lost’ will
           be almost 3,000.
                  If you wish to retain most-of. these extra places
           (aiming for a ground capacity of at least 50,000
           say) then new barriers could be constructed at positions
           shown by the red lines on the second copy of drawing
           1610/1.        The capacity would then be 16,000.
                       In proposing the extra barriers we are mindful
            that in some cases they will possibly hinder the
            close packing of spectators.                   Clearly, there is no
            point in spending money in order to achieve a large
            p e r m i t t e d . ground   capacity, if that'numberrcaanot
            then be packed in.               However, we think that even with
            an uneven distribution of spectators it will still be
            possible to accommodate 16,000 spectators.
                       You may wish to consider whether the cost of
            these extra barriers will be justified by the additional
            income they might generate over the years.                   It is



                                                   0   -
                                                                    SHEET   4.

          likely that new barriers, which will require fairly
          massive foundation and anchor blocks will cost between
          £50 and £60 per metre run.      Thus the extra 235 metres
          of barrier will cost about £5.00 per extra standing
          place.
                   Spion Kop is not ideally catered for by exits.
          A very adequate gangway system feeds to only three
          exit points.     The total width of these three exits
          at their narrowest points is 12.5m.     The guide assumes
          a maximum flow rate through these exits of 60 persons
          per minute for each 550mm of width.      Thus the
          theoretical time to discharge 16,000 spectators from
          Spion Kop would be 13$minutes, compared with a maximum
          of 8 minutes indicated by the guide.
                 The exits at each end of the terrace are reasonably
          free from hazards,   except the one at the North end passes
          under a bridge with a headroom well below the recommended
          value of 8ft.     This defect could be removed by lowering
          the floor level, but I would argue strongly that it is
          far from essential to have such a large headroom, and
          the cost of modification is not justified in an existing
          structure.
                 The exit at the back of Spion Kop is likely to
           raise most difficulty.      The ramp is steep and it has
           an appreciable cross-fall at the top where there is also
           a change of direction.      At one'side is a vertical drop,
          which has guard rails which appear to be reasonably
           strong, but this can only be established by testing.
           We shall need some indulgence by the licensing authority
           if no works are to be requested.      My feeling is that
           continuous handrails will be required, splitting the
           ramp into say three separate lanes.
                  There may be considerable pressure to increase


                                                                                 y

          the total exit capacity.     We can argue that the
          eight minutes allowed for complete evacuation is only
          really valid for stands where there might be a risk
          due to fire, or explosion, or structural failure.        In
          the case of terracing it is only the impatience of
          spectators which might create danger.      For an interim
          period, at least, this should be acceptable.
®                Any changes or additions to the exit arrangements
          should take account of a possible future decision to roof
          over Spion Kop.     It would be possible to incorporate in
          such a scheme a 'squaring off* at the top which could
          increase the area available for spectators.      However,
          this would probably mean that additional entrances would
          be needed, possibly by tunnelling through the bank at
          lower level.      This would certainly make it easier to
          pack the crowd more uniformly.      However, this is a
          matter for the future and is unlikely to be part of the
          present exercise.
    (b)   The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North West Corner)
^                The west terrace is not quite so well endowed with
          barriers as Spion Kop.      The present layout is shown on the
          attached drawing 1610/2.      Our measurements show a total
          area of 1480m2 but there are no gangways.      We feel that
          some allowance should be made for circulation space as
          spectators have to move quite considerable horizontal
          distances to achieve good packing.      The full area would
          justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
          probably be appropriate to allow 10% as      the equivalent
          of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.        The
          barriers should be designed to match this figure approximately.
                  The shaded area on drawing 1610/2 is that which
          may be counted if the existing barriers are of class A.
           About 15 of the existing barriers are likely to need

                                                                                 /
                                                                    SHEET   6 .

          strengthening to achieve this .standard.    Even with
          this strengthening only 4,300 spectators could be
          accommodated, representing -a loss of nearly half ~
          We presume this would be unacceptable.
                    The extra barriers required to achieve
          approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
          second copy of drawing 1610/2.      You may feel that
          some of the proposed new barriers which are close
          to the entrances might restrict the passage of
          spectators undesirably.      In that case they could
          be omitted.
                 The three exits have a total width of about
          11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
          to leave the ground.      Thus the stand could empty
          in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                    The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
          should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.         Tbere are
          no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
          exit.      But we feel this is of no consequence as
          movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
          and quick.

   (c)    The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                    This area is also illustrated in the drawing
          1610/2.      The gross area available (there are no gangways)
          is about 565 m2 .     Thus if the crush barriers were
          adequate and the whole area is included the number of
          spectators could be about 3,050.
                 Unfortunately, the crush barriers in this area
          were shown to be very inadequate when tested in 1973.
          Only one was tested and the rail and posts were bending
          at a load of only 270 lb/ft.       Because of this result
           none of the others was subjected to a test lead.        We

                                                                     SHEET



EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




             have examined the drawings of these barriers and
             in addition to the weakness of the rails and posts,
             the holding down arrangements appear to be very
             inadequate and might be treacherous.       A sudden
             failure of a bolt, and they are very highly stressed,
             could lead to a collapse without warning.       These
             barriers need major strengthening as a matter of
             urgency.
                    Assuming that the barriers are strengthened
              it will be seen from the drawing 1610/2 that they
             also need considerable supplementation.       The scheme
             shown on the second copy of this drawing does not
             quite justify the whole area being taken in the
             calculations.       But it would be reasonable to count
              say 2900.      This would bring the total standing at
              the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                       The exits serving this part of the terrace are
              very adequate, but there may be requests for central
              handrailings to be provided.


      Seating Accommodation
       (a)    The North Stand
                     The form of construction of this stand is such
              that it presents a minimum fire hazard.      The exits
              are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy the
              recommendations of the guide.
                       Two matters might cause concern.    The first,
              the fact that the exits are marginally below the
              recommended minimum of 1.1m, is we think of very little
              consequence.      However, the second, the narrow gangways
              which are only about half the recommended minimum may
              cause some difficulty.     It would be possible to widen
              the gangways by taking one seat off the end of one of
              the rows meeting at each gangway.      As the gangways
                                                                    SHEET   8 .



EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS




          are the same in the other stands the total number of
          seats lost vould be 1,041.    This is almost unthinkable
          and must be resisted strongly.
                  Fortunately, the timing of spectators leaving
          the ground on 6 January shoved that a peak of 80 per
          minute passed through one exit.      This is the figure
          quoted by the guide for a 1.1m gangway.      With 18 exits
          for 10,000 people the average vould be 556 per unit.
          Thus the stand vould empty in about seven minutes,
          vhich is vithin the recommended limit of eight minutes.
                  Our observations on 6 January shoved that everyone
          had left this stand, apart from a fev people vho vere
          in no hurry, in about six minutes, although ve also counted
          about 40 per exit vho left before the final vhistle.
          The overall picture appears very satisfactory and
          encourages the hope that this stand vill be accepted
          as not needing any significant modification.

   (b)    The West Stand
                 This stand is very similar to the north stand
          in its construction.    We vere not able to accurately
          assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
          January because there vere many seats vhich vere unsold.
          Hovever, there is every reason to believe that there
          vill be no difficulty in vacating this stand vithin
           eight minutes also.   There should be no need for
           significant modifications.

   (c)    The South Stand
                 The structure has been surveyed and appended
          are prints of our dravings 1610/3, 4 and 5, vhich
           shov the plans and cross-section.     Also attached is
           a seating plan, draving No. 1610/6.
                  The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
           has 5710 seats.   These are served by 10 exits (excluding
                                                                      SHEET   9<



EASTWOOD f t PARTNERS




          those serving the directors box) so that an average
          of 570 people need to pass through each exit.       The
          count on 6 January shoved an average of just over 70
          per minute passing through one exit vhich corresponds
          to an emptying time of about eight minutes.       Indeed
          there vere very fev people still trying to get out six
          minutes after the final vhistle.       A fev had no doubt
          left early and a fev vere still standing around, but
          the stand had substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                    Having left the top of the stand the spectators
          have to make their vay from the first floor landing via
          one of three staircases.       Tvo of these are 3.6m vide
          and the other 2.4.       This is equivalent to 17$ 'lanes'
          of 550mm.      At 40 people per lane, 700 people pass per
          minute.       To discharge 5710 people (less those in the
          directors box) vill therefore take almost exactly 8
          minutes as permitted by the guide.
                    The fire officers vere clearly very interested
          in the first floor.       There is very little ’fire load'
          on this floor - the snack bars and the office/lounge.
          But quite a small fire might fill this area vith smoke.
          We suspect that there might be a request for it to be compart­
          mentalised by fire doors.
                    At ground floor level tvo of the staircases lead
          almost straight to the open air,, through a compartment
          vhich is separated from the main part of the building.
          The third staircase is not so veil separated and some
           structural vork may be needed.      Apparently the paint
           store is beside this staircase.      This may not be vise.
                    There may veil be requests from the fire officer
           for considerable extra precautions and structural
          alterations in this building.
                    The front, open-air part of the south stand is
EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




          veil endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
          one passage.      This passage has a theoretical capacity
          of only about 150 people per minute In each direction.
          This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.      Becaase
          the stand Is open to the air and there Is very
          ready access to the pitch we do not think this rather
          long emptying time Is of any great consequence.


   General Requirements
          It remains to be seen what other general requirements
   will be requested.     The fire officer may request structural
   alterations which we have not mentioned.      We must expect
   requests for handralllng dividing staircases Into lanes and
   on the ramp from Spion Kop.      There will probably be need for
   a new fire warning system, and the emergency lighting
   standards may not be adequate.      In the first Instance we
   think it better to wait for the police and fire service to
   suggest what is required.
          The police wish to have a new police office of a
   significantly better standard than the present one, with a
   separate room for the detention of ’wrong doers'.     It would
   probably be better to ask what they need at an early stage
   and with your permission we will do this.


   Effect on Ground Capacity
           If no new crush barriers were provided but the existing
   ones are all brought up to class A standard the ground capacity
   would become
          Seating approximately                 24,000
           Standing on Splon Kop                13,900

EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




          If all the new barriers which we have suggested
   are Installed the capacity will become
          Seating approximately              24.000
          Standing Splon Kop                 16.000
          Standing at West end               10,100

                                             50,100

          If it is required to Increase this capacity at some
   time in the future Splon Kop could be 'squared off' at the
   back using a steel framed structure and perhaps a further
   4000 places could be provided.    The Kop could also be
   roofed over, of course.

   costs but the following will give an indication of what may

           This total should not at this stage be taken as
    more than a broad guess.     We may have pleasant surprises
    but there could be shocks.      The total does not contain
    any allowance for the local authority's charges in
    connection with the issuing of the licence or for our
    professional fees.


    Future Action
           Subject to your approval we suggest that the next
    steps might be as follows :-

    1.     We should pass copies of all drawings to the police,
            the fire brigade, the city Building Surveyor and the
           County Council.     In addition to drawings showing
            the results of our surveys of the Kop, the Lepplngs
           Lane terrace and the south stand, we are preparing
            suitable drawings of the north and west stands,
           measuring from the photo-copies of Husbands drawings.

    2.      We should make firm proposals to the police and the
            fire brigade for the new crush barriers, together
            with our computation of the number of spectators, and
            invite comments including any suggestions of further
            measures which may be needed.

    3.      At the same time we should make detailed drawings and
            specifications for the strengthening work on the
            barriers which are known to be weak, andfor the con­
            struction of the new barriers, and obtain tenders.

    4.      We should request a meeting with the     police and the
            fire brigade to discuss the stands and to try to agree
            what may need to be done to bring them up to standard.

     5.     We shoulddiscuss in detail with    the   police their
            requirements for a police office, and prepare a detailed
            design.

     6.      We should discuss with the police and fire officer
            what other services such as alarms, communications
             etc. are needed, prepare an agreed scheme and
             obtain tenders.


     A Meeting with The Club
            You may feel that another meeting to discuss this
     report and the suggestions for further action, should be
     held shortly.     Dr. Eastwood will be out of the country
     for three weeks from 22 January so that the week beginning
     15 January would be appropriate.

                                                    REPORT ON GROUND CAPACITY


                     This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
        which is attainable.
               It deals in broad terms with the necessary strengthening
        and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
        calculations are made of the theoretical exit times.
                     Calculations of exit times are also made for each of
        the stands and reference is made to the observations which were
        made at the end of the third round cup-tie on 6 January, 1979.
                     The green guide has been used as a basis for our cal­
        culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
        will not be possible to satisfy ill the recommendations in the
        guide.            Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the
        fire officer and the police.

    Standing Accommodation
    (a)     Spion Kop
                   The general layout of Spion Kop is good.              It
           has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
           veil below the maximum laid down in the guide.           The
            slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
            for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                   The only questions therefore are the adequacy
           of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
           permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of
            the exits.
                   Where the barriers are adequate in strength
           and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
                                                           2
           of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m          of plan
           area.       Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
                                         2
           Kop is approximately 3120m        which would provide
           accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                   Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
           standards.       Category A must be able to withstand a
            test load of 6kN/metrewLdth (400 lb/foot approximately)
           and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
           In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
           and Brocklebank Ltd.       Of the 101 barriers on Spion
           Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb and
           a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
            incipient defect which needed attention.           Most of
            those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
           would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
            On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of a
            long barrier which was weak.       It should be emphasised
            that the general situation was satisfactory compared
           with most grounds.
                  Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
                                                                                                 SHEET   3.

                       barriers up to a uniform category A standard.                       It
                       should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
                       the tests and there may have been some deterioration
                       due to rusting.                Most of the barriers are made from
                       2§” diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
    .%                inches when new.                Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield’s
•                     atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
                       to more rusting than others and it is possible that
                       there will be an increase in the number needing attention.
                                  Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/m, the
                       maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
                       guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5                    to 2.9m
                       for slopes of 30°.                   These figures apply to 'peak viewing’
                       areas.        Most of Spion Kop has a slope of about 17°
                       for which the recommended spacing is 3.6m.                     The slope of the
                       upper part          changes to 25° for which the spacing is

                        3.1m.
        ^                         Whilst we believe it is arguable that parts of
        S               Spion Kop could be considered as not being ’peak
    1                   viewing areas’ we are prepared to accede to the police
                        view and use peak viewing area standards for all barriers.
                        This also applies to the stands at the west end of the
                        ground.
                                   We propose that the existing barriers should be
                        supplemented by new ones as shown in red on the attached
                        drawing 1610/1X.                   The green shaded area behind each
                        barrier shows the area which can then be assumed to be
                        available for spectators.                   This area is 2958m      which
                        at   54   p e r s o n s /1 0 m 2   gives a capacity of   15,973.        It
                        should be kept in mind that as many as 20,000 spectators
                        have been admitted to the Kop in the past.

                                                                                                         /

                  Spian Kop has three exits, one near each
            end and one at the top.       The total width of
            these three exits at their narrowest points is 12.5m.
            The guide assumes a maximum flow rate through such
            exits of 60 persons per minute for each 550mm of
            width.     Thus the theoretical time to discharge
            16,000 spectators from Spion Kop would be 11$ minutes,
            compared with a maximum of 8 minutes indicated by the
            guide.     We do not consider this to be a serious
            matter.     Rapid evacuation (in say 8 minutes) is very
             desirable for stands where there may be a risk due to
             fire, or explosion, or structural failure.        In the
             case of terracing it is only the impatience of spectators
             which might create danger.     We believe that for an
             interim period at least the evacuation time of 11$
             minutes should be acceptable.
                    The exits at each end of the terrace are
             reasonably free from hazards, except the one at the North

t            end passes under a bridge with a headroom below the
             recommended value of 8ft.      This defect could be
             removed by lowering the floor level, but we believe
             it is far from essential to have such a large headroom,
             and the cost of modification is not justified in an
             existing structure.
                    The exit at the back of Spion Kop would benefit
              from handrails dividing it into lanes.      Some remodelling
              of the approaches to the ramp may also be thought
              desirable.

                       The west terrace has a total area of 1480»       but

                     be made for circulation space as spectators have
                     to move     quite considerable horizontal distances
!                    to achieve good packing.       The full area would
                     justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
                     probably be appropriate to allow 10% as the equivalent


    ••
                     of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.
                     The barriers should be designed to match this figure
                     approximately.       Those barriers which cannot withstand
                     6kN/m should be appropriately strengthened, and extra
                     ones provided where necessary.
                                The extra barriers required to achieve
                     approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
                     attached copy of drawing 1610/2X.
                                The three exits have a total width of about
                      11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
                      to leave the ground.     Thus the terrace could be
                      emptied in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                                The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
                      should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.     There are
                      no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
                      exit.      But we feel this is of no consequence as
                      movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
                      and quick.
                      The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                                This area is also illustrated in the drawing
                      1610/2X.      The gross area available (there are no
                      gangways) is about 565 m2 .     Thus if the crush barriers
                      were adequate and the whole area is included the number
                      of spectators could be about 3,050.
                             Provided the existing crush barriers are
                      brought up to standard and supplemented in red as
                                                                  SHEET g

           shovn on our draving 1610/2X, the area vhich can
           be used in calculating spectator capacity is that
                                                    2
           shovn in green.   This area is about 535m corresponding
           to about 2900 spectators.    This vould bring the total
           standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                  The exits serving this part of the terraces
           are very adequate in vidth and there vill be no
           difficulty in emptying in eight minutes.


    Seating Accommodation
    (a)    The North Stand
                  The form of construction of this stand is
           such that it presents a minimum fire hazard.     The
           exits are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy
           the recommendations of the guide.
                  The exits are very marginally belov the
           recommended 1-lm vidth, but ve do not consider this
           to be of great consequence.
                  Gangvays are only 640mm vide for much of their
           length (they viden round the exit).   This is veil
           belov the green guide recommendation.   Hovever, it
           is clearly appropriate to take into account the
           general nature of the stand, the number as veil as
           the vidth of the gangvays, and above all the ease and
            speed   vith vhich spectators can evacuate the stand.
                    On 6 January ve counted the number of spectators
            leaving in successive minutes after the final vhistle.
            The figures vere 71, 72, 80 and 73.   Thereafter
            the number fell off as the spectators vere in no hurry.
            This established that in an emergency the green guide
            figure of 80 per minute (relating to a l'lm gangvay)
            can be achieved.    With 18 exits for 10,000 spectators
                                                                             SHEET   7,



         EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS




                    the average is 556 per exit. Thus the stand vould
                    empty in about seven minutes, vhich is vithin the
                    recommended limit of eight minutes.
                           Our observations in company with the fire
                    officers staff on 6 January shoved that everyone
                    had left this stand, apart from some people vho vere
                    in no hurry, in about six minutes, although ve also
     ^              counted about 40 per exit vholeft before   the   final
4)                  vhistle.    The overall pictureappears verysatisfactory
                    and ve suggest that this stand should be accepted
                    as not needing any significant modification.

             (b)    The West Stand
                           This stand is very similar to the north stand
                    in its construction.     We vere not able to accurately
                    assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
                    January because there vere many seats vhich vere unsold.
                    Hovever, there is every reason to believe that there
                    vill be no difficulty in vacating this stand vithin
                    eight minutes also.     There should be no need for
     A              significant modifications.

             (c)    The South Stand
                            The structure has been surveyed and appended
                    are prints of our dravings 1610/3, 4 and 5, vhich
                    shov the plans and cross-section.   Also attached is
                     a seating plan, draving No. 1610/6.
                            The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
                     has 5710 seats.    These are served by 12 exits (excluding
                     those serving the directors box) so that an average
                     of 476 people need to pass through each exit.   The
                     count by the fire officer’s staff on 6 January shoved
                     an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
                     exit vhich corresponds to an emptying time of about
                     seven minutes.    Indeed there vere very fev people


                                                                                          i /

                   still trying to get out six minutes after the final
                   whistle.    A few had no doubt left early and a few
                   were still standing around, but the stand had
                   substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                          Having left the top of the stand the spectators
                   have to make their way from the first floor landing
                   via one of three staircases.   Two of these are 3.6m
                   wide and the other 2.4.   This is equivalent to 17$
                   'lanes’ of 550mm.    At 40 people per lane, 700 people
                   pass per minute.    To discharge 5710 people (less
                   those in the directors box) will therefore take almost
                   exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.
                          At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
                   almost straight to the open air, through a compartment
                   which is separated from the main part of the building.
                   The third staircase passes through a wide lobby which
                   will probably need three sets of self closing fire
                   doors to separate it from the remainder of the building.
                   The club intends to move the paint store from the

    t              space behind this staircase.
                          The front, open-air part of the south stand is
                   well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
                   one passage.    This passage has a theoretical capacity
                   of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.
                   This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.      Because
                    the stand is open to the air and there is very
                    ready access to the pitch we do not think this rather
                    long emptying time is of any great consequence.


            General Requirements
                   The police and the fire officer, and possibly the
            Building Surveyor, will no doubt wish to discuss a number of
            matters.   Prior to holding a further formal meeting they
                                                                      SHEET

      will probably wish to study the drawings and to pay a
      further visit.   We would like to be present when any
      further inspection is made and would appreciate contact
      being made with Dr. Wood during Dr. Eastwood's absence
      which will extend to 15 February.
              If the police would like to suggest the kind of police
4)    post they would like, this can be considered by the club
      and drawings prepared by us as a matter of urgency.
              A meeting to discuss all aspects of the application
      might be held around say 16 February.
              In the meantime Eastwood & Partners will be checking
      the various electrical services so that we shall be in a
      position to discuss these at the meeting.


      Future Ground Capacity
             Following the upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
      out of such other works as may be required it is hoped the
      ground capacity will not fall below 50,000 made up as follows
              Seating approximately                  24,000
*             Standing on Spion Kop
              Standing at Leppings Lane end
                                                     16,000


              (total including N.W. corner)          10,100
                                                   50,100

              It will be recalled that in recent years agreement
      has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
      be admitted to the ground.      This involved of the order of
      19.000 - 20,000 spectators being on Spion Kop.        Indeed, it
      is believed that in the days when crowds of approximately
      70.000 were accommodated in the ground, the figure on Spion
      Kop probably approached 30,000.
             It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
      excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

    substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
    be required;

    (d)    Plan No. 6705/10A - same comments as for plan 9A;

    (e)    Plan No. 6705/11A - no objection in principle, but details of exact

(g)   Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved
by steep slopes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped" arrangements
to give foothold, the proposals are satisfactory but the possible need to
take measures on top of the wall to discourage persons from attempting to
climb over will have to be borne in mind;

(h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last year, the front
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered 5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;

(i)    Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;

(j)    Stewarding of New Gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May,
1985, it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by
Stewards, who must be fit, able and properly trained.


                                     Yours faithfully,

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                    Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
       Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.   We note
the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
by the Building Surveyors Department.     We believe that all the
calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
checking and comment.
       With regard to your detailed observations our response
is as follows *-
(a)    We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
the proposed extra security gate.     There is already a gate in
the 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the
police.    This same gate will still be available for the spectators
in emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
which will be under the control of the police.   This point may
perhaps be clarified during the Working Party's visit on 7 August.

(b)       The foundatinmsffor this fence are in fact already aligned in
the way pou suggest.
(c) and (d)
         We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
                                                             /
single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
walls.    The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
Studding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
durability, and would probably invite vandalism.

(e)      The refreshment area is under the most westerly
staircase up to the north west corner terrace.     There will
be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.

(f)      The handrail is to be at a height of 1250am (4* 1*)
above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
step.

(g)      The stepping of the Xece of the wall is achieved by 45*
chamfers which will not form good footholds.

(h)      Mx. Chester says that the club will certainly not
object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
the precise location can be discussed on 7 August.

(i)    As with point (a), we are not sure what is intended,
and the matter can be discussed on 7 August.

(j)      Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
taken care of by Mr. Chester.


         It will be much easier for your Working Party to
appreciate What is intended when they see the works under
construction.    There will also be an opportunity to see
the metal decking of the South stand.


                            Yours sincerely,




c.c.     Mr. R.H. Chester

      Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield on
                            7th August, 1985

           D.   I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)
           F.   Waterhouse (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.   Purpose of Meeting.

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "summer" inspection of the
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

2.   Ground Inspection.

A.   Leppings Lane End

The progress of the works to segregate visiting supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Working Party's meeting held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive's letter
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of 1st August.

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
checking and conxnent.

On the inspection, the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
to be the poor standard of workmanship in the construction of the new
dividing wall which was being built behind the Stand. The position of the
Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by
45 chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall
and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on the plan submitted).

As regards the single block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the walls were braced
by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted
the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the
dividing walls in the new toilet facilities evidently did not have any
foundations, apparently having been built straight onto the existing
concrete slabs. It was noted that there were some 9 inch thick brick walls
in the Male Toilets, it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
would be more likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

The Club pointed out that the new toilet facilities would not be completely
finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would
be left on site.

The position of the new refreshment area under the most westerly staircase
up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been built
straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by thePolice.
This gate would still be available for the use ofspectators in an
emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
Police would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. wide gap.
However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required. It
was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South
Central Terrace Pen.

As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
both the Stand and at the Access level.

IT WAS AGREED

(a)   that the condition of the internal walls in the new male and female
toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;

(b)   that the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
extended or have steps to provide easier access from the new 2 m. wide gap
formed by the new radial fence;

(c)   that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence should be provided from
the new South Central Terrace Pen;

(d)     that the advertising hoardings at the front of theupperseated      stand
area   should be securely fixed to the concrete wall;

(e)   that the spalling of the concrete of the wall at the front of the
upper seated stand area should receive attention as a matter of maintenance;

(f)     that the corrosion of the steel columns at the rear of the Stand
should receive attention on a maintenance basis.

B.     South Stand

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reported that the condition of the upper
concrete outer portion of the exterior wall of the Stand had been
investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.

It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the non-slip
surface was to conmence very shortly (and certainly be completed by the
start of the season).
IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand should largely overcome the flamaability problems inherent in such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they would ensure that the
wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
laying of the metal sheeting.

C.   Spion Kop

Messrs. Eastwood 4 Partners recalled that outline details of the Club's
proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of the
Officer Working Party by letter dated 22nd July. As part of that scheme,
the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed. Its present condition
remained acceptable with continuing maintenance.

In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which could
occur when large crowds were present.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new ®ate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
arrangement to assist access and egress.

D.   North Stand

The temporary storage facilities created by the erection of a timber wall
(in front of the Ladies' Changing Facilities in the Sports Hall) were
inspected.

IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
basis.

E.   Closed CircuitTelevision    Facilities

The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and outside
the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed Closed Circuit
Television System were explained to the Officer Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED

(a)   that a 2J kg. CO2 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the
Police Control Box and'the Disc Jockey Box;

(b)   that loose external   wires on the outside of the Boxes should be made
secure.

Oear Dick,
      Many thanks for your note of 12 August enclosing the
copy of David Vaughan's note of the nesting held at the ground
on 7 August.     A copy of jay letter to David Vaughan was sent
to you the same day so that our letters have crossed in the
post.
        You will see that I have taken up very strongly the
suggestion by Don Sherilf that the vorknanship in the brickwork
was poor and would lead to weakness.     It   is unfortunate that
David Vaughan did not record that I had completely refuted
what Don Sheriff said.     David now recognises that this was a
mistake but    iV putting the matter right by circulating a copy
of my letter.
      Turning to the natters on the second pagei-
■It was agreed"
My comments on the points you have in mind are as follows i-

(b)     This refers to the existing gate between the new 2m wide
        gap formed by the radial fence which will be used for
        police access only.   You will notice fron the wording
           David's minute that I persuaded then that steps oould
           be used.   I have interpreted        this as being from
           the inside only which means that we will not lose
           any of your advertising space.       We have added the
           provision of some timber steps on the inside to
           the work being carried by Gleeson.


0    (C)   The other radial fence forming the small visitors
           pen has left a length of terrace without a direct
           access on to the pitch. There is of course a gate
           at the top of the terrace connecting into the next
           pen and we had hoped that the police would accept
           that as an adequate means of exit in emergency.
           However at the meeting they made the point very
           strongly that if someone had to be got out of the pen
           which has no gate or if there was misbehaviour the
           police would only be able to get in via the neighbouring
           pen, passing up the terrace through the gate at the
           back and then down again in the isolated pen.      They
           considered this unacceptable.        I think that this
<•         particular item can be paid for out of the contingency
           sum and suggest that it be added to Gleeson's work.


     (d)   You will recall that when you and I went round with
           Superintendent John Freeman he pointed out that the
           advertising hoardings on the parapet of the seating
           area of the west stand were simply hookid over the
           parapet wall and some of the hooks had been bent*
           We agreed that a fixing would be provided. He had
           apparently reported this to David Vaughan so the
           matter ves raised again.  It is clearly a good point
           because any hooligans in the seated area could easily
           drop an advertising board on to people below.        Z have
           in mind that the hoardings can be fixed by a runner
           of timber and again subject to your approval, this
           can be carried out as part of the present works.
                                   V   f   II
(e)      This is a very minor matter which can be dealt with
         next year.


(f)      You will probably know that the bases of the steel columns
         behind the West stand have been queried year by year
      by Don Sheriff who has requested that exaavations be
      carried outto ensure hhat the steel is not rusting
      below ground level.      By chance Gleesons had exposed
      one of the columns and I was interested to see that it has
      not suffered badly.      However I have pointed out that the
      columns do not carry any load.        They form part of the
      previous structure and were chopped down to that level
      when the new concrete stand was built for the World
      Cup.     They merely form a frame within which the brick
      wall is built.     There is therefore no cause for concern.
      At the next meeting in February I will try to get this
      item deleted from the list.



      Quite a number of items have now been added at Police
request.     In addition there is the cost of the new gas main
and also unexpected coats in connection with the electricity
supply to the new refreshment area in the North West comer.
I am asking John Strange to check on all these items to see
whether they can be accommodated within the contingency sum
which we included in Gleesons contract. I^am ton holiday but
John w                       v next week.

                            g»fTT-»qation work at Lepplnos

                The segregation of supporters at the Leppings Lane
          end of the ground was first proposed soce time before
          Septanber 1981. We do not know the exact date but the
    ^     original request that schemes be looked at was made by
t       : South Yorkshire Police in the days when Mr. England was
          the Club Secretary. Some rough outline sfebemes were
          prepared at that time but the work did not proceed.
                in February thi. year the matter was raised again
          and more schemes devised. Approval of a schane was
          given by SYCC in May. Shortly after that another, much
          less expensive scheme was put forward. After agreeing
           several matter, of detail with SYCC and the Club,
           construction work eventually started on 22 July, 1985.
           The work is now almost complete.
                 Enclosed are copies of the following document,
           relating to the segregation worki-
                 a)   Our letter dated 9 April,to SYCC.

        d)    Their reply dated 10 May.
        e)    Our report on the tenders received   for the work
              dated 12 July.
         f)   A filled in copy of the relevantpage* of the
              Bill of Quantities received from Gleeson
              $Sheffield) Ltd.
        The scheme involved the alteration of existing toilets,
    the provision of new ladies toilets and refreshment
    facilities because segregating walls prevented access to t
    the existing toilets and refreshment bars by either the
    home or visiting spectators.
         Also included in the Contract were various items of
    ground safety work.   These are items 6 and 8, page 7/1 of
    the Bill of Quantities, items 1 to 4, page 8/1 for the
    repair of barriers or. Spion Fop which failed the load test
    earlier this year and items 1 to 3, page 9/1.
         Enclosed are copies of the following documents
^   relating to that safety work:-
C        g)   Minutes of a meeting with SYCC, held on 23
              January,- 1985.

             R. Woodhouse (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)*

1.    Welcome and Introduction

Mr. Vaughan pointed out that the Local Government Act, 1985, would abolish
the South Yorkshire County Council (and the other Metropolitan County Councils)
on 31st March, 1986. From 1st April, 1986, the Certificating Authority ur.d»r
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, would be the appropriate District
Council. In the case of the Hillsborough Stadium this would naturally be
the Sheffield City Council. For this reason, it had been suggested to the
City Council that appropriate representatives in addition to the Building
Surveyors' Division might find it useful to be present at the meeting, and
Mrs. L. Bashforth and Mr. J. Derricott were welcomed and introduced to the
remainder of the representatives present.

Mr. Vaughan took the opportunity of expressing appreciation and thanks to^
the representatives for the help and assistance which they had given to him
in his role as Co-ordinator of the Officer Working Parties since 1978. ttiere
had obviously been occasions when differences of opinion and interpretation
had occurred but, in the main, these had been resolved both amicably and
constructively.

For the Club, Dr. Eastwood thanked Mr. Vaughaa for his services and wished
him well for the future. Other representatives endorsed Dr. Eastwood's
remarks.

2.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was two-fold; firstly to discuss the further
details of development proposals at the stadium forwarded with the letter
dated 23rd December, 1985, f r o m Messrs. Eastwood and Partners and, secondly,
to carry out the "winter" inspection of the Stadium.

 A.   Development Proposals for the Spion Kop

 The further details were in addition to the comments set out in the letter
 dated 29th November, 1985, on the observations made following the Officer
 Working Party meeting held on 13th November.
      (i)    Sheeting of Outer Face

      Dr. Eastwood reported that the sheeting of the enlarged Spion Kop at
      the rear and sides would result in the structure being virtually
      sealed. In reply to queries from the County Fire Service, he confirmed
      that no storage would be allowed under the structure and that checks
      for any accumulations of rubbish would be undertaken on a regular basis.

      (ii)   Climbing of the-Inner Steel Frame

      As regards the possiblity of unruly spectators climbing the inner steel
      frame of the new structure, Dr. Eastwood reported that the bottom boom j
      member was now to be omitted. The resultant height of ovej 10 feet
      would make it very difficult for spectators to climb the structure.

      (iii) New Step and Barrier Layout

      Drawing No. 6648/56 was circulated and considered. This related to the
      new step and barrier layout on the Spion Kop, and Dr. Eastwood reported
      in particular on the discussions which he' had had with the Planning
      Authority as to the height of an intermediate or a low second rail to
      the barriers .where the drop to the gangway below could be over one metre
      in places. He sought the Officer Working Party's views*, and the merits
      of the options were considered.                        »

I    IT WAS AGREED that, in the view of the OfficerWorking Party, thebest
      option for a second rail in the areasdescribed was a low toe rail at
I    a height of some 200 mm.

B.   Facilities for the Disabled

To illustrate that the figures originally quoted to provide facilities for the
disabled at the foot of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) were not
unrealistic, Dr. Eastwood reported on the breakdown of the tender figures
(opened on Monday) for the enlarged, roofed Spion Kop. He still considered
that any such proposals would involve the loss of up to' 1,000 of the extra
5,000 spectator places which would be provided by the enlarged Spion Kop.
Other areas of the Stadium had also been considered and investigated, but
none could provide as large a flat, easily accessible area as that in front of
the North Stand, which had been successfully used for so long without any major
problems. Up to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants, used the area. The only
major drawback he saw was that when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
could be blown onto the disabled, despite the cantilever roof of the North
Stand extending virtually to the pitch. For this reason, the Club were willing
to roof an area from approximately the letter ''O'' on the results board to the
end of the Stand (nearest to the Spioa Kop) with a substantial roof, including
armoured glass where there might be a visibility problem, provided that this
was supported by the Officer Working Party.

Whilst accepting much of what Dr. Eastwood said, the Officer Working Party
(and the Police representatives in particular) still expressed some concern as
to whether making semi-permanent facilities for the disabled in front of the
North Stand was the appropriate and correct thing to do.

The Building Authority confirmed that, after further investigations, it was
considered that the disabled facilities requirements of the Building
Regulations 1985 did not appear to strictly apply to the roofing of the
enlarged Spion Kop.
IT WAS AGREED that, in the first instance, Dr. Eastwood vould prepare sketch
plans of the. suggested roofed disabled facilities in front of the North Stand
for consideration by the Officer Working Party.

C.    Ground Inspection
      (i5   West Terrace and Stand

The Police representatives confirmed that the revised segregation arrangements
to the rear of the Stand worked well on by far the majority of occasions.

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that the segregation rail in the upper seated area ’
of the stand could be moved within certain limits if the Police considered
that this would achieve a useful purpose.

IT WAS AGREED

(a)   that the additional advertisement hoardings at the front of the upper
seated stand area (nearest to the North-West Terrace) should also be securely
fixed to concrete wall;

(b)   that further areas of spalled concrete at the front of the upper
seated stand area should r e c e i v e d 'attention as matters of maintenance.
                                                                      *


       (ii)   North-West Terrace

IT WAS AGREED that the advertisement hoardings erected on the upper North-
West Terrace should be securely fixed.

       (iii) North Stand

The area for the suggested covered disabled facilities was inspected.

As previously mentioned by Dr. Eastwood, the possibility of providing an
increased width access to the pitch area (between the North Stand and the
Spion Kop) for possible use by emergency vehicles, as well as for maintenance
by the Club was discussed. The facility could be incorporated into the
enlarged Spion Kop proposals relatively easily.

It WAS AGREED that, whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
was not essential for their purposes, it could be useful for use by emergency
vehicles in certain situations and generally should be supported.

       (iv)   Spion Kop

Dr. Eastwood indicated the extent of the work to construct the enlarged,
roofed, Spion Kop, and confirmed that steps would be taken to prevent
unauthorised access to areas where work might be in progress during the
course of tKe season.
                       •2--='.   -            -/   —   ~          •
‘It w a s rn o t e d 'that the additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence m the
 front corner. nearest to tne South stand, with a stepped arrangement iu
 assist access and egress, had been provided.

       (v)    South Stand

 It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden floor of the upper
 portion of the Stand (with sprayed non-slip surface) had proved to be of an
 acceptable appearance in use, and generally appeared to provide a compromise
 solution to the flammability problems inherent in such wooden structures.

 IT WAS AGREED that its condition would continue to be monitored.

   Dear Dick,
                   Home Office Document on Fire Safety and
                         Safety at Sports Venues
            I have read through the part of the document which deals
   with Sports Grounds. I do not see any grounds for objecting to
   any of the recommendations. There will be little if any change in
( ® t h e procedure already established at Hillsborough. The document
     envisages that far more grounds for various sports will be designated,
   but in appropriate circumstances the procedures will not be so
   onerous as those relating to Hillsborough.       However, as it is a
   'top' ground we cannot expect that there will be much relaxation
   compared with the present arrangements.
            There is a welcome statement on page 11 that due account
   whould be taken of the need to keep the costs to clubs and local
   authorities to reasonable proportions. There are also various
   references to Safety Certificates reflecting the circumstances of
   each particular ground and the number of spectators who are likely
   to attend (see page 14).   These words may be useful to us in the
   future, although we can expect to have more stringent requirements
   c o m p a r e d w i t h some of t h e smaller clubs.
                   It is comforting to know that the new Green Guide will not
    become a statutory code, and will continue to be subject to
                                         j   11 i
interpretation.
         The reference to prohibition notices by either the fire
authority or the local authority on page 19 may cause concern to
some clubs.   But in paragraph 2.38 on page 20 there is a clear
implication that it is only necessary to reduce the risk to
an acceptable level, rather than trying to remove all risk.   This
wording will help curb excessive demands, and may be useful to
us sometimes in negotiations.
         I am returning the document herewith.


                          Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                                                                    "7UT1

  Dear Sir,
  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

  In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
  condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
  have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
   received them as yet.
   The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
   with the stadium and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
   receive is very satisfactory.

   The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
   information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. Some points in the
   letter have now been further clarified as follows

   (a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
   from the walkways.
   (b) As far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they will be
   dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

    (c) Gates must be unlocked and stewarded at all ti»ea, during matches: if this
    cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

    I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
    particularly like to refer to the comments which are made in respect of final
    exit gates. As you can see from the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
    tSe sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
    their useful life they must be replaced with outward opening doors. The Fire
    SiiJcahive also produced a drawing (a copy of which I enclose) to show a
    w t e r arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry from the
    outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this hook
    type arrangement will be more easily used in the event of an emergency than the
    current locks, about which they are very concerned.

    Encs.                                                                                       734005 - Mr. Bownes

      possible.

^      For the attention of Mr. D. M. Bownes


       Dear Sir,

       SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 ■ SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

       Thank you for your letter dated 3rd November, 1986, in respect of the above
       Club.

       Please find below my observations in response to outstanding matters.

       An inspection of the ground was carried out on 17th November, 1986.        The
       comments appended below do not take into account the numbers of persons using
       individual areas, lateral and radial gangways or units of exit widths, as
      lit is assumed tnat from previous correspondence and documentation that the
       various working parties and committees have adequately dealt with these n.enis.

       MEANS OF ESCAPE IN CASE OF FIRE

       North Stand

       Timber framed and clad buildings are constructed and located under the stand. -

       The only reference as to the acceptance is minuted in meeting dated 7.8.35
       in which one large store for bulky items was agreed on a tem£orar^ basis.

       There is also no record to indicate whether these buildings have been treated
       with fire retardant paint or solutions. Confirmation is required as to treat­
       ment of these buildings.

       Spion Kop

              Timber framed and clad unit located on main central exit route has not
              received any approval, no approach has been made by the Club for its
              installation, this should be removed immediately.
                                                       •

               part of the emergency exits. The gates for reasons of security, fasten

        South Stand

        The accommodation is divided into four a.eas.

         A.Ground        floor offices,   directors suite,         players   area, functionsuite,
                   kitchen etc.
                   First floor, upper stand walkway, press lounge, players lounge, paint
                   stores, disused bar area.

         C.        Lower stand, uncovered stand seating.

            D.      Rear stand, covered seating.

            With respect to the four areas, the following observations are made:-

            A.     Ground Floor:-
                         (i)   During normal working   hours most             ^         office^we.

                               ST              avaiiable for use by ^n y person within the area.

                                                           \ 9 ^
  (ii)   A number of rooms at this level i.e. kitchen, laundry, stores
         and directors' suite ventilate via openable windows and/or extract
         fans into the long corridor between areas A and C above.       It
         also appears that a number of the openable windows are protected
         by corrugatedi lightweight plastic sheeting.

         The separation between the corridor and such ground floor areas
         should be to a minimum half hour fire resistance, any ventilation
         requirements being met by ducting to outside on the South Wall.

 (iii)   All storage should be removed from stairway enclosures and these
         areas always maintained free from such storage.

First Floor:-

   (i)   Again, a number of rooms i.e. players' lounge, press lounge,
         the store room previously used as a licensed bar and the paint •
         store ventilate into this area.     Any ventilation requirements
         should be met by ducting to outside on the South wall.

  (ii)   Valves should be fitted to the gas supply line to each of the
         five refreshment positions in order that the supply can be cut
         off should an emergency arise.

 (iii)   All timber construction within this area should        be suitably
         treated so as to be flame retardant.

  (iv)   The paint stores contain a quantity of flammable paints and
         mixtures and present a hazard which it is considered should
         be removed from this area.     Proposals to relocate the stores
         should be discussed with the Fire Authority before any work
         is commenced in order that suitable siting and any need for
         licensing under Petroleum legislation can be ascertained.

   (v)   The timber constructed cupboard and the portable sales kiosks
         should be removed from this area.

  (vi)   In the cleaners' cupboard to this area, the fire       resisting
         separation between the ground and first floor levels   is breached
         by the passage of cables through a wall.    The area    around the
         cables should be infilled with material to ensure       a minimum
         fire resistance of thirty minutes.

 (vii) All rooms onto the upper stand walkway should be separated from
       it by minimum half hour fire resisting construction, any doors
       being to the same standard and made self closing onto 25 mm
       rebates.

(viii) Spaces above toilet accommodation are being used for storage
       purposes. Again, these areas must be maintained clear of storage.

Uncovered Seating Area:-

The means of escape from this area is along the corridor in front of
the rear part of the stand.   Should this route not be available then
evacuation onto the pitch is possible subject to persons having the
ability to climb over the front wall on to the pitch perimeter track.
This wall is approximately 1.5 m high at the Spion Kop end decreasing
to 1 m high at the West end.

                                             - 4 -



             To facilitate easier forward evacuation on to the pitch ‘it is recommended
             that openings be provided in' the wall at the foot of radial gangways.

     D.      Covered Seating Area (Rear Stand)

             The means of escape from this area is not considered to be satisfactory
             in that escape is possible in one direction only, this being down through
             areas described in A and B above.

             Subject to all the recommendations outlined in A and B above and made
             later in respect of automatic fire detection being implemented, the
             means of escape from the covered seating area would be acceptable.

      AUTOMATIC FIRE DETECTION
      In 1979 the working party discussed the provision of automatic fire detection
      in the South Stand.

    ® t   is recommended that such provision should be made in all areas beneath
)        • seated area of the stand as soon as possible.   The system should also
      cover the Tavern Club which has a direct link on to the first floor corridor
      of the South Stand.

      The automatic detection provided should be tied in to the existing fire warning
      system.

      In order that persons using the Spion Kop can receive early warning of any
      fire occurring in the "Stands" Club, it is also recommended that automatic
      fire detection be provided in that Club.

      EMERGENCY LIGHTING

      Spjon Kop
      The emergency lighting has yet to be tested - no test certificate received.

    ^fcfvithT North and West Stands

       n letter dated 12th November, 1980, from Eastwood and Partners, it was
      suggested that following test certificates dated 11th August, 1980, a period
      of 5 years should elapse before re-testing for South Stand ana 2 years for
      North and West Stands. As of today no record appears to exist as to whether
      these areas have been re-tested or that the test certificates together with
      maintenance records have ever been re-presented.      The emergency lighting
      system should therefore be re-tested for the whole of the grouno and test
      certificates produced.   In addition the whole of the system should conform
          to B.S. 5266.

          fire alarm

      West Stand
          Existine call points to be relocated to accessible positions outside of
          S S ,     areas and be increased to cover the upper areas of the stand.

          North Stand

          As West Stand above.


                                                      I Qc T -
South Stand

This stand appears to be well covered with regard to the provision and siting
of call points.   %

Indicator Control Panel

 The indicator/control panel is situated within the Police control centre
"between South and West Stand.    Whilst this is reasonable for match days it
 is not considered to be practical for the majority of the time.

This panel should be duplicated with control at each location which should
be:-

1.     Police control box

2.     Main office reception area

FIRST AID AND FIRE-FIGHTING EQUIPMENT

  ne current standard and displacement of First Aid fire-fighting equipment
 is considered satisfactory.

GATES

The sliding gates already in situ in the ground have been accepted by this
Authority after due consideration and account being taken both of their location
and the fact that they are of existing construction.     I would wish, however,
to point out that it is the view of this Authority that doors required for
means of escape should open outwards and it is recommended that notice be
given to the Club to the effect that when any such sliding gates are to be
replaced then their replacements must open outwards even if this involves
structural work to recess the opening to avoid impinging over footpaths.
While the sliding gates remain in use however, they must be immediately avail­
able for use from the inside by any person should an emergency situation
arise. Any method of securing the gates against illegal entry from the outside
must be by way of a simply operated device not requiring the use of a key,
additional security being afforded by the presence of a steward who should
be familiar with the emergency evacuation procedures for the ground.

 If there are any queries on these matters please do not hesitate to contact
 the Officer concerned.

 Yours faithfully,




 Divisional Command^

   Dear Sirs,

   Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Gate Release Devices

   I refer to your letter of 19th August and the enclosed plans of a proposed gate
   release device.

   The proposed device has been discussed by the various Authorities at some length
   and It has now been suggested rhatj^erhapsa prototype device could be fabricated
   and fitted to one of the gates for testing purposes. It has also been mentioned
   that with some modifications the proposed device could also be used for the
   sliding gates at Sheffield Onlted Football Club.

   I look forward to hearing from you with your coaments on this matter.

   Tours faithfully,




   Head of Department

        DESCRIPTION:                        One hydraulic pump complete with two hydraulic cylinders.
                                            The force on the cylinders, under an applied force is
                                            measured by a pressure gauge mounted on the pump.


        IDENTIFICATION:                     Pump: D948005
                                            Gauge: BGF 168 SR
                                            Cylinder 1: 04773               Model RC 53AF9N

        METHOD

        The calibration was carried out in a Grade 0.5 lever arm testing machine                                           in
        terms of the Technical unit of force the ton force (tonf). The uncertainty                                         of
        the forces applied during the calibration is _+0.5^«

        Three tests were made on each cylinder.

        Tests were made to determine the reading indicated on the gauge at fixed loads.

    For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell


    Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                      Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                            Barrier Testing 1988

         Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
    part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
    The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
    128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
    the lower area of terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
^The    location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
    1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
         The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
    procedure set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
    Grounds*•
         In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
    withstood the applied load.   A clip over the rail of barrier 124
    broke before reaching the full test load.
         Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
    that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
    tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those t sted on the
    Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
    load.

       The rail on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
replaced now.    There w a s also a lot of movement of the rail on
barrier 144, when tested, and we also recommend that that rail
is also replaced.
     As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
the start of the coming season.
     Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
results of the barrier tests.



                                Yours sincerely,

                               SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE
                                                        REF:       Fl/CWC/RK
     FROM:    Inspector Calvert                         STATION/0E9T: Hammerton Road
     TO:      The Chief Superintendent - 'F' Div        DATE:      11 June 1986

              SUBJECT:   POLICING - HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND


              I refer to the memorandum dated 8 May 1986, requesting suggestions
              from various Officers who have been intimately concerned with the
              policing at Hillsborough.

              The policing of the ground is by and large a fairly smooth affair
              but I believe that we could considerably enhance our efficiency
              with certain changes which could be made by the Club in their
              procedures.                    _

              Inspector Creaser has highlighted various of these and all of them
              have been shown before when we have made approaches to the Club,
              in many cases with very little success.  One of the greatest
              problems we have is access to-the ground, particularly at the
              Leppings Lane end.  The redesigned turn stiles do not give any­
              thing like the access to the ground, either on the Leppings Lane
              terraces or in the West Stand, needed by away fans.

              On occasions last season when large numbers attended, we had away
              supporters who were justifyably irate because of the inefficiency
              of the system , which was turned on the police and could have
               resulted in public disorder.

              One of the points which is not mentioned is the access fci home
              supporters at the Penistone Road end where ticket holders at major
              matches do not have sufficient turn stiles to allow smooth access.
              There is a gross lack of flexibility in the manner in which turn
              stiles operate at the Penistone Road end for the Spion Kop and
              the North Stand, which may well be aggrevated if more home fans
              decide to use the Kop now it is covered.

               I have in the past suggested at the Club that they look at the
               problems, both of allowing ticket holders easy access and stream­
               lining the entry for paying customers by using a number     of'correc
               money turn stiles', as is the case   at other grounds.

               Inspector Creaser mentioned my interest in the manner in which
               packing is carried out on the Leppings Lane terraces.  The location
               of the crash barriers on these terraces at the entrances caused
               considerable congestion and I believe that in the event of emerg­
               ency evacuation, the location of these barriers would prevent
               access to the tunnels.

               I am aware that there is a statutory requirement as set out in
               the 'green book' giving the number  of barriers required      incertain
               areas, but it may well be that now   is the time to look at the
               positions of certain of the barriers with a view to alleviating
               the problems outlined above.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield United Football Club and
Sheffield Wednesday Footbal1 Club

I am writing to ask for your comments in writing as to the condition of the
above two stadia under the 1975 Act from the Fire Service point of view-

What I would like from you is written confirmation that as far as the Fire
Authority is concerned both stadia meet your requirements under the 1975
legislation.

If it should be that there are outstanding matters which require attention
please detail these in your response; I think it would be helpful to all parties
if any defects outstanding were fully detailed so that action could be taken to
remedy them.

Please be advised that I aa aware of the south stand roof problem at Shefffeld
Wednesday and as you know I am taking steps to ascertain the Club's position on
that problem.

I hope you will be able to let me have your rnply to this letter in the near
future.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

         SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB
         AND SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

         I refer to your letter dated 13 November 1986.

         Both stadia, so far as the Police are concerned, meet our requirements
         under the 1975 legislation.

         Co-operation afforded by both clubs is very satisfactory with the
         exception of the lack of CCTV facilities at Bramall Lane. It is hoped
         that this can be remedied as soon as possible as it will be a valuable
         asset to us in effectively policing the ground.

         Yours faithfully

 Dear S i r ,

 S a f e t y o f S p o r t s Grounds Act 1975 - S h e f f i e l d Wednesday F o o t b a l l Club

 In November 1986 I ask e d both t h e P o l i c e and F i r e S e r v i c e to comment on the
 c o n d i t i o n of your stad iu m h a v in g regard to the p r o v i s i o n s of the 1975 A c t . I
 have a l s o asked th e B u i l d i n g Surveyor to make s i m i l a r comments but I have not
 r e c e i v e d them as y e t -

The P o l i c e have i n d i c a t e d t h a t they are q u i t e s a t i s f i e d wit"h the sta d iu m and
have i n d i c a t e d t h a t the d e g r e e o f c o - o p e r a t i o n which t h e y r e c e i v e i s v e r y
satisfactory.

The F i r e S e r v i c e h a v e , how ever, made a number of comments and I a t t a c h f o r your
 i n f o r m a t i o n a copy o f t h e i r l e t t e r to me o f 18th February.                     I t h i n k the l e t t e r
i s l a r g e l y s e l f - e x p l a n a t o r y but I would p a r t i c u l a r l y l i k e to r e f e r to the
comments which are made i n r e s p e c t of f i n a l e x i t g a t e s .                    As you can s e e from ths~
xct-i-er tr.e F i r e S e r v i c e a r e concerned about                      s l i d i n g g a t e s and have i n d i c a t e d
t h a t as and when t h e y r e a ch the end o f t h e i r u s e f u l l i f e t h e y must be r e p l a c e d
w ith outward o p e n in g d o o r s .             The F i r e S e r v i c e have a l s o produced a drawin g (a
copy of which I e n c l o s e ) to show a b e t t e r arrangement f o r s e c u r i n g t h e s l i d i n g
g a t e s a g a i n s t f o r c e d e n t r y from the o u t s i d e during the c o u r s e of the game.                      Tbs?

Would you p l e a s e l e t ' me have your comments on the F i r e S e r v i c e l e t t e r                                               as soon as

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Ground* Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

 In Noveaber 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to c o n e o t on the
 condition of your stadiua having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act.      1
    V   !° T   d th* Buildin* Surveyor to make similar contents but I have not
 received thea as yet.

3 ^ K P^ iC*    indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
with the stadiua and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
receive is very satisfactory.

The Fire Service have, however, made a number of coaments and I attach for you>
information a copy of their letter to ae of 18th February.  Soae points in the
letter have now been further clarified as follovs:-

(«) The tiaber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited awav
from the walkways.                                                    7

(b) As far aa the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they will be
dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

(c) Gates aust be unlocked and stewarded at all tiaes, during aatches: if this
cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
particularly like to refer to the consents which are aade in respect of final
              » 700 f ! “ * fT<m the letter the Flre Service are concerned abou :

               I note your request for a report on the condition of the above
               Stadium.

               You will appreciate that to carry out a complete survey of all
               parts of this complex is a long and time consuming job which
               should not be approached in anything other than a thorough
               manner.

               I have therefore yet tc find available diary time for my Officers
               to spend on this site.

               A report will be sent to you after a complete inspection has been
               undertaken.

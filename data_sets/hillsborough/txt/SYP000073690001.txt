                                 We travelled along the M62 motorway then went                     into Manchester

                      and stopped for a drink.         After we'd had a drink we carried on to

                      Sheffield.     We arrived there about          11.30 am (1130).          We parked about a

                      mile and a half from the ground.           We had a slow walk to the ground,

                      arriving near the Leppings Ln e n t r a n c / a b o u t         12.15 <1215).    Just to

                      satisfied we got on a bus and/went out of the area to get a pint.                           We

                      got off the bus and went        i srxo a pub,     I c a n ’t remember what       pub it was.

                      We stayed in there till /about 2.20 pm (1420) and caught a bus back to

                      the ground.     The pub atfasn’t that far from the ground because                  it was

                      packed with Liverpool fans having a few drinks.                     We got off the bus

                      and walked towards the ground.          Policemen were on all the road

                      junctions.     We walked with the crowd towards the ground and we could

                      see that there was a lot of people outside aoi^/Turnst i l e s.                  We got to

                      way into this crowd and started ta^make our way towards the

                      turnstiles.     It was packed outs/Tde but I felt comfortable                   in it.    The

                      in this crowd for about 5 minutes and during this time I could hear

                      the mounted Policeman to the right of the turnstiles shouting to the

                      mass of people to stop pushing and stop panicking.                      All of a sudden

                      this mounted Policeman said,         "I don't know what you're going mad for

                      w e ’ve opened a gate     round the corner."

                      He pointed to the right of the turnstiles.                     We all   ran through the

                      gate.   This was about 2.50 (1450).             All five of us went through the

            intended to stay there and watch the match.               We were then being

            pushed very slowly forward.            Then we stopped,    we could n’t go in any

            direction at all and it felt as>tfhough the life was being pushed out

            over this f e j / c e    into the next pen.      We walked to the rear of the pen

            and re-cliifibed the fence.          We were then pulled up into the West

            jBtand.    from there       I could see Police and Stewards        pulling people out

            over the perimeter fencing and fans carrying hoardings to and fro

            across the goalmouth area.            I was shocked to see the chaos and

            bodies down on the pitch because when I had been in the crowd I

            c o u l d n ’t see a thing    I was motionless,     the only thing I could move

            were my eyes and they were facing into the stands.                 I looked for the

            other three I had travelled to the game with and I eventually saw them

            on the pitch.           I tried to get back down and onto the pitch but the

            Police w o u l d n ’t let me on the pitch.         I left the ground about 4.25 pm

            <1645).      I asked a policeman with a flat cap if the match was going to

            be played.       This bobby said "no w a y ’ so we w jg ftt back to the car.           My

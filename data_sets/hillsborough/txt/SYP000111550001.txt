                horses were             unable           to      control        t he     m ^ r ^ y ^ o f         the    crowd.

                I think          that      th e    time w o u l d            be a b o u t      c^OOpm when                                              was

                closed        to    vehicles             in the         interests             of    safety.           By this           tim e,       the

                c ro w ds ,      many who          were          now c l ea r l y w ^ j ^ e ^ P o r ^ d ^ . n k , w ere                 filling            the

            whole           width       of      th e     r o a d.       It    r emained an              impossible           task          to     control

                t hem.        As    the      kick-off             time       got    closer          more       and more          fans attempted

                to    gain       entry       through             the L e p p i n g s       Lane       turnstiles.                It s o o n b e c a m e

                obvious          that      they were              getting          frustrated            by t he       slow movement                    into

                the    ground.             As     th e      crowd ar o u n d            the    turnstiles             inn^ased              they

                started to           push a n d             sh o ve ,    tempers           were       f r ^ i r K ^ myself              and       other

                officers           were      being          ve^b|^^^^abii^d.                       There       seemed       little          we     could

                do.    At     one    stage,            as     requested            by P S P r o c t o r ,        I followed                him     i nt o     the

                crowd and tried                   to a p p r o a c h         the    turnstiles,                hoping       to        advise         the

                crowd       to     stop      pushing             before       injuries             occurred.           I was          in f a ct

                separated           frorri P S P r o c t o r            by a P o l i c e           h or s e,    and    I l ost          sight        of

                him.        At t his         point          I repeatedly                shouted        out at         the    c r o w d a r o u n d me

                to    stop       pushing.              This       was    useless,             nobody       took       any    notice,              and most

                seemed        to    laugh         o ff      t he a d v i c e       or    continue          to    verbally abuse                    me a n d

                other       officers            there.            The    pushing           continued and               intensified.                     I made

            my way            nearer         to    t he       edge      of    the       cr o wd ,     somewhere         next          to    the      road.          I

      there       w#re     any        persons         being          injured        nearer        to    the     turnstiles.

      could       not    see w h a t          had     caused          this       b ut                                                                    n

      that     serious           injuries            or    damage        would          have     occurred            outside          the

      entrances.               Also      at     this        point       I c an      r ec al l     l a r ge     numbers           of

      considerably               to    t he     numbers           entering          the     entrance           at     the    s a me        time.

                      already         dead     but     efforts,             nevertheless,           continued unsuccessfully                        to

                      revive         them .        I eventually assisted                     other      officers,          and also

                      supporters,             in    carrying           three       apparently          dead young men              from      the

                      c o u l d not      identify           any     of      them.

                      I remained           inside       t he      ground,          on t he      pi tc h,   until      most       of    the

                      supporters           had      le ft    t he      ground.         I was       completely         stunned          by all       t hat

                      it w a s       extremely         lucky        that      no    serious        injuries         had    occurred          outside.

Police Constable 276 M B Bobinson   -   F.2. Ecclesfield

F.A. CUP SEMI-FIMAL. HILLSBOROUGH, SATURDAY 15th APBIL 1989.



On Saturday 15th April 1989t I commenced duty at 9»OOamt    Ecclesfield
Police Station, from where I was transported with other Officers to the
Hillsborough Football Ground, where a full briefing subsequently took
place•

I was detailed to Serial 19 together with P.S. 323 Proctor and ten other
Constables. Our duties were initially outside the ground, at the Leppings
Lane entrances, supervising arriving Liverpool supporters, receiving and
searching arriving coaches, and general public order duties. This duty
was in fact the same as I and many of my colleagues perform at most
football matched; at Hillsborough, has been well tried and tested, and
myself and,I am sure, the other Officers present, were well aware of
what was required.

I arrived with my serial at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at some
time shortly after 11.00am. We were met by Inspector Sykes who briefed us
on our particular duties. We then went out into Leppings Lafae and took up
positions in the 'mouth' of the entry to the ground and the Leppings Lane
turnstyles, alongside Leppings Lane road itself.

On reaching Leppings Lane I imediately noticed that there were already a
large number of Liverpool supporters in the area, some walking around, some
stood around in small groups. The turnstyles were not open at this point.
From the outset, I had cause to converse with many supporters, all of whom
at this time were very amicable. I was continually approached by supporters
who had arrived early and who were asking one of a limited number of
questions, namely:- Where was the nearest pub or beer-off?, Where could they
get something to eat?, Where a particular entrance to the ground was?, and
Did I know where any tickets could be bought?

All the supporters were in good humour, and were dealt with accordingly. They
continued to walk aroundi or gather in groups, the numbers building steadily
all the time. More and more fans arrived and it soon became noticable that
many had been drinking, many were in fact walking around near to my location
carrying several cans or bottles of beer, and openly drinking from them. On
'normal' match days I am certain this in itself would not have been tolerated
by my serial, but the point was reached where there were simply too many of
them acting in this manner. There was the occasional loud mouth who appeared
worse for drink, but again as time went on, these became more and more noticable.

I cannot recall the exact time that the turnstyles were opened, but I can recall
that when they were, there was      no apparent rushby      the supporters in theareat
get into the ground. They were      stood about in groups of increasing size,andthen
they began taking up positions on nearby walls, sitting and drinking beer etc.
There were many people who had obviously arrived without tickets, they vere
openly approaching other people and asking to buy tickets. These people were in
fact a continual nuisance, and were being repeatedly asked to move away from
the entrance to the turnstyles.

As time went on it became increasingly difficult for all Officers, even the
mounted Officers, to maintain good order in the Leppings Lane area. The crowds
were too plentiful and as the day went on they seemed less willing to respond
to any Police advice. Very large groups continued to stand around outside and
refused to enter the ground as      advised. Becauseof      the numbers involved,and
the relatively small number of      Officers presenttodeal with them, thistask

soon became impossible. It was not possible to control the crowds on the road
or at the entrances to the ground. Even the Horses were unable to control the
majority of the crowd.

I think that the time would be about 2.00pm when Leppings Lane was closed to
vehicles in the interests of safety. By this time, the crowds, many who were
now clearly worse for drink, were filling the whole width of the road. It
remained an impossible task to control them. As the kick-off time got closer
more and more fans attempted to gain entry throughthe Leppings Lane turnstyles.
It soon became obvious that they were getting frustrated by the slow movement
into the ground. As the crowd around the turnstyles increased they started to push
and shove, teppers were fraying, myself and other Officers were being verbally
abused. There seemed little we could do. At one stage, as requested by P.S. Proctor,
I fo&lowed him into the crowd and tried to approach the turnstyles, hoping to
advise the crowd to stop pushing before injuries occurred. I was in fact seperated
from P.S. Proctor by a Police horse, and I lost sight of him. At this point I
repeatedly shouted out at the crowd aroundst me to stop pushing. This was useless,
nobody took any notice, and most seemed to laugh off the advice or continue to
verbally abuse me and other Officers there. The pushing continued and intesified.
I made my way nearer to the edge of the crowd, somewhere next to the road. I
could see that the crowd near the turnstyles was very tightly packed, many were
climbing up onto the perimeter wall of the ground seemingly to escape the crush
rather than gain easier access. The pushing nevertheless continued and was at its
worse not long before 3*00pm. I can recall a Police Officer shouting out over a
vehicle loudspeaker to the crowd, advising to stop pushing, but the advice was
ignored. I recall thinking that there was soon going to be injuries if the pushing
didnt stop, although from ■yposition I could'nt see if there were any persons
being injured nearer to the turnstyles.

    I can recall that there was a point when there wasa sudden surge forward by the
    crowd, obviously by movement near the turnstyles. I could not see what had caused
    this but I assumed that a Gate had been opened to relieve the pressure. Had this
    n t been done, I do believe that serious injuries or damage would have occurred
    outside the entrances. Also at this point I can recall large numbers of supporters
    rushing to the entrances from Leppings Lane. I saw than run across the road from
    a wall where many were sitting or stood near by. My own belief is that these
    people did not have tickets, and that on seeing the sudden rush into the ground,
    realising that a gate had been opened, they too joined the rush. This obviously
    added considerably to the numbers entering the entrances at the same time.

    Supporters continued to enter the ground, but shortly after 3*00pm, on hearing
    radio messages requesting urgeat assistance in the ground, I went with other
    officers into the ground, onto the pithh, near the Leppings Lane terracing.

    I first of all thought that a pitch invasion had taken place, bu it was sonn
    apparent that the incident was much moee serious. As soon as it was apparent that
    people were getting seriously injured in the crush on the terracing, with other
    officers, and supporters, I first off all recall trying to break down a strip of
    the perimeter fencing to the right og the goalmouth in order to get to a person
    who if not already dead, was very seriously injured. This was eventually done,
    the man lifted through the broken fence. He was carried onto the pitch and attended
    to by other Officers. I believe he was dead at this time.

    From this point I asisted in helping all present in lifting obviously dead people
    from the terracing, and also assisting injured people onto the pitch. I cannot
    say how manjr dead bodies I helped remove from the terracing, but I believe it
    must have been in double figures. On three occasions I assisted other Officers
    who I could not name, in attempting to rescusitate three people, two young boys
    and a man of about 25-30 years. I can recall thinking that they were already dead
    but efforts nevertheless continued, unsuccessfully to revive them. I eventually
    assisted other officers, and also supporters, in carrying three apparently dead
young men fro® the pitch at the Leppings Lane end, to the area near to the
gymnasium, I did not stay with any of these bodies, other officers remained,
and I could not identify any of them.

I remained inside the ground, on the pitch, until most of the supporters had
left the ground. I was completely stmnned by all that had happened and could
not initially understand how it could have happened. I was not in the ground
when the incident began, but it is my opinion that, being present outside
the Beppings Lane entrances, it was extremely lucky that no serious injuries
had occurred outside.

1.          I   reported         for    duty      at    Rawmarsh           Police       Station           at      8.00     am

             on    Saturday,        15 A p r i l         1989-        My    Serial          along         with others

             was    c o n v e y e d by F o r c e         coach       first       to    Rotherham               to c o l l e c t

             other    officers             and    then    to     Hillsborough                where        we     attended

             the    briefing        for      the    Semi       Final.

2.          I was     in    charge         of    Serial        56    under       the g u i d a n c e        of     Insp.

             Newey    from       C.2       Sub    Division.

3.          Following        t he      briefing         at     Hillsborough             I was        deployed             along

             with    my    Serial          from    11.15       am    onwards,          on       Rawson         Spring       Road.

             My    Serial    was       the       "Reception          Committee"              for    the        Notts.

             Forest       fans    arriving          in    mini       buses,        which         were      all       to   be

             parked       along     Rawson         Spring       Road.        Several             private           cars     were

             also    parked       in       the    car    parks       along       that        road.

            The     fans    that       I    camein       contact          with     during          t he    course         of

             this    duty    appeared             for    the    main       part       to    be     in     good       spirits

            and     looking       forward          to 'the      game.

            The     m a j o r i t y of the        fans       appeared        to       have      arrived            and    entered

            t he    ground        before         the    kick        off    time       and    there         had been         no

problems,             although         it was          obvious           t hat     a    l a rge      number       of     fans

heading          towards        the      ground         had       been        drinking.

By 3.00          pm    the     crowds          in H e r r i e s      Road/Penistone                   Road       had

thinned          out a n d      there        was       just a few              late       comers        rushing

towards        the      turnstiles              and     the       o dd    drifter          t ha t     you

always        get      who    turns       up at         every match and                    hangs        around

outside        th e     ground         un t i l      ful l    time        because          he     hasn't         got     or

can't       a f f o r d a ticket.

By 3.05          pm    I had      g at hered my Serial                        together          a n d we     started

to m a k e     our      way     towards           Claywheels              Lane         for m e a l .        At

th is    time         I could       hear        on     the       rad io a        lot      of    transmissions

coming        from      the L e p p i n g s          Lane     end        of   the       ground with              regards

to    the     crush      of     f a ns    outside            the     turnstiles                and    I heard          the

message        go      out    for      the      gates        to    be     opened.              It wa s      then       that

we were        stopped          on P e n i s t o n e         R o a d at       th e      junction         of H e r r i e s

Road     by S u p t .        C h a p m a n who         ordered           us   to       enter      the    ground

because        the L i v e r p o o l         f a ns     were       on     the      playing           area.        I took

my Serial             into    the      ground          from       the P e n i s t o n e         Road     e n d a n d we

entered        the      playing          area        between         the N o r t h S t a n d a n d               the

Ko p .

On    entering          the     playing           area       I could          see a        large        number         of.

fans     on    the      p i t c h at      the L e p p i n g s            Lane      end     of     the    ground

a n d at      this      time      I thought             t h at     there         had     been a         pitch

invasion and             t ha t     we    had      been       s ent       into       the       ground       to    clea r

the     pitch...        I along          wi th my Serial                  ran a c r o s s         the    pitch         to

offer      assistance             to     the      few    officers             who      were      already         there.

At    first      I tried          to     t alk     to    the       fans       to     get       them     to m o v e      off

the    pitch      but        I was       met      by    hostile           reactions             and     phrases          like

"Get     fucked"         and      " T h e r e ’s p e o p l e        getting            killed         in t h e r e "

These      are    phrases           t hat      you      h ea r     regularly when                 you get a

                                                                                                                   R 169

large        crowd who4 are               all       pushing          and      shoving          so     I was        not

u n du l y w o r r i e d and was                   still       treating            the     situation              as a

pitch        invasion.              It was          not      until       I got        nearer          to    the     fence

at     the L e p p i n g s         Lane       end      t hat      I realised             that       they were

telling        the       truth and              people were              being        crushed          to     death.

On     seeing        what      wa s      happening             and      realising            t h at    there        wa s

already a            large         crowd       of      police        and      fans       trying        to     get

people        ou t    of      the     terraces,              I tried          to     give      what        assistance

I could        to     the      injured             f an s    wh o    were         being      passed         out     onto

th e    pitch.           I was        trying           to    give       reassurance             to     the        walking

wounded        but       most       of    the       t im e     I was         being       pushed and               jostled

by     other      f an s      who     did       not a p p e a r         to    be     injured          but     all      who

seemed        intent          on    blaming            the P o l i c e        for w h a t       was        happening

and a        large       number          of     them a p p e ar ed            to     ha ve     been        drinking.

It w a s      shortly after                   t h is     t ha t     I sa w a n u m b e r            of L i v e r p o o l

fans      rush       towards          the      S p i o n K o p as            if    they were           going         to

cause        trouble          with       the       Forest         fans.           I assisted           in u s h e r i n g

these        fans     back         towards          the      Leppings             Lane     end a nd         then

carried        on g i v i n g         assistance               to    the      injured          fans.

A young        fan., w h o         I think          was      a young          girl       about        11-12        years

old w ea ri ng           a    l i ght     coloured             *T*      shirt        and     jeans         w as    bei n g

tended         to    by a St.             John's            Ambulance             woman.        I then            gav e

assistance           to       carry       th e      fan across               the     pitch      to     the        corner

of     the   field           between          the N o r t h S t a n d a n d              the    Kop,        where         an

ambulance was                 waiting.              I put         the    girl        d o w n a n d at         t hi s      time

she a l r e a d y a p p e a r e d             to    be      dead.        I left          her    being

tended       to     by o t h e r         people          and went          towards          another          youth

who    was     lying          on the        grass           gasping        for       breath         but     who     was

not    being        tended         to.         The ambulance                  ha d    left      t he      field        by

this     time       so       I along       with another                 person who              I don't            know
                                                                                                           PAGE            4
                                                                                                           R 169

carried          the y o u t h       off     the     pitch and           into       the     Gymnasium.

By    th is      time       there was          bodies        l y ing all           over     the    place           i ns i d e

and    outside          the G y m n a s i u m .           I left        the y o u t h w i t h          people

at    the     Gymnasium and                  returned        to    the       playing        area.

The    only       body       I h a ndled was              the a f o r e m e n t i o n e d        that     I know

for    definite.              All      the     rest       I dealt        with were           the w a l k i n g

wounded.

During        the      whole        incident         there was           a    lot     of    help       coming         from

the    fans       on the        pitch        but a l l       the     time       there was          that

nucleus          of    troublemakers                who    seemed        intent        on    going        round

stirring          up    hatred and             blame       towards           t he P o l i c e .        I had        to

break       up m a n y m i n o r        scuffles,            s ome      between        the       fans

themselves             and    some      between           Police        and     fans.

My    feelings          were        t ha t   as     a whole        we w e r e       not     given enough

information about                    what      was    happening              and    it s e e m e d a       long

time       before       most        people        realised         t ha t      it was       not    ju st       a

pitch       invasion.

A    lot    of    the       fan s    I had        dealings         with       in the        playing        area

appeared          to    have        been     drinking          heavily.

Once       all    the       bodies      ha d      been moved and                the    game       ha d    been

abandoned             I gathered my Serial                     together            again     and       we w e n t

back       onto       Herries        Road      to    carry        out    traffic           control        and       to

try and          keep a       path      open along             the      r oad f or         the    emergency

services.              We    remained          there       until        all     the    traffic           had

gone.

Whilst        carrying          out T r a f f i c         Control        I had        to    break        up a

at    the      Leppings              Lane        end that             I realised             that       they were

telling         the        truth          and      people          were      b e i ng    crushed             to -death.

On    seeing          what       wa s      happening               and      realising            that        there        was

already         a     l arge         crowd         of     police         and      fans       trying          to    get

the      pitch.            I was          trying          to     give       reassurance              to      the     walking

wounded         but        most       of     the        time       I wa s        being       pushed and              jostled

by    other         fans who              did      not       appear         to    be    injured           but      all      who

seemed         intent           on    blaming             the      Police         for    what        wa s      happening

and a       larg e         number           of     them        appeared           to    have       been        drinking.

saw a gap in front of me I ducked under the bar.                   I though 1/ would be

alright then with the barrier at my back but more peoplev^iacked under

it and I was gradually pushed forwards gettip^niore and more                    crushed.

I could see jaeople       at the front    c 1 imb ingxtfv e r the front fence ^t o get

out of the crush.         As people got    ont*r the fence they then pulled other

people up and out of the pen.            There were also people        coming over

everyone heads and out of yjhe pen.            I thought to myself       if 1 get to

the fence at the front / w o u l d       be able to get out.         I was pushed to

the front of the pei;/but I was right by the fence perhaps one or two

people in front hJT       me but I wastoo far forward to be pul^ed out.               The

people behind were        being pulled out.      I had been s e p a r t e d from

               I was crushed and I did not think that I 4£s going to get

out.    I could n o y breath properly I did not see any of the match.             I

had noticed thy players        come out and that was about     it.

After a whi \/ the prsssur^/seenied to ease and I could m Qvj* back a bit

I moved back g radually^and I was suddenly grabbed by^                   and he

pulled me back NQuj/of the, crush.          I wanted to go^Snd find my brother

who was    in the North Sy^and before he came looking for me.

We walked back thrcragh tiy? tunnel.

When we got through t m f tunnel         I could see people lying about and

sitting about.         I just presumed that they weryT injured.       I did not

know at this stage that anyone was dead

There were about 4 lads trying to carry syfmeone who was iV~ij u.r j / t l ,    they

asked us to help them so we he 1ped thereto carry him to a w ambulance

outside.     The lad we carried was cougbTing up blood.        He was being

carried face down.         I would say          a   big lad.   He did not have his

shirt on but I jefould not really describe him.          I/'t hen went to the

North Stand j f n d    my brother.

We then rnarae our way outside the ground.^^We eventually met

       uujinside.     We had already met         inside the ground.    We thert

tried^o     find a phone to phone .homey

While we had been carrying the i n u r e d fan/Q photographer was trying

to t,ake photographs.        One of the lads/^iat was carrying him shouted at

him and was going to hit him but             ran off,

I did not see anything \l woul/'cons ider to be a criminal            offence

While I was in the crusfo idK pen 4 there were X 'y x ' men one in his early

,30’s and one in his rny d 20* s ,
--------------------
 The younger one was trying to hold the Oyfder one up a nd he was

gradually going down.         He eventuall>Jt^ent down and the crowd moved

over him.      I would describe hirn as white male      in his early 3 0 ’s,, clean

shaven short hair he was not very tall but he was stocky.               I think he

was wearing a tee shirt but          I can not really remember,

         During the crush some Police Officers were getting s^uck in and

         helping people out.     Others were    Uist standi m^Sfround doing nothing.

         The emergency services were            slow to react to the situation,

         I think that most of the\wc^/k was done by the fans.       The tanjr^y system

         was terrible when an announcement was made       I could not uvrae rstand what

         was being said.

         I think that the Liverpool supporters should have been given the Hop

         End of the ground.

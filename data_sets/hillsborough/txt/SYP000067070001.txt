                I have been a licensee for the past twenty years and I have been the

                licencee of "The Notyjfngham House'* for the past                 years.

                On Saturday 15th )^ffril 1989 I was working alone in the pub from the

                time I opened at eleven o'clock.

               From eleven o ’clock up to twelve o ’clock tha^e were only a few

                regulars    in the pub and at about ten g ^ t       twelve a group of about

                twenty N ottingham Forest supportergr came in and they were about £5-30

                yrs old.        I recognised a few ia£^lhem being ex-students of University

                of Sheffield, y^h ey appeared to have "kitty" going for t)*£ir drinks.

                About ten myhutes later we had about three or four l^xfs came in, who

               were LiveXpool       supporters a nd they mixed with the #otts F o r e s t

                frtippc^rt/rs   .
               We tnfcn had a steady flow of both sets of supporters.             The pub peaked
                                                                               PAGE       2
                                                                               S1133

        at about one-thirty and we had about seventy supporters         in, two third

         of which were Nottingham supporters.      They were all well behaved.        I

         would say that for the time the Liverpool        fans were in the pub they

         might have had about four pints each and the Notts Forest might have

         had about six pints.

         The Liverpool fans left about 2 o'cljkTk they all appeared to be in

         cars.     The Nottingham Forest fan%/left about twenty past two.      The pub

         was clear at about that time and they appeared to be in a jolly mood

         when they left.

         For that day my takings were about treble the amount from the previous

         Saturday.

         I did not sell any cans over the bar ,pn that day at all to take out.

         At about half past four,      both Liverpool and Nottingham Forest

         supporters    returned to my atfb and were consoling each over the tragedy

         and left in a sad mood,Ntfith
                             >od, Nfntf no problems at all.

                                                                              Signed

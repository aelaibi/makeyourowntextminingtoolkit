               Together          w ith other O f f i c e r s    from that         station       I was     t r a n s p o r t e d to

               Force      Driv i n g School,         B r l g h t s i d e Ln,   S h effield.        At that        location a

                traf f i c a p p r o a c h i n g   the   ground.



                I was a l l o c a t e d duties as a reserve a nd as                      such was       to    remain at

               Brightside          Ln to be d e p l o y e d as and when any                 congested         road junction

               was     identified-
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                           S2435

At   1.0^30,                             I was    conveyed to B u r n g r e a v e Rd,        Sheffield,

where      I di rected       supporters          towards Hi 1 Isb o r o u g h area of the City.



At   10.40 am        (1040 hrs)          another    Offi c e r who      had     been   previously

a l l o c a t e d this    duty    returned and          I in turn       returned to standby at

Brightside L n .



At   11.45 am         <1145 h r s ) I was         deployed      to Park Sq        roundabout         in

S h e f f i e l d City Centre,           I controlled       traffic at this            junction until 2.

40   pm    (1440 hrs).           Throughout        that    time    traffic was         very heavy and

consisted mainly             of N o t t i n g h a m fans    travelling          in private       cars and

mini      buses,     although       I did notice          several     vans and mini           buses       that

c o n t a i n e d L i v erpool    supporters.



At 2 . 4 0    pm    (1440 hrs)        I was      collected and        returned to B r i g h t s i d e           Ln

where      at ar o u n d 3.0 0      pm    (1500 hrs)       1 was     eating my meal.             At that         time

I saw      Inspector Wa l k e r          on the telephone          nearby.        He a n n o u n c e d    that

'Oper a t i o n S u p p o r t 5 was       being    implem e n t e d and myself          together wit h

many      other     officers,       left the       canteen and        boarded vans waiting                 outside



We   t r a ve l l e d wit h a Police          escort and a r r i v e d at the ground w i t h i n

five minutes.



On arrival          at H i l l s b o r o u g h we d i s e m b a r k e d and    ran to the      rear       of    the

N o r t h Stand.         As we    reached the stand             I saw a senior Officer,                   I do not

know who       it was,       he said       "Straight       round     lads,      in front     of the North

Sland".



I thought          it was a Pub l i c       order     situation       taking      place     inside        the

ground,      and wit h other             officers who were          not       p e rsonally known to me                I
                                                                                                         PAGE       3
                                                                                                         S2435

ran b e t w e e n the Kop and the N orth stand and onto                        the       pitch.



As    I did so        I could    see   there were a bout           100 s upporters             on the    pitch

at    the Leppings        Ln end of the ground.                It a p p e a r e d to be a pitch

invasion.



I took up a p o s ition on the                 pitch facing        the N o r t h s t a n d .      I saw and

h eard    people      shout i n g and     gest i culat i ng they were            saying         "Get over

there,     get    over     there",     and     pointing      towards     the Leppings            Ln end of

the    ground.



I only s t a y e d      in that     position for a r o u n d        1 minute and then someone

told us to move            to the      centre    circle.



I m o v e d wit h the       other O f f i c e r s    to the    centre      c ir c l e.        There were many

more     people       on the    pitch by this         time and      I saw that           they were

struggling        for    breath.



1 decided        I must     help the      people who were           obviously         in great      distress

so    I m o v e d forward.        As    I went      I was    checking     people were            okay and

that     they were       not    in need of       instant medical          attention.             it was

o bvious     now that       this was      not a public         order     sit u a t i o n but      that    people

on\he      pitch were          injured.



I made my way further               forw a r d until        I reached a position near                   to the

go a l p o s t s at   the L e p p i n g s Ln end of the ground.                  As      I did many       fans

were     starting       to arrive w i t h a d v er t i s i n g     hoardings       for        stretchers.      It

became a p p a r e n t    that    these       hoardings     were    creating       congestion so           I

started      telling      the fans       to    lay them on the         floor     so that         they were

not    in the way.          I could see a Police Officer                  trying         to    resuscitate

                                                                                                          S2435
some o n e and          I remember           shouting     hit him harder           in the   chest.



I saw a number                of what        I thought were         bodies    near    the goal p o s t s , about

4 or 5,          I checked for          signs       of    life but      could find none.



The    fans were          sc r e a m i n g    and shouting at           everyone     to help.



A g ro u p of s u pporters              ar rived with a hoardi ng and                 I told them to help

me w i t h       the body of a m a n a g e d between SO - 30 years,                         we   loaded him

onto     the      hoarding an d          ran across         the    pitch wit h him.         The man was          dead

but    the       s u pporters      did not         realise.



We    used the access              point        between the Ho p and the N orth S t a n d and on

arriving          at    the    rear    of     the stand      I saw that       the area was        heavily

congested.              Ambulances           and what a p p e a r e d     to be medical      staff w ere         in

attend a n c e .



We    carried          the man     to the        rear     of the N o r t h stand a short          distance

from     the      g y m n a s i u m where we        put    the    board down.        There were      numerous

Po l i c e O f f i c e r s     in that area          so    I told one,       who    1 did not     know,     to

take     care of the body.                    I ran back to the            playing    field with the

supporters.



On    returning          I a g a i n set about            calming    people    down,    there was      less

a c t i v i t y at      the L e p p i n g s Ln end but            I could see      great    numbers    of

Of f i c e r s    in that area.



At    this       time    the Forest           s upporters        on the Kop were       still     singing and

this a p p e a r e d to be            causing       great anger         amongst     certain Liverpool            fans

on the       pitch.           I recall        grabbing at         least    three    supporters who
                                                                                                           PAGE          5
                                                                                                           S2435

appeared          to     be setting        off    towards that end           of the ground.             They

appeared          to     calm d o w n .



I remember             looking       behind me and seeing a                line    of Police Officers,             the

full       w i d t h of the       pitch and adv a n c i n g        to the     halfway       line from the

Forest       Kop e n d .



I was       telling         people anxi o u s          about   relatives       that an a n n o u n c e m e n t

would       be made        on the PA system expl a i n i n g what                  they w ould have        to do.



I later        heard the a n n o u n c e m e n t that            the game would be           cancelled and

h e a r d Mr D a l g l i s h on the P A .



W hi l e    I was        on the      pitch someone shou t e d             at me "Why      did yo u      open the

gates       ?“.        M any Li v e r p o o l    fans    seemed hell        bent    on a t t a c k i n g any

Po l i c e O f f i c e r .      At    1 east     six    people a p p r o a c h e d me shouting and

yelling        abuse-          I m a n a g e d w i t h the help of other             fans    to divert         them

away.



I n o t i c e d that many             people      on the       pitch smelled        strongly      of

intoxicants             and m any      of that         number a p p e a r e d to be drunk.             There     were

other       supp o r t e r s who were            in total      control      of themselves        and their

conduct        was      helpful       in dealing with the                others.



A fter      the    game was          c a n celled the       stad i u m    emptied and       I accompanied a

man,       s e a rching      for his younger             brother     to the       rear   of the N orth Stand

w here      he was        provided wit h the             em e r g e n c y t e l ephone   details       by another

Officer        who      had set       up a table         under    that     stand.



I s u b s e q u e n t l y a t t e n d e d a de-bri e f i n g       in the N o r t h S t a n d and        left     the

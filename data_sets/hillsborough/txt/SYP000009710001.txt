Constabulary             took u p their               d esignated         positions,       I then went          round the

areas at the North end of the                               ground to supervise             my officers,             I

w o u l d say during             that       time      I noticed        rather more         private       cars and mini

buses a c t u a l l y        drove      to the         ground       rather       than coaches          this    in general

terms      caused more               congestion            in the area than normal                1 can say that

the m a j o r i t y      of supporters were well                      ordered.           I personally          saw no

d is order,          ho w e v e r , t he m a j o r i t y of supporters                 seemed to only want                to

find     premises          to    consume alcohol                  a nd I p e rsonally was          being

ps r s i s t a n t l y ^ a s k e d    the    location of            licensed       premises       etc,        At about         1.

45 pm      (1345 hrs),               I was w ith SDQ|                      i n H:i.ddlewood R u , where             I saw a

queue      of about 6 or 8 people                          outside a n ^off        licence waiting             to

purchase         beer,       there were              several       others       inside    this    shop     purchasing

beer and having                 bought       packs of beer they were                     sitting       on nearby

walls,         and    cars      consuming            the    contents       of the      tins,



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 ,00          pm   (1400 hrs)          I went       to Penis tone Rd to

supervise            supporters        entering the ground,   I was retained at that area
                                              /                                           C
until      a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 .00 pm (1500 hrs) whe n I received a radio m e s s a g e

requesting all a v a ilable                      officers          to enter      the     ground and go to the

L e p p i n g s Ln 4 V e a      as there was a pitch                      invasion       in progress,           I then

e nte r e d the ground                from P e nistone Rd between the North Stand and the

Kop,     my     immediate            i m pression was             that there was a pitch                invasion         in

c 1 1rnb i n g over       the fen c :i.n q a t the                front    of   the    terraces.         I made my way

to this         f e n c i n q i n f r^o n t of Pen 3,               1 he 1 ped t w o p e o pie o v e r the

fencinq         onto     the    ground and then                   climbed onto         the wall        in front     of        pen
                                                                                                          PAGE         5

3,    I could see the            problem was           that a large       number    of    people at

the     rear       of the terraces           were    pushing and     swaying       forward,       I was

shouting at them to               pull       b a c k , but this    seemed to be a signal                 for   them

to    push h a r d e r , one man            in the     crowd then shouted to me that there was

a dead ma n next to him,                    I now know that was           in the ap p r o x i m a t e area

where      the      barrier     collapsed        in Pen 3,       it was at this          point    I realised

how serious           the sit u a t i o n was and that there were a lot of                        people

being      injured,          I then    realised that        the gate       to Pen 3 had been o p e n ed

so    I went        down and helped other               police    officers     pull      people     out of Pen

3 via this           g a t e , I was    then     requested by a Police             Sergeant       to get

some Police           officers who were              standing ar o u n d    nearby to come and

assist       with the         injured       persons and     in the area of the              gate.



S h o r t l y after      this about          '100 to    150 L i verpool     supporters        then       ran

towards        the Koo end of the              ground,     they were       prevented from           reaching

the Kop end b y             a line o f P o lice o ff icers all             across     the    pitch,       I went

to assist           in removing        those    fans away from that            end of the         ground.



                                                                             fHoSOeV'
Sh o r t l y after       this    I was       requested     by     Chief    Inspector S urnn e r to

gather as many special                  constables        together    as    I could and go to the

.rear turnstiles             area of Lappings Ln,               I then went with about              ten

Especial C onstables             to this area and we f o rm e d a h u m a f\ corda n a c r o s s

was    positioned there               for    some    considerable     length of time             until     the

crowd had d i s persed            from the West Stand and the Leppings                        Ln terraces,

during       that     period we were           subjected to a lot of verbal                 but     no

physical           abuse.     After     that we were        engaged       in cleaning        the area of

Em e r g e n c y    vehicles,     we were       then stood down.

      Dear Sir,

      INTERIM REPORT ON THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

      I refer to our meeting on Saturday, 30th September, at the Stamford
      Bridge Football Grounds as part of your further information gathering
      prior to the production of your Final Report.

      It is appreciated that this particular visit concentrated on the
      activities, role and views of the Police in relation to crowd safety
      and public order.   However, no single public authority can effectively
      deal with a major sporting event without the support of the others. I
      believe the close co-operation of public authorities in this borough is
      a major contribution to safe spectator enjoyment.

      This authority is uniquely placed with regard to public safety
      licensing including the three football grounds at Chelsea, Fulham and
      Queens Park Rangers.      There are in excess of 3.5 million people
      attending entertainments in the borough each year of which nearly one
      million attend the football matches.

      The Safety of Sports Grounds Act takes a considerable amount of time
      with three separate Safety teams operating.     Your interim report has
      perhaps had greater impact here than any other authority.

      I am sure that you noted on your visit that, together with the clubs
      and other public authorities,    we have been responding to your
      recommendations and are therefore able to draw on that experience.
      This Council would be very pleased to make a contribution to your
      inquiry on the basis of our experience and views on future developÂ­
      ments.

      I would be grateful to hear from you whether you would wish an oral or
      written submission, whether you have any preference for format of the
      latter and the timescales for the response.       Please feel free to
      contact me should you wish to visit any other premises within the
      borough.

      Yours faithfully,


         LO

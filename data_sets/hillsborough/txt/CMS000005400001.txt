               STRATEGY FOR IMPLEMENTING ALL SEATING


Thank you for your letter of 19 December with your suggestion of
a Government statement on the implementation of Taylor. I look
forward to receipt of your draft which I would want to show to Mr
Atkins.


On your point about cover I would hope that the statement could
recognise that Taylor saw all-seating as being important both
from the point of view of comfort as well as of safety,
particularly if it is to contribute to improvement in spectator
behaviour. In this context cover must be desirable although as
you say not a necessary condition for the implementation of
Taylor.


Following on from the statement it is in my view essential that
we quickly establish what the role of the FLA is in relation to
any implementation plan. There is a need for a body independent
of football to look at the resources available to football clubs
in relation to their role in implementing Taylor (which of
course goes far wider than the implementation of all-seating) and
in that context provide advice on investment priorities,
including on the use of the monies made available to the Football
Trust following the reduction in Pool Betting Duty. My concern as
you will know from my letter of 14 December, is that the most
effective use is seen to be made of these monies made available
                                                                   1
by this reduction and that the Football Trust is able to move
away from a first come first serve approach in distributing this
money. I would hope that the FLA could provide some general
guidance on priorities in advance of the 1992/93 football season
and I would welcome your views on this in advance of any meeting
with the FLA and the Football Trust.


Yours sincerely




JOHN VAUGHAN

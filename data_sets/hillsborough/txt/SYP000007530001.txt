            The      pitch          was      full        of    supporters                who    had    obviously               spilled           out     from

            as    we      passed          the         Kop where              the    b ul k     of   the      NOTTINGHAM              FOREST         fans       were

            housed          that         I heard            fans        shouting          towards         us    ’I H O P E H E * S            DEAD',          They

            towards            us.           This        was       deeply distressing                   and     in a n g e r I p i c k e d              out     one

            shouted            them       to      shu t       up     but      it w a s       obvious         that         it w as         in v a i n     as    they

            made       my      way       back         out     the       pitch and            repeated          the       process           along        with

            other         PC's       and         fans       with        a body       (up p e r      h a lf     of    body        covered with

            shouting            and were               j ust       clapping          when       bodies         were        being      carried            in

approached             me     asking           me    if       I ha d          got    a ticket              to     the       ground.              1 hadnt

him      the     £2 0 .       I       nave      still          got        the    1 1 cket           ha     gave     me a n d this               I    have

After       I bought              my    ticket           I    walked           along          the       road      to    the       is 1,a r d to

            went       through.                 I went          up    to       this       entrance                to    make        sure           where          it wa s

            and      also      to      see       what       the       crowds             were       like.              It w as          probably              between

            supporters              around            at    this          time.

            I decided             to       pass       the       time          by    finding             a    pub       to    h a ve      a drink.                     I

            There       I met          a    couple          of       Liverpool                supporters                from        the        Blackpool                   area,

            the      reason         we      s or t     of       met       was       because             they       asked           me    to        compare                t heir

stayed        in th e           pub as         far    as      I remember.

I walked           towards           the       ground         on m y       own    but       talked        to      other         supporters

on    t he    way.            I walked          fairly          quickly          to    the       ground and               made       my way         to

the     entrance              in L e p p i n g s      Ln,        I didn't             see    anyone          in the            street

drinking           alcohol           from        cans      and. I d i d n ' t          see       any    fighting               or a n y t h i n g

because        of       the      amount         of    people          around          them.         They         were      sort        of

I was           pushed           against                 the     railing           and    suddenly              I was        fighting            for

breath.                Th e         pressure              was      so       intense       t h at         I c o u l d n ’t c o n t r o l          my

pressure               continued                   tor       a good          five     mi n u t e s , w h i l s t          this         wa s     going       on

roaring               as    it          normally             does       when       there      is a g o o d             move       or    someone

         got    any Liverpool                 colours           on    but      1 think        t hi s     tout       assumed        I was

         g o in g    to    the      ground         thus     I     w as      offered a          ticket.

         The     tout      said      he      had    three         standing           area      tickets          for £ 2 0 e a c h .             I

         asked       if    it w a s       for      the    Liverpool               area and         he    said        it w as      so    I paid

         him tj>e''£20.              1 have         still         got       the     ticket      he      gave me a nd this               I       have

         given       to     Inspector           M O R R I S.      When        1 bought         this         ticket        it   had a single

         s tub a t t a c h e d       to      it,    this        was      la ter      torn     off       at    the     turnstiles.

         I can       describe          the        ticket        t o u t as        being a white               male,       mid     twenties!,

         about       5*     10"     (5*10)         tail a n d         fair ly well            built.           He     had      straight,

          lightish          c o l o u r ed    brown       hair        cut        to a m e d i u m       length.           He    was     wearing

         a r o u nd       neck      ju m p e r ,    light        in      colour.            I c a n ’t       remember          anything             else

         about       this        man and          I don't         think          I could       recognise             him again.              From

         his     accent          he w a s n ’t f r o m L i v e r p o o l             but     I c o u l d n ’t sa y w h e r e            he      did

          come      from.

There       was     no     form         of     queuing               the r e    as       I would               normally          expect.          There

because        of      the       amount          of       people a r o u n d              them.            They were              sort    of

I gave       my     t icket           to     the      gateman and                he       tore        off        the       stub and       he      gave

          Once     inside             the    ground           I walked         straight           across          the     open area             and

          into     the       tu n n e l      leading           to    the    terrace.              Before          entering           the       ground       I

          t u nn e l    leading             to     this       area.        I d i d n ’t        really         look      fo r     any      direction

                I was      pushed against                  the        railing           and    suddenly         I was       fighting          for

                breath.          Th e    pressure              wa s    so       intense        that      I c o u l d n ’t c o n t r o l       my

                pressure         continued               for    a good           five     minutes,           whilst        this wa s         going         on

                the    game      must        have        started           and    T. r e m e m b e r     being       aware    of       the    crowd

Going         back       to        when          the     policewoman            sat me        down       by       the w a l l ,     she a s k e d

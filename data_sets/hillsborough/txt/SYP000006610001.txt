To the Chief Constable,                   ;
Merseyside County Police HQs                          20th, April, 1989.




Dear Sir,

            re; hillsborough football ground disaster


Like no doubt each community minded Liverpudlian feels a need to reflect
and add opinion towards the horror of Saturday last, I find myself as a
veteran 1Koppite' no exception.

In fact this is a letter which in hindsight I had intended to send to
you long before the tragic events at Sheffield,

Hereby I wish to pay compliments towards members of that special police
section that week after week supervise public safety within and
outside the city's main football grounds,     whatever the going,   'gate'
capacity etcetra, their vigilence applied with disiplined firmness
and yet with the humour to match that of the 'Kop' really does ensure
a sense of well-being and safety for the vast majority of us all.

That the less formal uniforms of our mounted police personnel is a
constant reminder of the turbulent times in which we all live, only
serves to make us more appreciative of their good stewardship.

While I do not wish to appear presumptuous, I believe the Merseyside
police to be the best trained and experienced body in the land in the
application of sporting crowds control, and add unreservedly that
what costly chaos prevailed at Hillsborough would surely have never
happened at Anfield or Goodison.

                          Yours faithfully.


                                                            Wallasey,______

                       HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Mr. D. Mason,
Director of Social Services
Hatton Garden,
Liverpool.


                                                       19th April, 1989


Dear Director,

      We are writing together to express our appreciation for the
effort, skill and professionalism, that has been shown during the
last week.    Neither of us have any doubt at all that without the
considerable effort being deployed we would have been unable to deal
in any proper way at all with the difficulties.       We both know that
the entire Department has worked loyally and in co-operation and
produced a first class team effort.      There may have been people who
have played a more visible role, but again neither of us are in any
doubt that behind the scene works"is as vital.

     We-hope that you will distribute this letter' to all the members
of the Social Services Department and that they will become aware
that the people of the areas effected owe them a considerable debt.


                              Yours sincerely



           Keva Coombeo .......
           Leader of the Council

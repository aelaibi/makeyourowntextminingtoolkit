  Dear Sir,

  Hillsborough Inquiry
                                                                                                     I
  Considerable attention has been focused on the extent of tt e^alleged
  surge of fans through the tunnel into the Leppings Lane tei races
  following the opening of .gate C at or about 1452.

  So far as we are aware, the evidence given todate has not tyeen
  quantitative in n nture but only by way of observation from those who
  came through the jate or witnessed it being opened.
                                                                                                     i


  We believe that t is West Midlands Police Inquiry Teim may Have
  carried out detai Led examination of photographs of ihe teri aces using
  blowup techniques which may be capable of identifying indii idual
  spectators who mi ght have been affected by whateverisurge took place.

  It is, of course, plain from consideration of the photographs as they
  stand that three or four supporters are in the same positxo n by the
  tunnel mouth at 3 .00 p.m. as they were at 2.45 p.m.  Howev(: r, that
  is entirely incon elusive because those supporters miy be s importing
  themselves on wal Is or fencing adjacent to the tunn4l entrh ne e .

  We shall be pleassd to know whether more detailed examination of the
  photographs has been carried out and whether it is proposed-to call
  any evidence as tb the results of that examination.j

  On a .separate issjue, we would ;iw.ish ..to .confirm,,a. conyersatio n,which

Dear Sirs,

                                HILLSBOROUGH INQCJIRY

    Thank you for y«ur ifex of 2nd June.

     As regards the photographs, I confim that the West Midlands Pollue Inquiry
Ifeam are carrying oi>ut a detailed examination of these. Clearly we cairn*.ot jet say
whether the results of such examination will warrant any evidence feeing
presented to the Inc ,uiry in this connection.

      As regards the proposal that ws call landlords of public houses ok the
"Liverpool*' routes, Counsel to the Inquiry tells me that he h&s already
discussed this sugge;istion with Mr, Woodward and indicated that we woul.d not be
c a llin g a n y e u a h moooeo.



                                   Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

Hillsborough Stac ium Disaster Inquiry

On our guided visit to Hillsborough Stadium on Friday, 2nd June, we
were shown the Club control room.   It was noted in the course of
our visit that there is a Club camera showing a partially obscured
view of the area behind gate A.   From the discussion which we had
at that time, we believe that the video recording oE that ramera
has not yet been viewed and did not form part of th<i composite
video.

It may be that tl. is is of no relevance, but we understand ;hat it
will now be exami ned and no doubt arrangements will be mad< a to show
it to ;dne inquiry , if it is of relevance.

May we put through you one or two points upon which! we shojild
appreciate further information from Sheffield Wednesday Foptball
Club.

Firstly, the Clufc bundle exhibits at pages 1 - 1 4 , he Gen eral
Safety Certificat e issued under The Safety of Sport ground Act
1975.

It will be noted at page 9 of the bundle (Clause 25 (2) (il) of the
Certificate) that a record is to be kept of crush barrier ;ests
which have to b e carried out on an
                                 -- annual
                                    ----- 1 basis

 We anticipate th at copies of these records will be of inte rest to
 the inquiry.

 Secondly, the Cl jb bundle exhibits, at item 52 (p.p. 165 - 168), a
 computer print-out of the spectator count through t|he turn stiles for
 the semi-final o f 15th April, 1989 as at 3.00 p.m.

 There is also an earlier document,     item 36, recording the flow of
 supporters into the ground for the     match held on lljth Febr uary, 1989
 (p.120).   We won 3er if any similar   record to that kept for the game
 of 11th February    1989 was kept in   relation to the semi-fi nal of
 15th April,' 1989    If so, we would   appreciate detai Is.

 Thirdly, there appears to be an element of confusion (to w hich our
 clients may unwittingly have contributed) as to thej extent of the
 ability of the CLub Security Officer to monitor what is sh own on
 Police cameras.                                     !

 A suggestion has been raised somewhere in evidence that th e Club can
 only monitor wha t is being recorded by the two Police vide o
 recorders.  At o ar inspection on Friday, we noted that it was
 possible for the Club to monitor any of the Police camerasl whether
 or not these wer s engaged in recording.

 Could we perhaps be informed as to whether that system was in
 operation on thejday of the semi-final.            !


 Yours faithfully,

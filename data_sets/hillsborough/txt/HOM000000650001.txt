DATED:   270489



          On Saturday 15th April       1989   (150489)   together with four friends I

          attended the F A cup semi       final football match at Hillsborough,

          Sheffield,       to watch a football match between Liverpool       FC and

         Nottingham Forrest FC .

          I went to the match to support Liverpool            F C , the tickets for the

         match were obtained from Anfield through the season ticket

         holder scheme.       The ticket I think is valued at        14 and I was seated in

         the North Stand.

         The people who I travelled to the game with are-.-

         We travelled to the game by car.           It was    ____________ car   We stopped

         en route the ground and had lunch at one of the motorway service

         stations and we arrived        in Sheffield for about 1.30 pm (1330).

         We parked about a mile from the ground,             I do not know the location as

                                                                             PAGE


it was my first time in Sheffield.

Having parked the car we walked the remainder of the way and arrived

at the ground at about 2 pm (1400). There were slight delays on the

motorway due to road works.             I do not recall seeing any persons

consuming alcohol en route to the match.

There was no requirement        for Police directions or escort to the

ground as Mr              knew the ground and the area.       I did not see any

trouble between the point of arrival and entrance to the ground.

There were not very many people about.

On arrival at the ground I entered via the turnstiles on the

Penistone Road.     There were no queues on the turnstiles and the people

I was with were searched by Police on entry.

On reaching the seating area we were told by a steward where to go.

There was no difficulty        in finding the entry point and we had no

difficulty in entering        the ground.

I did not see any gates open other            than the turnstiles,   nor did I see

any unauthorised entry into the ground.             I handed the ticket in as I

entered.     I did not witness any consumption of alcohol            inside the

ground.

I was not    involved    in any crush whilst attending the football match.

It would have been about        3.10 pm     (1510) when I saw the crowd standing

on the terraces on the West Stand surging forward.             The movement

stemed from the rear of the crowd towards the front.            I d o n ’t know

what caused the m o v e m e n t .

I did not receive any injuries myself from the football match.                The

next   thing I saw was that people          in the terracing were being lifted

into the seating area of the We3t Stand,            by supporters above them.

People were also climbing over            the fences to the front of the

terracing onto the pitch area.

                                                                             PAGE


It appeared to be at this time that the terracing was too overcrowded

and people were escaping the crush.          A number of people were being

carried away on stretchers from the pitch area.

As a result my two collegues and myself went down to the rear of the

North Stand to see if we could assist with anything.            This would be

about 3.30 p m .

On arrival at the rear of the North stand we spoke to a Police

Officer and having told him we were Doctors we were tola to ac

downstairs,   which we did.       Here we spoke to an officer with a radio

and again told him that we were Doctors.           This officer showed us into

the gymnasium,     which was being used for a makeshift casualty centre.

              */ent towards the playing area whilst

myself remaind at the gymnasium.

Inside the gymnasium,     I saw two dead bodies on the floor.        I felt for

a pulse on these two people and there was aot one.

Lying on the ground at the same point was another man aged about

thirty,   He was conscious and appeared to be in shock.           I got him up

and sat him down.      Two more bodies were then brought        into the area.

I checked them again and confirmed that           they were dead.

At this stage I heard another person was in pain.             This man was

behind a partition which was        inside   the gymnasium.    He complained to

me of injuries to his     legs.

This man was with a friend and I asked him to rip the mans trousers

so I could examine him, which he did.           I saw that the leg was blue

from the top of his     left leg to his toes.

There was no medical     equipment available and so I just told him to

take deep breaths.

Next to him was another man who had been brought          in, he had crush

injuries to his chest and he was        ’b l u e ’ through lack of oxygen.     He
                                                                        PAGE


was pointing out that his chest was injured.           I saw that his chest

was blue.      There was nothing that I could do except talk to him,

until help arrived.

During this time more bodies were being brought in on the other side

of the partition.

I went back over and saw that there were another three or four more

bodies who were dead.

I returned to the man with the chest         injury, whilst I was talking

to him firemen came in carrying          oxygen.   I took one and gave it the

man with the chest       injuries and left him in the care of the fireman.

I then went      to see another man who was lying on the ground who was

in pain.      This man had injuries to his left shoulder but otherwise

he was a l r i g h t .

It was about       this time that a team of paramedics arrived from

Sheffield Hospital and they started to administer first aid to the

casulties.

At about 4 pm (1600)       I was approached by an Inspector who asked me

together with three other Doctors to confirm the deaths of persons

present    in the gymnasium.

We took a section of the bodies each and certified their deaths.              A

Police officer was with each body and he took the details from me of

the time of certification        and my name and address.

I c a n ’t remember how many     people I certified as dead but it   was at

least eight.

I do not have any details        of the dead people,   their details are with

the Police.        I remember that the   first body certified as dead was at

4 pm (1600).

We stayed until about 4.40 pm       (1640)   the same date. My own personal

observations are that medical       assistance should have been requested
                                                                                            PAGE


   \       on the loud speaker system immediately casulties were noticed.                   Up to

   M       the time that I entered the gymnasium no request had been made on the
       \
           public speaker system.

           There was no first aid equipment available                inside the gymnasium.     It

           is my opinion that at such stadiums as Hillsborough where                large

           attendences are frequent,                a room should be set aside equiped to deal

           with e m g e r g e n c i e s .

           The last thing I would               like to say is that now having examined a map

           of the ground I am not sure as to which gate we entered.                 It may have

           been the Leppings Lane turnstile.                 The person who would know for

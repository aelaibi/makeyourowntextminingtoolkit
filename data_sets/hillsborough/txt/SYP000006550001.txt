SUBJECT   MAJOR POLICY DECISION                                      DATE




          All senior officers are to note that all major decisions, with regard
          to the conduct of the investigation and logistical support, will
          either be communicated by me verbally or in writing. They will NOT be
          actioned in response to decisions from other quarters, includingfrom
          officers at ACPO rank. Of course the Chief Constable is in overall
          direction of the enquiry and he does give me a direct brief, but if he
          does speak to you direct you must ensure, if I am not present, that
          you tell me the content of the decision/direction. The Chief
          Constable appreciates this as much as anybody.

         Dear Sir

         I refer to my letter to you dated 21 May 1998 in which I asked that you ascertained the full
         version o f the abbreviations F.I.O and Q.O.R from South Yorkshire Police. PC Greenway
         spoke to this office today and confirmed that he would be replying to your request. I should
         be grateful if you would let me have this information by fax or telephone as soon as you
         receive the reply from SYP.

         Thank you for your assistance.


         Yours faithfully

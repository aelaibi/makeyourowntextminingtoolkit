             I had no contact w i t h any deceased                      persons at all.

             I cannot       say what       time    the turns t i l e s        opened to the            public      but    can

             say that       I was     not aware         of any     problems        outside       the L e p p i n g s Lane

             entrance w h i c h       I could see from my               point.

             I have      performed duties at              previous major             events at H i l l s b o r o u g h and

             have always         been     in the    locality of L e p p i n g s Lane there have                        been no

             serious      incidents at           previous events            I have attended.

             F ro m my o b s e r v a t i o n s   I w o u l d say that         the major         cause     of the       incident

             was      the fact     that    so m a n y    p e o p ^ l e ^ r r J ^ e ^ J ^ a t e and h a ^ j n ^ ^ n t e j n t i o n of

             alcohol      although        only a few were            o b v i o u s l y drunk,      and there were

             I was also a s k e d         by supporters where               the nearest           pub was.

E ND OF R E P O R T
                           HILLSBOROUGH DUTY 15 APRIL S$

DAVID SIEEVEN GOULSON   PC 21^ A2 sub Div   (Armthorpe)
With reference to the request for account of duties performed at Hillsborough 15/4/89
I report as follows;

At 8.15am Saturday 15 April 89 I reported for duty at Armthorpe Police office and was
subsequentley transported to Doncaster DHQ for onward transportation to Hillsborough
football ground.

Around 9*30am we arrived at Hillsborough and a briefing was held in the North stand
I was attached to serial No 29 together with PC 31^5 Punton, 1280 Hebdidge, 1169 Kerr,
2915 Severn, H^BraSley, 2668 Fletcher and 2840 Pearson.in charge of the serial was
PS 1561 Reynolds.

following the briefing I took a meal break and approximately 11.00am the serial was
deployed to our respective points I was allocated the road barrier at Leppings Lane
junction with Shenstone Road, together with PC 1169 Kerr and PC 2840 Pearson.

As the day progressed supporters walked along Leppings Lane towards the Leppings Lane
entrance* with the numbers increasing as the time passed. Numerous supporters were
drinking from cans and were carrying as many as four cans which I assumed they were
consuming prior to entering the ground which was approx 75yds away.
A complaint was recieved from a resident of Shenstone Road (believed         to the effect
that youths had been urinating against her house wall therefore several walks along the
road were made and several youths were prevented from walking down the road.

As the afternoon progressed the amount of people passing towards the gates increased
greatley the majority of people appeared to be in a good mood with the occasional
singing and shouting group. At 2.30pm approximately the supporters walking passed showed
no signs of slowing down and several people who were sat on walls of local gardens had
to be ushered towards the ground in an attempt to get them inside prior to the start
of the match because it became increasingly obdous that there was no way that they
would be inside before 3pm. Many people simply moved a few feet awa$ and stopped again
for no apparent reason, in fact many made no attempt to get into the ground until the
last minute, at 2.45pm people were still sat outside a nearby fish shop eating and drinking
cans of Beer / Lager
It was obvoous that many had been drinking although they were not drunk to the falling
down stage.

From my position at the Road barrier I saw numerous people climbing over a wall near th
the turnstiles, this continued for about i hour until a police officer who I believe
was a special Constable (wearing a flat cap) appeared on top of the wall, even then
people continued to climb to the top of the wall, this incident occurred sometime between
2 .30pm & 3»00pm.

A large number of supporters were walking away from the ground, mingling with approaching
supporters and asking for any spare tickets I would estimate the ticketless fans to be in
excess of 100 (the ones who passed me).

approximatley 3•00pm my attention was drawn to the Leppings Lane entrance by a request
to attend there regarding public order I cannot recall where the request originated
I attended the entrance together with PC Kerr & Pearson as I arrived the majority of
the police present were either Mounted branch on horseback or Special Constables,
numerous supporters were climbing over the turnstiles, I pulled one youth back and was
instructed by a Police inspector who I do not Know to close the turnstile doors, this
was done and the crowd of supporters present were moved back to the road side of the
main gates which were then closed. I remained on the outside of the main gates.
On my arrival at the entrance initially the large gates into the ground were closed.

At this time I was unaware of what was happening inside the ground, I was not in possession
of a personal radio. After a short while I heard conversation relating to people inside
the ground being injured, An ambulance arrived and was directed into the ground.
M Numerous people were still milling around outside the gates when a Fire tender arrived
conversation was then heard relating to 3 fatalities, people then slowly started to
leave the ground further ambulances then arrived together with other fire tenders, by now
people were leaving the ground in large numbers many were shouting abuse at police
officers saying it was our fault for opening the gate and accusing the police of killing
people the atmosphere outside the ground was so tense with the obvious signs of hatred
towards the police that I was fully expecting an assault against me and other officers

word was now being passed around that there were numerous deaths and supporters were
talking about bodies being sill over, some of the supporters were obviously injured
and when offered help they refused it and just became abusive tbwards the officer.

I remained outside the ground in an attempt to keep the road clear for emergency vehicles
I returned th the North Stand sometime later when the ground had been cleared.

I had no contact with any deceased persons at all.

I cannot say what time the turnstiles opened to the public but can say that I was not aware
of any problems outside the Leppings Lane entrance which I could see from my point.

I have performed duties at previous major events at Hillsborough and have always been
in the locality of Leppings Lane there have been no serious incidents at previous events
I have attended.

From my observations I would say that the major cause of the incident was the fact that
so many people arrived late and had no intention of entering the ground in good time
They had consumed large amounts of alcohol although only a few were obviously drun£.
and there were hundreds of supporters present without tickets who usually still try to
gain entry any way they can.

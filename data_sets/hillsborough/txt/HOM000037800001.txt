HILLSBOROUGH


Here is a copy of Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s report on Hillsborough, which he has
delivered today. A copy is also enclosed for Tim Middleton. I have not yet read the
final report, but I understand from the Judge that its conclusions are much as we
expected. W e will be consulting you next week on the terms of the advice which we
offer to the Home Secretary. Copies have gone also to Stephen Wooler in LSLO
and John Ringguth at CPS Headquarters.

2.     I am enclosing for Rick Evans a copy of that part of the report which deals
with Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s comments about inquests. I would be grateful for
his advice about how the Home Secretary might respond on these points.

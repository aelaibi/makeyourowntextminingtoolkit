I was      paired         up with 7DC DRAJLING,                    and    our    duty        was     to    patrol the

Hillsborough            car    park area,          in plain         clothes,,          Our    role was       to observe

that area           in respect       of thefts        from motor            vehicles/crime.                 TDC

D R A J L I N G and       I com m e n c e d a foot       patrol           in the above area,              in plain

clothes       with        a radio      between the            two    of us,,          At     that    time    the radio

appeared          to be    in good,        clear working             order.           Our    patrol       c o mmenced at

around      10.30 am          {1030?     that      date and almost               straight          away we were

approached           by youths       who asked        if we         had spare          tickets       for    the    game,,

I saw several             small    groups       of supporters              from both sides,                who were

wan d e r i n g    in the H i l l s b o r o u g h    park area.



                                                     c r ow        )U x               and    I saw groups          of

                                                                                  wit h cana         of beer- e t c

who were          urinating along           the side          of    t e r raced

adjacent          to the H i l l s b o r o u g h    park.



By around          12 noon      (1200)      time     it was a l r e a d y         quite       crowded wi t h groups

of supporters who were                  the worse        for        drink       but    it was hard          to

e s t a b l i s h w h i c h side     they s u p ported due                to both teams             having       the    same

c oloured         strip.



At 2 .00      pm     (1400)     that    date       I made my way            to the          ground,       to take my

meal.       I walked along             P e n i s t o n e Rd,       to an entrance             near    the North

Stand.       The      crowd at       the    side     of the ground was                     quite    noisy    but

overall      well       behaved.         It was      obvious         that       due    to the general             smell     xn

the   turnstiles area,               that most        of the         fans       had been drinking.

1 became aware                of the            problems        at    the        ground by the               number        of

ambulance             vehicles             speeding          to the     ground.             I received a radio message

to at t e n d         the GYM at the ground and                              it became           obvious       that a major

incident         had took              place.


                                                                \ u  3

On arrival            at     the GYM            the    first      three          or four        bodies       ftad. been             laid

out.         Over      the    period            of what must            have          been the          next       hour      or so trier

seemed to be an e n d l e s s                       flow of dead and injured                            bodies       being brought

At     first     it was          impossible             to know how man v dead there was,                                     the r e f o r e

tables and           chairs were m o v e d          to make       space and attempts             were made            to

assemble          the bodies        in some        order and       identify them.



I looked around and saw Police                        officers        trying      to    rssusitate        fans        etc,,

everyone         seemed to         be stunned and shocked and                   several        fellow     officers,

who    I know are well              experienced,          openly      cried as         they aid their            best

to help          in any way they           could.



The    i nstruction was             given     that as an officer               brought       in a body or took

charge      of a body            brought     in by fans,          that    officer w ould then be

deputed a CID officer                   per body to assist               in ide n t i f i c a t i o n and

property         etc.



F i n a 11y ail       bodies were                     and                                          of tiody

etc,    and      placed      in rows       to assemble        some       kind of order.



Wh e n all       bodies were           ’IN ORDER'        I was     inst r u c t e d    to a 11 e n d H a m m e rt on

Rd Police         S t a t i o n where      an office        was    set    up for       the   comp l e t i o n    of

M i s s i n g Pe r s o n Reports          from     the grieving          families       etc,      I was      under

the    direct        supervision          of Chief       Insp,    AGAR      (Drug Squad)         who    listed         the

I was at         that      location       for most       of the     evening with a constant                     stream

of    reports        to be taken.            The   room was       quite      large,       recently m o d e r n i s e d

room and well              set   out   for    the task       it was       picked to be used for,

a l t h o u g h at    first      there were        not    enough tele p h o n e s        but T e l e c o m

e n gineers       set      up further        lines.



Throughout           the    evening       1 also a t t e n d e d at       the Boys Club,           adjacent           to

The Boys       club was         quite       busy but       taking    into account         the    number          of

people      involved       1 think          the    social    services      and helpers          did a ster 1 in<:

I was      finally stood down by Chief                      Ins p. AGAR,       who Ibelieve was

instructed        by Chief           S u p t . MOLE via telephone.

I returned home            that morning             to my wife and tried to expl a i n                     the

events     of trie day but              i. found that words

happened«




                                            I found myself          i ncreasi ngly d i s g u s t e d        by the

media      coverage       of the        events and found            it hard to       believe       that      the

S u n d a y morning       papers        showed      pictures    of o b v i o u s l y d e a d / d y i n g    fans,

whe n a that        time       few    of the      dead were     identified.            I just      think         of

parents who         did not          know    if their       loved ones were          dead or       not,      being

conf r o n t e d by a full            colour      picture     in the     press.

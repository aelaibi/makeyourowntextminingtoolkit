Other       fans       become a gg re s si v e and abusive                 to myself and my

f ellow       colleagues            about    the    crush of fans outside.                        I looked

thro ug h the           c oncertina gate A and saw that there was

tho us an ds        of fans         outside and a           lot was jfaeing crushed against

the    turnstiles.               At one stage            the    fans outside           star te d to

rock    gate A from side                 to side         in d es p er a ti o n    to open the

gates       that       the gates        should be opened.                PS    1066 H ig g i n s a sk e d

twice       for     the gate         to be opened and on the second o cc as i on

p er mi ss io n was          given by Supt.              M a rshall     for    the gate           to be

opened.           We    then formed two             lines       one at one        side       of the

gate and the other                   line o pp os it e making a funnel                   line       of

o ff icers        to stop a surge              into        the ground.           The   gate          was then

open after             c on f r o n t a ti o n w it h      the gate man Jack Stone,                      The

gate was          e v e n t u a l l y o pened and fans            came     in.     Tick e t s       could

not    be     checked due           to the vast amount                 of supp or te rs           entering

t hr o u gh    the      gate,        1 estimate          that a p p r o x i m a t e l y 300-~40Q

suppo r t e rs         were a l l o w e d    in t h r o u g h gate A a nd          the       pressure

outside        d e c re a se d and the gate was                  shut.        The gate was           only

open for about               45 seconds.           Dur in g      the    period of time              1 was

at    the L e p pi n gs Lane and              1 saw         numerous       fans    climb over

gate 8        into      the ground.           This         was not      known w h et he r            it was

due to        pressure         of    people w i t h no           tickets      trying         to      get in.

Ra n from the L ep pi ng s Lane                    turnstiles          to the     pitch       perimeter

in front of the L ep pi n gs Lane                        terracing,.       1 was       then

i n s t ru c te d      by Insp.       Beresford          *E* C & V to form a cordon

on the e i g h te e n yard              line of the            pitch and stop Li v er po ol

fans    crossing           the      pitch towards           the Forest Fans.                 Wh il st      in

the    cordon          1 could see L iverpool                  fans    spilling        out    of the

t e r ra c in g     over     the fencing.               Also    they were        being       lifted

                                                                                              R 402

by other         fans     into the West Stand.                   At   this        stage    I thought

it was a pitch             invasion          by L i ve rp oo l    fans.           It was    then

that     bodies        started         tobe ferried across the                    pitch by

supporters.              It was        at this      time     looking at the           bodies

being      ferried that           there was a m ajor              problem.           3 Liverpool

fans were         s tru ggling w it h a body                I g r ab be d hold of a corner

an d    ran across         the    pitch wit h         it.      The    person on the boarding

was     o bv i ou s ly    dead.        The    body was       taken to the            rear of the

g y m n a si u m and      left.         1then g r ab be d hold of a stretcher                      and

went     back     to the      pitch.          In    frant     of the Ko p there was a

doctor      trying        to resusc it at e a male               person,          after a short

while      he    i nstructed me to take                the body away,               he was    dead.

After      d ep os it in g    the      body     in the      g ym n as i um    I joined        up

wi th PC *s 20 0 0 an d S H 8 1 .              There was a lack of a m bu l a n c e s and

it was      deci de d      to use our C & V van to convey non serious

casu al ti es         to the N o r t h e r n General           Hospital.            A male and

female      person were           taken       in the van to the N o r t h e r n General

H os pital.           R e t u rn e d to gr ou nd to assist wit h                   casua lties

outside         the    gym.      I then met PS           1066 and       he deci de d         to

r egr ou p the C & V for Public Order Duties                                 outside       the ground

as     the fans wree          s ta rt in g     to   leave      the ground.

                 meant       that        they         had     to    s p i ll     onto       the    pitch,          even          then    I d i d n ’t

                 realise          the         enormity            of w h a t     was    going          on.        I had          seen     people         being

 ,              After       this    point      I went               the    ph^siotherapy                part        of    the H o s p i t a l

                where       I saw about          30    casualties           with minor             injuries.               I sent       a ll     but

                one    of    these    home.           Th e    one    man who          appeared          to       be w e l l ,     but   had      been

                knocked       unconscious             was    admitted           for    overnight             observations.




                By 6.00       pm    (1800)       the    area        was    cl ear      so    I left          the     hospital.           I walked

                back    to m y     car a n d      found my mother                 and       sister        waiting.              I still        had my

                car    keys.        I travelled              back    to L i v e r p o o l .




                As a    general       observation              I feel\that             there       wa s      a    lack     o \ co-ordination

                to    get    the    injured       to     hospital          in    priority          order          and an apparent                1ac k

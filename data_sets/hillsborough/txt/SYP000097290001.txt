Dear

In the absence of the Deputy Chief Constable, I reply to your second letter
to him dated 21 April, and in particular to paragraph number four.

You will recall that paragraph refers to Mr Woodward QC having the opportunity
of attending a local football match and I am now in a position to let you know
the necessary details, as below.

Arrangements have been made for Mr Woodward to attend the game between
Sheffield Wednesday FC -v- West Ham United on Tuesday 9 May 1989.

I should be pleased if Mr Woodward could attend at the South Yorkshire Police
Sports & Social Club, Niagara Road, Sheffield 6, at 6.00 pm that evening, when
he will be met by Chief Superintendents Terry Wain and Brian Mole who will
accompany him to the match.  Enclosed is a map of the Sports Club for
Mr Woodward's use.

I trust the above arrangements are acceptable to Mr Woodward but if there are
any queries or further details he requires in advance of the date, please do
not hesitate to get in touch.

Yours sincerely
HAP 1

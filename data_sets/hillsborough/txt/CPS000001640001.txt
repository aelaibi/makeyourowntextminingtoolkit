     Dear Mr Enzor

     Adlington -v- Duckenfield and Murray

     We refer to recent correspondence, specifically in regard to the decision advised on 18
     November 1998 not to intervene to take over the public prosecution, and note with concern
     that we have not heard further from you since our letter of 23 December 1998 in regard to
     th e provision of reasons.

     As you will appreciate we need to act expeditiously in considering the implications of this
     matter, and would be grateful for your advice by return as to when the reasons can be
     expected.

     Yours faithfully




     Winckworth Sherwood

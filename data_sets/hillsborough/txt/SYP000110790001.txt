Road     side       of       the    ground.              The    other       Officers            were     engaged           on    foot

patrol        in a l l o c a t e d a r e a s             around       the     ground.            The     simple         brief         was     to

respond        to       people          acting       suspiciously               near       vehicles          who      had       been

spotted        by the             motorcyclists.                    The    mobile         Officers        provided              the

facility         of       picking          the      ’f o o t m e n ’up a n d t r a n s p o r t i n g          them         to     the

areas      in q u e s t i o n .           Due       to    the       vast    a r e a to     be    covered          I     worked with

DC     Tuke    and J o n e s .

Patrols        were          maintained             during          the    morning         and    liaison was               maintained

with Detective                    Superintendent                McKay with a view                   to    identifying

potential           ’h o t s p o t s ' .        The       areas       of    concern which                featured           on

previous         match            days    were       visited and              it     is    fair     to    state         the

situation           became          very much a                'pot 1 u c k ' e x e r c i s e       due      to    the      volume          of

traffic and               supporters             around          the g r o u n d .

At     1.30pm       I     h a d a hot          meal       at     the g r o u n d     before        resuming             patro1 with

DC     Tuke    and       Jones          at 2 p m .

At     this    time          we    concentrated                on the W i s e w o o d ,          M i d d l e w o o d Road,

Merries        R o a d,       Halifax          Road and Foxhill                    areas.         Progress            through           the

traffic        was       slow a nd            one    of m y         lasting        impressions            was      the      number          of

supporters              drinking           outside            public       houses around               the    ground            in the

hour     before          kick       off       time.

After      3pm      t h er e       was    a    rad i o        message       received            requesting            attendance              at

the     ground.              I was       unable          to    either       clearly         interpret             the      message          or

transmit         using            the    radios          in our       possession.                I decided            to    contact

the     ground          by    telephone             and made          my way         to F o x h i l l     Police           Box.

I was      iparable to             contact          the       ground       or H a m m e r t o n     Road      by      telephone             due

to     engaged          lines       and       I believe             I obtained            the    information               that       all

Officers         were         required           in the         ground        from Ecc l e s f i e l d            control.

■we i m m e d i a t e l y         set    off    for       the       ground      but       became       quickly          blocked          in

th e    t raf f i c on            the    city a p p r o a c h         of H a l i f a x      Road.         I instructed                  the

Officers         w i t h me         to a b a n d o n          the    car    on H a l i f a x      Road       in a       safe
                                                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                                 R5

l o c a t i o n a n d we m a d e          our w a y      to    the     ground       on     foot.

Upon    arrival          we    entered          the     g r o u n d at      the     rear      of    the N o r t h         Stand.

My    first      impression           was       the     number       of     people       between          the       slipway          to

the    p i t c h at      the    side       of    the     North Stand              and    the       gymnasium             a r ea.

Ambulances          were       present          and     injured        supporters             were       being       treated.

The    source       of    this       activity           was    the     pitch.           I asked a uniform Officer

(male)       what      the     situation          was      and     I received            some       mumbled          reply which

I    could    not      understand.               Th e    Officer           started       to     cry a n d       my       next

recollection             is    being       on the        pitch       and     seeing        literally            hundreds             of

supporters          and Police             Officers           either        carrying          injured          or    dead

supporters.

One    of m y      first       thoughts          wa s    the      fact      that    the m a j o r i t y         of P o l i c e

Officers         would        probably          not     recognise           the O f f i c e r s       w i t h me         and myself

due    to our       mode       of    dress       and     the      f a ct    that    Officers             f r o m all        over       the

Force    were       on d u t y       at    the    ground.

DC J o n e s ,     Tuke       and    myself       were        quickly        drawn       to a s s i s t i n g        supporters

and Police          Officers          who       were     carrying           casualties             from    the       pitch.            The

majority         in h i n d s i g h t      were       dead.

Rather       than      be d r a w n       further        on t o    the      pitch       1 decided          to       visit        the

gymnasium with                a view       to    locating          and      gathering           all      the    Officers

under my         command.            I entered           the      g y m n a s i u m w i t h DC        Jones         and Tuke           and

saw    the    enormity          of    the       situation.             I believe           there         were       at    l ea s t     20

bodies       on the       floor       at    that        time.        Numerous           Officers          were       inside          the

room and         had     obviously          been        tasked with            specific            responsibilities.                        I

saw Detective             Superintendent                 McKay       and     wa s   given          instructions              to

obtain       the    details          of m o r t u a r y       space        throughout           the F o r c e        are a .

Rather       than      engage        the    l i nes      of    communication               to      the    ground          I decided

to    return       to F o x h i l l       Police        Box.       I retrieved             the C I D        car      from

Halifax       Road and          together          w i t h DC T u k e         and Jones             m ade my way             to

Foxhill       Police          Box.        T e 1ephone         enquiries           were     made       w i t h al l        hospitals
                                                                                                                                        PAGE        4

in the F o r c e         area       and without                 exception            the       staff       refused           to    supply

the    information             requested without                       first         obtaining             the a u t h o r i t y            of

the    hospital          administrator                   wh o    could         not       be    l oc a t e d .        Th e    situation

was    explained and                a    request          was     made         to    supply          the       information              to

Ecclesfield           control            rather          than H a m m e rton R o a d w h e n                    the       information

was    available.              Ecclesfield                control          were          informed          of       the     situation.

I was      able     to      obtain         the      information                requested             from       the M e d i c o         Legal

Centre       and    one       other        hospital             before         returning             to    the       ground.

At    this     time      Police          Officers           were       controlling                  traffic          on H a l i f a x        Road

and    progress          was       swift.           I supplied             the       information                to Det.           S u pt.

E N D OF   REPORT
Detective Aaapector


1 an a Detective inspector in. the Couth Yorkshire Police at present
ctr.tior.ec’ at Dcclesfield. Police station.


On Saturday 15 April 1^39 I was. on duty in coin end of 12 Detectives and.
2 motorcyclists with responsibility for offcnces of theft of and fron not or
vehicles parked in the vacinity of .Sheffield Wednesday football Ground*


T va\s present ’’hen all Officers on duty in connection with the Seni Final
football match between Liverpool and Dostinghar Dorest were briefed
by Chief Superintendent Duckcnfield*     A separate CID briefing followed
by Detective Superintendent McKay and Detective Inspector Dowell end
I briefed the Officers under our contend inrespoet of their areas
of responsibility.


All the Officers under ray co""':rnd were dressed casually 'dth DC Durston and DC
Hirst in possession of a CID car with responsibility for the city side of the
ground and DC Duke rad Jones in possession of a. further CID car with responsibilit
for the Dcnhill/Jdddlowood Doad side of the ground, Phe other Officers
were engaged on footpatrol inallocated areas around the ground*      The simple
brief was to respond to oeople acting suspiciously near vehicles who liad been
spotted by the notorcyclists*     The n.-bile Officers provided the facility of
picking the *fontnen* up and transportinp thea to the areas in question*
aaie to the vastaarea tc be covered I worked vdth. DC Duke and Jones*


Patrols ware maintained during the naming and Liaison was oaintazned
with Detective Superintendent Dckay with a view to identifying potential
*hotspots*,   Dhe areas of concern which featured on previous natch days
wore visited and iinii fair to state the situation became very much, a *potluck*
exercise due to the volune oftraffic and supgartojBS around the grounct*


at 1-pOpm I had a hot seal atthe ground before resuming patrol with
DC Duke and, Jones at 2pn,


At this time we concentrated on the ’.dsewood, !dddlew??/od Doao, Jerries --oad
Ilclifsiz Doad and Fo:d:ill areas,   Progress through the traffic was slow and
one of my lasting impressions was the number of supporters drznkxng outsxae
oublic houses around the ground in tne iaour oefore kick off time*
                                                                                      J -s
After 3pn there v/as a radio message received requesting attendance at the
ground#    I was unable to either clearly interpret the message or transmit
■using the radios in our possession*    I decided to contact the ground by
telephone and made my way to Foxhill Police Box#


I was unable to contact the ground or Kammerton Road by telephone due to
engaged lines and £ believe I obtained the information th a t all Officers
were required in the ground from Ecclesfield control#


We immediately set off for the ground but became quickly blocked in the traffic
on the city approach of Halifax Road#     I instructed the Officers with me to
abandon the car on Halifax Eoad in a safe location and we made our way to the
ground on foot#


Upon arrival we entered the ground at the rear of the North Stand#        My first
impression was the number of people between the slipway to the pitch
at the side of the North stand and the gymnasium area.      Ambulances were present
and injured supported were being treated#      The sourc^ of this activity
was the pitch#    X asked a uniform Officer (male) VlfeflA^he situation was and
I received some stumbled reply which I could not understand#     She Officer
started to cry and my next recollection is being on the pitch and seeing
literally hundreds of supporters and Police Officers either carrying injured
or dead supporters#


One of my first thoughts v/as the fact that the majority of Police Officers
would probably not recognise the Officers with ne and myself due to our
mode of dress and the fact that Officers from all over the Force were on
duty at the ground#


DC Jones| Take and myself were ciiicltly drawn to assisting supporters and
Police Officers who were carrying casualties from the pitch*      She majority
in hindsight were dead*


Father than be drawn further onto the pitch I decided to visit the gymnasium
with a view to locating and gathering all the Officers under my command#
I entered the gymnasium with. PC ;'ones and .Jake anci saw the enormity   02   “iie
situation*     I believe there were at le-.’st 20 bodies on the floor at tnat
time#     Humorous Officers were inside the room and had obviously been
tasked with specific responsibilities#      I saw detective Huperin*oendent
KcEay and was given instruct ions to obtain the details of mortuary spa.ee
throtighout the Force area*
                                                                                       <

Pather than engage the lines of communication to the ground I decided to return
to Foxhill Police Sox#    I retrieved the OID car from Halifax lid and together with
DC Hike and Jones made my way to Foxhill Police Bos#     Telephone enquiries
wore made with all hospitals in the Force area and without exception the
staff refused to supply the information requested without first obtaining
the authority of the hospital administrator who could not be located#       The
situation was explained and a request was cade to supply the information to
Seclesfield control rather than Hammerton Toad when the information vras
available.    Scclesfie^d control wore informed of the situation#    I v/as able
to obtain the information requested, fron the Hedico Legal Centre and one
other hospital before returning to the ground.


At this time Police Officers were controlling traffic on Halifax Toad and
progress was swift#    1 supplied the infornation to Det Pupt 1-IcKay and v/as
instructed to return to Hammerton Toad where relatives were being directed#


Tomothor w5.th DO Jones and Tuke I left the "round end travelled to Aammerton
Hoad.   The journey took a-rprcximately kO ninuted and I have no recollection of
seeing Officers controlling traffic on Penistone Poad#


Upon arrival at Hammerton Eoad PC Tuke and I were instructed to visit the
UortPem General 'aid Poyal i-allaaskire Hospitals with a view to instructing the
Officers present on the details of information the Casualty Sureau would
ronuire#     I went to the Casualty Bureau at Hcclosfield Training Centre
and obtained details of the information required#     Upon arrival at the
hospitals it was obvious that the Officers present under tiis command of
Inspector Pennett and Young were trained and aware of the information
required#


I returned to Hsmmerton Poad end confirmed the action taken before being
directed to the gymnasium at th.e ground.    Upon arrival I sow Detective
"unerintondent HeKay and was instructed to transport Prof Usher to
flhiregreen inrespect of a suspicious death involving a house fire#


I continued with duties at Pcolosfield in relation to the suspicious cearn
and a firearms incident#

seem            to       think            there            was          a    radio            message            from        Control                giving

18.                As    we    stood          in    the       cordon,       still           expecting         trouble,               a

number       of   drunken           fans          kept    running          up    to       individual          officers               or

groups       of    officers             and       shouting          obscenities                such    as    'You've            fucking

killed       t h em ,    you       bastards'.                 'It's      your        fucking          fault',          an d     so

forth.        They       were       obviously             distressed             and        I gave         instructions                  that

people       should       not       be       arrested          unless       absolutely                necessary            as      I felt

that    any       display          of    force       could          have    caused             the    crowds       in      the       stands             to

have    created          further             violence.              I was       concerned             that    large           scale

violence          would       break          out,    either          directed             at    opposing          fa n s      or

at    the    police.           I was          convinced             that    there           would      be    mass       violence

towards        the      police          as    it    was       obvious       that          a lo t      of    fans       believed

we    had    been       responsible                for    the       injuries/deaths .

19-                I became             aware       th a t     someome          wa s      speaking          over       the      public

announcement             system,             I presumed             it   was     Messrs.             Dalgleish          and        Clough,

because        the      crowds          hushed       when       they       spoke          and    they       seemed         to      have        a

calming       effect          on    the       crowds.           I would          have          preferred          this        to     have

happened          some    t i me        earlier          as    I am       sure       it     would      have       allowed            the

police,       particularly                   my    cordon,          to h a v e       participated             more         actively                in

rescue       rather       than          public       disorder            prevention.                  I would          ad d     that

earlier        announcements                  over       the    public          address          system       had       in      the       main

been    ineffectual                and       hardly       audible,          either             because       of     the       quietness

of    the    individual             using          the    system,          or    the        actual         poor    quality               of    the

system.

20.                After       the       calming          influence             of     Mr.      Dalgleish          I    felt         it       was

24.               We    also        attended        the       Bassett          Public    House,    where       the    front

windows         had    been       damaged         by,    it    is    believed,          Liverpool       fans,       who    had

tried      to    get    the       licensee         to    open       up    so    they    could    use    the

telephone.             He    refused         and    they       broke       the    windows       along    the    length         of

the    pub      frontage.              A crime      report          was    submitted       but    there       are    no

useful       lines      of       enquiry.

25.               At    6 . 55      p.m.     we    attended          the       North    Stand    for    de-briefing            but

were    sent      out       to    an      incident       at    the       Northern       General    Hospital          where

it w a s     believed            t h at    relatives          were       causing       problems    to    staff.           Other

officers         had    arrived            before       us    and    it    wa s   ascertained          that    the    Press

had    been      harrassing               relatives          which       had    caused    them    to    take    issue

with    the      Press.           No      arrests       were    made       and    the    matter    was    dealt       with

sensitively            by    the       police.

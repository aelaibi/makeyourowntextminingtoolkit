Thank you very m uch for your letter of 7 May in support of recent calls for a new public
inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

I am currently considering the representations which have been made for a fresh inquiry. I
have been following the families’ campaign for a new inquiry closely and I have had the
opportunity to meet some of the members of the Hillsborough Families Support Group
since the broadcast last December of the television drama about the disaster. I am very
conscious of the strength of feeling on this issue and will reach a decision as soon as I can.

Finally, I w ould like to thank you for your kind comments on our election success. I am
very much looking forward to the task ahead.

I am a season ticket                holder and       I got my ticket         from Anfield.        The

ticket        cost £6 and was            for   the West End terracing           in L ep pinqs Lane,

Sheffield.



I left        home about 9 a . m . (0900 hrs)           on S a t u r d ay   15 April     1989    (150489)

and    caught a train to Shotton,                  near Queensferry,          where    I met Frank

M A R N E Y at about          11.a . m . <1100 hrs)



We    tr av el le d straight           to Shef                        ETuck in a traffic          jam in

S to c kp o rt    for about        one houj/.



We a r ri v ed at S h e f f i e l d at about          1.45pm    (1345 hrs)       and    parked the      car

in a side         road off P en i st o ne Rd about            fifteen minutes          from the ground.

We w a l k ed     to the gr ou nd from here,            along with a steady stream of both

L iv erpool       and N o t t i n g h a m Forest     supporters.          I did not     see any

suppo rt er s         consuming alcohol          en route to the ground or any f ighting                   or

drunkeness.



We made         our way to the ground as Frank                 had been there          previously.       We

did    not      receive any d irections            or escort     from Police Officers.



The    three      of us a r ri v e d at        the entrance     to the ground at a b o u t ten

m i nu te s     past    two    (1410 h r s ).      I entered v/ia rthe turnstiles at              the

L e p pi n gs    Lane end.         The    entire    entrance    area^ to          ground was

compl et el y         packed out,        by £his    I m ean   it was, tightly      packed with

supporters.            I saw about             e ^mounted Po                 outside    the turnstiles

and    there were about             ten P ol i ce m en on f.                    were    trying    to

control         the    crowd,    but *were unable        to do so.          It was a crush       in front

of    the t urnstiles and              it took me from 2 . 1 0       pm     (1410 hrs)    until 2. 5 5     pm

(1455 hrs)            to get    into     the ground thro ug h the           turnstiles.

       g.   „ I ’d like to say at this                  point    that
                                                                            \„^

^ c c i ^    in thro ug h the t urnstiles wi thaut                               njy^ in their       tickets.        This was

             to speed up their               entranc e        into the ground.



             I saw a m o un te d Police Offi ce r at the                       right       side of the terrace

             turns ti le s         lifting    people         out of the      crush over the barrier               blocking

             the avenue            between the         turnstiles and the                passageway    leading       to the

             S o ut h Stand.          He? also a ss is t ed about            two        people out of the        crush and

             over      the    top of the wall            of the turnstile                block    into the ground.



             When      I got       into   the ground          I did not see any gates open whatso ev er .                       I

             w a l k e d forward          towards      the    rear of the West Stand.                 I was     on my own at

             this      time    having       been s e pa ra te d from                                 outside.



             There      is a toilet          to the      left of the tunnel f a d i n g                into    the West

             S ta nd terracing,            w h i ch    I used.    I did not see any signs                    showing me

             w he re    to go nor did           I see any stewards.                     I saw a large        crowd heading

             towards         the    tunnel            I f ollo we d them



             I did not         know that you            could get       into the          side    pens on the        left and

             right      by walk in g ar ou nd           the stand.         I just         thought you went        down the

             t u n n e 1.



             When      I entered the           tunnel        it was     crammed full        of     people.     The    m atch

             had not star te d at              this      point.       I was w a lk in g          through the tunnel      you

             could      not    run because            of the    people     present.



             Wh e n     I got       to the     end of the         tunnel      you could not stop and             I    was

             'shunted'         down the        t er ra cing      towards       the front.

                                                                                                                          31962



                     had p reviously told me                     to stand at         the back of the terrace

             ecause       of the       crush the           previous year,           so    I tried to do so but was

            unable       to get through,                 because      of the      pressure of the         crowd.      I was

             shunt/ed'         into    the    left        side of the terrace,              ie Pen 4,



            There were          no Police O ff icers                 in the tunnel         or the stand         itself     that

            I saw.        There were          no stewards             either.



            I did not       see any other                 incidents of disorder              before entering          the

            stand.        I did not see a n yb o dy drinking                       alcohol.



            Going    back       to w hen      I was        'shunted"        into    the    terracing      I was      carried

            f or wa rd    in the       crowd to a point about                     one metre    in front         of the

            terrace       fencing       in front           of the stand,           d ir ec tl y facing     the gate.



            At this       time    I could not move my arms                        because    of the      crush.       As the

            crowd swayed you had to                       pull your        legs across       because      they did not

            move automat ic al ly .                  It was      difficult        to m a i nt a in your    balance.          You

            couldn't       control       your        own movements,            they were      dictated by the              crowd.



            I had to stand w it h my head back so                            I could breathe and because                    of the

            crush    I had to take               long deep breaths.



            People a ro un d me who were                    taller        than me had their arms                resting     on my

            head,    so    I had to keep moving my head a ro u nd to breathe.

                  This     girl was        shouting and screaming              for   help because        she was            being

     /Oa          Some       people were       climbing       over the front         fence   onto the      pitch.                I

            Co   ’            know a ny thing about           the gate       because    I did not see          it at all.

                  When       I was    shouting       for    the girl as exp la in ed above,             it was         before 3.

                  10 pm       (1510 hrs).           I know this       because    there    is a clock on the                  right

                  come     into      contact w it h a barrier myself.



                  B e h i nd me was a stocky fella               in his early twenties.                He was      trying to

                  push the          crowd back ar ou nd        him.     As he was       trying    to make       room         I could

                   I made my way to the area behind the West                                        stand and sat down by the

 \X 2 iC tL A O * j\fn   the area behind the stand                        I saw        people      holding         injuries          to their

£>k>\d             hands and arms.                 Two     ground         staff were          handing            out water      to    people,           by

                   the stairs          leading       to the          right hand side               of the West stand seating.




                   I was       looking       for                and




                   After       10 -    15 minutes          I left the stand area via the gate C,                                      w h ic h was

                   open,       and made my way             back       to the town            centre         to find a telephone.                        I

                   queued up for the tel ep ho ne                      but     I could not                remember       the    code.          I then
                                                                                                   PAGE          7
                                                                                                   S1962

walked      back     to the     car on my own to meet                    and            This   had been

p*re a rr an ge d     if we were        ever    to get seperated,



I was      first     back    to the     car.            carne after about      ten minutes          it

wo ul d    be about 4 pm         <1600 hrs)                    follo w ed at about 4 .30        pm       <1630

hrs)      and we e ve nt u al l y t ra velled          home.



Whilst       in the ground           I did not see a n yb od y escaping           through    the

fencing,       however a number           of    people escaped       onto the      pitch wh e n the

gate at the front             of the     terracing was         opened.     This was at about 3.15

pm    <1515 hrs).



I could see          people     getting       through the gate at the          pitch,    but    I

c o u l d n ’t get    near    it.



     received a cut to my              left               t was about      1 inch long and about

a quarter       of an

                            linen'               [received this      from the      crush outside

by the       turnstiles                        from the walled area between one                of the

turnstiles.



I did not attend the                 hospital    and    I did not    receive any medical

tr eatment whatsoever.



I    did not assist an yo ne who was               dead or      injured.



I think       that    the deaths and the           injuries were         caused    in the    surge and

there was       no where        to go to escape.



I left the ground e v en t u a l l y of my own accord.                     I did not hear any

loud speaker a n no u nc e m e n t s          except    for one at    the beginning         w hen    people

                                                                                                                  S1962

             were    told to get off     the    pitch area.



             I. did not witness any        criminal     offences         of any kind.             The Police           at

             the front      of the stand   did not appear            to know what was going on and

             were    treating   it as    crowd violence.



             There was      not any P ol i ce about     before       the game          started but after wa rd s

             there were about 200 outside            the Leppings            Lrt end.



             If there had of been more Police around                     thqr/lur ns^ i l^s and the               rear o -f

             I. handed the whole        of my ticket      over at the turnstile.                        I. was   not

             given the      stub back.

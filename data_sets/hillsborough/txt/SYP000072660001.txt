                 more     dead and               injured.              When        I returned                to    the     passageway                I saw a

                 I continued                helping          until          I could           do       no m o re .        _______ a n d          I then           went

                 into     the       North Stand               and       joined           my    son and             brother,]                .        I was

             absolutely           knackered          and    distraught             by all       the    events.         I j u st     sat

             clown a n d       cried.

             We     all   then       left     the    ground       at    about          4.30   (1630)      and walked            ba ck   to

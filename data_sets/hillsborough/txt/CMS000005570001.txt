Dear Mr
Your letter of 3 January to the Prime Minister about football
hooliganism has been passed to the Minister of Sport. I have been
asked to reply.
Your comments have been noted.
The Government has been concerned for some time now about
football hooliganism and has worked closely with the football
authorities and the police in implementing a package of measures
to deal with the problem.       For example there are now strict
controls on the availability of alcohol at football grounds, the
police have been given stronger powers under the Public Order
Acts to take action against troublemakers, there is wider and
more effective use of close circuit television and better
segregation arrangements at the grounds.

An important new measure has also been introduced to prevent
convicted football hooligans from going to matches abroad.    The
Football Spectators Act 1989 give courts in England and Wales the
power to impose restriction orders on those convicted of football
related offences. These orders require those in respect of whom
they are made to attend at police stations when specified
football matches are being played abroad.

In his report on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster Lord
Justice Taylor said that all seater stadia would do more than any
other single measure to improve the safety, behaviour and control
of spectators at football matches. The Government agrees with
his view and intends that all grounds in the Football League
should be all seater by 1999. The Government is also introducing
other anti-hooligan measures recommended by Lord Justice Taylor
in the form of specific offences related to football. Under new
legislation to be introduced shortly it will be an offence
to throw missiles, run onto the pitch or indulge in racialist
or obscene chanting.

Yours sincerely

ON SATURDAY I FOUND A BLACK CASSETTE RECORDER SIMILAR TO A WALKMAN THAT FELL
OUT OF THE POCKET OF A MAN WHO WAS CARRIED OUT OF THE TERRACES DEAD.   THIS WAS
AT ABOUT 10 PAST 3,
I GAVE THE RECORDER TO A POLICEMAN TOGETHER WITH MY NAME AND ADDRESS.
I TRIED TO GIVE IT TO OTHER POLICEMEN BUT THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY TOO BUSY
D E L I N G WITH THE INJURED & DEAD.
THE MAN WAS IN HIS 3US? 3 j.G? WE"ARING A SHIRT AND JEANS.

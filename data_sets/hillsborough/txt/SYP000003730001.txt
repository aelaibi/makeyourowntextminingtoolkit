            I am a single man and I reside at the above address together with my

            mother.      On Saturday Apr i1/ 15th 1989 <150489)               I travelled to

           Hillsborough to see the F4 Cup Semi-Final                  between Liverpool and

            Nottingham Forest „          I am an avid j-i ve\poo 1 fan a nd I travelled in a

            private motor        car together with four otir^r people.                 It was a journey

           we arranged between ourselves,

       10 miles from tj>tr ground.            We stopped at a pub f q

      ,We were n o ^ s u b j e c t e d to any travel         delays a ir the way to the ground

ten    that   I can remember.           When we stopped at          § pub there were other

       football    supporters      including Li ve rj<fo 1 and Nottingham Forest fans

      drinking together and there                    no trouble at all.

      We arrived in Sheffield at about                           s and parked about a

      mile from the ground but I c|nn^remeiTiber the name of the r o a d .                       We

      were not escorted from h e ^ l ^ o            the ground at all although I

      Police officers g r o u n d        W w s t r e et s.    I saw no fighting or anything

       of that nata/e outside Ima/^pidund at all.                   We arrived at/the

       turnstiles ^art about       1j      hrs and it was just a mass o p e o p l e

      around the turnstiles.              There was no queueing systjyfri, it was just

       chaos.     There seemed to be no Police super v i s io ^ r             stewards to

      advise     people.    I did have problems finding Jtfie correct tu r ns ti 1e to

      enter through.        I had to just join a l a r p f mass of people all trying

       to get through the turnstiles together./ For some reasons that                         I am

      unaware of there were not enough J / b l i ce officers or Ste wa rd s

      filtering them into queues toventer the stiles.                     It was     chaVs*

      Whilst     I was   in this    chaosyoutside        it became obvious that         lere was a

      way in to the /-jght of Jme stiles.                    I was standing nearby so I ducked

      through with lo /.s       of other p<£dple and al though 3/ had my ticket               ready

      there was noTfene to check it and I still have/both the stubb and the

      ticket.      I /produce    it for the benefit of the inquiry,                    "No

ver^busy,     I realised that I had to go with the f 1ow and y n d e d up in

pen 3.    I think it was at that       point that I realised tp fa t there were

fences keeping     people   in the pen and they c o u l d n ’t g/ove sideways to

immediately took me off my feet and I was yoff my feet unable to touch

the terrace underneath me for some time./ 1 do not recall any scenes

of violence    inside the turnstile entrances or inside the ground.                           I

around me could help at all.         To have bent dcywn or slid down to

assist them would nave been without doubt absolute suicide.                        Very

slowly the pressure eased off and I w a s ^ M ^ t o             get out from the

back and I left pqn 3 a t about quarter |p%st three.                  I went back out

through the tunnaft which at that time was almost empty and there were

certainly no deafd     bodies   lying in the tunnel at              that time that I

could see.     I was   so shocked and just wanted to                get out.   I      stopped

j ust   inside the|turnstiles for a moment or two and then began to

leave to telephone home,        I wanted to tell my mother            1 was safe.         1

thought that a few people had lost their             lives.      I did not realise

the scale of the disaster at this time,

On leaving the ground onto Leppings Ln,                I        a group<2 of

laughing and joking between themselvej/'                   I was horrified at this and

turned to the one who laughed a n ^ C a i d ,          ’You bastard,     there are

people dying in t h e r e . ’   He ^ T o p p e d   laughing and looked at me and was

obviously totally obliv^^us to the problems occurring                    inside the

ground.     From the lo^v. on his face he was               in no communication with

the ground at all and until          I opened my                they knew nothing at

all of the tragic events going on

  be 1 ieve the whole affair w-M j»tforly o r g a n i s e d .       O ut sid e the

turnstiles the organisatj^i/was non-existant .                   It was a mass of

people all trying to            through a limited number of turnstiles.
                               C
There were no signjr/or       stewards     to di rect me to where        I wanted to

go.    I just went//wi.th the flow of pe op l e.             I suggest that there was a

total absence yBf su per vi sio n both inside the ground and outside the

'around.

Further to/the a b o v e , p rior to goi^g^lfo^the ground to gain access^ I

went   to tjfie turnstile area aJXabout one o ’clock to sell,                if l y t ou 1d ;

a spare ticket for t h e J ^ p p i n g s Ln standing t e r r a c e .     I fsHlnd I could

have sold that ticJret many times o v e r .           There we re a Ip^C of Liverpool

fans without J/fckets at that time and I feel                 this cot/l& be relevant

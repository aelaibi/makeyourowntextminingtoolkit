Ian Daines is on annual leave now until Monday 15 September 1997. He
has left the following instructions for you.


1)     Take his file on Hillsborough and get up to speed generally.


2)     In particular look for further correspondence between Mervyn Jones
       and Mr Brummell re the statements where items are missing from
       the original statements, who gave legal advice etc.


3)     You will be going to London with Ian and Ken on Wednesday 17
       September to Winckworth Pemberton. I have organised a staff car
       to pick you all up from Woodall Services. You will be picked up at
       7.00 am there to allow time to stop for breakfast.


4)     On Wednesday 24 September Lord Justice Stuart Smith and Chris
       Bone will be visiting South Yorkshire. Can you make contact with
       Chris Bone to introduce yourself etc. Enclosed is a copy of the
       general routine for an evening football match at Hillsborough. You
       will be able to firm up details with Chris Bone.

       With regard to this visit I have organised a staff car and driver to be
       available for the whole of his visit. I have booked two rooms at the
       Holiday Inn Royal Victoria for them to use at any time throughout
       their stay. I have booked lunch for the five of you in the SOM
       Restaurant 12.00/12.30.

We spoke, and I am writing to confirm the details o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s visit to
Sheffield on Wednesday September 24.

2.     The Judge, accompanied by his Clerk Graham Catherall, myself, and a driver will be
arriving from London at about midday. The car will take us to your force headquarters at
Snig Hill for lunch, and I am grateful to you for offering to fax me a map showing the way
from the M l (junction 33).

3.     After lunch, the Judge wishes to travel to Heeley to see the force archive o f material
about the Hillsborough disaster. He then wishes to go to the Hillsborough ground in time to
have a look around it in daylight if possible and to see police briefing and preparation for the
match that evening. As I understand it that would perhaps mean leaving Heeley at about
1630 or 1645.

4.     The Judge will remain at the ground until some time after match kick-off (1945) but
does not plan to stay until the end o f the game. I imagine that we will be leaving at or
before half-time to travel back to London in reasonable time.

5.     Our party will be travelling by Government car throughout. I would be grateful if you
could make arrangements for our driver to be looked after both at Snig Hill and at Heeley,
and for a lead car to be on hand to guide us to Heeley, to the ground, and finally back to the
motorway.

6.     I have discussed these arrangements with M r Mackrell,the Sheffield Wednesday
secretary, and have written to him separately. The Judge’s visit to Sheffield will be private
and we are not planning any publicity for it.

7.       Thanking you in advance for your help

COMMUNICATION BETWEEN HFSG AND SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE

Since we spoke on the telephone yesterday, I have given some consideration to the way we
communicate with each other, which is often by fax followed by a letter through the mail.
Frequently the fax message has a front sheet and the letter thus we are sending three pieces of
paper, where one should suffice.

Since I took over responsibility for the Hillsborough Scrutiny, I have had a plain paper fax
(number 0114 2963113) installed in my office and this provides printed hard copy that does not
deteriorate, unlike the roll paper fax machines using thermal printing which deteriorates with age
and light. I will be pleased therefore to receive correspondence from you, on the above fax
number only, without a front sheet and without the need for a confirmation letter by post, saving
both time and costs.

Would you also be willing to receive correspondence from myself by fax in this way, except of
course when we are sending copies of statements, documents, plans and photographs, when we
would use the post in the normal way.

Re:   Hillsborough Disclosure File

At 4.00 p.m. Wednesday 29th January 1992 I saw Mr Paul Middup, Secretary
of the Police Federation, and discussed with him the position regarding
the disclosure of statements of police officers involved in the
Hillsborough disaster enquiry. I pointed out that we were now receiving
applications for statements and that authority from officers would be
required before they were released.

In brief, in accordance with legal advice it had been decided that
statements could be released but they should not be released unless
appropriate authority had been obtained. In discussions with members of
the Hillsborough families, they had been told that any applications for
officers statements should be forwarded to Headquarters rather than
individual officers, and then approaches would be made through this
department to seek approval from the officers concerned. Unless approval
was given then statements would not be released.

In addition, mention was made of the fact that some members of the families
sought meetings with individual officers and again requests would be
directed to Headquarters in order that necessary approaches could be' made. ,
Comment was made that it was felt time to let matters rest and that many
officers might not wish to be involved further in resurrecting the
Hillsborough disaster. Police Constable Middup indicated that he felt
he should seek legal advice on behalf of his members as to whether or not
officers should grant approval for their statements to be released.
I agreed that I would not approach any officers for approval until such
time as I had received Federation advice and I would ensure that where
requests were made to officers they were made aware of that advice,
whatever it may be.

Police Constable Middup assured me that he would expedite the matter and
would seek to have the advice in the next few days.


NOTE - POLICY

Where requests are made for police officers statements then approaches
would be made to the officers by memorandum accompanied by Federation
advice given by their legal representatives. .

No approaches would be made until that advice has been received.

HILLSBOROUGH DISCLOSURE POLICY


At 9.15 a.m. today, I spoke to Mr               on the Disclosure Policy.

Agreed that the existing advice remains appropriate and that he can see
no reason why our photographs cannot now be released in connection with
my suggestion in the interests of goodwill on behalf of the South Yorkshire
Police.

The matter will be discussed further on 28th January 1992.

                  SUBJECT:         hillsborough disaster - requests for disclosure


                  I return the file of correspondence which you forwarded to me together
                  with your minute of 3 October 1991• You will see that each item has
                  been numbered and the history of the correspondence is set out at the
                  front of each. For example, HDl refers to a request made on
                  20 December 1989 which was denied by West Midlands Police on
                  3 January 1 9 9 0 . HD/2 is a request dated 14 December 1 9 8 9 which was
                  denied by West Midlands Police on 5 January 1 9 9 0 . And so on.

                  It is a matter for your decision as to whether you wish to resurrect
                  interest by writing further updates in response to such requests.
                  Do you intend to write say every three months?

                  Your minute of 3 October 1991 implies that you will write acknowledging
                  receipt. I was led to believe your letter would express policy. It
                  was not envisaged that further attention would be given by me other
                  than filing the requests with the other Hillsborough papers. What
                  further attention do you have in mind? Do you wish the actual requested
                  material to be searched out and copied? Do you wish the question of
                  'property' to be researched?

                  Please indicate those areas that you decide require further action
                   and the necessary action will be taken. I would point out this will
                   inevitably delay the work of this team, but this other work can easily
                 . be done if required.

               (Discipline & Complaints)


              SUBJECT:          DISCLOSURE OF 'HILLSBOROUGH MATERIAL*


               Forwarded herewith is a copy of an advice from R C Johnston concerning
               the disclosure of Hillsborough material.

               We spoke on Thursday respecting the maintenance of this policy of
               non-disclosure that remitted from this advice and you stated that
               it was your intention to stay with this policey.

               Letters are from time to time being received asking for copies of
               items of material and presently they are forwarded to me here at
               Hammerton Road.  I recommend that they be acknowledged at your office
               on receipt and that acknowledgement should be in the form of one or
               more standard letters drafted to your personal satisfaction. The
               letter with copy correspondence should then be sent to me for filing
               in our papers.

               Obviously I might draft such letters, but it represents a diversion
               from my present occupation and not desirable. I do not have immediate
               typing power at my disposal, nor are you and I easily able to confer
               as to the wording of the different letters involved.  I wonder if
               you would care to discuss with Chief Superintendent Mole your policy

GEN/2
I am aware that a substantial number of requests have been received for
copies of documents and other material acquired for the purposes of the
various investigations into the Hillsborough Disaster and now in the
possession of the South Yorkshire Pol ice. The following purposes can be
identified.
1   Lord Justice Taylor’s enquiry.
2   Coronal inquests.
3   DPP investigation.
4   Discipiinary investi gation.
It will be known that Council opinion has been sought on the vexed question
of disclosure and the following principles can be drawn from this opinion.
a   As a general rule no documents or material ought to be disclosed unless
    civil proceedings have been commenced and discovery is due to take
    place.
b   No disclosure of documents, video films and photographs which are
    clearly in the ownership of someone else should be disclosed by the
    Police without the owners consent.
c   No information should be disclosed that is 1 ikely to prejudice any
    disciplinary hearing.
d   Statements taken for the sole purpose of the six complaints from Messrs
    McMahon! Leigh;* Marti n^Morri son, Ki 1 cull eri *and Tyrrell. These being as
    I understand it the only complaints which have been investigated
:   separately and not subsumed in the investigation into the "main event",
    are subject to public in te re st immunity and therefore must not be
    disclosed under any circumstances.
There is no legal requirement as far as I am aware at present to disclose
any information. No request for information has been made in the course of
civil proceedings concerning the Chief Constable where the stage of
discovery has been reached and there are to my knowledge no relevant
criminal proceedings.
It seems to me there are three policies which can be adopted by the Police,
a   Disclose nothing.
b   Disclose everything.                                             '•••■'
c    Disclose selectively.      .
The first may be seen as attractive because of the resource time which will
be taken in finding, copying and then releasing material. However against
this is the loss of public favour which may result from not disclosing the
most innocuous material, say a persons own statement which has no bearing on
any remaining issues of the disaster. Indeed I would go further and suggest
  -   2   -




              that such a policy may be misinterpreted deliberately or otherwise by the
              media and others so that there is constructed a belief that the Police have
              something to hide.
  5           A policy of disclosing everything is not possible for the following reasons:
              Material which is owned by someone else should not be disclosed without
              their permission and in this context it may seem to be more practible to
              refer the person who has     requested the material to the owner. Statements
              taken as part of the six     complaints referred to in Paragraph 2d cannot be
              disclosed since they are     public interest immune and itis not for the Police
              to wave that immunity.
  6           The final policy of selective disclosure appears attractive because although
              it will have resource implications it does enable the Police to protect the
              public image aspects of the case, particularly in the light of the Forces
              most recent statement of purposes and values. But it does have a further
              drawback which is the inevitable arbitration which will have to take place
              and which may well lead to allegations of "cover-up" or something similar
              thus negating the primary purpose for adopting the selective disclosure
              policy.
. 7           One final matter which must not be lo st sight of is the policy which has
              been adopted in relation to requests from the Hillsborough Steering Group.
              {ACC Stuart Anderson’s letter of 2 May refers). It has been reiterated on a
              number of occasions that no request for disclosure will be considered until
              after the disciplinary aspects of Hillsborough have been completed. The
              reasoning is of course the possibility that disclosure may prejudice those
              proceedings. Even then it has been said that applications will be dealt
              with on their merits and that regard will be had to the purpose for which
              the material is required. So the principle of selective disclosure has
              already been articulated at least to the Hillsborough Steering Group.
  8           A number of different classifications of document can be identified and
              although the following list is not intended to be exhaustive it can be used
              to develop a policy of disclosure although such a policy would not be
              implemented until after the disciplinary aspects of Hillsborough have been
              resolved. This of course will include court action such as Judicial Review
              relating to decisions taken on those disciplinary aspects
              a       Olio Statements
                      Apart from statements taken in connection with .the six specific
                      complaints referred to in Paragraph 2d there can ultimately be no
                      objection in law to these being disclosed. I f previous requests have
                      been refused on a "for the time being" basis. There is a risk of
                  -   criticism if these requests are not dealt with until a fresh request is
                      made.

     b   Request for Copy Statements of someone other than the waker
         Again with the exception referred to at (a) there can be no objection
         in law to providing copies as long as there is a written authorisation
         from the maker of the statement. Where previous requests have been
         refused the potential criticism referred to at (a) is relevant.
     c   Request for return of ticket
          These belong to the owners and therefore there can be no objection to a
          request for disclosure from an owner.
     d   Audio, Photographic and Video Material
          In the main this material will not "belong" to South Yorkshire Police
          and under this heading the issue of Copy-right looms large. I would
          recommend that any request from someone other than the owner is
          directed to that quarter.
     e     Pathologist Reports
          These are "expert" evidence and as such any request from someone other
          than the expert should be directed to them.
     I believe two further points are worth making. In the area of civil claim
     for compensation I know of no case where the refusal to provide statements
     or evidence of a persons presence at Hillsborough is holding up the proper
     conduct of the case. Secondly any policy of disclosure should be supported
     by a policy of charging.

         SUBJECT:     POLICY FOR DISCLOSURE OF HILLSBOROUGH MATERIAL

          1.   This paper is submitted to enable policy decisions to be made
               for dealing with any request that is received seeking material
               connected with the Hillsborough Enquiry.

         SIZE OF PROBLEM

          2.   Currently the force has received some fifty requests for material.
               This does not include possible requests to West Midlands which
               may not have been forwarded. This does not include the
               "Hillsborough Steering Committee” requests which have never been
               specified.  It does not include the requests for return of
               material that was surrendered on condition of ultimate return
               such as tickets.  It is believed that there are hundreds of these
               conditional surrenders.

          3.   One may anticipate that once it becomes known that South Yorkshire
               Police are releasing material further requests will be received.

         PROBLEM OF "OWNERSHIP"   :

          H.   It is a question never resolved as to the status of this material
               which would make it appropriate for South Yorkshire Police to
               release it. For example a request was received for the release
               of a pathologist's report that might have been dealt with by
               referring the requester to the pathologist or to HM Coroner.
               Another example would be photographs taken by press cameramen.
               Would South Yorkshire Police act correctly to release such
               material?                                            .




          5.   Once the problem of "ownership" is resolved the general plan would
               be to seek to classify requests by type and have a disclosure
               policy according to that classification. Then when a similar
               request falling into that classification is received it can be
               dealt with in accordance with the determined policy.

         PHILOSOPHICAL CONSIDERATIONS .

          6.   The legal position I would suppose is that there is no legal
               requirement for South Yorkshire Police to disclose anything.

          7.   The choices of policy are:-
                                             a. disclose nothing
                                             b. disclose anything on request
                                             cd is cl os e selectively

         ■8.    A'-policy of giving on request is attractive since it shows an
                openness that will find favour publicly and will comply with the
                wishes of the requester. Tne material is innocuous and current
               ■■nurr,r-r?s sr*?                                               .
9.    At the other extreme a policy of non-disclosure has benefits in
       that it is less costly of resources, avoids nice judgements that
      might give rise to criticism and avoids embarrassment or argument
      in the event of the requested material not being found.

10.   Any disclosure might become part of a gathering of material that
      could form the basis of a book or a programme exposing differences
      with the "authorised version" of events revealed by the Taylor
      Enquiry or the Inquest. The chance of this occurring piecemeal
      is exceedingly remote but any disclosure may lead to access to
      researchers seeking exactly this objective.

11. If not an "all or nothing" policy then disclosure will require
      decisions on merits of individual cases. This may lead to South
      Yorkshire Police arbitrating on matters of good taste for example
      a request for a photograph showing dead son's corpse in situ.
      Probably any souveniers will be marketable.

CLASSIFICATIONS CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED

12.   The classifications currently identified are:-

      Cl   Request for copy of statement made by the requester, Such
           requests have been received in the past ostensibly for inquest
           or 1 itigation purposes and have not been actioned. It may
           be that the purpose has now passed.   Probably none of those
           already received should be actioned unless fresh request is
           made.

      C2   Request for copy of statement made by someone other than the
           requester.

      C3   Request for copy of statement made by someone other than the
           requester when the maker has given consent for supply to the
           requester. Requests falling in both these categories have
           been received but like Cl the purpose may have passed.
           Probably none of those already received should be actioned
           unless fresh request is made.

           Request for return of ticket handed over to West Midlands
           Enquiry.  Some requests by letter have been received that
           may relate to civil actions. Others arise from a form of
           receipt given by West Midlands at the time indicating the
           handover was conditional. There appear to be some hundreds
           of these. Probably none of those should be actioned unless
           fresh request is made.

           Request for audio, photographic or video material., Requests
           have been received for photographs. There appear to be .
           possible sub groups depending on the provenance of the
           material:-

           a.     South Yorkshire Police Material;
           b.     Media Material;
           c.     Fire and Ambulance Service Material;
           d.     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Material;
           e.     Private Individual's Material.;
           f ..   West Midlands Police Material,
       ♦
               .


                                     Probably copyright considerations arise in relation to
                                     disclosure of any other than South Yorkshire Police Material
                                     and if a policy of disclosure finds favour then legal advice
                                     should be sought together with the approval of the "owner".
                                     Costs also arise as supply probably should be conditional
                                     on payment of fee. The administrative problems may be
                                     considerable in that if the requester does not have a
                                     reference for the photograph he wants it may be exceedingly
                                     difficult to trace.

                            C6    Requests for expert evidence such as pathologists report.
                                  Probably the answer to the "ownership" problem would indicate
                                  that South Yorkshire Police should not disclose but refer the
                                  requester to the pathologist, etc.

                            C7    Requests for material made by police officers.  As far as is
                                  known no requests have been made by South Yorkshire Police
                                  officers who might feel they had grounds to sue the Chief
                                  Constable and would seek specific material to support their
                                  CHS6 *




                    13.      The need for the following decisions to be made has been
                             identified:-

                            A - The "ownership problem” - needs legal advice as to status
                                     of this material

                             B - "Philosophical problem" - needs to be a decision on the
                                  fundamental stance of the force, all?, nothing?, selective?

                             C - If selective then decision needed on whether to release
                                 on past requests or only any fresh requests.

                             D - If selective then decision needed on whether classification
                                 plan is appropriate after which more detailed work will be
                                 undertaken in relation to each identified classification

                                     easiest course to take is to disclose nothing.   The
                                     ification of that course, if justification is needed, is

                     SUBJECT:                HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY - PROPERTY


                     The following is a resume of property held with the Hillsborough
                     File for your information and consideration as to disposal:

                     CLOTHING

                     There are 41 pairs of shoes and 40 single shoes.   In one case
                     the owner is known and in one other an enquiry to establish a
                     suspected owner is still outstanding.   The remaining shoes are
                     unidentified.

                     There are 60 hats/caps in the property none of which have been
                     identified.

                     There are 44 scarves and 1 flag, together with 61 items of
                     personal clothing including shirts, jumpers, coats etc.    There is
                     one enquiry outstanding to trace a suspect owner.

                     The majority of the above property is dirty and despite being
                     sealed in plastic bags is now beginning to emit a distateful
                     odour.   I would suggest that with the exception of the items where
                     owners are known or suspected, the remainder now be destroyed.

                     OTHER ITEMS

                     There are 23 pairs of spectacles in the system most of which are
                     damaged in some manner.   No owners are known

                     There are 22 watches and with the exception of two 'Sekonda’ makes
                     none are of any value.

                     There are several items of misc' property including cigarette lighters
                     combs, beer bottles and cans, earrings badges etc.   The only
                     items which could have any value are a Gold St. Christopher charm
                     and four ’Walkman* cassette players.   There are however no owners
                     known or suspected.

                                                .ssion be granted to destroy all these items




                     There is a total of £14.53p. in cash recorded as found property,
                         iect to your approval, it is intended to pay this into the
                         mce department against receipt.       ■




   GEN/2
                                    TICKETS

                                    In addition to all the ticket stubs obtained from the Sheffield
                                    Wednesday Football Club there are a further 474 tickets in the

                                    and 51 where the owners are not know or photocopies only were

                                    exist for many which were taken from witnesses although this

Dear Sir,

I am writing to you requesting the return of the ticket stub I submitted as evidence to your
force as part of the Hillsborough enquiry.
Please find herewith a copy of the receipt given to me by |_________________ on 12/5/89.
Please note the date on the receipt is incorrect. The ticket stub which I require relates to the
Liverpool v Arsenal F.A. Cup semi final on the date 12.04.80 (not 12.04.89 as noted on the
receipt).
I would be most grateful if you could assist me in this matter.

Yours faithfully

Dear

Thank you for your letter of 22 February 1998. I have been on leave for a while and have
only returned to work today.

You say that the bereaved families want someone to accept responsibility. Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith’s report quotes six occasions when the previous and present Chief Constable
have accepted responsibility. There have been others. Please see pages 92 and 93 of the
report.

Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield did not “opt out”. Independent medical advice told
the Chief Constable that Mr Duckenfield was unfit to face a disciplinary hearing and there
was no likelihood of a return to health while he continued to face that prospect.

Please read Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report or the articles I have written in the Police
Review (article 1, 27 February 1998; article 2, 6 March 1998; article 3, 13 March 1998) for
a fuller picture of what happened on the day of the disaster and subsequently.

Your sincerely

HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY


Note of a meeting on 25 November 1997.


Present -       Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
                Mr Wells, Chief Officer o f South Yorkshire police
                Mr Bone


Mr Wells visited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith at LJS-S’s request.




2.      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith recapped the process by which officers involved in
the disaster were asked to provide full recollections o f it, and these were then sent on,
after ‘vetting’ to the West Midlands police who were collecting evidence for the
Taylor Inquiry. The ‘vetting’ consisted o f removal of expressions o f opinion and
intemperate language. Mostly this was quite proper but there was a tendency to
remove opinion and intemperate language about senior police officers but leave in
similar material about misbehaviour by Liverpool fans.

3.      This plainly did not affect Lord Taylor, because he made serious criticisms of
senior officers. But it was of concern that there seemed to be a pattern of changing
this material in this way. LJS-S noted that Sheffield Wednesday FC also took
statements from their people and could cut out what they wanted so long as the
authors were prepared to sign them.




4.     LJS-S had good cooperation from the South Yorkshire police. He wasn’t
aware of any indication that the police were dragging their feet over requests for
information from him or from the Hillsborough families.

5.       RW said the force were committed to openness. There was an element in the
Family Support Group which seemed to be trying to make them stumble and appear
as if they were holding up release of information - for instance a recent request for
sheaves of ‘body files’ had a slight feeling o f red herrings being drawn across the trail.
But the force would still respond as quickly as it could.

6.    LJS-S said it would help him to be able to show that the police had acted
promptly on requests from the families - the Support Group might well say he had cut
his scrutiny short before they had been able to assemble their material. RW would
let LJS-S have a schedule of what the force had supplied the families with and when.




7.      LJS-S said that one person he had met had said that RW had told them that Mr
Duckenfield would be prosecuted, and that it was announced very soon afterwards
that he wouldn’t be.

8.     RW was sure he had not guaranteed that anybody would be prosecuted. That
was not in his gift. He might have said that one or two officers might face discipline
- and two did, though in the event neither went before a tribunal.




9.      LJS-S had had no clear answer as to whether South Yorkshire Police had
admitted liability or simply accepted it - albeit that this was, in legal terms, a
distinction without a difference. RW recalled that he was continually going on public
platforms to express the force’s regret. An example was of his TV interview on the
day of the inquest verdicts. He gave LJS-S a videotape o f this.

10.    RW acknowledged that South Yorkshire police had made four main errors at
Hillsborough. These were

              not breaking out of the assumption that there had to be a 3 o’clock
              kick-off

               not foreseeing where the fans would go after Mr Marshall had (rightly)
               had Gate C opened (this was the critical error)

               not noticing or taking full account o f the building   of pressure
               in the pens behind the goal

               not being able to distinguish between distress and disorder.

11.     LJS-S noted that these were the things which Lord Taylor had criticised. The
police disputed why they had lost control of the crowd outside the Leppings Lane
gates.

12.     RW recalled that Lord Taylor had drawn a distinction between junior and
senior police and between those senior police who realised what was going on and did
something about it and those who did not. His aims in dealing with the issue over the
years had been to be as open as possible, to express sorrow, both personal and
professional, over what had gone wrong and to make sure that the force stayed
capable o f doing what it should be doing.
13.     But he could not and would not say that South Yorkshire police were the only
cause o f the disaster. He had to talk about shared responsibility as between the police,
the club and the licensing authority. He asked whether he should write to all the
affected families, or go to Merseyside to meet them. But LJS-S could not advise on
that.

14.     LJS-S thought that the police had been unwise to try to persuade Lord Taylor
that they had not made any mistakes and the disaster was all the fault o f the fans. Mr
Duckenfield’s lie about the forcing of the gate had sown dragon’s teeth. His report
to the Home Secretary would say something about the force having gone on record as
apologising for what had happened. He would show this part of it to RW before the
report was submitted to the Home Secretary.

Dear

Thank you for your letter of 4 March 1998. We are all moved by the tragedy that 96 people
died when they should have been enjoying a game of football. I cannot comment on all the
points you make but you may find it interesting to read a series of articles I have written for
the Police Review (27 February, 6 March and 13 March 1998). Most libraries keep copies
of the magazine.

With best wishes.

  Hillsborough Scrutiny - Subsequent Actions

  Over the weekend I have given this m atter further thought, I have received your fax, and
  thank you for the kind sentiments you have expressed. W hat I set out below does have an
  effect on the contents o f your letter. It m ay be that by the time you receive this letter I will
  have already spoken to you over the telephone.

  We have various problems over accepting instructions from David Duckenfield and, as will
  have been apparent from our meeting on Friday, we have also discerned problems over
  continuing to act for South Yorkshire Police.

  In the first place David Duckenfield quite rightly questioned our credentials as lawyers
  acting for him and for him alone. In other words protecting his interest as a discrete issue
  compared to protecting the interests o f South Yorkshire Police either at the time o f the
  incident or after it.

  You quite rightly explored the various scenarios which were possible although I think
  everybody must accept that it is almost impossible to foretell the future or to anticipate the
  way in which a private prosecution might develop once an information has been made.

  M y concerns really are on the following lines:-

  (a)              The professional situation that this firm would be in if there was something we
                   wanted to use in David Duckenfield’s defence which we had only leam t about when
                   acting for South Yorkshire Police. The professional conduct rules relating to
                   solicitors provide that any information acquired by a solicitor whilst acting for a
                   former client is confidential and cannot be disclosed to a new client w ithout the
                   former client’s consent. However, a solicitor is under a duty to the present client to
                   inform the client o f all matters material to the retainer. Consequently, a solicitor in
                   possession o f confidential information (which under this rule amounts to any
                   information) concerning a former client which is or might be relevant is put in an
                   impossible position and cannot act against that client. The rules go on to say that
                   express consent by a client to disclose o f information relating to his or her affairs
                   overrides any duty o f confidentiality.

The firm is a mem ber of E u r f a e a U   an international network of lawyers. *Noii-soiiritor. The firm is regulated by The Law Society in the conduct of investment business.
As a result o f having acted for South Yorkshire Police we will be in possession o f
information which we may wish to use in the defence o f David Duckenfield and in
order to do so we need the consent o f South Yorkshire Police. In all the likelihood
the giving o f this consent will not prejudice the position o f South Yorkshire Police
as there is very unlikely to be a divergence o f interest. If your consent is given,
however, and this consent is required to enable us to act for David Duckenfield as
referred to above, there might be a situation in which there is a divergence o f
interest and you should be aware that in giving your consent for us to act for David
Duckenfield and to use information we have come by as a result o f acting for South
Yorkshire Police we would also be entitled to use information which might be
detrimental to your interests. At the moment it is difficult to think o f examples,
particularly since you are so keen to make sure that David Duckenfield is well
represented in any proceedings which may be brought. However should the situation
arise we would need to be free to act wholly in Mr Duckenfield’s best interests and
you need to be aware o f this possibility and confirm your consent to our using any
confidential information as necessary.

Following on from the above, SYP as the funding authority for the reasonable legal
costs o f David Duckenfield in defending a personal prosecution against him might
find themselves acting at odds with their other financial and accountable
responsibilities. In other words SYP might get to the point that they should not be
funding David Duckenfield.

One way o f getting round that would be to have a contract o f indemnity between the
authority and David Duckenfield which would survive any changes in mood or
understanding once the proceedings were well advanced. Then the question might
arise as to why the police authority had entered into such a contract and bound itself
in respect o f future conduct in a way which was not in the authority’s interest and
which might not be within its power.

There is a Home Office Circular on this subject. It takes into account the fact that
s.88(4) o f the Police Act 1996 (re-enacting s.48(l) o f the 1964 Act) does not apply
to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless the Circular goes on to highlight s. 111(1) o f
the Local Government Act 1972 which does apply to police authorities and gives
them a discretion to fund anything ..."which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive
or incidental to, the discharge o f any o f their functions". This only underlines the
fact that there is a discretionary power to fund the defence o f a retired police officer
but not if the interests o f the defence o f that police officer begin to diverge from the
current interests o f the police force/authority.

The question o f potential reimbursement from central funds, in the event o f an
unsuccessful prosecution also needs to be borne in mind. You w ill recall the
reference to this in our detailed advice forwarded last week. Assuming this firm is
instructed by David Duckenfield any entitlement to a defendant’s cost order would
be his on the basis that he has "incurred" costs, notwithstanding the fact that they
may be paid by the authority. Such entitlement would be jeopardised if there was
                                             -3-

       any agreement, express or implied, binding ourselves not to seek to recover costs
       from David Duckenfield in any circumstances. It is therefore crucial to this
       entitlement that no such agreement is entered into, although it is perfectly acceptable
       for the authority to indemnify David Duckenfield’s costs for the accounts to be
       forwarded to you for settlement.


I think all these elements need to be thought about carefully and I would like the
opportunity o f a further discussion with you. Simon has spoken to David Duckenfield who
appreciates that there are several formalities arising out o f Friday’s meeting and understands
they are to be dealt with before entering any formal agreement. I look forward to hearing
from you to clarify these points at the earliest opportunity.

Yours sincerely

Dear Nick

Hillsborough Scrutiny - Subsequent Actions

Thank you for your letter of 17 March 1998. Before responding to your specific points, I will
try to provide some background information.

The Chief Constable retained your firm to provide him with legal advice in connection with
the conduct of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny. As it happened, we needed your help
on only a handful of occasions but it was tremendously useful to know that you were
familiar with the issues. The advice you gave was timely, succinct and useful. You did
receive some information that is not in the public domain but I can think of none that I
regard as critically confidential. You have some material of ours and arrangements are in
hand for it to be collected shortly.

The Chief Constable has released vast amounts of material to interested parties and has
seldom declined requests for access to Hillsborough Disaster material.

The Home Secretary has accepted the recommendations of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
Scrutiny. The reaction of a few people has been to talk of commencing a private
prosecution against Mr Duckenfield for manslaughter. At my request, the South Yorkshire
Police Authority passed a resolution agreeing to fund legal representation for retired and
serving officers who may face the threat of a private prosecution arising out of the
Hillsborough Disaster. The members of the Authority can only agree to provide funds for
individuals who apply. They delegated that approval power to their Clerk in consultation
with the Chief Constable and Chairman of the Authority. In other words, the Authority
approved the principle, individual cases are left to the Clerk.

Mr Duckenfield applied as did Sergeant Trevor Bichard. I supported their applications. I
showed that they acted in good faith and that a refusal to fund their legal representation
would be damaging to the morale of the Force. “Good faith” and “morale” are two tests that
are required by the Home Office Circular. The Clerk approved their applications.
I cannot see any situations where the interests of the Chief Constable would come into
conflict with those of Mr Duckenfield, nor do I think that you have come by information that
could create a conflict of interests. For those reasons, I am happy to consent to you using
information acquired from the Chief Constable in your advice to Mr Duckenfield.

In respect of your question about the continuation of funding, I attach a copy of the letter
from the Clerk of the Authority to Mr Duckenfield. There is no limitation placed upon the
quantum, the time span or divergence of interests.

I think I have dealt with the issues you raise but please contact me again if I have missed
something.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

Re:     West Midlands Police Report

       Constable Illingworth’s Statement


I refer to your letter of 5 March 1998 on the above subject.

You ask for a copy of the West Midlands Police report to the Director of Public
Prosecutions. As you know, Constable Greenway manages the archive of Hillsborough
Disaster related material. He is on leave until 16 March 1998. When he returns from
leave, I will ask him to retrieve the report from the archive and let me see it. I may need to
discuss with our solicitors whether any issues of confidentiality arise. I will deal with your
request promptly but there may be some time before I can reply.

In paragraph 3 of your letter you refer to statements by Constable Best, Huckstepp and
Illingworth. I am not sure that I agree with your interpretation of the letter dated 7 June
1989 from David Brummell to Mervyn Jones. However, you ask for copies of Constable
Illingworth’s recollections and his statement. Again, I will discuss this with Constable
Green way when he returns.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

Re:     West Midlands Police Report

       Constable Illingworth’s Statement

I refer to your letter of 5 March 1998 and to my interim reply of 10 March.

The West Midlands Police report to the Director of Public Prosecutions fills seven boxes, it
is 22 volumes of text. Before deciding whether to release it, I will need legal advice on
whether all or parts of it should remain confidential. For such a large report, a lawyer will
require a large fee to read the report and advise me. If I decide to release all or part of the
report, the process of copying and posting would take up staff time and incur costs. I must
consider these factors amongst many others.

It will help me if you can tell me why you want the report. Your answer may mean that only
some of the 22 volumes are of interest to you. Have you written to the Director of Public
Prosecutions to ask her for the report?

Constable Illingworth gave evidence to Lord Justice Taylor and to the inquest. Transcripts
are available to you. Please tell me why you wish to see his statement. This will help me
to consider whether I should reverse my previous decision.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

Re:     West Midlands Police Report

       Constable Illingworth’s Statement

I refer to your letter of 5 March 1998 and to my interim reply of 10 March.

The West Midlands Police report to the Director of Public Prosecutions fills seven boxes, it
is 22 volumes of text. Before deciding whether to release it, I will need legal advice on
whether all or parts of it should remain confidential. For such a large report, a lawyer will
require a large fee to read the report and advise me. If I decide to release all or part of the
report, the process of copying and posting would take up staff time and incur costs. I must
consider these factors amongst many others.

It will help me if you can tell me why you want the report. Your answer may mean that only
some of the 22 volumes are of interest to you. Have you written to the Director of Public
Prosecutions to ask her for the report?

Constable Illingworth gave evidence to Lord Justice Taylor and to the inquest. Transcripts
are available to you. Please tell me why you wish to see his statement. This will help me
to consider whether I should reverse my previous decision.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines

Dear Ms Adlington

Re:      West Midlands Police Report

         Constable Illingworth’s Statement


I refer to your letter of 5 March 1998 on the above subject.
You ask for a copy of the West Midlands Police report to the Director of Public
Prosecutions. As you know, Constable Greenway manages the archive of Hillsborough
Disaster related material. He is on leave until 16 March 1998. When he returns from
leave, I will ask him to retrieve the report from the archive and let me see it. I may need to
discuss with our solicitors whether any issues of confidentiality arise. I will deal with your
request promptly but there may be some time before I can reply.
In paragraph 3 of your letter you refer to statements by Constable Best, Huckstepp and
Illingworth. I am not sure that I agree with your interpretation of the letter dated 7 June
1989 from David Brummell to Mervyn Jones. However, you ask for copies of Constable
Illingworth’s recollections and his statement. Again, I will discuss this with Constable
Greenway when he returns.

Yours sincerely

        Snig Hill
        Sheffield S3 8LY

        Dear Mr Wells

        I am taking the unusual step of contacting you directly as I understand from PC Greenway
        (Complaints and Discipline Department) that requests for Hillsborough documentation cannot
        be dealt with until he returns from holiday on March 16th.

        My purpose in writing is to seek a copy of the West Midlands Police report of their      ! t: ':r '! •       51: ;
        investigation to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I understand that access to this document
        is at your discretion (Chapter 5, paragraph 30 page 90 Scrutiny Report).

        Finally, I am concerned to note from the letter appended at page 213 of the Report that copy
        statements of PCs Best, Huckstepp and Illingworth were supplied to the press during the
        Taylor Inquiry. In particular, I have been trying to obtain a copy of PC Illingworth’s
        statements for quite some time before finally being informed on 12 November 1997 that South
        Yorkshire Police were unable to seek his authority to release his statements!_______________ .                     .


         Given that the final revised version of PC Illingworth’s statement was placed in the public
         domain in 1989 I trust you will feel able to supply me with a copy o f the same together with
         his initial version.

         Yours sincerely

Dear

Thank you for your letter of 22 February 1998. I have been on leave for a while and have
only returned to work today.
You say that the bereaved families want someone to accept responsibility. Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith’s report quotes six occasions when the previous and present Chief Constable
have accepted responsibility. There have been others. Please see pages 92 and 93 of the
report.
Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield did not “opt out”. Independent medical advice told
the Chief Constable that Mr Duckenfield was unfit to face a disciplinary hearing and there
was no likelihood of a return to health while he continued to face that prospect.
Please read Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report or the articles I have written in the Police
Review (article 1, 27 February 1998; article 2, 6 March 1998; article 3, 13 March 1998) for
a fuller picture of what happened on the day of the disaster and subsequently.
Your sincerely

Dear Mr Daines

RE:         HILLSBROUGH

In view of the threat of the Hillsborough Family Support Group to bring private
prosecutions against Officers I made enquiries of Zurich Municipal to ascertain whether
the defence costs would fall to be met under Municipal Mutual’s policy in this event.

Enclosed is a copy of their reply which is no more than I expected. However, the
possibility of Municipal Mutual providing financial assistance has been investigated albeit
without success should this be raised in the future.

Yours faithfully

Dear Sirs

H ills b o r o u g h

We refer to our recent conversation with Mr Alderman, when the question was
raised as to w h e th e r or not MVIl's policy would provide an indemnity in
relation to defence costs in the event of private prosecutions a g a in s t any
of the Police Officers present at Hillsborough by the bereaved families.

I have forwarded the enquiry to WII and have now had a response from their
Claims Director via our Head Office to the effect that a s the limit of
indemnity under the policy has already been exceeded they are not able to
meet any further defence costs.

Yours     f a i t h f u l l y _______________________________________

                                        are shown bold, In brackets at margins.


The events on the day centred around the FA Cup Semi-Final

between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.



The Liverpool supporters were situated at the Leppings Lane end of

the ground. The reasoning behind the decision to place them there

was based on geographical considerations. The Leppings Lane end

is at the north western corner of the stadium.



In the days of violent confrontation between rival sets of supporters,

geography was a common consideration in attempting to keep them

apart.



Shortly before the 3.00 pm kick off “pens” 3 and 4, situated directly

behind the Leppings Lane goal, began to fill up. At the same time a

large crowd gathered in Leppings Lane near to Gate ‘C’. Owing to the

large number of people pressing against the gate, the order was

given to open the gate, allowing some 2,000 supporters into the

ground.   Almost all of those allowed to enter by Gate C’ were

attracted to the central tunnel giving access to “pens” 3 and 4. This

sudden influx of supporters added to the large numbers already in

place on the terrace and a fatal crush ensued. Ninety-five people lost

their lives on the day. Another died in 1993.




                                           1
INQUIRIES



Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry



Lord Justice Taylor was assisted by the West Midlands Police. The               [Chapter 1 -
                                                                           paragraph 34-52]
Inquiry began on 15 May 1989 and was completed on 29 June the

same year. It was held in public. The Inquiry considered:-



* 3,776 statements

* 1,550 letters

* 71 hours of video

* 174 witnesses



On 4 August 1989 Lord Justice Taylor published his report.          The

report clearly apportioned blame for the disaster stating that the

principal cause was police failure to cut off access to the central
l!»
 pens .
      _




On that day, and in the light of the findings, the then Chief Constable,

Peter Wright:



* offered his resignation to the Police Authority

* suspended Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield from duty and




                                           2
• made a public statement, accepting the Taylor findings in respect

  of the police participation and expressing his profound sorrow at

  the deaths.



The Coroner’s Inquest



The Coroner’s Inquest opened and adjourned between 19 and 20                    [Chapter 1 -
                                                                           paragraph 60-66]
April 1989. The 'mini-inquests’ to identify the deceased took place
                                                                                [Chapter 3 -
between 18 April and 4 May 1990. The main inquests took place               paragraph 3-54]

between 19 November 1990 and 28 March 1991.



A total of 230 witnesses gave evidence. The Coroner’s jury could

reach one of two verdicts: ‘unlawful killing’ or ‘accidental death’. The

members chose a verdict of accidental death.         It is important to

recognise the implications of such a verdict. The Coroner stressed

that it did not necessarily mean that no-one was blameworthy.

Indeed, South Yorkshire Police has accepted its part in the disaster

and has apologised on many occasions.



Criminal Offences



Consideration was given to the question of whether any of the                   [Chapter 1 -
                                                                           paragraph 52-57]
officers in charge should face criminal charges.       West Midlands

Police were asked to undertake an investigation into possible criminal




                                           3
offences leading to the deaths.      Possibilities were manslaughter a

culpable misfeasance in public office.       On 31 March 1990 West

Midlands Police submitted a report to the Director of Public

Prosecutions (DPP) outlining their findings. On 30 August 1990 the

DPP directed that there should be no criminal proceedings.



Police Complaints Authority



West Midlands Police also investigated associated disciplinary                   [Chapter 1 -
                                                                            paragraph 58-59]
matters. The investigation was completed on 19 August 1990. On 7

May 1991 the independent Police Complaints Authority (PCA)

directed disciplinary charges of neglect of duty against two officers,

Chief   Superintendent      David    Duckenfield    and    his    deputy,

Superintendent Bernard Murray.



David Duckenfield was suspended from duty. He was also diagnosed

as suffering from stress, no doubt caused by the events of 15 April

1989, the public censure of Lord Justice Taylor, the intense media

pressure surrounding his being held to account and the mounting

disciplinary investigation into his handling of the policing operation.




As long as Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was suspended he

received full pay but was not able to contribute to policing. In view of

the significance of the disaster, the Chief Constable wished the




                                            4
discipline process to be worked through but, on hearing independent

medical advice that Duckenfield was too ill to be amenable to the

disciplinary process, let alone face the necessary tribunal, he

consented to    allow David Duckenfield to retire on 10 November

1991.



On 13 January 1992 the PCA allowed the disciplinary action against

Superintendent Murray to be terminated because they held that it

would have been unjust to pursue a joint charge against him alone, in

the absence of the more senior officer. Like the DPP’s decision not

to prosecute, the disciplinary procedure ended with no-one convicted

or cleared. It was another bitter blow for some of the Hillsborough

families.



Lord Justice Stuart-Smith expresses sympathy with the families in

their viewing the disciplinary process as unfair and unsatisfactory.

He underlines that it is as the law stands and suggests that it is now a

matter for Parliament. The present Chief Constable, Richard Wells,

is the lead member nationally for the Association of Chief Police

Officers, pushing for similar reform.

Judicial Review



On 6 April 1993 relatives of six of the deceased sought judicial            [Chapter 1 -
                                                                       paragraph 67-70]
reviews of the inquest verdicts. On 5 November 1993 the Divisional

Court upheld the Coroner’s proceedings and the jury’s verdict.



Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny



In December 1996 Granada Television broadcast the 'drama

documentary’ Hillsborough,     written   by Jimmy McGovern       and

produced by Ian McBride



The Hillsborough Family Support Group, friends and relatives of the

deceased and their families felt strongly that a number of issues

needed to be addressed. They voiced, in and around the broadcast,

concerns which revolved around the following issues. They claimed

that:-



• New video evidence had been discovered.

• There had been a suppression of evidence.

• Previous decisions had been faulty (save Taylor’s, with which they

   agreed).

• West Midlands Police had been biased in favour of South

  Yorkshire Police in their investigations and findings.



                                           6
• No apology had ever been forthcoming from South Yorkshire

  Police.



In June 1997 the Home Secretary announced a Scrutiny which was to

be headed by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of

Appeal. The remit of the Scrutiny was this:-



• To determine whether new evidence exists.

• If any new evidence does exist then what is its relevance?



Scrutiny Report Findings



Having considered all the evidence, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith made

a number of clear and unequivocal statements about the concerns

that had been raised.



ALLEGED SUPPRESSION OF EVIDENCE



The report considered whether any of the suggested ‘new’ evidence

had been deliberately suppressed and therefore not considered by

Lord Justice Taylor in his Inquiry.



It had been suggested that the evidence of Dr Ed Walker and Mr

Roger Houldsworth had been fraudulently concealed.




                                          7
Dr Walker had travelled from his home in Rotherham to the Northern                [Chapter 3 -
                                                                                paragraph 71]
General Hospital on the day of the disaster in order to assist in the
                                                                                  [Chapter 1 -
treatment of casualties.    He had claimed that he had never been               paragraph 17]

interviewed by officers and had not given evidence at the Inquest. In

fact, Dr Walker made a record of his actions in the form of an aide-

memoire immediately after his involvement.           He also made a

statement to West Midlands Police officers.



A principle concern for the families is a belief that police officers lied

about the effectiveness of Camera 5 in order to escape their

responsibility for noticing the critical build up of crowds in “pens” 3

and 4.



Roger Houldsworth was the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club                       [Chapter 2 -
                                                                             paragraph 25-31]
video technician. His evidence relates to the use of CCTV cameras

and the images displayed on screens within the control room.          PC

Trevor Bichard who had been on duty in the police control room had

claimed that one of the cameras - Camera No 5 - had not been

working properly at the critical time. Mr Houldsworth said that this

was untrue and that he had repaired the camera that same day. He

had been present in the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club room at

the crucial time around 2.50 pm. He claimed that he realised from

looking at CCTV pictures of “pens” 3 and 4, at about the time Gate C




                                            8
was opened, that the pens were dangerously overcrowded.            It is

claimed that this was new evidence concealed from the Inquiry. Lord

Justice Stuart-Smith rejects such a claim saying:-



“The suggestion that the police tried to blame their failure to spot

overcrowding onto faulty CCTV equipment is wrong”.




“In m y opinion, even if PC Bichard did to some extent exaggerate any
                                                                             [Chapter 2 -
defect in what camera 5 was showing, it is o f no consequence”.            paragraph 89]



Lord Justice Stuart-Smith said:



"There was abundant evidence at Lord Taylor’s Enquiry that the

police in the control box had a good view out o f the windows.      PC

Ryan said he very rarely looked at the TV monitors because they

were over his head. Superintendent Murray never suggested that he

was reliant on the TV cameras. He had an excellent view out o f the

window.”




“So fa r as M r Duckenfield is concerned, he never said anything about

a   faulty Camera 5, still less that that was the reason he failed to

appreciate the overcrowding.      Although he pointed out that he was

standing behind the officers seated at the front o f the control box and

did not have quite such a good view through the windows, he never




                                           9
suggested he could not see the terraces sufficiently to form a

judgem ent.”




He also said:-



7n m y opinion, the importance o f M r Houldsworth’s evidence has            [Chapter 2 -
                                                                           paragraph 97]
been exaggerated out o f all proportion.   M r Houldsworth’s existence

and his evidence were known both to the Taylor Enquiry and the

Coroner. ”




The suggestion that police hid important video evidence is also

rejected by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.     PC Trevor Bichard secured

the tapes from the police video machines which had recorded the

relevant CCTV footage.         These tapes were handed to all

investigatory agencies and copies were even supplied by the police

service to Yorkshire Television.



Two video tapes did go missing but these were not from police                  [Chapter 2
                                                                         paragraph 76-77]
recordings but from those of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

They were not the product of cameras facing on to the terraces and

so would not, in any event, have been relevant. Of the allegation that

the police concealed or suppressed video evidence Lord Justice

Stuart-Smith says:




                                           10
“It seems to me a bizarre way to conceal o r suppress evidence to

make it available to a television company.                In m y opinion the

allegation    that police   hid   video      tape    evidence   is   completely

unfounded.     There was no suppression o r disappearance o f footage

from the vital tapes. It is entirely understandable that the compilation

tape contains no footage from camera 5. It would be surprising if it

did, since footage from camera 5 was not helpful o r relevant in

illustrating the causes o f the disaster”.




Lord   Justice    Stuart-Smith    also       considered    whether     criminal      [Chapter 2 -
                                                                                   paragraph 93]
proceedings (ostensibly for perjury) should be taken against PC

Bichard, PC Ryan or PS Goddard (on duty in the control room). He

makes it clear that there is nothing in any of the submissions for any

further inquiry or consideration by the prosecuting or disciplinary

authorities or further application to the Divisional Court.



There is implied, on behalf of some of the deceaseds’ families, that

there was an attempt by police officers to cover up the possibility of

some survival after the 3.15 pm cut-off point. The ‘cover-up’ was

alleged to have been effected by enforced changes to witnesses’

statements.



It had been submitted that West Midlands Police had improperly                        [Chapter 4 -
                                                                                  paragraph 4-72]
attempted to affect the evidence of Mr Bruder, Miss Martin and Mr




                                                11
Taylor. It is alleged that West Midlands Police put pressure on the

three named witnesses to change their evidence in various ways.

Essentially, this related to what has come to be described as the

Coroner’s “3.15 pm cut off point”. It is claimed that the three named

witnesses were in a position to give evidence that contradicted the

conclusion that all the deceased were dead by 3.15 pm. This is to

misunderstand the purpose of the “3.15 pm cut off point”.         The

Coroner does not claim, in establishing the crucial time, that no one

died after 3.15 pm. Indeed, the 96th victim, Tony Bland, did not die

until 1993.    However, the Coroner established that all the fatal

injuries to the deceased were sustained in a period of some 4-6

minutes prior to 3.15 pm.



Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considered the evidence given by the three

named witnesses and indeed interviewed each of them.            He is

satisfied that there was no improper attempt to affect their evidence.

Mr Bruder himself says that the West Midlands Police did not attempt

to coerce him into altering his evidence. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith

concludes, as does Mr Bruder himself, that he (Bruder) is not the sort

of person to be coerced in this way.



In respect of Miss Martin and Mr Taylor, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith            [Chapter 4 -
                                                                         paragraph 43 and
says that he did not find them to be reliable witnesses.                               70]




                                          12
It is also submitted that South Yorkshire Police were guilty of               [Chapter 4 -
                                                                             paragraph 73
misconduct in that officers’ statements had been altered in bad faith.           and 107]

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith finds that this is not the case. It is true that

some statements were altered on solicitors’ advice.        However, the

original statements and the amended versions were retained in South

Yorkshire Police archives and were made available to the Scrutiny at

the unprompted instigation of Richard Wells, the present Chief

Constable. The original statements were made by officers in terms of

personal    recollections which were        not appropriate     to   court

proceedings.    They contained materials which reflected officers’

feelings at the time but were not necessarily evidentially relevant.



Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is critical of some of the changes, believing

that the judgement involved was not always sound. He believes it

would have been more appropriate for all the statements to have

been made available to Lord Justice Taylor. Nevertheless he rejects

the idea that the changes would materially have altered the Taylor

findings.



Lord Justice Stuart-Smith says there is:-



“No question o f misconduct regarding alterations to self-written              [Chapter 7 -
                                                                             paragraph 24]
officers’ statements”.




                                            13
The Chief Constable has made the statements available, through the

Home Secretary, to the House of Commons library in conjunction with

the Scrutiny Report.



A claim was made that evidence was further suppressed in that                 [Chapter 5 -
                                                                         paragraph 26-34]
bereaved families had been denied access to South Yorkshire Police

archive material.    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith said that there was no

substance to this complaint.        Indeed,    it can be seen from the

extensive list of materials (see Annexe 1) provided that South

Yorkshire Police have striven to co-operate as fully as possible with

the bereaved families.



PREVIOUS DECISIONS



Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considered the submission that a number of

decisions taken by the earlier investigative and judicial bodies were

faulty and that a new inquiry was necessary to address the

implications of these decisions. He makes it clear that there is no

basis for a further judicial enquiry.



He considered the role of the Coroner and whether it could be said            [Chapter 5 -
                                                                            paragraph 22]
that the Coroner had shown bias. He is satisfied that the Coroner

was not biased and that there is no basis to re-open the inquest.




                                              14
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has considered whether there is any new

material which should be put before the DPP or PCA. He is satisfied

that there is no such evidence.



He is also satisfied that there is no evidence of want of care by the

emergency or hospital services.



He says that there is “no justification” for an inquiry into the

emergency or hospital services. He says that:-



“None o f the evidence I was asked to consider added anything

significant to the evidence which was available to Lord Justice

Taylor’s Enquiry or the Inquest”.




SUGGESTION OF BIAS IN WEST MIDLANDS POLICE



It had been submitted that West Midlands Police had been biased in           [Chapter 5 -
                                                                        paragraph 43-44]
favour of South Yorkshire Police.



Lord Justice Stuart-Smith dismissed this allegation in unequivocal

terms.   He deals comprehensively with the allegations made that

West Midlands Police officers attempted to coerce witnesses.      He

says:-




                                        15
“Even if there were signs, which in m y view there are not, that

individual officers exerted undue pressure in those cases, it does not

support the contention that the West Midlands Police as a whole

favoured the South Yorkshire Police. ”




Lord Justice Stuart-Smith said:



“The West Midlands Police took a very large number of statements

from Liverpool supporters. More than 50 were called at the Taylor

Inquiry and over 100 gave evidence at the Inquest (only eight of

whom had done so before at the Inquiry). Lord Justice Stuart-Smith

quoted Lord Taylor, and said:



      “I pay tribute particularly to the West Midlands Police fo r their

      speed and dedication in gathering the evidence and to all

      those responsible for processing it.     The most eloquent tribute

      to fairness and thoroughness o f the police investigation came

      from the Secretary o f the Football Supporters’ Association. He

      said there had been initial anxiety at Liverpool as to whether

      that investigation would be fair and objective.    His Association

      therefore   collected   200   witness    statements   themselves.

      Having heard the opening statement by Counsel to the Inquiry,

      based upon the evidence gathered by the police, he found that




                                          16
       it accorded entirely with his Association’s evidence and the

       initial anxiety was wholly dispelled” (Interim Report, para 16).




He asserts quite clearly that any other such allegations were wholly

unsubstantiated.



ALLEGATIONS THAT NO APOLOGY HAS BEEN MADE BY

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE



One of the key concerns voiced by the Hillsborough Family Support                [Chapter 5 -
                                                                            paragraph 45-54]
Group was that the bereaved had at no time received any form of

apology from South Yorkshire Police.



The Scrutiny makes it clear that this is not the case.      In his report

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith cites many examples of how South

Yorkshire Police, through its former Chief Constable, Peter Wright,

and the current Chief Constable, Richard Wells, has apologised for

the force’s contribution to the disaster.



In his Report, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith quotes the following

examples:-



“In a television interview on the same day (the day of the Inquest

verdicts being made known) there was the following exchange:




                                            17
       Trevor    Hicks   “I   was   gladdened     when     I   heard   his

      announcement earlier where for the first time publicly I have

      heard the Chief Constable publicly apologise and expressing

      regret to the families ...”




“The interviewer asked Mr Wells if it was true that he had said on

behalf of the Force that they were sorry. Mr Wells said:



      7 would not have said it if it wasn’t true ... as I say, as a parent

      with all the feelings that I can muster, to M r Hicks and

      everybody else who has lost loved ones here, we are, not ju s t

      the Chief Constable but all o f the officers involved are terribly

      sorry.    It is an inexpressible grief to have to bear and I know

      words don’t count for much but they are sincerely meant. ”




“At my meeting with him Mr Wells made it plain that since Lord

Taylor’s Interim Report he had acknowledged on behalf of the Force

that there had been four main errors:



i)    failing to delay the kick-off in the light of the large crowds at

      Leppings Lane;




                                           18
ii)    not noticing or taking full account of the fact that the central

       pens were full by 2.50 pm;



iii)   not foreseeing where the supporters would go once Gate C

       was opened and not blocking off the tunnel - this was the

       critical mistake; and



iv)    not distinguishing distress from disorder and consequently not

       reacting sufficiently quickly or effectively to the situation.



I do not think it is reasonable to assert that the South Yorkshire

Police have never apologised or accepted responsibility for their

share of the blame.”

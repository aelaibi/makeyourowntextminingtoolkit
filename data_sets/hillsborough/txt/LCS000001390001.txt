Matters with specific reference to the role   the Director of Social Services.

Point’s made by Survivors were in no particular order. I have made my reply in
the order they were presented.

Point 2.
Requests for information re: Centre use and equipment at the Centre - listed

Anyone is welcome to have access to the equipment and indeed many have
done. The Audio and Video equipment is used heavily for therapeutic purposes,
because of the recorded material we have surrounding the disaster. The
Administration office keep a record for booking out purposes.

The Computer/Printer was donated to the Interlink magazine and is left with us.

Access to files.

The question of access to files and recording was raised by survivors through
the Advisory Group. There is already a Social Services departmental policy
with regard to access to files. In addition to this, however with the approval of
representatives of the Survivors Group we formed a Centre policy for record
keeping , and displayed notices in the Centre inviting users to ask for records if
they wished to see them.           A p p e N o irx

             19.6.91. A Statement was made that survivors were satisfied with policy.

    3 .2     C o n fid e n tia lity .

              The Team has never consciously breached confidentiality. We are very cautious
         " " with regard to giving out names and addresses without permission. If any
               human errors have been made we apologise but to our knowledge addresses
               have never been given out without permission. We have developed a policy on
               issues of confidentiality, explaining our role within the Social Services
          ■> --department see( Appendix 4) Confidentiality document.

    4 .1     T h e A d v is o ry G roup.

             The Advisory Group was set up as a means of consultation and sharing ideas
             with Centre users. There has also been extensive research carried out by .
             outside researchers with regard to service users and management of-disasters.

            ' We would never say we have.provided a perfect service. We have made
              mistakes and not satisfied everyone who has used the Centre. We were placed
              in a unique and unusual position in treading very new ground. We were, and
           V are .learning as we work. We^-re open to constructive criticism and new ideas,
           . and invite, people to talk to us if they have any specific concerns about our
              service. I believe however from; the feedback that we have had, that many
           , people have been satisfied with the service we have provided.

             Social Workers at the Centre are frequently invited to talk about their
           . experience in working in a disaster team. This is useful training for other
             workers in the voluntary services, Social Services, and health service.

             The Team did not set themselves up as experts, we share our experience’s with
             others. I am notaware of any team member receiving promotion purely on the
             basis of their Hillsborough related work.

    4 .2     Tim Newburn researcher from the National Institute of Social W ork to respond.

    5.       The future Team brief was presented in draft form to the Advisory Group for
             comment and additions. We have always been clear about our continued
             commitment to Hillsborough related work. (See Appendix 5) Team Brief and
             Advisory Group minutes 19.6.91.

                                                                          contd
contd

        We outlined the Centre’s future in Interlink (Appendix 6) and have extensivley
        advertised our new work (See Appendix 6) Leaflets and Posters, including co­
        operation with the media. We have also kept a permanent small advert about
        the Centre in Liverpool football clubs match programmes.

6.      To my knowledge rarely has the phone been unstaffed only on the rare
        occasion when staff have attended union meetings or during extreme staff
     .. shortage at lunch times. We staffed the Centre during a three day strike last year
        without pay.

        The Centre has four telephone lines, so there may be times when all of these
        lines are engaged.

7.    Group Meetings.

        We have always encouraged groups to meet independently. We facilitated all
        groups originally and now almost all of them are self help groups
        (independent). This is seen by our staff as part of a ‘moving on’ process away
        from the Centre, and Centre staff.

        We also have an agreement that Centre users can by key holders for self help
        groups to allow.flexibility.

8.    I n q u e s t s ’;           "       V                ;

        The Team ensured a social work service’ each day for six months of the
        inquests, this was very difficult because of the distance involved. We were
        fortunate that Sheffield Social Services were generous with their help and
        support. We also recruited help from our colleagues in the other Merseyside
        Hillsborough teams. We were not able to provide adequate transport for
        ourselves or Centre users. Social Workers did transport some, individual
        bereaved families by car.

        The Team travelled mostly on the 6.45 am train to Sheffield. Due to the
        frequency of visits to Sheffield, the weather, cost, and sheer fatigue it was
        impractical to expect staff to drive such distances. At the same time we had to
        provide a service for everyone still in Liverpool which was at times difficult to
        manage. On the final day of the inquests two workers from the Liverpool team
        were present plus other workers from Merseyside and Lancashire and
        thankfully from Sheffield. Planning again was difficult because of the uncertainty
        about when the inquest verdict could be announced.

                                                                         contd
contd


        We acquired the names and addresses of every witness who gave evidence at
        the inquest, (co-ordinated by Sheffield S.S.D.) and ensured they received a
        letter of support and information about the Centre.

        We did our best and in defence of my team I do have to say that they worked
        under considerable pressure during this period. Many nights and hours were
        spent away from our -families. We were also having to fit in our leave before
        April. Some of the team requested to carry leave over into the following year.
        We did our best to provide an adequate service for everyone.

9.      The Advisory Group.

        The Advisory Group was set up following the disaster in order to share
        information and encourage Centre users to take an interest in the day to day
        running of the Centre. It proved difficult to gather a consistent group of people.
        Last summer the chair of the group offered to talk to the various Centre users
        about the future function of the group, only one group responded to this request
        (See Appendix 7); Letter from chair of group. I have arranged a further Advisory
        Group meeting at the end of April.

     Draft - of report            to Social      Services       to be d i s t r i b u t e d as s o o n
     as possible.

     S T A FFING C E N T R E . - We are      losing      1^ of our        staff      this month.

will continue to be an important part of the teams working methods.

Beyond this the team will provide a comprehensive social work service that includes
the use of counselling, group work skills and advocacy.

In addition the team are keen to develop work which children and young people        andto
utilise skills and techniques learned from colleagues in the youth work service (see
Appendix).

e) Referrals to
              * the team.

To date the majority of referrals to the team have come from users themselves or their
family and friends. Whilst the team would iike this to continue, it would also like to
develop clearer working links with other professional agencies,because of the. size of
the team it will be essential to provide and efficient assessment procedure to
determine.

      a) If the team has the skills and capacity to work effectively with a referral or
      b ) to determine a more appropriate agency for the referral.

Because of the stated aims of the team, it is anticipated that referrals will be incident
related'e.g. sudden traumas, bereavement from-.accident, suicide#or illness^and loss
generally which for example could be the effect of the break up of a relationship-.-

All referrals wijl be considered on an individual basis. .                        .
HILLSBO RO UG H           CONFERENCE.

None of the planning group present. It was also stated by Gerry and Sarah that
professional’s commitment to the group had to be checked out, not just the users.
Attendance of the group has been poor recently.

The Hillsborough Conference would be a good way to iron out issues such as the
ones discussed today at the advisory group.

4.   YOUTH WORKING PARTY DISASTER PACK.

Will be sent to group members for comment. It is aimed at the Youth Service.

C O N F ID E N T IA L IT Y .

Issue of files and typed notes about confidential matters in Admin Office. People tend
to simply walk in to admin, when there is a lot of very private information in type-writerg,
messages„and on desks, could everyone please check with the Duty Officers, who will
act as messenger - go between, if anything is needed from Admin. This is for the
protection of information about those using the centre.

 RECORDING. ACCESS TO FILES AND ISSUES OF CONFIDENTIALITY IN THF
 CENTRE.


 It is important to point out that there is a clear Liverpool Social Services policy stating
 the correct procedures for recording in files and a set procedure for client access to
 files.

 That policy is available for the group to see if they want to.

 Written into the policy there is a stated purpose for keeping files and recording as
 follows.

 1.            The main purpose of the social work record is to ensure that

 a) the information required to provide the best possible service is accurately and
 clearly recorded and quickly retrievable.

 b) that there is a record of live contact and social work activity inorder to demonstrate
 that the department has met its statutory responsibilities.

  c) that there is a record of initial assessment, treatment plan and the results of social
  work intervention..in order that .individual w orkers can record and measure the
.       progress made in reaching agreed helping targets with individual clients.

  '   d) With a prior kn o w le d g e of clients, for the purpose, of social work training afull
 ■ record of ail w o rk-unde rtaken by students be-kept for the duration of the training period-
' and at the end of this time the information will be summarised on. to the clients file a nd
 any detailed student record destroyed.

  This Centre as part of the Social Service departm ent is required to keep records.
. Standard good practice in the department is to share record keeping with individual
  clients.

 Standard procedure in the future in this centre will be to.

 1) Inform the client on initial contact that a referral will be made out and a record of
 contact will be kept securely in the centre. This information will be stated on a leaflet
 or a letter, which will be given to the client.

 2) If the client counsellor relationship then develops an agreement can be made with
 the client as to what actually should be kept in their file, for example detailed notes can
 be kept for therapeutic purposes and destroyed.

 3) when the client counsellor relationship ceases the file can be destroyed after a
 delay period of say 6 months, (in case the client represents themselves)

    M I N U T E S OF LAST MEETING.

    F U T U R E OF TEAM.
    7th of November Team Day.     Barnie                  has put t o g e t h e r ideas from
    the day. He will present s o mething                  in writing for the group.

    AGENDA.

    1)    P U R P O S E AND R OLE OF A D V I S O R Y GROUP.
    We discussed the fact that it's                      n e c e s s a r y to revit a l i z e the
    function and role of the A d v isory                 Group.          So that we can .share
    the running and decision making of                   the centre.          We deci d e d that
    the group is important and we need                   to ensure that i't shares the
    power regarding the running of the                   Centre.

    D I S A S T E R FUND.                                                ;
    The H.F.S.G. are meeting 'the Trustees- on the 18th of December,
    to; discuss, how to dispose of there rem a i n i n g money.  The
    H.F.S.G. need to know what kind of funding  we need..

    Bill is anxious that we ‘meet again before they meet with the
    T r u s t e e s of the fund on the 18th.   So we d e c i d e d we will meet
    on; Monday the 17th at 1 1 . 0 0 a.m.     There have been d i f f i c u l t i e s
    with child care for people so 1 1.00 a.m. would fit in with
    school h o u r s .                       .             •

    The Advis o r y G r o u p will p r o b a b l y run during the day time from
    now on.    All those present agreed this was possible.                              We also
    need   to get as many of the g r o u p              r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s here as
    p ossible.     Social         work  staff     - A : rota        was       set     up until
    Christmas.      S h e f f i e l d Social    Services     are also the*re_daily
A^ti>hoped that Sheffield will take more control of the social w o r k
    side in the future.

    Barnie - c o n cerned about          the s u p p o r t e r s gi v i n g evidence.     T hey
    are unrepresented.

    Paul - voiced his sheer f r u s t r a t i o n over events.   He felt                   that
    i nquests were slanted to blame L i v e r p o o l supporters.

    G e n e r a l l y the inquests sway from w i t n e s s to witness.    Dif f i c u l t
    to judge the f e e lings of the Jury.            It is a very d i f f i c u l t a n d

1.   MATTERS         ARISING.

Access to Files Record Keeping.

Carolyn stated that the Survivors Groups were satisfied with the.policy.

2.   TRIP TO CAMELOT.

Went ahead as planned and was a successful day. Over 200 families and children
went.-        • -                v-             ••         -

3.   VOLUNTEERS.

There is concern from some of the survivors that they would be doing social workers
jobs.

Sarah and Gerry agreed that clarity was needed about exact volunteer role, if people
were to want to volunteer work; it would be phone call and reception duties for short
periods and more importantly befriending survivors of tragedies. Carolyn wondered
why Hillsborough Survivors w eren’t being filtered through to the groups. We
explained the major reason was that we have very few Hillsborough referrals now,
most of our referrals are non Hillsborough e.g. traffic accidents, bereavement - suicide.
Generally anything that is, related to a traumatic incident or loss.

4.   T IM ’S RESEARCH.

Tim has been in Nottingham to research any Hillsborough follow up in that part of the
country. He has noticed the sharp contrast between the football clubs involved.
Nottingham F.C wanted to brush the tragedy aside immediately.

HUE HjLLSB O R O U G H C E N T R E T E A M BRIEF

a) Statement of Aims

From the experience of H illsborough, the team have identified the need for
preventative work with those suffering from the after effects of atraum atic incident, The
team have by necessity developed a certain core of skills in the area of Preventative
Mental Health work, and in supporting people through the Socio - Legal process.

Whilst continuing*to be committed to Hillsborough work, the team are now able to offer
a more general service to those in Liverpool suffering as a result of a traumatic
incident of loss, (The team are keen to develop and improve services more generally
in this area of work).

We are also committed as a team to upholding the councils equal opportunities policy
and want to implement this in a positive way.

b) Team Structure.

The team will consist of a team manager, a senior practioner and six social workers.
There will be appropriate admin, and clerical support. There will also be ongoing
support from a clinical psychologist ( see Appendix)'for a further twelve months and
until at least December 1991, input from a children’s society worker.

It is anticipated that within the near future, the team will become part of a departmental
division, ensuring a greater degree of managerial support,

c) The Hillsborough Centre.

We want to continue the user friendly environment we have developed and hope that
our open door policy will continue. This has only been made possible by thorough
duty cover, The success of the open door policy in the future will hopefully i . ^ u e uaers
of the centre as volunteers and we hope that user participation will encourage and
empower individuals to work in partnership with Centre staff,

The Centre is already used independently by a wide range of workers and groups not
solely related to Hilisborough. We want to encourage this particular function of the
Centre, and the Hillsborough Centre Advisory Group,will have an important part to
play,if the idea of the staff and all the users of the Centre working together is to
succeed,

d) Intervention.

Our open door policy offers immediate short term help which has been acknowledged
to be of enormous value to those using the services. The idea of an informal drop in

 3.       Madam Speaker, a fte r th e Hillsborough disaster, a

 num ber          of    inquiries   and   investigations   to o k   place,

 looking a t aspects o f th e tragedy.             Perhaps th e most

 th o ro u g h and w ide-ranging was th e Public Inquiry led by

 Lord Taylor.             The term s of reference o f th a t inquiry

encom passed not only inquiring into th e disaster                  itself
b u t also making recom m endations about crow d control

and s a fe ty a t sports events.



4.        Lord Taylors inquiry took oral evidence fro m over

170 w itnesses a t public hearings during May and June

1989 and considered many hours o f video evidence fro m

d iffe r e n t sources. In his interim rep o rt in August 1989,

Lord Taylor found th a t             th e disaster had a num ber of

causes.         He did n o t a ttrib u te all th e blame to a single

cause o r person, b u t in paragraph 278 he m ade clear

th a t:




                                      2
       "The main reason fo r th e disaster was th e fa ilu re o f

       police control"



5.     in    th a t   in te rim    re p o rt    Lord   Taylor     m ade    43

im m ediate recom m endations. His final re p o rt in January

1990        m ade     a   fu rth e r   76      recom m endations.         The

developm ents which have taken place since th e n in

safety a t fo o tb a ll grounds and in th e policing o f fo o tb a ll

m atches         have       been       based       largely      on     those

recom m endations.            Football in this country has been

tran sfo rm ed since th e Taylor Report,               to   a large e x te n t

th a t is due to          his w ide-ranging and soundly based

conclusions.

 7.    Madam Speaker, as Hon Members w ill know, an

 inquest is a fact-fin d in g inquiry, conducted by a Coroner

 in fro n t o f a jury, and aim ed a t establishing th e answers

 to fo u r im p o rta n t questions, namely:



      The id e n tity o f th e deceased



      The place o f death



      The tim e and th e d a te o f death and



      How th e deceased came by his or her death.



8.    The   Coroner's     rules       require   proceedings   and

evidence to be directed solely a t finding answers to

th o se questions.



9.    The ju ry a t th e Coroners inquest, a fte r exam ining

th e evidence, found in March 1 9 9 1 th a t th e cause o f




                                  4

 10.    A fu rth e r investigation was conducted by th e w e s t

 M idlands Police, supervised by th e Police Complaints

A u th o rity , to establish w h eth er th e re w ere any grounds

fo r crim inal proceedings, and to consider w h e th e r any

police        o ffic e r   should   be   subject      to   disciplinary

proceedings.



11.    T hat investigation involved th e taking o f over S000

sta te m e n ts and th e scrutiny o f all th e m aterial which

had previously been exam ined by th e Taylor inquiry.

A fte r th a t investigation th e evidence was sent to th e

D irector o f Public Prosecutions, w ho concluded th a t no

person should be subject to crim inal proceedings.




                                    5
 12.   The Police com plaints A u tho rity decided th a t th e

 c h ie f su p erin ten d en t and superintendent in charge on

 th e day should face disciplinary charges fo r n eg lect o f

 d u ty , in th e event, th e ch ief superintendent re tire d due

to ill health in advance o f a ruling by a disciplinary

trib u n a l under th e police discipline rules. A disciplinary

hearin g cannot proceed w hen a police o ffic e r re tire s

b e fo re th e hearing takes place.        The Police com plaints

A u th o rity la te r decided th a t disciplinary proceedings

ag ain st   th e   su p erin ten d en t   should   be   w ith d ra w n

because th e re tire m e n t o f th e chief su p erin ten d en t

m e a n t th a t w h at, in e ffe c t, was a jo in t allegation o f

n eg lec t o f d u ty could n o t be fairly heard in th e absence

13.    Madam speaker, Hon Members w ill be fam ilia r w ith

th e unhappiness o f th e fam ilies o f those w ho died,

a b o u t th e inquest.   They la te r applied fo r judicial review




                                    6
 o f th e co ro n ers proceedings. During th e judicial review

 proceedings, th e conduct o f th e inquest was subjected

to close and detailed exam ination,                  in Novem ber 1993

th e Divisional co u rt ruled th a t none o f th e m a tte rs

raised       in   th e   judicial    review    proceedings       ju s tifie d

in te rv e n tio n by th a t court in th e verdict o f th e inquest

ju ry .     The court also expressed strong doubts as to

w h e th e r another inquest, if ordered, would result in

a n y th in g fu rth e r being learned and observed th a t th e

process w ould be very harrow ing.



14.       The events surrounding th e disaster have th e re fo re

been subject to investigation on several occasions. But

concerns have rem ained abo ut w h eth er th e fu ll facts

have       yet    em erged.         I have    m et   relatives   of    th e

Hillsborough victims whose suffering is exacerbated by

th e ir b e lie f th a t th e re are unresolved issues w hich

should be investigated fu rth e r.




                                      7
 15.     R epresentations w ere m ade to my predecessor and

h ave been m ade to             me, to th e A tto rn ey General and to

th e D irecto r o f Public Prosecutions. A Granada television

p ro g ram m e        in    Decem ber        last     year    dram atised    th e

d isaster and raised a num ber o f issues which, in th e

v ie w    of   th e        program m e       makers,         represented    new

evidence.         since        th en     fu rth e r     m aterial   has     been

s u b m itte d on b eh alf o f th e Hillsborough Family Support

Group. Those representations have related in p articular

to video evidence o f th e disaster and medical evidence

a b o u t th e tim e o f death o f th e victim s.



16.    Madam speaker, my D epartm ent, th e o ffice o f th e

A tto rn e y General and th e crow n Prosecution service

h av e considered very carefully ail th e evidence w hich

has been p u t fo rw a rd in recent months.



17.      The D irector o f Public Prosecutions has taken th e

v ie w th a t th e m aterial so fa r presented to her would n o t

Justify fresh crim inal investigations. The th en A tto rn ey




                                         8
General also to o k th e         view , again on th e        m aterial

presen ted to him, th a t any application to th e High Court

fo r a new inquest w ould n o t have any realistic prospect

o f succeeding.



18.   Nonetheless,      i   am   acutely   conscious       th a t   th e

fam ilie s o f those w ho died a t Hillsborough and m any

o th e rs including Hon Mem bers o f this House are very

concerned      th a t   unresolved     issues   rem ain.        I   am

d e te rm in e d to go as fa r as I can to ensure th a t no

m a tte r o f significance is overlooked and th a t w e do n o t

reach a fin a l conclusion w ith o u t a full and independent

exam in atio n o f th e evidence.



19.   I can th e re fo re te ll th e   House today th a t th e

A tto rn e y General, th e D irector o f Public Prosecutions

and l have agreed th a t it is in th e public in te re s t th a t

th e re should be an independent scrutiny to ascertain

w h e th e r th e re now exists any new evidence relatin g to

th e disaster which was n ot previously available. We are




                                  9

Justice o f the co u rt o f Appeal, fo r th a t purpose. His fu ll

te rm s o f reference are:



      To ascertain w h e th e r any evidence exists re la tin g

      A pril 1989 which was n ot available:



      (a)         To th e inquiry conducted by th e la te Lord

                  Taylor; or



     (b)          to   th e D irector o f Public Prosecutions or

                  responsibilities; or



     (c)          To th e Chief O fficer o f th e South Yorkshire

                  m atters;




                                  10
      And    in     relatio n    to    (a) to     advise     w h e th e r   any

      evidence        not     previously         available    is    of      such

      significance as to ju s tify               establishm ent by th e

      secretary o f State fo r th e Home D ep artm en t o f a

      fu rth e r Public inquiry; and In relatio n to Cb) and CO

      to    d raw    to     th e ir   a tte n tio n   any    evidence        n ot

      previously       considered           by   them   which       may       be

      relevan t to th e ir respective duties;                and to advise

      w h e th e r th e re is any o th e r action w hich should be

      taken in th e public in terest.



I am to day placing a copy o f these term s o f referen ce in

th e Library.



20.   w e have asked Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith to exam ine

all th e w ritte n      and o th e r evidence w hich has been

su b m itted .    He w ill also consider any fu rth e r m aterial

w hich in te re ste d parties wish to subm it.




                                       11
21. Lord Justice stuart-sm ith's task w ill be tw o fo ld .

First to advise me w h e th e r any evidence n ot previously

available is o f such significance as to ju s tify a fu rth e r

fu ll public inquiry.    His advice to me w ill be available to

th e House and th e public. Secondly, he will id e n tify fo r

th e   A tto rn e y   General   and   th e   Director   of   Public

Prosecutions and th e Chief constable o f South Yorkshire

Police any evidence which m ig h t be relevan t to th e ir

decisions w hich has n o t previously been considered.



22. i hope th a t th is exam ination w ill enable us to

establish conclusively w h e th e r or n o t m aterial evidence

ab o u t th e causes o f th e Hillsborough disaster has been

overlooked,      if it has l can assure th e House th a t I w ill

ta k e w h a te v e r action is needed, w e ow e it to everyone

touched by th e trag ed y, but above all to th e fam ilies o f

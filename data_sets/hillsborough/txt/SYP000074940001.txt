Sgt C r o p l e y Catchbar Lane Nr to Leppings Lane



Approx 2 p m ,



Our    serial        stand acrosj^tTeppings Lane             (on Catchbar Lane)               preventing

vehicles        going j t W n Leppings L a n e . At this time Leppings Lane and

bottom mjp^rfw^oad very             crowded.      Liverpool       Suppo r t e r s     (mainly male

youtfis) roaming about              towards and away from g r o u n d . Many we re cps^'Tnking

from beer/lager            c a n s / b o t t 1 es of   cider,    saw one y o u t h d r p r r f t i n g    from a

carafe of        red w i n



2.30.

Sgt C r ^ p l e y a r r e s t e d one for P .0 -/<ff fence,           a c c o m p a n i e d him in van to

charge        room.    Charge    room b u s y took Sgts          radio arid wa l k e d out of ground

onto main        road and w a l k e d towards Leppings Lane area                       (to my serial).

On this        road    (East side)       I was    passed by a few groups                 of fans         but no

great     numbers.



As    I wa l k e d    left towards N o r t h stand and L e p pings Lane,                    the No of

supporters           increased as did         level    of noise.       As    1 passed "the main

■gate11 saw      large     crowd at the gate w ith several                   moun t e d P. O f f icers at

rear     of    crowd.    Walked     past and       rejoined Ser.         26 on Catchbar Lane                still

preventing           traffic    from entering Leppings Lane.

Towards 3pm           large N o ’s of Liverpool           fans    came from          road from Catchbar

up hill        on same     line as Leppings Lane.



M any were       drinking       from   cans and bottles walk i n g                 straight     over      the

crossroads           junct i o n there     oblivious      to M . v e h i c l e s    travelling across
                                                                                                            PAGE          3
                                                                                                            S 1920

their     path.      One    group    in road caused a female                    d r i v e r to stop,       making

improper       suggestions          to her       re.    sex.    One y o u t h s t retched       in front       of

w i n d s c r e e n and sim u l a t e d       "oral    s e x ’ to her.     As group       parted she         drove

off.    That    one y outh was            spoken to by          (Pc Flatman?).

Due to large no.             of fans          it was    impractical        to speak       to individuals             re

their     conduct.



Saw 3 seperate youths                facing       oncoming       crowd shouting           "spares"         "got any

spare    tickets         lads." Many were              stood    in the     road joking and talking

noisily.       I a sked several               times for them to go onto                the   pavement,        most

w a l k e d off along        the    road.



S h o r t l y after,       I looked a long Leppings Lane                   towards       the main gate and

saw a large          crowd at the gate with m o u n t e d                 police at the        rear.        I could

hear a loudhaler             saying,^iMove             towards     the Po l i c e     h o r s e s 11 or similar       I

could see youths             sa ji/a c ro ss     the wall       to the     left of the ma i n <z4Xe ,

pulling there f^ms out of                       the    crowd and up and over the y & l l               (            qr

7 go o v e r ) ^/h X ,     the time       I     c o u l d n ’t see why Police weren't              stepping

them g a t i n g      over     the wall.I         didn't       notice     the    ’gate    crg^m*    enter      the

ground     I was      facing the other way.



Informed via radio for all a v a ilable                         officers        to go to the track area

of ground.          Ran to ground — taken to pen area by D D i v i s i o n Officer.



Went    to fence at          c e n t n / of stand        (rear of goals)            and saw obvious

                 youths)       roaming about               in L e p pings Lane moving         towards ^fid a w a y        from

    of    cider     I saw 1 y o u t h dj^Ttffng from a carafe                     of red wine.         At 2 . 3 0      pm

    I ac c o m p a n i e d ^ ^ t ^ 6 f ropley and a prisoner              to the grounds

    Police      charge      room and then made my way back                      towards L e p p i n g s Lane        via

    the mai n road at the front                  of the ground.

    As    I a p p r o a c h e d L e p p i n g s L a n e , the number         of supporters and the            level

    of noise        rose,     a large     crowd stood at the main gate^JWIe r e .                      I saw

    several        moun t e d officers       on h o r s eback stood aJ^Tfhe rear of the                     crowd.

    I wa l k e d    past them and         rejoined my seriaji^ a t              the    junction of C a t chbar

    Lane , still          preventing      traffic       f r orn^nte r i ng L e p p i n g s L a n e.     At about

    3    pm large     numbers      of L i v e r p o o l ^ T a n s    passed me and walked           into

    L e p p i n g s Lane.      Many were       thinking        from     cans and bottles walking

    straight        over the      crossroads         junctin there,            oblivious       to motor

    vehicles        travelling across            their      path.       1 group       in the    road   caused a

    w o m a n driver       to stop her        car,    making         improper    s uggestions       to her

    about sex.            1 y outh s t r e t c h e d across         her w i n d s c r e e n sim u l a t e d oral

    sex,    d i r ected at her and he was spoken to by a police officer.                                     Due       to

    the    large number of fans               it was      impractical          to speak to        individuals

h   regarding        their     conduct,

    ^    saw three spearate youths                 facing the oncoming                crowd shouting,

    ’Spares*        and    "Got any spare tickets                   lads.’     Many were stood         in the

    road joking and talking                 noisily.          I asked several            times for them to

    go onto the           pavement    but most walked off along                    the    road.     Shortly

    after,      I looked along Leppi n g s Lane                     towards    the main gate and saw a

    large     crowd at the gate w ith m o u n t e d Police at the                         rear of the       crowd.

    I could hear a loud haler                  saying       "move towar^M          the    police    h o r s e s ’ or

    similar.         I could see youths sat a c r o s ^ t h e                  wall    to the     left of the

    gate,     pulling       other fans        out of tjaf crowd and up over the wall.                          I saw

    six or seven youths go over t^is wall                             but saw no police           challenging

    their actions,

    I was     then told of a radio message asking                            for all a v ailable       officers

          to go to the track area of the ground.                             Myself and other officers                     from

          serial 26 ran into the g r o u n d led by a S h e f f i e l d based officer.                                    As we

          reached the area behind the goal                        occupied by L i v e r ^ 0 ^ f f ^ s u ^ p o ^ t e r s

          othe r officers we re al ready in a t t e n d a n c e JK^ l t                  was at this         point that

          I lost      contact wit h setrial 26.                  A s Jt^fooked at the           crowd behind the

          goals      I could see obviaus            crtjjmng of people at the front                         s tood

        *2 against        the fence       (this was the sect i o n           in the      centre      i mmediately

          b ehind the goal.               I ^assisted other          officers       to help fans           over the t o p

          of the fence out of the               crowd,      and      led them onto the             pit c h area to

          recover.          Most of these       fans were weak,              reduced          and out of breath.

          Presently         I noticed a small           gate      in tj>r, tence had been o p e n e d and

          officers were trying               to pull                  free     out of the g a t e .          I went        to

          assist      these officer's         (I dp-^'not know who             they were)        to pull       people

          out,      some    people were       unconscious,           others      conscious.          The    goal area

          was      by this time getting           crowded with            casualties and also               very warm.

          I e s c orted several            conscious     fans towards            the    centre of the          pitch to

          recover,         each time       returning     to the                to assist        to pull      out more

          casual ties .        1 middle age d ma j ^ T p p r o ;<ima t e 1y 35 to 40 years was                         pul led

          ,~onto    the    pitch.     I       not know the           identities         of these officers.                When

         vthe man was         laid down on the grass a St Johns A m bulance ma n or

          o r d inary a m b ulance man         checked the           casualty for a pulse and star t e d to

          give m o u t h to m o u t h while         I gave heart massage.                   Almost      im m e d i a t e l y    I

          was      taken over       by an amb u l a n c e man or St Johns a m b u l a n c e m a n and                  I left

          to go back to the fence.                  I cannot desc/'lfbe this                 casualty any further

        ‘ except to say that he wore a light                              oured buttoned shirt.                  I then

          went      to the area to the          left of X h e         goals and saw several                 people

- y »     behind the fence            these    obv i o u s l y    in difficulty.            Some     had their arms

          o u t s t r e t c h e d against    the^^ence,          trying     to hold the         crowd off        people         in

          front of them,            being    crushed.       Myself and several                fans a t t e m p t e d to

                                                                                                      S19S0A

snap the wire       fence       to a l l o w the       crushed fans onto the               pitch,    by

pushing and      pulling        it until      even t u a l l y   it gave way.

People    inside the       crowd took hold of the fence and pulled                            it in

towards    them,    pushing        it up, allowing           casualties        to get thro u g h the

gap and onto the          pitch.        I escorted several             through the fence and                led

them towards       the    centre of the          pitch     (all were sweating and short of

breath.      I a s s i s t e d them to remoj^#' the i r shirts               to    cool off,        and    left
                                  X
them to fully recover w i t h / f V i e n d s            or other supporters.                I then

assisted     fans and otiy s r        police officers            to carry injured and dead off

the   pitch on boards,
                ^                to

any of the      police officers,            I a s s i s t e d to    carry    injured off the              pitch,

I believe      they were        not Do n c a s t e r    based officers.            I cannot describe

the   people    that were        injured or dead that               I a s s i s t e d to    carry off the

pitch.     Man y fans on the            pitch were        being abusive           towards myself and

other officers.           We were      then told by an             Inspector       (not Don c a s t e r

based)    to form a line across               the      centre    of the     pitch a s both sets of

fans became a g g r e s s i v e     towards each other,              in art attempt          to kerb any

confrontation.           Once    the a n n o u n c e m e n t was made that the game was                    to be

a b a n d o n e d fans started to        leave the ground.              Once      the ground was           empty

I went    on general       foot     patrol     outside      the ground w ith other              officers          I

r eturned to Don c a s t e r at 7 .45          pm arid went        off d u t y . ,

              On 20th October              1989       (201089),     I was shown              o footage and

              photographs          of the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster          by PC               of the West

              on    (Ref No D E I / 1 6 ) ( E x No                  ).     I can be seen ass i s t i n g           to carry No

              50,     An d r e w B R O O K E S , on a h o a r d i n ^ ^ r o s s     the    pitch.       I am      carrying   the

              I can also          identify this same group                   carrying said hoarding on video

              (Ref No M A P / 7 > f Ex No                     ), time     reference       15.30.10.         We    can be seen

            picking up the h o a rding at the            corner of the six yard b o x and

            subsequently       carrying    it across     the    pitch.



            We    carried A n d r e w B R O O K E S to the gymn^ittrri w here       I left him wit h other

            offi c e r s .



            I have       indicated on a plan of the         pitch      ( R q Q C A P / 1 )(Ex No        ), by

            Andrew BR O O K E S .



            In my previous s t a tement         I mentioned attempting            to   resuscitate a male

            in a light shirt.          I believe an a m b u l a n c e m a n took over from me.             I

            cannot       remember   if this    person and      the    person   I am seen       carrying    is

            one and the same.

                 I am a Detective Sergeant                          in the South Yorkshire Police,           Scenes of

                 Crime Department,                 Police Headquarters,                  S h e ff ie ld .           ^

                 At 8.45 am Monday 17 April                          1989,      I attended at the Medico \ y S q a l Centre

                 Natery Street,            Sheffield,               my duties being to co-ordinate the work

                 carried out             by the following Scenes of Crime Department                         personnel      in

                 connection with/Hie Hillsborough Disaster.




                 Nr RICH            Af I S Q A


                 At this time I took, possession of the Scenes of Crime post mortem

                 record sheet and quantity of samples and exposed films from
                                                                            PAGE      2
                                                                            S32S5



The system used in carrying out the post morterns was that each

deceased had been given a number and as each body was brought              into the

post mortem room,       the number and the name of the deceased was given to

me.    I recorded these on a post mortem record sheet together with the

member of the Scenes of Crime Department           responsible for taking

photographs at the direction of the Pathologist            carrying out that

particular post mortem.

On completion of each post mortem,           the Scenes of Crime Of f i ce r then

handed to me any samples removed from the body, which were mainly

blood samples together with the exposed films used in the photography

of that particular post mortem.           I then ensured that each

sample and exposed film was properly identified and then recorded this

fact. At 5.00 pm (1700)         that date,   on completion of all the post

rnorterns, I took all the samples,        together with the exposed films, to

the Scenes of Crime Department at Force Headquarters where I placed

all the lirlood samples        in a refrigerator and the exposed films were

submitted for pro cess i n g .

At 8.30 am the following day, Tuesday IS April            1989,   I removed the

blood samples from the Scenes of Crime refrigerator and handed them t o

                                  for transportation to the Royal

Hal lamshi re H o sp it al .

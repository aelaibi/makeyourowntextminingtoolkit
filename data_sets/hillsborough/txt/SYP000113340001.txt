               F’o l i c e   stationed              at      Attercliffe.

               On    Saturday,           15th          April,       1989       (150489)             I    commenced          duties        at    8.00am

               (0800)        to    perform             duties       in    connection                with       the    Liverpool/Nottingham

               Forest        Semi-Final                at     Hillsborough.

               At    9 . OOarri ( 0 9 0 0 )         this       date      I attended             a       briefing       at    West       Bar     Police

               Station          where        I    received          duties          w i tt f ^ s e r i a l s    11 — 16.         The    duties        and

               serials          are     as       outlined         in D      Division            Operational                Order.         Our     role

               initially           was       to     supervise            Liverpool            fans        arriving          at    M i d j 1a n d ^ S t a t i o n

               on    the     normal          services           train.             They     were         loaded       on    to    public

               transport           and       then        taken      to    the       ground.

               At    least        two    police             officers        travelled               with       each    PSV       so    that     their

               conduct          could        be     monitored.

               The       last     bus    which           took     the      remainder            of       my    sergeants          and     constables

               to    the     ground          left        at    2.30pm        (1430).            Their          instructions             on     arrival

               at    the     ground          was       to     report      at       the     gymnasium            for    redeployment.

               During        the      time        we     were     at     the       railway          station          Liverpool          fans      were

               good       natured        and        my      officers         had      an     excellent           rapport.

Forest          supporters                at    the    Railway           Station.              He    did       not    require             any

further          assistance.                    I then          travelled           to    the       Hillsborough                Ground

arriving             at       Penistone          Road       at    approximately                 3.00pm             (1500).

When       walking             along       Penistone              Road    towards             the    gymnasium             there          were

very       few       Nottingham                Forest       supporters              waiting          to       go    into       the    ground.

I believe             these          had       attended           in    the    hope       of    being          able       to    buy       a

ticket          at    the       ground,          but       had     been       unsuccessful.

I went          into          the    qround^js J                  approached             the    gymnasium             door          I was       met

by    Chief          Ins-H-ector           Sumner          w ho    asked       me    to       take       some      serials           to       the

West       stand          where       there       was       a     pitch       invasion.              I set          off    with       a       number

of    other          officers             to    deal       with        this    incident.                 Some      officers           were

from       my    previous             serials,             others        were       not.        On       walking          into       the

playing          area          I saw       that       the       game     was    still          in    progress             in    front          of

the    West          stand.

The    crowd          was       shouting          and       roaring           and    I saw          spectators             were       still

coming          over          the    fence       of    the        playing       area.           As       we    got    past          the

halfway          line          I saw       a    police          officer        run       on    to    the       pitch       from       the       West

stand       and       go       up    to    the    referee.               I then          told       my    officers             to    form       a

cordon          across          the       pitch       to    sweep        the    spectators                back       towards          the       West

stand.           The          West    stand       terracing              is    fenced          in a n d        divided          into

sections             by       iron    railings.

As    we    started             to    sweep       them          back     and    approached                the       fence       of    pen       3,    I

saw    fans          crushed          up       against          the     wire    mesh.           Some          people       were       reaching

through          the          fence       screaming             and     shouting          for       us    to       help    them.              I went

up    to    them          to    try       and    reassure              them    and       realised             then    that          some       of

them       appeared             to    be       dead.        Whilst        up    at       the    front          I    realised          that          the

crowd       were          still       pushing          forward           and    crushing             the       people          at    the

front.           I saw          people          lapsing           into    unconsciousness                      before          my    eyes.

It    was       not       a    deliberate             surge        and    on    looking             out       into    the       crowd          it

appeared             they       were       all    leaning              forward       and       this       was       creating          a       slow

                                                                                                                                                         R261

momentus                of    crushing.                    I stood             up       on       the    front       and      shouted           loudly

“P u s h    back,             y o u ’ re         crushing             people                at    the    front".              I also          made       a

pushing             motion             with          my    arms.              It       had       absolutely          no      effect

whatsoever.                       Other          officers             by       this          time       had    jumped          onto          the    small

wall       and       were          gripping                the       wire          mesh          and    were    shouting                in a       similar

way    to       myself.

People          at       the       back          of       the       crowd          were          being       pulled       up       into       the       stand

above       them             and       I had          fears          of       someone             being       trapped          onto          the    spikes

of    the       separating                      fences.

I    continued                to       shout          and       all       I    could             see    were    staring             faces          which

were       not          responding                   to    our       requests.

The    tunnel                to    the          rear       of       this       enclosure                did    not       appear          to    be       blocked

at    this          time          and       a    space          had       been          created.              All    it      needed           was       for    the

crowd       to          start          to       move       back       and          it       would       have    helped             to    relieve             the

pressure.

I was       conscious                   that          there          were          no       police       officers             to    the       rear       of    the

crowd.

I made          a       transmission                      to    control                to    ask       for    officers             to    come       in       from

the    rear             of    the       stand             to    get       them          to       pull    back,       to      do     what       was

required,                but       I had             no    recollection                      of       them    responding                to    the       call.

You    will             appreciate                   that       due       to       the       shouting          and       screaming             and       people

milling             around             on       the       pitch,          it       was       near       enough       a       sheer       impossibility

to    hear          the       radio             even       though             I held             it    next    to    my       ear.

I stood             back          to    take          stock          of       the       situation.              Immediately                   in    front          of

me    were          a    number             of       people          trapped                on    the    fence       in a          large       pile.           I

saw    that             the       gate          to    the       number             3    enclosure             was    now       open          and    officers

were       in       the       gateway                one       of    whom          I    identified             was       Chief          SuperjjjtjMndejnt

Nesbit.                 He    had       a       number          of    officers                   with    him    so       I    remained             in    situ.

I saw       that             some       officers                were          near          number       4    gate       giving          assistance.

People          were          still             climbing             over          the       fence       and    coming             over       the       top    of

number       3    pen.           We    assisted             them        to    the     playing             track.

I then       made       a    request             for    bolt        cutters           in       an       effort          to    create          another

opening          into       number          3     terrace.              Again        I do       not       know          if    this       message

was    received             or    if    in        fact       theyever           came           to    our       location.                 I then

saw    police          officers             and       spectators              kicking           at       the       fence          to    my     right

and    by     pulling            the    wire          back     they          created           an       entrance             into       this

enclosure.              This          still       being        pen       number           3.        I    immediately                   went        to

this    space          and       started          to    assist           in    bringing                 people          out       from       the

enclosure            onto        the    playing             area.

You    will       appreciate                that       some        of    the       bodies           that       were          removed              from

the    enclosure             were       either          unconscious                 or     dead          and       as    officers                 came       to

the    entrance             to    carry           people       away          I was telling                   them        to    see       to       them,

to    give       what       aid       they        could.

Casualties             were       building             up    on     the       pitch         behind            the       goal        area          and    I

told    officers             to       take       them       further           on     to     the         pitch       so       as     not       to    cause

obstruction                for    ourselves.                 Whilst           we    were            helping         people             one        man    who

was    conscious             became             trapped        in       the    wire        and          whilst          we    were           trying          to

assist        him      people          were       jumping           on       him     and        over         him    and        other          people

who    were          trapped,          to       get    on     the       pitch.            I do          not       blame        them          for    this,

some     of      them       were        injured,            some        had    cuts,            they         had    been          trapped           for

so    long       that       once        they      became           free       they        wanted             to    get        out      of     that

situation.                 The    young          man     was       eventually               freed            and    moved           on       to    the

pitch.           I     continued            to    help        at    this        location                where       both          regular

officers             and    special             constables              were        involved              in      carrying              people          away.

Spectators             and       police          officers           were        involved                in     removing             the       bodies

from     this          particular               area.         I was          conscious               that         one        young       man,       a

Liverpool              supporter,               was    stood        up       and     the        pile         of    casulaties                 was

above        his       knees.           Until          then    I had           not    fully             appreciated                    the    enormity

of     the    tragedy.

 I then          saw    that          the       enclosure          was       now     empty           of      casualties                 but       was

full    of       police       officers             and           the    remaining                    spectators.

I    looked      around           the       area       of        the    goalmouth                    where        I saw       St.       Johns

Ambulance             people       and       police              officers                 involved           in    giving          various           type

of    artificial            respiration.                         An    ambulance                    had     come       down       the    pitch           to

number       3       enclosure.              I then              noticed                 that       the     Fire       Service          were        in

attendance             with       some       of    their              members              walking           about       with       oxygen

bottles          which       they       were       giving              to        people             who     required          that       service.

I then       became          conscious             of        some       hostility                    between           the    Police           officers

and    spectators             in       the       pen     and          told           the    officers              to    come       out     of       that

area    onto          the    pitch          and    they           did.               I    remained           in    that       area       of     the

pitch       as       they    did.

I    remained          in t h a t          area    purely              as        a       containment              exercise          when

suddenly             I became          aware       of        a    skirmish                 in       the     number       3    enclosure.                  I

looked       round          and       saw    a    stocky              built              uniformed           police          officer           running

out    of    the       enclosure.                 He     had          his        head          in     his    hands.           He    was        not

wearing          a    helmet          and    he        ran       onto        the          pitch.            Two    other          officers

followed.              I was          unable       to        speak           to          them        but    I understand                 that       they

had    been          into    the       enclosure                 with        a       Scenes           of    Crime       Officer           to       take

photographs             and       this       had        upset          the           spectators.

We    then       appeared             to    be     in a          state           of       limbo.            Officers          were        stood

about       in       groups       on       the    playing              area.              Spectators              were       still        ripping

down     boardings               to    make       makeshift                  stretchers.                     I then          started           to

re-group             what    was        left      of     my       serials                 which        would       be    5    sergeants              and

•15 c o n s t a b l e s .         All       of     us,       without                 exception,              by     this          time    were       in a

state       of       shock.           Police           officers              were          walking           about       the        pitch          crying

and     I ensured             that         they        were           comforted                 by    other        officers.

Whilst        I was         on    the       pitch        a       number              of    supporters               kept          trying       to     pick

an     argument          with         me    stating              that        it          would        not    have       happened              if

Liverpool             had     been         allowed           to        use       the        larger          stand.            I    pointed          out

that     this         was     nothing             to    do       with        me          and     they       all     accepted             it    and       said

they       were       upset.           At       no    time       was       I threatened             with       violence          but       it

appeared          to       me    that       they       only          wanted       to    argue.

I    later    attended                at    Penistone                Road    to    load       the    Liverpool             fans       onto

the    bus    to       return          to       the    Station.              In    the       main    the       spectators             were

very       very       subdued          as       were       my    officers.              So    far    as       I recall          only       two

bus    loads          left       that       location.                 I put       my    remaining             officers          onto       one

of    the    buses          where          they       sat       in    silence.

Whilst       I was          stood          outside          on       the    pavement          a young          man       came    to       me,       a

Liverpool             supporter,                and    asked          for    the       directions             to    the    Northern

Generl       Hospital             and       how       he    could          make    enquiries             regarding             his

friend.           I started                to    obtain          details          of    the    casualty             number       when          one

of    his    friends             starting             shouting             "I've       told    you       not       to    speak       to    those

bastards.              You       bastards             did       this,       murderers".              He       then      went     on       to    say

we    had    opened             the    gates          and       had    caused          the    problem.

I    initially             wanted          to    go    and       remonstrate             with       him       but       decided       it w a s

better       to       ignore          the       remarks,             not    knowing          all    the       facts,       than

creating          a    scene.              This       remark          really       hurt       me    as    all       the    officers             who

were       with       me    who       had       given       their          all    in a n      effort          to    help       the    crushed

supporters.

At    no    time       did       I see          any    of       the    club       stewards          in    the       ground.           I have

referred          to       my    problems             with       the       radio       but    would       add       that       everyone

appeared          to       be    so    engrossed                in    their       respective             duties           that       they       d i d no



or    could       not       hear       any       radio          transmissions.

I handled             many,       many          casualties.                 Some       had    lost       their          lower    garments

whilst       being          in    the       crush,          others          had    wet       themselves,                been    sick,          so

one    can    appreciate                   the       smell       at    this       particular             location.

My    main    involvement                   was       passing          the       people       on         to    other of ficers                 to        be

taken       away       and       the       only       one       I handled          at    that            time       w ho I feel           that           I

could       recognise             again          was       a young          girl/woman             being        carried         out       with

dark       brown       spiky          hair,          long       at    the    sides,          wearing          what       appeared          to       be
                                                                                                                                                    PAGE        7
                                                                                                                                                    R261

             a    brown    coat          or    dress.

            Many     young          officers          responded          to       their          responsibilities                      with    vigour

             and    determination                   and    were    a    credit          to       the       South          Yorkshire          Police.

            Some     climbed             over       the    fence       into       the       pen       to    lift          people       out    and    on

             occasions          gave          artificial          respiration,                   whilst             others       had    to    stand       on

             the    fence       and       shout       at    people       to       pull       back.

            The     things          that       really       stick       in m y         mind       were          -

             1.                 A    young          policewoman          coming             up    to       me       and       asking    what       she

             could       do.        I told          her    to    get    the       crowd          to    push             back.     She       then    left

             me    and    ran       up    the       fence       nearly       to    the       top       and          was       shouting       and

             screaming          at       the       crowd    in    her    determination                      to          get    them    to    respond.

             2.                 This          was    the    depth       of    bodies             that       had          built    up    in    the    well

             of    the    terracing.

             My    own    feelings             are    that       I shall          never          forget             the       helplessness          and

             frustration             I felt          when       I went       to    the       West          stand.

             Here    I am,          a well          paid    professional                with          nearly             28    years    service          who

             has    attended             and       been    involved          in m a n y          public             order       situations          and

             attended          many       courses          to    improve          my    professionalism,                         yet    here       I was,

             when    I was          most       needed       by    the    community,                   when          I    could    have       given       most

             help,       thwarted             at    the    frist       hurdle          by    'a       fence'             with    strands       of    wire

             approximately                one       eighth       diameter.

             I    could    touch          them,       speak       to    them       and       nothing                more.

END   OF   REPORT
My name is RICHARD DEWS and I am an Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police

stationed at Attercliffe.



On Saturday 15 April 1989, I commenced duties at 8.00 am to perform duties in

connection with the Liverpool/Nottingham Forest Semi-Final at Hillsborough.



At 9.00 am this date I attended a briefing at West Bar Police Station where I

received duties with Serials 11 - 16.    The duties and serials are as outlined

in D Division Operational Order.    Our role initially was to supervise

Liverpool fans arriving at Midland Station on the normal services train.    They

were loaded on to public transport and then taken to the ground.



At least two police officers travelled with each PSV so that their conduct

could be monitored.



The last bus which took the remainder of my Sergeants and Constables to the

ground left at 2.30 pm.     Their instructions on arrival at the ground was to

report at the gymnasium for redeployment.



During the time we were at the railway station Liverpool fans were good

natured and my officers had an excellent rapport.



I liaised with Inspector Harper who was supervising the Nottingham Forest

supporters at the Railway Station.     He did not require any further assistance.

I then travelled to the Hillsborough Ground arriving at Penistone Road at

approximately 3.00 pm.



When walking along Penistone Road towards the gymnasium there were very few

Nottingham Forest Supporters waiting to go into the ground . I believe these
                                       -   2   -
                                                                                           I
had attended in the hope of being able to buy a ticket at the ground, but had

been unsuccessful.



I went into the ground, as I approached the gymnasium door I was met by Chief

Inspector Sumner who asked me to take sane Serials to the West Stand where

there was a pitch invasion.   I set off with a number of other officers to deal

with this incident.   Sane officers were fran my previous serials, others were

not.   On walking into the playing area I saw that the game was still in

progress in front of the West Stand.



The crowd was shouting and roaring and I saw spectators were still caning over

the fence of the playing area.    As we got got past the half way line I saw a

police officer run on to the pitch fran the West Stand and go up to the

referee.    I then told my officers to form a cordon across the pitch to sweep

the spectators back towards the West Stand.         The West Stand terracing is

fenced in and divided into sections by iron railings.



As we started to sweep them back and approached the fence of pen 3, I saw

fans crushed up against the wire mesh. Sane people were reaching through the

fence screaming and shouting for us to help them.          I went up to them to try

and reassure them and realised then that sane of them appeared to be dead.

Whilst up at the front I realised that the crowd were still pushing forward

and crushing the people at the front.          I saw people lapsing into

unconsciousness before my eyes.



It was not a deliberate surge and on looking out into the crowd it appeared

they were all leaning forward and this was creating a slow manentus of

crushing.    I stood up on the front and shouted loudly "push back, your
                       *

crushing people at the front".    I also made a pushing motion with my arms.          It

had absolutely no effect whatsoever.       Other officers by this time had jumped
                                     - 3 -



on to the small vail and were gripping the wire mesh and were shouting in a

similar way to myself.



People at the back of the crowd were being pulled up into the stand above them

and I had fears of someone being trapped on to the spikes of the separating

fences.



I continued to shout and all I could see were staring faces which were not

responding to our requests.



The tunnel to the rear of this enclosure did not appear to be blocked at this

time and a space had been created.   All it needed was for the crowd to start

to move back and it would of helped to relieve the pressure.



I was conscious that there were no police officers to the rear of the crowd.



I made a transmission to control to ask for officers to carte in fran the rear

of the Stand to get them to pull back, to       what was required, but I had no

recollection of them responding to the call.    You will appreciate that due to

the shouting and screaming and people milling around on the pitch,it was near

enough a sheer impossibility to hear the radio even though I held it next to

my ear.



I stood back to take stock of the situation.     Immediately in front of me were

a number of people trapped on the fence in a large pile.     I saw that the gate

to the number 3 enclosure was now open and Officers were in the gateway one of

whan I identified was Chief Superintendent Nesbit.    He had a number of

officers with him so I remained in situ.     I saw that some officers were near

number 4 gate giving assistance.
                                     - 4 -




People were still climbing over the fence and caning over the top of number 3

pen.   We assisted them to the playing track.



I then made a request for bolt cutters in an effort to create another opening

into number 3 terrace.   Again I do not know if this message was received or if

in fact they ever came to our location.      I then saw police officers and

spectators kicking at the fence to my right and by pulling the wire back they

created an entrance into this enclosure.      This still being pen number 3.   I

iirmediately went to this space and started to assist in bringing peopleout

from the enclosure on to the playing area.



You will appreciate that sane of the bodies that were removed fran the

enclosure were either unconscious or dead and as officers came to the entrance

to carry people away I was telling them to see to them, to give what aid they

could.



Casualities were building up on the pitch behind the goal area and I told

officers to take them further on to the pitch so as not to cause obstruction

for ourselves. Whilst we were helping people one man who was conscious became

trapped in the wire and whilst we were trying to assist him people were

jumping on him and over him and other people who were trapped, to get on the

pitch.   I do not blame them for this, seme of them were injured, sane had

cuts, they had been trapped for so long that once they became free they wanted

to get out of that situation.   The young man was eventually freed and moved on

to the pitch.   I continued to help at this location where both regular

officers and special constables were involved in carrying people away.



Spectators and police officers were involved in removing the bodies fran this

particular area.   I was conscious that one young man, a Liverpool Supporters,
                                           - 5 -


^   was stood up and the pile of casualties was above his knees.     Until then I had

    not fully appreciated the enormity of the tragedy.



    I then saw that the enclosure was now empty of casualties but was full of

    police officers and the remaining spectators.

    I looked    around the area of the goal mouth where I saw St Johns Ambulance

    people and police officers involved in giving varous type of artificial

    respiration.    An ambulance had come down the pitch to number 3 enclosure.     I

    then noticed that the Fire Service were in attendance with seme of their

    members walking about with oxygen bottles which they were giving to people who

    required that service.



    I then became conscious of sane hostility between the police officers and

    spectators in the pen and told the officers to come out of that area on to the

    pitch and they did. I remained in that area oijr the pitch as they did.



    I remained in that area purely as a containment exercise when suddenly I

    became aware of a skirmish in the number 3 enclosure.      I looked round and saw

    a stocky built uniformed police officer running out of the enclosure.     He had

    his head in his hands.      He was not wearing a helmet and he ran on to the

    pitch.     Two other officers followed.   I was unable to speak to them but I

    understand that they had been into the enclosure with a Scenes of Crime

    Officer to take photographs and this had upset the spectators.



    We then appeared to be in a state of limbo.      Officers were stood about in

    groups on the playing area.      Spectators were still ripping down boardings to

    make make-shift stretchers.      I then started to re-group what was left of my

    serial* which would be 5 Sergeants and 15 Constables. All of us, without
                            *


    exception, by this time were in a state of shock.      Police Officers were

    walking about the pitch crying and I ensured that they were contorted by other

    officers.
                                        - 6 -




Whilst I was on the pitch a number of supporters kept trying to pick an

argument with me stating that it would not have happened if Liverpool had been

allowed to used the larger stand.      I pointed out that this was nothing to do

with me and they all accepted it and said they were upset.        At no time was I

threatened with violence but it appeared to me that they only wanted to argue.



I later attended at Penistone Road to load the Liverpool fans on to the bus to

return to the Station.       In the main the spectators were very very subdued as

were my officers.   So far as I recall only two bus loads left that location.

I put my remaining officers on to one of the buses where they sat in silence.



Whilst I was stood outside on the pavement a young man came to me, a Liverpool

Supporter, and asked for the directions to the Northern General Hospital and

how he could make enquiries regarding his friend.        I started to obtain details

of the casualty number when one of his friends started shouting            I've told you

not to speak to those bastards.       You bastards did this, murdenttHl.    He then

went on to say we had opened the gates and had caused the problem.



I initially wanted to go and remonstrate with him but decided it was better to

ignore the remarks, not knowing all the facts, than creating a scene.            This

remark really hurt me as all the officers who were with me who had given their

all in an effort to help the crushed supporters.



At no time did I see any of the club Stewards in the Ground.         I have referred

 to my problems with the radio but would add that everyone appeared to be so

 engrossed in their respective duties that they did not or could not hear any

 radio transmissions.
                         0




 I handled many, many casualties.      Some had lost their lower garments whilst
                                   - 7 -


being in the crush, others had wet themselves, been sick, so one can

appreciate the smell at this particular location.



My main involvement was passing the people on to other officers to be takew

away and the only one I handled at that time who I feel that I could recognise

again was a young girl/woman being carried out with dark brown spiky hair,

long at the sides, wearing what appeared to be a brcwn coat or dress.



Many young officers responded to their responsibilities with vigour and

determination and were a credit to the South Yorkshire Police.    Seme climbed

over the fence into the pen to   lift people out and on       occasions gave

artificial respiration, whilst   others had to stand on       the fence and shout at

people to pull back.



The things that really stick in my mind were:-



1.   A young police woman coming up to me and asking what she could do.     I told

     her to get the crowd to push back.    She then left me and ran up the fence

     nearly to the top and was shouting and screaming at the crcwd in her

     determination to get them to respond.



2.   This was the depth of bodies that had built up in the well of the

     terracing.



My own feelings are that I shall never forget the helplessness and frustration

I fel when I went to the West Stand.



Here I am, a well paid professional with nearly 28 years service who has
                       0

attended and been involved in many public order situations and attended many

courses to improve my professionalism, yet here I was, when I was most needed
by the camvunity, when I could have given most help, thwarted at the first

hurdle by 'a fence' with strands of wire approximately | diameter.



I could touch them, speak to them and nothing more.

Dear A.C.C. Mervyn Jones,

Re: HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


I enclose copy letters from:-

                                                  dated        17th   April    1989
                                                  dated        17th   April    1989
     G.M. Phillips                                dated        20th   April    1989
     M.G. Hill                                    dated        20th   April    1989 together with his
statement of events.
You may wish to incorporate these accounts into your investigation
and interview the people concerned as appropriate.   This is in
fact my inquiry but perhaps even more so of Hr. Justice Taylor.

We have also had a request from P.C. Ken Greenaway, Hillsborough
Incident Room, Force H.Q. for an alphabetical list of fatalities.

I would have no objection to supplying them with this information
but I think it would be wiser if communication were done through
your Force.

You would obviously want to consider Mr. Justice Taylor's views on
this matter and your own involvement as well before you supply this
information.




Yoursy>-sincerelv.




H. M. CORONER

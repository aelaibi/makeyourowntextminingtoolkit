              I am the above named person and have £ 4 years Police service.                             I am a

we did.



Whilst     in the canteen,    having been there 5 or 10 minutes a telephone

call was received by somebody who immediately shouted that

’Operational S u p p o r t 5 was requirjra.     I gathered my serial together and

we drove straight to Hi 1Isboyfugh.           The traffic was light and we

arrived on Pennistone R o a y b e h i n d the    op at about 3.20 pm (1520)



I sent my serial     to the Police       r    by the North Stand and went onto

the pitch.      I saw a cprdon           olice Officers across the pitch,       My

initial    reaction was that           was a pitch invasion but this soon

changed when I saw fans and Police Officers utilising the

advertising hoardings as makeshift stretchers.             It soon became

apparant that peopl"e were injured anti that there were indeed

fa ta lities.



I could see people     render ing first aid not always knowi ng what^to do

I spent my time adv ijn. ng and assisting where I coul                      of the

North Stand and       ■r the general area of the pitch                the half way

1 in e .



I tried mouth to mouth resuscitation on a^rout 6 people           in all.     My

efforts were fruitless.            Their immediate appearance and palor gave me

the impression that they had onlly R e c e n t l y died, rnaybe in the last 5

minutes,     rather than the ones who had blue faces and were long term

dead.



1 recall seeing Chief        Ins          BEAL when I first arrived at the

around and saw him sever              imes afterwards on the pitch.    Of the

people that I attempted to resuscitate they were all male with the
                                                                                   PAGE    3

             exception of 1 female.       I am unable to describe the males   in any
         w
             det ai 1   I seem to recall that the female had a white T shirt on,



             In short I made mysaftf as useful as I could helping and advising,

              Iso assisted in parrying 3 foodies on hoardings to the gymnasium along

             with other fan;    Z2>Ct-r&Y* & US4<JUoljz)              plKLO*-

             When the situation had calmed down somewhat      I was directed to take my

             /serial back to West Barr to eventually assist     in the dispersal of fans

             from the ground through the City Centre.



             I eventually went off duty at 3 am (0300).       During this time I spent

             an enormous amount of time talking to and counselling junior officers.

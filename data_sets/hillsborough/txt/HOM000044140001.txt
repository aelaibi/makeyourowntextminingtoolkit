Paul/Peter

LCD phoned this evening to say LC has spoken tonight to LCJ and will speak tomorrow morning to Lord
Woolf, subject to which Tom Legg (PUSS) will speak to LJ Stuart-Smith.

They then think that there should be a formal Home Office approach - from the HS or Richard Wilson,
by letter or by phone.

I should be grateful if you could advice on what is appropriate and stand ready to provide a suitable
draft/speaking note.

Thanks

David

Dear      /

          The anger,   horror and revulsion at what happened
last night will, fortunately eventually disapate. I am lucky,
for those people inlvoled life will never be the same.

           Now  is  the time to take positive  steps  towards
making football the safe and entertaining game it used to be.

           As a punishment to those stupid people who caused
this  tradegy there should be a ban on all football  matches,
quite for how long I do not know, maybe that will help people
realize the enormity of what has happened.

           Secondly every person seen on video films climbing
into  the ground should be prosecuted,  because each  one  in
their own way is responsible.

          And thirdly the government,   football associations
and supporters clubs must get together and work out a way  of
making the game safe.

          Basically it comes down to individuals,  we have to
care about our fellow human beings and if the need to watch a
football  match is greater than the need to protect life then
this foolishness should stop.

          My feelings    today are one of concern for   those
people  in hospital who,   if they survive, will never be the
same again and for those people who have lost loved ones   in
the name of a great game.

          I have sent this letter to as many involved parties
as possible   in the hope that    constructive  dialogue  may
follow.  Why does it always take a disaster before people put
their houses in order?

                                    Yours                    f lr tl'-T

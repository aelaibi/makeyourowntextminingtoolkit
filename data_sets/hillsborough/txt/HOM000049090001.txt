 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Thank you very much for coming to
 4        see me. Can you just tell me about yourself now.      Are you
 5        still a Special Constable?
 6   A   No, after the disaster I left the South Yorkshire Police
 7        because I was still having hassle by the police, and I
 8        couldn't take any more so I just handed my notice in.
 9   Q   "Hassle by the police."    What do you mean by that?
10   A   I was getting internal and external mail with threats.
11   Q   What?
12   A   I was getting internal and external mail with threats.
13   Q   Who from?
14   A   From various officers out of Sheffield and in Sheffield
15        saying that - all about Hillsborough, and in   the end I
16       went to my section district officer and told him and he
17       said he couldn't do anything for me so I still carried on
18       going on duty, and I was getting none of the response that
19       I had earlier from my colleagues, and in the end I just
20       finished.
21   Q   Did you make any complaint about these officers?
22   A   I wanted to make a complaint, but I was told    not to. I
23       was told I wouldn't be given any help in the matter at
24       all, and just to be more or less a good girl and carry on
25       with my job as a Special Constable, and as I say, I
26       couldn't take it any more so I just left.
27
28                                           there were reasonable
29        grounds to just let me go and leave the force.
30   Q   I see. So what are you doing now?
31   A   I am still a dental nurse, and I   have been that now for 18
32        years.
33   Q   Let us just go through your statements if we can.      You
34       have got copies of them there, have you?
35   A   Yes, I have, sir.
36   Q   The first one was dated 8th May?
37   A   That's right.


                                     2
)
    1   Q    Very soon after the events.       Was that something which you
    2        wrote out yourself?
    3   A    Yes, we were told on the actual day of the Hillsborough
    4        disaster by the commanding officer that we had to write a
    5        statement down, but not in normal statement format.          We
    6        had to write it down as the events had actually occurred
    7        along as they were fresh in us mind; you know, to do it as
    8        soon as possible.
    9   Q   Yes.   You did that.
10      A   I did that, yes.
11      Q   And that is the basis of the statement that was made on
12          8th May?
13      A   On 8th May, that is exactly, that is the statement I made
14          out there and then.
15      Q   And it is in your own woos?
16      A   In my own words, yes.
17      Q   I have to say that I find     it a little confusing in places.
18          Can we just go to page 2.         Youstart at the Penistone   Lane
19          end, don't you?
20      A   That's right, yes.
21      Q   This is at the     top of the page:
22                 "At 245 I started to make my way to the Leppings Lane
23                 entrance.   As I passed what I think is the main
24                 entrance to the Spion Kop, the turnstiles were shut
25                 down."
26          There you are still talking about the Spion Kop end at
27          that moment, presumably, are you?
28      A   Yes.
29      Q          "At 250 there was trouble at these turnstiles when
30                 the Nottingham Forest fans realising they were being
31                 locked out, were trying any way they could to get in.
32                 This included paying money to the turnstiles stewards
33                 and trying to buy tickets from the touts."
34          Is that, again, referring to the Kop end?
35      A   I assume so.   The events that I wrote down were ----
36      Q   I know. May be you don't have any recollection of these
37           events.


                                          3
)
     1   A   It's a long time, and it's something that I've tried to
     2       put to the back of my mind each time.
     3   Q   I see.   You must help me if you can because, you see,    I
     4       found reading this statement through very difficult to
     5       follow.  It may be because you were confused about events
     6       at the time?
     7   A   At the time everything just snowballed;   everything that
     8       was supposed to have gone according to plan.    I have been
     9       to many football matches.
10       Q   Never mind about that.   If you didn't have a clear
11           recollection at the time, I can understand why there is
12           some confusion in the statement.   Do you understand?
13       A   I understand.
14       Q   But you appear to be talking about the kop end here, and
15           then you say:
16                "The crowd became very abusive and angry and I had to
17                assist in the removal of fans from the ground."
18           That is still at the Penistone Lane end?
19       A   That's right, yes.
20       Q        "I was on the road side and the police inside were
21                passing fans back out over the turnstiles and there
22                was a very large number of fans trying to get in
23                still, so much that mounted officers and their horses
24                were being pushed up against the wall.    The next
25                thing I know is a large blue gate was opened and a
26                large majority of the crowd pushed their way into the
27                ground."
28           So far as I am aware, the only large, blue gate that was
29           opened was at the Leppings Lane end.
30       A   The way you've just explained that, on the Penistone side
31           of the road there, there are about three or four
32           turnstiles and then there are so many doubts actually
33           going down, but these gates, as far as I know, have always
34           been closed.   Each football match that is there, they have
35           always been closed, and they actually opened up.    I
36           remember distinctly the gate was actually opened, and the



                                        4
)

     1        only means of the gate being opened was by the gateman
     2        because they had different gatemen on each one.
     3   Q    Don't run on a moment.     The only exit gate that I am aware
     4        was opened was what was always referred to as gate C at
     5        the Leppings Lane end.
     5   A   I wouldn't know about that one, sir.
     7   Q   I see.     So you are not referring to that at all?
     8   A   No.
     9   Q            "A mounted officer grabbed my collar but had to let
    10             go because he would have been pulled from his horse.
    11                I got pushed to the floor but I managed to getback
    12                to my feet by pulling myself up a man's back. I then
    13             remember opening my eyes and finding myself inside
    14             the ground at the bottom of the Spion Kop and the
    15             gates had been shut behind m e ."
    16       At this stage you never got down to the Leppings Lane end
    17       at all?
    18   A   No, no.
    19   Q   What gates are these that were shut behind you?
    20   A   I can't recollect what the gates were called.      All I
    21       remember is there were so many turn styles and there were
22           these blue gates.     This particular one was opened, and as
23           soon as the gate had opened a wee bit, the next thing
24           people just came rushing from nowhere;      and, of course, I
25           was carried in the midst of these people, and this
26           horseman actually grabbed my collar;      but at the time, if
27           he continued to hold my collar he would actually have been
28           pulled out of his saddle and the horse may have gone down
29           with him.     All I remember is this massive crowd surging
30           forward with me in the midst of it.       I remember going down
31           on my knees and there was a man in front of me who was
32           also down on the floor, and the only thought in my mind at
33           the time was to get out.  I remember climbing on the man's
34           back and then blackness ---
35       Q   Don't run on too much.
36       A   This is just things I remember.



                                           5
)

     L   Q    You see, the puzzling thing about this is that I have now
    2         read a very great deal about this Hillsborough case.
    3    A   I imagine.
    4    Q    And, so far as I am aware, nobody else has ever mentioned
    5         a gate being opened at the Spion Kop end or a vast crowd
    6         flooding through it.
    7    A   Well, it happened.
    8    Q   I see.
    9    A   It did happen.
10       Q   Yes.
11       A   I would never lie.
12       Q   No, no, of course not.      That I accept.   It is a little
13           surprising that you appear to be the only person speaking
14           about this.
15       A   No, the gate was open and there were several other police
16           officers there at the time.
17       Q   Very well.   You go   on:
18                  "I asked the steward on the gate to let me out, but
19                  at first he refused.    It was only when a mounted
20                  officer, the same one who had tried to help me a few
21                  moments earlier, put his horse up against the gate,
22                  he opened it a short way and let me out."
23           I think possibly if I show you a plan of the ground        you
24           can tell me which gate you are talking about.
25       A    (Plan produced) That is the gym.       Penistone.   This is the
26           entrance where the Notts Forest were being brought into.
27           We had to divide the Liverpool from the Notts Forest fans
28           because of the problems we had. I was on patrol further up
29           and I was brought down to Penistone to bring the coaches
30           in, the footballers in.
31       Q   Which gate are you talking about that was open?
32       A   I can assume that these must be the turnstiles,        and then
33           there were several blue gates along that facing wall
34           there.
35       Q   I see.   So which one are you referring to?
36       A   The only one I can remember is there was a blue gate and
37           it was quite near the gym.        As you go through one of the


                                           6
i

    1          gates, there's turnstiles all along here and there are
    2          several blue gates, and then you go up around and the gym
    3          is there and then there is a side slope that actually
    4          leads back down on to the pitch.
    5   Q     So where were you swept through by this crowd?
    6   A     The gate that was opened was the one adjacent where you go
    7          up the slope towards the gym, and then there is a further
    8          slope that slopes down on to the actual pitch, which is
    9          about down here.
10      Q     And where were you swept forward?
11      A     It would have been around just where one of these gates
12             are, about here.
13      Q     You are pointing to ----
14      A      I have no idea, to be honest, sir, because at the time - I
15            have not been to Hillsborough since the Hillsborough
16            disaster happened, and all I remember is these blue gates
17            that were there.
18      Q     You are pointing to a blue gate situated somewhere near
19            the lighting tower at the East end of the pitch.
20      A     All I remember, as I say,    was there was easy access to get
21            to the gym and I remember, sir, going down towards the
22            pitch.
23      MR.   BONE:   That is where there was a mixture of Nottingham
24            Forest and Liverpool fans on the terraces.
25      A     That is right.   Exactly.     The problem was at the time, we
26            tried to divide them and not realised there were so many
27            fans more on one side than the other, so they had actually
28            put them together which, with the sound of it, created the
29            problem.
30      Q     The police tried to divide the Liverpool fans from the
31            Nottingham Forest ones.     A small segment of terrace at the
32            kop end was reserved for Liverpool fans and it was that
33            side of the ground.
34      A     Yes.
35      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Let's go on with your statement.
36            You say you found yourself inside the ground, and you have



                                           7
)

     L        explained to me now that you were sort of carried through
     2        on a great rush of people?
     5   A   That1s right.
    4    Q        "I asked the steward on the               gate to let me out but at
    5              first he      refused.     It was only when a mounted
    5              officer,      the same one who tried to help me          a few
    7              moments earlier, put his horse up against the gate.
    8              He opened it a short way and let me out."
    9         That is the same gate that came in through, is it?
10       A   That's right, yes.
11       Q        "Once outside I found myself              surrounded by drunken
12                 fans, screaming abuse, and the area covered by
13                 police."
14           Again, we arein Penistone             Lane?
15       A   Exactly.     Just    outside the same gate that I was talking
16           about.
17       Q        "An officer used my radio to               try and call for back up
18                but to no avail because the channel was full of
19                static."
20       A   That's right.
21       Q        "My radio was handed back to me and I ran to the
22                Leppings Lane end of the ground."
23           At this moment you are still outside Penistone Road?
24       A   I was still outside Penistone Road,              yes.
25       Q   So how did you run to Leppings            Lane end of the ground?
26       A   There were houses surrounding,            just round thecorner, and
27            I just remember taking off and that was it.
28       Q   Which way did you go?
29       A   The long way.       You can    actually       cut roundthe   back.
30       Q   I see. Down Veer Road,         perhaps,this way.
31       A   I can't remember the name, sir.                Itwasn't   my area.   We
32           only ever helped when the big matches were on at
33           Hillsborough.       I remember there were quite a few cut backs
34           round the houses at the back.   If you do the short cuts
35           you can get there more quicker.
36       Q   Very well.    You say:



                                               8
 1               "Ambulances and police cars were rushing to that end
 2               of the ground."
 3        So this must be quite late by now?
 4   A   It was getting on quite late.         Apparently, some people who
 5        were in the paramedics had had a lot of trouble actually
 6        getting to the match.
 7   Q   I don11 think ambulances got to that end of the ground
 8        until after 315;       I am not quite sure.
 9   MR. BONE:     After that.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       It may have been even later.     At
11        any rate, you got there when the ambulance and the police
12        cars were at that end of the ground.          That is right, is
13        it?
14   A   Well, as far as I can recollect.
15   Q   That is what you say?
16   A   That's what I say in this.
17   Q           "When I got to the Leppings Lane end of the ground I
18               saw a vast crowd outside the turnstiles trying to get
19               in.     It must have been about four times larger than
20               the crowd I left at the other end, so that would mean
21               that the crowd at the Spion Kop end numbered about
22               1000 plus and I would estimate about 4000 outside
23               Leppings Lane end."
24       They were still trying to get into the ground, were they?
25   A   It was utter chaos.       There were police officers     trying to
26       battle to keep people from          getting in, and   itwas just
27       absolute chaos all the        way around.
28   Q   You see, nearly all the other evidence is         thatthe
29       Liverpool fans - because the gate was opened - got in by 3
30       o'clock or shortly after.           That is why I am rather
31       puzzled by all this.
32   A   As I say, at the time there was just a lot of people
33       round.        It was utter chaos altogether.    There were a lot
34       of people who I know who have not been brought forward,
35       and they had a similar thing happen to them.          They saw a
36       lot of police officers        and a lot of people     battling
37       endlessly, and nothing        has been done about     itat all.


                                         9
)

    1   Q   Can we just go on.
    2             "I can't really remember how, but somehow I got
    3            inside the ground through the large blue gate which
    4            was open, and I ended up on the pitch."
    5   A   That's right.
    6   Q   This is a different gate, is it, from the one you were
    7       speaking about so far?
    8   A   Yes, yes.
    9   Q   Do you remember which gate this was?
10      A   I can't recollect, sir.
11      Q   Right; and you ended upon the         pitch?
12      A   That's right.
13      Q   But you can't remember howyou got there?
14      A   All I remember is again,it was        a mass of people and
15          somehow I managed to get through and the next thing I knew
16          I was on the pitch.     My boyfriend at the time, he wasn't
17          too far away because - I don't know what it was at the
18          time that these events were occurring.         I only seemed to
19          spot relevant people like colleagues from Woodseats Police
20          Station.    Somehow theystood out. They stood out to me        all
21          thetime. I wasn't aware of any of the police        officers
22          being there.    It was just the ones who I had worked with
23          for such a long time that I recognised, and homed in on.
24      Q   And then you say that once you were on the pitch you saw a
25          lot of dead people and so on?
26      A   Yes.
27      Q   And perhaps we can go down to the bottom of this statement
28          which is really from my point of view in many ways the
29          most important part.        You say in the last paragraph there:
30               "I helped carry a young boy into the gym from the
31               pitch nearby.     He    stopped breathing so I gave him the
32               kiss of life, and heart massage and a doctor also
33               helped.   He started breathing and opened his eyes.
34               His only word was 'Mom' and then he died."
35      A   That's right.
36      Q        "At 4.06 Dr. Curpen certified death and I stayed with
37               him."


                                           10
 1           You had been told to stay with him?
 2   A       We were all told if anyone had died on us, they didn't
 3           want the bodies by themselves;     you had to stay with them.
 4   Q       And we know that was Kevin Williams?
 5   A       Well, at the time I only knew him as body 51.
 6   Q       Can we go to the second statement.     I am toldthat    the
 7           reason why you were asked to make a second statement was
 8           because the Coroner had some doubt as to whether or not
 9           Kevin Williams could be alive at the time that you saw
10            him, and could say "Mom".    Do you understand?
11   A       I understand, yes.
12   Q       Was that explained to you?
13   A       Nothing has been explained    to me at all.
14   Q       Nothing has been explained    to you at all?
15   A       Nothing whatsoever.     When it happened, I wrote my
16           statement out, I was taken home, and I was unaware of
17           anything that happened afterwards.     No-one got in touch
18           with me which seemed - it seemed strange having been there
19           and no-one actually came up to me and saying when the
20           actual thing happened down    in Sheffield, if   I wasgoing   to
21           be there and be a witness and everything,you       know, tothe
22           actual events that occurred. No-one got in touch with me.
23           I had been there, I had been pushed to one side and just
24       i totally forgotten.
25   Q       Didn't Miss Appleton come to see you on 17th March 1990?
26   A       Miss Appleton came to me several times and also harassed
         I
27       | me at work with phone calls, and the bosses actually spoke
28           to the lady in person and told her to discontinue with
29           making these irrelevant phone calls because they were
30           damaging,
31                    When she couldn't get through to me at work, she
32           continued bombarding me at home.     She came three or four
33           times to my home.     Before that, there were several male
34           PCs, and they were very polite, they asked me the relevant
35           questions to which I answered.     Nothing was said about
36           having to make a further statement.     I gave them the



                                          11
 1        information that they needed, and they thanked me and said
 2        that I had done a good job.
 3   Q    What was that?
 4   A    I think what they wanted was a recollection of what had
 5        actually happened at Hillsborough, and they were just
 6        checking relevant questions and answers that I had given
 7       ^ in my statement.    Then this lady came along, PC Appleton,
 8        who said that she was a Detective Constable at the time
 9        and she was with a male colleague and, at the time again,
10        she seemed very nice to me, and then after      that - as I say
11         - I got these numerous phone calls at work     and at home.
12        She literally bombarded me.       At one time my mum and dad
13        told her to stop ringing.
14   Q    To stop what?
15   A    To stop actually calling, ringing, phoning.       Then she must
16        have visited my home three or four more times.
17   Q   >, Three or four times did she?
18   A    By herself.     The time that she actually came to my home
19        and took the second statement, I had had enough.       What
20        really hurt was that she turned round and said that
21        because I didn't weigh up, I was the odd one and it was
22        the end of the puzzle that needed sorting out, and her
23        exact words were her boss had got a message for me and the
24        message was I was nothing but a little liar, that it was
25        all part of my imagination that I had ever been at the
26        Hillsborough disaster, that what I was saying in my first
21         statement was a lot of clap trap.
28   Q   . Was what?
29   A   ( A lot of clap trap, lies, and as far as her boss was
30        concerned, there was nothing to say but I was a little
31         liar who wanted to get a bit of notice, and his words were
32         "You need to take a second statement to get it sorted, to
33        get things sorted out, tied up and thrown away."       That is
34         the lady's exact words.
35        Am I right in thinking that the only matter they wanted to
36         clear up was this question of whether or not Kevin said
31         "Mom"?   Is that right, or not?


                                       12
 1   A   It was Kevin, to do with Kevin, and also the actual events
 2       with regards to being at Hillsborough and this gate being
 3       opened.     She just called me a complete liar, and I kept
 4       saying to her over and over again that my first statement
 5       stood.    I had done exactly as we had been told, my
 6       colleagues included, had been told not to write it down in
 7       statement format but to event as the events had occurred.
 8   Q   Oh, she was questioning the opening of the gate in
 9       Penistone Road, was she?
10   A   Yes, besides Kevin as well.
11   Q   I see.
12   A   And, as I said to her at the time, I was only telling the
13       truth and I had past experiences with doing CPR and heart
14       massage because on various occasions with working with
15       general anaesthesia we had patients who had gone into
16       fatal resuscitation which I had to help bring round again.
17   Q   You know, it would help me if you didn't ramble on too
18       much and you allowed me to ask the questions and you
19       answer them.     You understand that, don't you?
20   A   All I understand, sir, is it was just very upsetting at
21       the time.
22   Q   Well, it is now eight and a half years later.
23   A   It is eight and a half years later, but it is      just
24       something in my mind and it has been resurrected and it is
25       something that I want to forget.
26   Q   So Miss Appleton was putting to you that you were confused
27       and mistaken about the blue gate at Penistone Road being
28       opened?
29   A   And that I was also confused over Kevin.
30   Q   Can we concentrate on Kevin.
31   A   Yes.
32   Q   The Coroner has told me that one of the reasons why he
33       wanted to find out about Kevin was because it seemed that
34       it was unlikely that he could have been able to say "Mom"
35       at that stage.     That was one of the questions that Miss
36       Appleton wanted to clear up with you, was it?



                                      13
 1   A   I She never mentioned anything about that, sir; her exact
 2         words were I wasn't there with Kevin at all. Quite
 3         clearly, her exact words were I never existed.  I was just
 4         a Special Constable who wanted to get a bit of notice so I
 5         had lied the whole thing, and it was all part of my
 6         imagination.  I had never been, and as I say, her words
 7         were she wanted to get everything all sewn up neatly and
 8         tied up.
 9   Q       What were the names of these other officers that came to
10           see you?
11   A       All I remember is they were just PCs, male PCs.
12   Q       They were PCs?
13   A       They were PCs.    I know its laughable.   At the time there
14           was one - there were two gentlemen who were actually
15           staying at the Moat House Hotel on Chesterfield Road South
16            (they had not been up North all that long) and one
17           collected cap badges, and in the conversation he asked if
18           I wanted to collect any badges for him I could pass them
19           on to him.      Other than that, I can't recollect any of
20           their names.  It is just this female PC Appleton, whose
21           name rings a bell.
22   Q       Can we just turn to your second statement.
23   A       Yes.
24   Q       Miss Appleton has told the Inquiry that this was dictated
25           by you?
26   A   | No.      At the time when she told me what her boss had passed
         i
27           on by her to me by calling me a liar, she said that they
28           needed to take a second statement because my first
29           statement didn't stand at all.
30           I see.     Can we go through it.   First of all, did you read
31           and sign the endorsement at the top?
32   A       No.    The lady just made a statement out and she   went along
33           making i t . She got a dictionary out so that she would get
34           the better words more clearly read.
35   Q       What "better words"?
36   A       Well, all I remember is she went through, there     were some
37           words that she wasn't too clear on so she got a dictionary


                                          14
 1        out and she wrote this statement herself.     She came along
 2        across the room to me and just told me to sign there,
 3        there and there at the bottom of the statement and that
 4        was i t .
 5   Q   But didn't you read it?
 6   A   | I was in no state, sir.   I actually went out.    I had to
 7       j leave the room because I was in tears, and I said to my
 8        j mum and dad that she had come out to take a second
 9       I statement and my dad at the time turned round and said he
10       I was going to throw her out of the house because he had had
11       I enough.
12   Q    So you didn't read the statement at the top:      "This
13        statement consisting of 5 pages each signed by me is true
14        to the best of my knowledge and belief."
15   A   I never read it at all.
16   Q   Have you ever taken a statement from anybody as apolice
17        officer?
18   A    Oh, yes, I have taken many statements, but at the time -
19        we had always been told when you were doing a statement to
20        read and check and to verify from whoever you were taking
21       I the statement from. That is something I always upheld,
22         but at the time when this woman was repeatedlycoming    at
23         me, I just couldn't take it any more.  I was on the edge
24         of a breakdown.
25   Q    She repeatedly came at night, did she?
26   A    No.   It was weekends that she came round.
27   Q   How many times did she come?
28   A    r would s a y three or four times.   That is three or four
29        times I would say it was by herself, and on many of the
30        times I came my mum had told her repeatedly not to come,
31        and she just turned upon the doorstep.     My mum being
32        polite, she actually let her in.
33   Q    So you didn't read or sign an endorsement at the top?
34   A   No.
35   Q    It purports to be signed by you?
36   A   No.
37   Q   You say you didn't sign it?


                                     15
 1   A     Today is the first time that I have actually seen this
 2         statement, and at the time when she did this statement
 3        herself by her own hand, I just signed it at the bottom
 4        without reading it at all.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: We have not got hold of the
 6        original statement, have we?
 7   M R . BONE:   No.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    We will have to get hold of the
 9        original statement.
10   A    It was just that I wanted it all out of the way.         With her
11        coming continually, I just couldn't take it any more.          As
12        I say, I was on the edge of a breakdown, and that was it;
13        I just wanted it out of the way.
14   Q   I must quite understand what      you are saying.   You told me
15        a moment ago that you didn't     sign at the topthere?
16   A   No, I have not signed at the      top.   I remembersigning at
17        the bottom.
18   Q   Right.   So if that has been signed at the top,      that is a
19        forged signature.
20   A    Well, it will be because I remember distinctly her writing
21        the statement out ---
22   Q    Just answer my question and we'll get on quicker. You have
23        taken many statements from witnesses and you know the form
24        that they take?
25   A   Yes.
26   Q   They have this statement at the top,      don't they?
27   A   Yes.
28   Q    Which is asked to be signed by the witness.
29   A   They have to.
30   Q   And then it is signed at the      end?
31   A   That's    right, each statement, each page has to be signed.
32   Q   Did you think it was odd that you weren't asked to sign at
33        the top?
34   A    Not at the time, no.    As I say, I just remember signing at
35        the bottom.
36   Q   Yes, I see.     Can we go through it.
37   A   Yes.


                                      16
 1   Q         "Further to my previous statements, I would like to
 2             add the following."
 3       I think there were some other statements but I'm not quite
 4       sure that we have got them.
 5             "I worked in the capacity of Special Constable at the
 6             FA Semi-Final football match ..."
 7       There's nothing in that.
 8             "My recollection of the events of that day are vague
 9            and confused."
10       Was that right or not?
11   A   No, it wasn't.
12   Q   It wasn't.
13   A   It was very clear and distinct.
14   Q   Right.   So did you say that, or not?
15   A   I told her that ---
16   Q   I am sorry.   Did you say that your recollection of the
11       events of that day was vague and confused?
18   A   No.
19   Q   You said exactly the opposite?
20   A   I have told her exactly the opposite.
21   Q   I see.
22
23
24       Was that correct?
25   A   That is correct.
26   Q   Did you tell her that?
27   A   I did tell her that.
28   Q
29
30       Did you tell her that?
31   A   I told her
32   Q   So that's correct.
33   A   That's correct.
34   Q
35
36
37       Did you tell her that?


                                    17
 L   A   No, I didn't.
 2   Q   So she has made     that up, has she?
 3   A   That is totally rubbish.
 4   Q          "As a result of this, I feel that my memory, my
 5             recollection of that day is possibly inaccurate."
 S   A   Not true.
 7   Q   Did you say that?
 8   A   Not true.
 9   Q          "I am insure of what time I arrived at the Leppings
10                Lane entrance to the ground or even how I came to be
11                on the pitch but I did."
12       Is that right?
13   A   I can't recollect at the time, but I remember getting
14       through that gate and getting on to that pitch.
15   Q   We are talking about the Leppings Lane entrance her e.
16   A   Yes.     I wasn't aware of the time
17   Q   It must have been quite     late, mustn't it?
18   A   It would have been quite late for me to have managed to
19       get Kevin and have him certified as being dead at 6
20       minutes past 4.
21   Q   But it is right that you can't remember how you got on to
22       the pitch?
23   A   That's right, as I said in my first statement.
24   Q   Did you say that?
25   A   I told her, yes. I must     have done,sir.   That's all I can
26        say.
27   Q   So that sentence is right?
28   A   Yes.
29   Q            "By the time I got onto the pitch it seemed to be a
30                mass confusion.   There were police officers and
31            supporters all over the place."
32       Is that right?
33   A   That's right, yes.
34   Q   You told her that, did you?
35   A   I did.

    1   Q            "I could see people who appeared to be injured and
    2                possibly dead, lying on the pitch. I was in a state
    3                of shock."
    4   A   I wasn't in a state of         shock.
    5   Q   You weren't in a state         of shock?
    6   A   I wasn't in a state of         shock;   my faculties were full.
    7   Q   Is the first part of that         sentence right?
    8   A   Yes.
    9   Q   That's right.      "I was in a state of shock" is wrong.
10                   "I didn't know what to do but my natural instinct was
11               to help these people in the best way that I could."
12          Is that correct?
13      A   That is correct.
14      Q   And you told her that?
15      A   I told her that.
16      Q            "I can't describe to you in any detail my exact
n                movements over the next half an hour or so."
18          Is that correct?
19      A   That is not right because         at the time I told her my exact
20          movements were that I was trying to help people who were
21          dying or injured or dead, and I was trying to convey them
22          down to the gymnasium.
23      Q   But were you able to describe your exact movements with
24           each person?
25      A   Yes.
26      Q   You    were.    I see.   So that is wrong.
27                   "I know that I approached several people lying on the
28                   pitch and assisted if possible."
29          Is that right?
30      A   That's right.
31      Q            "I didn't give any of these people mouth to mouth or
32                   heart massage."
33      A   I did.
34      Q   You did.       That's wrong.     So she has just got that wrong,
35           has she?
36      A   Totally wrong, sir.        I could not possibly leave a person,
37          see a person dying and not try and assist in mouth to


                                              19
 1       mouth or heart massage.      That is one complete lie. I
 2        helped many people as I possibly could do that day.
 3   Q    I see.
 4                "I decided that there were enough people dealing with
 5                the situation at the Leppings Lane end of the ground
 6             and made my way to the Spion Kop end of the ground."
 7        Is that right?
 8   A   That1s right.
 9   Q             "I could see that bodies were being carried from the
10                Leppings Lane end to the Spion Kop end of the ground
11                and then being placed on the pitch."
12        Is that right?
13   A   That's right.
14   Q             "I assisted to carry a number of dead and injured
15                people from the Spion Kop end of the pitch into the
16                gymnasium where a temporary mortuary had been set
17                u p ."
18       Is that right?
19   A   That's right, y e s .
20   Q   And, again, you told her that?
21   A   I did.
22   Q             "I was talking to some of these people, comforting
23                them and trying to reassure them."
24       Is that right?
25   A   That1s     wrong.
26   Q   That's     wrong.
27   A   How can I actually be talking to people and comforting
28       them when I'm takingpeople         in onboards?
29   Q   I don't see why not.
30   A   Sorry, but I didn't talk      to anybody at all.
31   Q   So that's wrong.
32   A   That1s wrong.
33   Q             "I am unable to describe any of these people in
34                detail."
35       Is that right?
36   A   I couldn't describe anybody at the time, no.

}

    L   Q            "By this time I really was in a state of shock. I
    2             couldn't believe what I was seeing."
    3        Is that right?
    4   A    I wouldn't say I was in a state of shock.       It's just that
    5        I'd never seen anything like this happen.       I wasn't in a
    6        state of shock.       Again, I knew exactly what I was doing.
    7   Q   I see.     So you couldn't believewhat    you wereseeing?
    8   A   I wasn't in a state of shock but       Ijustcouldn't   believe
    9        the events that were occurring.
10      Q        "I seemed to be on automatic pilot."
11      A   That's right; I w as .
12      Q   That's right?
13      A   Yes.
14      Q   And you told her that?
15      A   I told her that.
16      Q        "My memories are very confused and distorted."
17      A   No, they were very clear.
18      Q   Very clear.
19                   "I can recall carrying a youth who I now know to be
20                   Kevin Daniel Williams from the pitch to the
21                   gymnasium."
22           Is that correct?
23      A   That's right.
24      Q            "He was the last person that I assisted in carrying."
25      A   Yes.
26      Q   Is that right?
27      A   Y e s.
28      Q            "I saw Kevin Williams lying on the pitch near to the
29                goal area at the Spion Kop end of the ground."
30           Is that right?
31      A   Yes.
32      Q           "At that stage he wasn't on a hoarding or stretcher"
33      A   N o , he wasn't .
34      Q   Is that right?
35      A   That is right.
36      Q   And you told her that?
37      A   I told her that.


                                           21
 1   Q   Do you want to have a break?
 2   A   No, I'll carry on.
 3                               (Short pause)
 4   Q         "I remember that there were several people around
 5             where he was lying."
 6        Is that correct?
 7   A   That's right.
 8   Q        "I can't recall anyone giving him mouth to mouth".
 9   A   No, he was just lying there.
10   Q         "With    the help of other people, who I can't recall,
11             Kevin Williams was placed on to a hoarding and
12             carried into the gymnasium."
13       Is that right?
14   A   I remember that there were two young boys, and      the other
15       gentleman was a PC from South Yorkshire Police.
16   Q   I see. You cannot recall who they were?     You have    not
17       been able to identify them?
18   A   I just remember that there were two young     boys who were
19       Liverpudlian, and the other one was a police officer.
20   Q    I see. That statement is correct?
21   A   Yes.
22   Q        "Someone instructed me to stay with the body."
23       Is that right?
24   A   That's right.
25   Q        "I didn't know what to d o ."
26       Is that right?
27   A   At the time ----
28   Q   Did you tell her that?
29   A   I did tell her that, yes.
30   Q        "I didn't want to believe the boy was dead."
31       Is that right?
32   A   At the time - this is wrong because he was quite blue
33       cyanised (sic) ---
34   Q   He was what?
35   A   He was quite blue.    His colour   wasquite blue.   When   we   j
36       took him to the gym there wasstill      aslightpulse.      He
37       still had a slight pulse.


                                      22




                                                                             I
 1   Q   Did you take his pulse?
 2   A   I actually felt the pulse, yes.
 3   Q   You haven't said that before, have you?
 4   A   I think when I gave him mouth to mouth - in my statement I
 5        had actually felt a slight pulse.
 6   Q   I don't remember you saying that previously.
 7   A   I know there was a slight pulse.     That is why I gave him
 8       mouth to mouth.     If there had not been anything there, I
 9       would never have tried giving him mouth to mouth or heart
10       massage.
11   Q   Is it right that you didn't want to believe the boy was
12        dead?
13   A   After - after I had given him mouth to mouth and he had
14       actually said the word "Mom" and he died, I couldn't
15       believe that he was dead.
16   Q   Can we just read on?
17   A   Yes.
18   Q          "I didn't know if he was dead or not but I decided
19            that I had got to attempt to revive     him."
20       Is that right?
21   A   That's wrong.
22   Q   That's not right.
23   A   Because when we actually took Kevin on - or body 51 as I
24       came to know him - that is when I found a slight pulse and
25       I had actually given him mouth to mouth.
26   Q   I thought you did try to resuscitate him?
27   A   I did resuscitate him and he did say     "Mom" but this is
28       more or less saying I didn't want to believe the boy was
29       dead as though he was already dead, and then I tried to
30       give him mouth to mouth, and heart massage.
31   Q   Did you give him heart massage as well?
32   A   I did give him heart massage, yes.     I gave him CPR and
33       heart massage, and that is when Kevin said "Mom" and then
34       he died in my arms, and then someone came up to me,
35       because I still continued, and that is when someone
36       touched me on the shoulder and said "Leave him, he's dead"
37       and that's when we were all told to stay with the dead


                                     23
 1       people and Dr. Curpen came along and certified him as
 2       being dead at 6 minutes past 4.
 3   Q   You see, apart from the fact that you don't say in this
 4        statement that he said "Mom" --
 5   A   I'd like to ----
 6   Q   Just listen to my question, would you?
 7   A   Yes.
 8   Q   Apart from the fact that in this statement you don't
 9       mention him opening his eyes and saying "Mom", there is
10       nothing inconsistent, is there, in this passage from what
11       you have said earlier?
12   A   Because this is not my statement;   this is PC Appleton's
13       statement.   She is the one who wrote this statement, the
14       one that I've never read until today.    That is why I am
15       upset because I stood by my first statement, and then this
16       woman has come along and tried to decimate my original one
17       by putting lies and sheer fabrication in places where
18        things I am supposed to have said and done never occurred.
19   Q   You go on:
20             "By this time my head had gone.    I wasn't aware of
21            what I was doing or what was really happening."
22       Would that be right, or not?
23   A   That's wrong.
24   Q   So all this passage here she has made up, has she?
25   A   She has made up, yes.
26   Q   Do you know, that is a very serious allegation to make
21        against a police officer?
28   A   I know it is against a police officer;    but, as I say,
29       this is not my statement;    I never wrote it;   I never said
30        anything. This is a statement from somebody else.
31   Q   She says that you dictated it to her?
32   A   No, I was in no fit state to dictate.    As I say, today is
33       the very first time that I have seen this statement. It is
34       the first time ever.    I have never seen this one.   I
35       remember my own - I can't say clearly because it's all
36       those years ago, but I remember my first statement, and



                                     24
JI

     L       then I remember her coming to my home and taking this
     2       second statement, and the woman herself wrote it.
     3   Q   You made a third statement, didn't you, to Miss Adlington?
     4   A   I am not sure.    Is this Miss Adlington - is Miss Adlington
     5        - Kevin's mum?
     5   Q   The support group, yes.
     7   A   I remember going to Liverpool.
     8   Q   I have got a photostat copy of theoriginal     statement
     9       here. Is that in your handwriting?
 10      A   No, that is my writing.
 11      Q   That is your writing?
 12      A   That is my writing, yes.
 13      Q   And you say in that you area former     police constable.
 14               "There is now produced and shown to me exhibit DJM1
 15               appended to my statement.    This exhibit is a
 16               statement which I made on 8 May 1989 in relation to
17                my involvement at Hillsborough ... "
18           That is the first statement that we went through?
19       A   That's mine, yes.
20       Q        "I confirm that the contents of that statement dated
21                8th May 1989 are true."
22       A   That's   right.
23       Q        "In relation to exhibit DJM2 appended hereto, I would
24                like to point out that the statement contained
25                therein, dated 17th March 1990, was compiled by WPS
26                7844 Appleton, a member of the West Midlands police
21                   11
28           If you have never seen this statement before, how could
29           you say that it was compiled by her?
30       A   All I can assume is - I don't know,     I can't remember.
31           All I remember is going to Liverpool to meet Ann Williams
32           and she had got a solicitor there.     There were two ladies
33           and we actually went to Ann Williams' home, so if I had
34           seen it - it's a long, long time ago.     I can't remember
35           this at all.
36       Q   Didn't you read through that statement then in order to
37           find out whether it was true or not?


                                        25
\
}'
     L   A   I must have done.   I must have done at Ann's, but I can't
     2        recollect it.   I just remember the second statement was
     3        done by this WPC Appleton and it wasn't a true statement.
     4        But I do remember going to Ann's home.       As I say, there
     5       were two ladies there, one from the support, and there was
     5        a solicitor there as well, and there were various things
     7        said and written, and that was it.    As I say, its a long,
     8        long time, so I cannot recollect.
     9   Q   I know, but you were asking me to believe a moment ago
 10          that you had never seen this statement before, the second
 11          statement?
 12      A   I can't remember actually seeing this at all.        I can't
 13          remember at all.    As I say, it's a long time, and there's
 14          a lot of things that I've pushed to the back of my mind.
 15          Obviously, reading this, I must have seen some sort of
 16          statement.
 17      Q   The statement is exhibited to this statement as DJM2, and
 18          it is the second statement, if you want to see it, it is
 19          referred to as such on the document.
 20      A   Yes.
 21      Q   You go on in this statement:
 22                "After exerting considerable pressure on me WPS 7844
 23               produced a dictionary which she referred to whilst
 24               compiling a statement which I believe is the one
25                appended hereto ..."
26       A   I must obviously have seen it then, but i t 's a long time
27           since I thought anything like this.
28       Q        "In relation to [that statement]     I was unable to read
29                the statement prepared by WPS Appleton due to my
30                 state of distress brought on by her behaviour."
31       A   That's right.
32       Q   What she said to you was    that you were aliar,    that the
33           gate which you referred to as the blue gate had not been
34           opened.
35       A   Never been opened at all.
36       Q   And that you were also a    liar inrelation    toKevin
37           Williams saying "Mom", is that right?


                                         26
 L   A   And I had never been at Hillsborough.
 2   Q   That you had never been at Hillsborough.     She said you had
 3       never been at Hillsborough?
 4   A   It was all part of my imagination, and yet when the
 5        Inquiry was going on I went to see various videos.       I was
 6        actually pointed out.     They started to laugh about it at
 7        one time by saying "Oh, you're our little star;       you are
 8        on every video that we have got available."
 9   Q   It was remarkable for her to say that you had never been
10        there when you would presumably have been rostered on some
11        of the serials, wouldn't you?
12   A   Yes.
13   Q   Were you rostered on one of the serials?
14   A   Yes.
15   Q   The fact that she accused you of lying on the previous
16       statement induced you to sign a statement which was
17       completely untrue in material respects.     Is that right?
18   A   That's all I can put it down to, sir.    This is not my
19       statement.     It was horrible what she did to me, this
20       continual hounding.     I think with the events that had
21       happened at the time, it was just too much to take on, and
22       then
23
24                  Then I had this woman continually bombarding me
25       with phone calls either at work or at home, or visiting me
26       at home, and I think at the end of it, it became a laugh.
27       She actually laughed on the last visit.     That's when she
28       actually wrote this statement out herself.     As I say, at
29       the time I had to leave the room, and my dad actually said
30       that he was going to throw her out of the house.
31   Q   Was your mother in the room while this was going on?
32   A   No, at the time I was by myself, and I just told my mum
33       and dad.     Actually, they could hear everything that was
34       going on at the time, and my dad said to me he would throw
35       her out of the house because it had become unbearable for
36       my parents as well.     This is not my doing at all.
37   Q   Was Miss Appleton offered coffee and biscuits?


                                     27
 1   A   She was.   We were very sociable.       She was offered drinks.
 2        She wanted to use the bathroom whenever.       She could go
 3        whenever she wanted to.     We were very friendly towards
 4        her.   On every occasion she came we were very friendly
 5        towards here, but as I say, each time it was her attitude.
 6        It was very aggressive.     She was a woman working in a
 7       man's world.    I think she was trying to compete with the
 8       men.  I know it sounds very sexist, but at the time that's
 9       how it came over.
10   Q   But why were you very friendly to her and offered her
11       drinks and so on, if she accused you of lying in this way?
12   A   She wasn't offered drinks on that day.
13   Q   Oh, I see, she was offered drinks on earlier days, was
14        she?
15   A   The other times she came she was offered a drink which she
16       turned down.    After that there was a continual bombardment
17       each time she came to our house, three or four times.           She
18       wasn't offered any drinks because my mum turned round and
19       said at the time that if that's her attitude, then she's
20       not going to get a drink or anything.         But on the last
21       visit, as I say, she had just come with one thing in mind:
22       that was to take this last statement which she wrote
23       herself.
24   Q   But you did sign it?
25   A   I signed it at the bottom.
26   Q   Why was that?
27   A   She said to me, "I want you to sign this statement" and I
28       just got the statement and I just turned each page and
29       signed it at the bottom where she pointed her finger, and
30       she took it off me and smiled at me very casually, and
31        said "Thank you very much.       That's sewn up nicely."
32   Q   You didn't read through it?
33   A   I never read it through.
34   Q   Why was that?
35   A   Because I was upset, and what angered me was I wasn't me,
36        I wasn't the Debra that I had been before Hillsborough.
37   Q   You weren't what?


                                      28
 L   A    I wasn't the Debra - I wasn't the person I had been before
 2       the disaster.     I had got no fight in me;   nothing at all.

 7   Q   Were you ----
 8   A   I was at the time ----
 9   Q   Could I just ask the    question.
10
11
12       Not that I can recollect;     it was the first week or so
13       after Hillsborough;     the first or second week afterwards.
14
15
16
17   Q   A number of police officers made claims for compensation
18       in respect of Hillsborough.      Did you do that, or not?
19   A   Yes, I actually went to the solicitor, my mum and dad's
20       solicitor at the time, and I had actually at the time - I
21       knew I shouldn't have done - photocopied what I had
22       written down in my pocket book, but then there was a mass
23       meeting in one of the theatres, and it had been made known
24       to the Chief Constable that there were several police
25       officers trying for compensation as well as specials, and
26       we were all told there and then that if we had any thought
27       of going for compensation to take the thought out of us
28       minds because if we went for compensation then there was a
29       risk of a regular losing the job or the special being
30       kicked out of the force.    We were threatened.
31   Q   That seems rather surprising because a number of these
32       claims were settled?
33   A   Some of them were settled, yes, as far as I can
34       understand.     I took them quite a while, but they were
35       officers who had left the force by then.
36   Q   When did you leave the force?



                                     29
     L   A    I left the force about two years afterwards - a year and a
     2        half to two years.
     3   Q    After Hillsborough?
 4       A    I wanted to make a go of it.         To be honest, I had every
     5        conception of getting into Thames Valley Police, and I
 6            passed my exams and everything, and I was just waiting for
 7            confirmation that it had come through to go and work down
 8            in Thames Valley, but unfortunately with this happening I
 9            never went for it.
10       Q    How long did this interview with Miss Appleton take on
11            this occasion?
12       A   I would say an hour.
13       Q   About an hour.       Not longer than that?
14       A   Not longer.
15       Q    And in that time she wrote out a statement?
16       A   That's right.
17       Q   In handwriting or         typed?
18       A   Handwr itin g .
19       Q    Much of which she has got right but much of which she has
20            got wrong?
21       A   Exactly.    They are       her words.
22       Q   What?
23       A   Most of it are her      words.     Some of it   isfrom my original
24           statements and the paragraphs that she hasactually            put in
25           herself are not my words at all.
26       Q   Are you suggesting           that -
21       A   She lied, sir.
28       Q   What?
29       A   She's lied.       That's all I can say.    That's theangry     part
30           that I had made one statement how it was, as          ithappened,
31           as the events happened, and then this woman has come along
32           and ruined my character, because I would have made a good
33           police officer.
34       Q   Why has she ruined      your character?
35       A   Because she has maligned my name.          I mean, it's not   very
36           nice after this happening and her taking this second

     L        statement, and while I'm still being a special constable I
     2        am still getting internal and external post with threats.
     3        But there is nothing inconsistent, so far as I can see,
     4        between the first statement and the second statement
     5        except that you ---
     6   A    It's just the words - it's her wording.
     7   Q    What do you say is inconsistent in the second statement
     8        with the first statement?
     9   A   Some of it is mine.
    10   Q   No, no, just follow the question.      I can see that if what
    11        is said in the second statement is completely contrary to
12            what is said in the first statement, then there may be a
13           problem, but at the moment, it      doesn't seem to me that
14            there is anything very much to     choose between the two.
15            There is nothing inconsistent in the second statement with
16            the first?
17       A    I think overall it's just that I've got an anger inside me
18           after all this time of knowing why couldn't they have
19           stuck with my first statement, and then having to badger
20           me to get a second statement.     That's what I can't
21           understand.
22       Q   I think the reason for that probably was that you appeared
23           to be the only person present on that day who        thought that
24           there was a blue gate opened at       the Penistone Lane end.       I
25           have not come across anybody else who suggested that.
26       A   That's exactly what happened.     I remember it clearly.
27       Q   That is obviously something which     israther    odd, isn't      it?
28           You are the only person, apparently, out of thousands of
29           people present on that day, who       noticed that. That is
30           rather odd, isn't it?
31       A   It may seem odd to you ---
32       Q   It does seem odd to me.
33       A   I understand.   All I am saying     is exactly   I remember the
34           gate being opened and this massive rush of people rushing
35           through it and me being carried on it.
36       Q    And that wasn't at the Leppings Lane end?
37       A   No.


                                          31
)
     1        That is something which is odd which I should have thought
     2        was perfectly legitimate for the Coroner or for the police
     3        to try to clear up to see whether you might be mistaken
    4         about it. Isn't that right?
     5   A    It's right. I agree with you entirely.      But nobody has
     6        come back to me about it.     No-one ever came to my home and
    7         questioned me - you are the only      one who knows   about this
    8         blue gate being opened.     Nothing like   that has been said
    9         to m e .   It's like I say, the actual events occurred.
10       Q   They just said you were lying about that?
11       A   Yes.
12       Q   And the other point that Miss Appleton wanted to clear up
13           was this business about Kevin Williams saying "Mom".        You
14           see, the problem about that is that Mr. Bruder who was a
15           police officer ---
16       A   That's right, he worked for Liverpool police.
17       Q          says that he was quite satisfied that Kevin Williams
18           was dead when he gave up trying to resuscitate him, and
19           also the St. John's Ambulance person said so as well.
20       A   I don't know about the S t . John's Ambulance person.
21       Q   I am just telling you.     So, if you are right, then Mr.
22           Bruder must certainly be mistaken about that.
23       A   All I can say is that I saw a little boy who I took to the
24           mortuary, the mortuary had been split, there was one half
25           for the dead, and one half for the injured, and at that
26           time Kevin was put in the injured side, as I say.       That's
27           where I gave him mouth to mouth because I felt a slight
28           pulse.      As I say, I had him in my arms and the little boy
29           said "Mom" and then died.     And then the side where all the
30           dead were massed, that's when his body was moved over
31           there and we were all told.
32       Q   Did he start breathing again?
33       A   Actually, as I say, I found a slight pulse, and he opened
34           his eyes, and said "Mom", and it wasn't gases escaping as
35           I had been told before, he actually said the word "Mom"
36           very clearly and looked straight through me and then just
37           died.


                                          32
 1   Q     And did he start breathing?
 2   A     He was breathing at the time.
 3   Q     Breathing at the time.
 4   A     And as I say, he said "Mom"      and then he looked straight
 5          through me and his eyes glazed over and he died, and
 6         that's when we were moved over and we     were told if someone
 7         had to died we had to stay with them,     and we had to go and
 8         check to see if there was any form of identification.
 9   Q     Thank you very much.     Do you think there is anything else,
10         Chris?
11   MR. BONE:   I don't think so, Sir Murray, no.      We need to speak
12        to Mrs. Martin.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Yes.
14   MR.   BONE:   I think while we speak to your    mum, perhaps you
15          would wait with
16   A     Of course, yes.

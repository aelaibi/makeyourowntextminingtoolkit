             the    exact       p o sition and      I don't      know w here         they went.

             The    crush outside          the    perimeter        fence was         beginning     to get     quite

             severe     by the      time    they     reopened       the gate.          Immedi at el y we were

             although          I am unable       to say who        opened      it or w hen as       it had p reviously

             had to go to get                in the terraces.

             a r o u n d me as        I m o v e d t h r o u g h the tunnel        I could not see the ground

             downwards.My             first     i mp re ssions as we neared the end of the tunnel were

             that       the    terraces       were a l r e a d y   tigh tl y    packed,     but due to the           crowd

             only describe             it as     like w a l ki ng     into a brick wall,            I had been walk in g

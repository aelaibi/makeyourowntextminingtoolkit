  Dear Mr Whalley

  You will be aware of the research undertaken here into the deceased who
  entered through Gate ’C .’

  I have continued that research which will only be totally complete when
  every document and statement is fully indexed but I feel the present
  picture should be explained to Lord Justice Taylor,

 The 21 deceased can be linked to entering through Gate ’C ’. The further
 research has however   pointed to some of them entering Gate ’C* at
 different opening times. I have prepared a chart for your information
 which is enclosed.

  A single ’X ’ shows that it is suggested by the evidence that the deceased
  entered through Gate     ;C ’ at the 1452 opening. An ’X ’with a ’?’ shows we
  can put the deceased    going through Gate ’C ’ but which opening time is non
  sufficiently proved. The X? is placed in the column the evidence points
  to,

  I trust this information is of value and I will of course continue to
  update you of any significant information.

  Yours faithfully




  * I • 'H S ri , 4 ^     ,

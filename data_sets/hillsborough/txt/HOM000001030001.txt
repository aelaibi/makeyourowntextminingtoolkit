Name:      BRUCE DAVID GROBBELAAR               d.o.b.   6/10/1957

Occupation: Professional Footballer




Dated 11th May, 1989.



I am a professional foorraller and goal keeper for Liverpool City Football Club,

I have been with Liverpool City Football Club for eight years, prior to that I was

in Vancouver in the Norte American Soccer League which no longer exists.       I have'

been first team goal keeper for eight years consistently, since the season

1981/1982. My work has        me familiar with Hillsborough Football Stadium at        r

Sheffield.

On Saturday 15th April, 1989 I was selected as goal keeper for the team for the

F.A. Cup semi-final: match against Nottingham Forest that was to taJke place at

Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield.     I travelled to the Stadium with tfate team in

the team coach under Police escort from our Sheffield hotel. We went into the

ground past the -Kop end nd got out of the coach behind the main stand where

the changing areas are.     fe went into the dressing roan for the team talk and

to be told the team and for usual pre-match preparations.      After this a number

of us went out onto the playing area to get the atmosphere and my recollection

of things at the;,time .war-, of'a. normal cup staid-firial build-up. The atmosphere

was good, I went and waved to sane supporters I knew in the West stand and

after signing a few autographs about the tunnel I went into get changed.       I

went out with a number of other players about 14.25 to 14.30 for the first

warm-up.     I stayed out about ten minutes at that time and I noticed then that

the crowd was building up well; the centre section of the Leppings Lane End

terracing was about three-quarters full and that the areas at each end were
pretty empty; particularly the area away to my right as I looked at Leppings

Tanp   that was the least full of the lot.   I went back in and then about five or

six minutes before kick-off the whole team went out, me with than, for final

warm-up to the kick-off.
 I remember that I kicked the tell and it went over, missing the goal, into

 Leppings Lane end fences.   I saw then how full it was.   I noticed again how the

 far end sections had plenty of space, especially the one away to my right as I

 stood and looked at the terraces.                                       -
 The ball was thrown back over to me and I wenti into? my normal routine .ofvwarm-up

.ajid"whenever the ball went past me I entered into banter with regular supporters 1

 and familiar fac^&tthat- 1 Recognised in the centre section at the back of the      ;

 goal i Kick-off happened and we got into our stride preity qiiickiy - we' forced a1

 corner pretty early m and the ball came down to my end      I rolled it out to the

 full back once and play went on until Peter Beardsley bit the crossbar of the

 Nottingham Forest'goal frcm a corner and came back into play.    I remember just

 after that there were shouts and screaxns from the crowd just behind mef it was ■ '

 different! not £he iardiki&y"crbwd noise and I turned around tolookr^’What        ^ 'ri

 amazed me first^wasthe ^scfeeritration and squash of fans in the centre section) '

 the end areas ^ili h M plerity of space.    It was only then I became conscious

:that the crowd was squashing forward andwasn'tableto gosidewaysand that 's "

: when I noticed the fencing'alongside than holding than in.   I saw!fans- bein^         '

 pulled up into the stand, above the terraces, I s » fans climbing over into the

 emtpy areas at 'the; side and I saw fansclimbingout over the front Sntoi^he

 pitch which was particularly difficult bemuse of the spike&~on>

 fencing but they were getting out.

 Play was still going on and I was in a terrible position trying to concentrate

 on play and having my attention taken by what was happening behind me. The ball

 came down to our end and Nottingham Forest won a corner, it was taken and we

 cleared our box area and as play was going forward over the centre line I heard a

 shout, "Bruce please help" - a desperate shout from a fan squashed up against
              the fencing to the right of my goal as I looked at Leppings Lane terraces. He

              screamed, "Please get the fucking gate open" - "Help, help".               All the people who

              could speak were pleading for help.         There were two policemen near the gate

              right alongside the fan who had shouted to me and so I shouted to them, "Get the

              gate open".     I was still trying to concentrate on play and was still having my

              attention taken by what was happening behind me - there were lots of fans on the

              pitch behind the goal area by them too.          I called again to the policemen, "Open

              the fucking gate" and one just turned away from me and looked back at the crowd

           :t..,:byit the other went to the gate and opened it and it was like taking the top off

              hour until Mr. Robinson came and told us formally the match was abandoned.                  My

     ;&      overriding feeling is that.the ticket allocation was wrong and that we should                                    '

              have been allocated the Kop end, but I feel it was unfair that it was at

Sheffield anyway having had the identical game at Sheffield last year.                                                             The

venue for replay was at Manchester United.                               I wonder why it couldn't have been

there in the first place? I was in the team the previous year at the

    semi-final, to me as I recall it was such a snooth operation although there was

    congestion at the Leppings Lane end then which tells me that the F.A. had got

    the allocations wrong then.                     The point I am emphasising in making the point

about having the semi-final at Manchester United Ground is the distance of

    travel for the fans two years in succession.. JLast year they had to^travel? all

    the way..to Sheffield and: Not^§....,Forest had. the short trip .and th^ F.A. .did the                                                                                —

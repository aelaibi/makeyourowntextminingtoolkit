            I commenced duty at Sam                 (0800)    on Saturday,         15th April,      1989     ( 150489)

            at West Bar Police Station,                  working Sam         (0800)   k   8pm    (2000)     in

            connection with the P ol ic in g a r ra n ge m en t s              for the FA Cup Semi-Final

            Football    m atch between Liverpool                FC and N o t ti n gh a m Forest FC to be

            held at H i l l s b o ro u gh Stadium.            I a t t en d ed a briefing at 9am             (0900),

            held at West Bar P.S.              and deployed my officers at 9.4 5 a m                    (0945).



            I was officer          in charge        of six serials          of one ser           t and ten

            constables,       whose      duties      concerned N o t ti n gh a m F               fans a rr iving at

            the Midl an d R a il w ay St^iTon.               A number       of double     deck PSVs were

            available,       on call       Vo pick up fans as they left the station,                         and when

            each was    full a Police Officer,                 sometimes       two or three        depending         on

            the f a n s 5 behaviours,          was deputed to a c co mp an y the bus               to    i t ’s
                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                              S3530

de st in a t i on at Hi I Isborough.                 The    initial    scheme was       for one officer

to a cc o m p an y each bus,            to    return wit h the empty bus to the Mi dl an d

S ta t i o n and take another                load - this was          to    continue    until      such time

as    1 judged that            traffic       conditions and time             remaining were             such that

the officer              could not hope        to    return to the M i dl an d S t at i on before                       the

last fans had gone               to the stadium.              When this occurred,             officers were

instructed to              remain at H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium,         to rejoin their

respective          serials,       and to form the             reserve      in the gymnasiurn.                They

were also          to take      their meals          there.      A similar ope ra ti on           involving an

Inspector and five               serials       was to take        place      in respect       of Liverpool

fans,      but that         Inspector        was    to    remain at West Bar to take               initial

control        of the M i dl an d S t at i on after             the match whilst         I was          to go to

H i l l s b o r o u gh   to take      charge       of the    reserve.



1 remained at the M i dl a nd S t at io n until                     the     late arrival        of the         last

train and forty plus fans                     from Hull       and then       I t ravelled wit h the

SYT    team      in an otherwise             empty bus to the          stadium.        The    bus went             by

way of Leppings Lane,                  between 2 . 55pm         (1455)      and 3pm    (1500),          and    I

could see that the area                  in f r o n t y ^ V the turnstiles was               f u l l.     I left

the bus at the junction of L e^ pings Lane and P en istone Roa d and

spoke      briefly wit h C /jI ns p ^ U R D Y and other                officers at that

location.            It was at ytp&t time                I heard radio transmissions

suggesting          there might         be a disaster           if something was         not done.                 I

made my way alone along Pen is to ne Roa d towards                             the ground and while

doing      so heard further             tra ns mi ss io ns      directing all         officers          to the

ground - there was               no    indication of what             the    problem was.



X entered the ground and made my way directly between the S pion Hop

and    the W orth S ta nd where               I met
                                                                            I*3,3,
                                                          Ins pecTor R I L b Y , a member         of the

D i s c i p l i n e and Com pl ai nt         staff.        I remained with him for a minute as                            I
                                                                                                                             PAGE          3
                                                                                                                             S3530

                  looked towards              the L ap pings Lane               stand and terrace and             I could see

                  people        climbing          from that       terracing           up to the stand.       I coaid see           lots

                  of people           round       the fencing        of the terracing but                it was    not

                  possible to see                 why -- I believed              it was     fighting and a pitch invasion.

                  The     radio was          useless at this                 point,   you    could neither       hear a nything

                  or transmit and                 I left    Insp R ILEY and walked down the                  perimeter        track

                  to the L a ppings               Lane    end.



                  As    I got       closer        I saw    people and Police Officers                   trying    to tear down

                  the     perimeter          fence,       as well       as     people      climbing up into       the stand.           I

                  still        couldn't       c omprehend what was                 happening and why.            Closer     still

                  I saw        people       in distress          next    to the fencing and o m K o r             two Police

                  Of fi c e r s     got over        the fence        into       the crowd a n d / s e g a n to assist the

                  and     said      “This     o n e ’s dead."           I instructed the Officer and others

                  nearby to                 i s t , to help get          the body out on to the field.                    This was

           simple     cordon behind the goal and keep people                       off the field and those

           on the terrace where             they were and this was               relatively       easy where      I

           was standing        but   I found that          I could exercise         no effective       control        ~

           people were shocked,             upset and seemed             to want   to remain       in small

           groups     talking.       As    I went further a fi e ld to get officers                  to join the

           cordon,     those    in it w an de r ed off         . . „ it was as      if everyone was dazed

           about what       had occurred.              There w a s , however,      no real     urge nc y by this

           time and     I remained on the               pitch or the terrace,          until      such time as        I

           heard the match was             to be a b a n d o n e d .     I went to the Police Room,

           telep h o n e d m atch    control and          received       permission to carry on w ith all

           my officers as        per our         instructions          for the   return of fans       on the

           buses    to the M i dl an d R a il w ay Station.               I went   back on to the       pitch,

           collected as man y officers as                  possible       for my serials and         resumed duty

           outside     the ground.          Having       set the ope ra ti on      in m ot io n    I left   the

           v i c inity of the stadium and went                 directly to the M id lands Station,

           where    I remained until             the    last special       train had    left.       I finished

           duty at 8pm       <2000).

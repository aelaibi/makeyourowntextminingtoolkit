I am a Chief Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police and am currently

the Divisional Commander of the Barnsley Division of the Force.

I was appointed a Constable in the Sheffield City Police in October 1963                          and

served in Uniform and CID Duties as Constable and Detective Sergeant, until

1974 when I was promoted to the rank of Inspector.

For   a period    of    two   years   I   served    as   Staff   Officer    to   the   then   Chief

Constables and during that time had responsibility for the planning of major

events in the form of Royal visits, in liaison with the Lord Lieutenant of the

County and had a particular responsibility for War Duties.

In 1976 I was promoted to Chief Inspector and posted as Deputy Sub Divisional

Commander to the Sheffield Central Division (D1 Sub Division) where I remained

in post until 1979.          During my time in the Sheffield Central Division, I was

responsible for the policing of football matches at Sheffield United Football

Ground     and   for   the    planning     and     arrangement     of     various   marches       and

demonstrations associated with normal City life.

In 1979 I again        transferred    to the Research & Development Department with

particular responsibility for planning public order training and policy.

In the October of that year I was promoted to Superintendent and appointed as

head of the newly formed Operations Division.

Almost   immediately     upon    appointment     the     Steel   Strike   commenced    and    I   was

responsible for Police operations and planning in connection with that matter.

During that time I had particular involvement at the Hatfields Steel Works,
which was the scene of much disorder and heavy picketting.

In D&o&mber 1981, I transferred from the Operations Division and returned to

the Sheffield Central Sub Division as Sub Divisional Commander and again had

some responsibility for football matches and marches and demonstrations in the

City Centre.

In the March of 1982, I took up the post of Detective Superintendent in charge

of   the   Criminal     Investigation Department          in   the Sheffield North      Division.

However,    within 3 months I was appointed the Deputy Divisional Commander of

that Division.

I remained as the Deputy Divisional Commander until October 1985 when I was

promoted     to   the    rank    of    Chief    Superintendent     and   appointed     Divisional

Commander of the Division where I remained until the 27 March 1989, when I was

transferred as Divisional Commander to the Barnsley Division.

During my time in the Sheffield North Division, as Deputy Divisional Commander

and Divisional Commander, I was deeply involved in the planning and command of

operations associated with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and in fact in

1987 was    the Officer commanding the              seYni final between Coventry City and

Leeds United and in 1988 the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

In addition, in 1984 during the Miners dispute, I was involved in the policing

of picket lines in Nottinghamshire,              Orgreave,     Doncaster and Barnsley and at

times took control of the Force Control Room dealing with the deployment of

personnel to picketting situations.

So far as both the 1987 and 1988 semi finals are concerned, I was directly

responsible for         the planning and       liaison    with   the management   of Sheffield

Wednesday    Football     Club   and    the    Football   Association.     On   both   occasions

negotiations were entered into concerning the allocation of seating areas to

opposing fans and the decision was taken that one team would be allocated the

South Side and the Kop and the other team the North Side and the West Side and
Leppings Lane Terraces.           This decision was based on the geographical location

of   the   Stadium    and   was    in   an   effort    to     ensure   complete    segregation      of

supporters to prevent confrontation and public disorder.                       Consideration was

given to other methods of deployment, but on balance it was felt that this was

the most appropriate separation.

In   connection     with both     the semi    final     in 1987    and 1988,      this policy      was

followed and the operations were succesfful.

In 1989 during the week prior to Monday 20 March 1989, I was approached by Mr

Graham McKrell       the Secretary of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,                       who

indicated that once again he might be asked to stage the semi final, possibly

between    Liverpool    and Nottingham Forest.              He asked    if I would be       able    to

confirm    that   we could Police such an             event   and I indicated       that   we would

receive any proposal        in a favourable manner should              the situation arise.          I

again indicated that        if          we did          stage that event,         I would ask that the same

segregation procedures were utilised as in previous years and that                         Liverpool

would be allocated the North Stand, West Stand and Leppings Lane Terraces and

Nottingham Forest the Kop and South Stand as in the previous year.

On Monday 20 March 1989, I was again contacted by Mr McKrell who confirmed that

he had been asked by the Football Association to stage the semi final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.             He did say that the Football Association had

asked if the allocation of seats could be reversed in that they would like more

facilities for Liverpool fans.           I once again pointed          out the reasons for the

decision    taken     the   previous year        and     after    confirmation       of    the   ACC

(Operations) Mr w W Jackson,            I confirmed that there was no possibility of

change and that that was the only manner in which I would be prepared to Police

such an event.      Mr McKrell indicated that he would have to take the matter back

to the Football Association before the final decision was reached

I believe it was later that same day that Mr McKrell contacted me and said that




                                                 3
the Football Association had accepted the position and that we would be asked

to Police the semi final on, the, 15 April 1989 and that the ticket allocations

would be in accordance with our plans of the previous year.

As a consequence of this information               I spoke   to Superintendent Murray and

Inspector Sewell      at Hammerton Road Police Station and at 3pm that day made

arrangements for a meeting to be called for Wednesday 22 March 1989 in order

that early planning discussions for the event could take place.

Conscious of the fact that I was scheduled to take command of a n e w Division

on the 27 March 1989,           I called upon    the proposed new Divisional Commander,

Chief Superintendent D G Duckenfield, to attend that meeting in order that

continuity might remain and he could continue with the planning which would be

in his domain.      The meeting took place at 10am on 22 March 1989 at Hammerton

Road Police Station and involved all interested parties, including the heads

of Operations and Traffic Division, the Senior Officers who would be involved

in the operation, the Support Staff responsible for preparing the Operational

Order and representatives of British Rail, Public Transport and the Highways

Authority of the County Council.

At that meeting initial plans were made concerning action to be taken and in

particular consideration was given             to the mode of travel of supporters and

representation was made by the British Rail representatives for Liverpool to

be brought into the Midland Station in the City Centre and Nottinghamshire to

the Wadsley Bridge Station in the North of Sheffield. Such action would defeat

the segregation plans in that supporters would be crossing each other and I

indicated    that   this would not       be   acceptable and asked      the British Rail      to

reconsider    the   matter.        The   reasons   for   their   request   were   based     upon

management difficulties in routing and time scheduling trains.                 It was further

agreed at that meeting that the Operations and Traffic Division would take

responsibility      for   all    traffic   matters   affecting    the   City   and   that    'D'
D ivision, the Central Division,               would be responsible for policing their own

area    leaving      the match    itself       to    be     the responsibility          of the Divisional

Commander of the Sheffield North Division.                       The meeting closed at 11am and I

took no further part in the planning meetings concerning this matter.

Following upon        the meeting I spoke              to Superintendent Murray                and Inspector

Sewell concerning the manpower levels used at the previous year's event and

asked       them   to examine    the position for             this   year and         to determine if any

reductions or increases were appropriate, taking into account our findings the

previous year.         The findings the previous year indicated that some Officers

were under employed and I was              conscious           of the need not           to repeat such a

situation if that was the case and if there were no other factors which might

dictate      their need    for    this   future match.               The   only       other   action   I took

concerning this matter was to maintain liaison with Mr McKrell during the next

few days and in particular to make reference to the need for clear indications

of tickets by colour coding and appropriate colour coded systems on turnstyles

to ensure easily recognisable access to the Stadium.

In    the    knowledge    that    Mr   Duckenfield           would   be    commanding         this   event,    I

personally selected the Sector Commanders who would be working to him and as

in the previous year utilised the system of using three sectors,                                 those being

the Ground,        the Liverpool supporters outside the ground and the Nottingham

supporters outside the ground.             In this connection I selected Superintendent

Greenwood as the Ground Controller, Superintendent Marshall to be responsible

for the Liverpool supporters and Superintendent Chapman to be responsible for

the   Nottingham      supporters.        All        three    Officers      had    a   wide    experience      in

policing football matches and in fact had been Sector Commanders at the semi

final   the previous      year.        The only difference was that Mr Marshall                        and Mr

Greenwood reversed roles           and   this was because Mr Marshall, having been my

Deputy for some time, had a better knowledge of the visiting supporters end of
the ground,       ie Leppings Lane,           than Mr Greenwood, who had been away from the

Division     for    some      time    albeit       for many      years       he    had       policed         matches    at

Hillsborough.            In   addition,       Superintendent            Murray         was    identified         as    the

Officer in charge of the ground control communications and this Officer was in

fact the man who regularly took up that position at First Division matches

throughout the season.

Prior   to   my    departure         from    'F'    Division      I met       with       Chief      Superintendent

Duckenfield        and   discussed      with       him    in   general       the problems               on    Division.

During that discussion the semi final was touched upon and I appraised him of

the staff selected            and    the fact       that M r Murray was examining the manpower

situation.

On the day of the semi final, Saturday 15 April 1989, I had no role to play in

the operation and was policing my own Division at Barnsley.

At   approximately        3.30pm      that    day    I   was    en route          on    the Ml motorway from

Barnsley     to    Sheffield        when,     on    local      radio,    I    heard          of   difficulties         at

Sheffield     Wednesday        Football       Ground.          The   reporter           did       not   seem     unduly

concerned and spoke of a delay in the match due to a pitch invasion.                                              As my

journey progressed, it became clear from the radio reports that the incident

was more serious and there was some indication of possible fatalities.                                            Calls

were being made for doctors to attend at the Stadium and a short time later I

heard   an   appeal      for   Police        Officers       to respond        to Hammerton              Road     Police

Station.     It was approximately 4pm at this time and I immediately responded to

Hammerton Road Police Station, arriving at approximately 4.20pm.

On arrival,       I saw numerous            uniformed Police Officers in the Station area,

including Chief Inspector McRob b ie .                   I immediately went to the Control Room

and contacted Chief Superintendent Duckenfield in the Police Control Room at

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club via the internal telephone system.                                            I asked

Mr Duckenfield if I could be of any assistance to him and he asked if I could
 deploy uniformed Officers into the Leppings Lane area on foot and in an effort

 to calm supporters leaving the ground and show compassion for their apparent

 feelings of distress.

 I immediately went to the Canteen at Hammerton Road Police Station with Chief

 Inspector McRobbie and organised units of men in serials under the command of

 Sergeants and briefed them as to the information in my possession concerning

 the   current      situation.     I then deployed              Units   to locations      in and around

 Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground and Chief Inspector McRobbie dealt with

 the notation       of deployment.       At       this       time also present was Superintendent

Mordew     and      after   deployment        I        obtained      transport    and    together   with

Superintendent        Mordew     attended         at    Sheffield       Wednesday     Football   Ground,

approaching from Middlewood Road into Leppings Lane.                             On reaching Parkside

Road I saw that Leppings Lane was heavily congested by football supporters and

a large number of fire engines.                   I alighted from the car and began on foot

towards the Stadium and there met Chief Inspector Waring.                            The crowd was dense

and I would generally describe the attitude of supporters as hostile towards

the Police.


I spoke briefly to Chief Inspector Waring and he confirmed that he had little

or no difficulty at that location and the crowds were gradually dispersing.




Together     with    Superintendent   Mordew,            I    then   turned   into    the private   road

leading to the back of the South Stand and on entering that area through the

gates I saw an area of sheeted rails adjacent to the riverside and noted a

number of bodies laid out in that location.                          I was approached by Detective

Inspector Webster who informed me in fact                       that there were eleven bodies at

that location and he further informed me that there were a further 74 in the

Gymnasium.

Prior to this point the magnitude of the situation had not been known to me and
I immediately made my way through                     'C' Gate into the West Stand enclosure and

into     the   Police        Control    Room        where,      on   arrival,    I   found Assistant       Chief

Constable        (Operations)           Mr     Jackson,          Chief      Superintendent      Duckenfield,

Superintendent          Marshall,       Superintendent               Murray,    Police     Sergeant   Goddard,

Police Constable Ryan and Police Constale Bishard.                              At this point I noted that

the ground was relatively empty, with the exception of a f e w supporters in and

around      the Leppings Lane end,                Press in the Press Box and officials on the

playing area.

I noted that messages were being received on the radio and were being dealt

with by the Control Sergeant and PC and in general they related to outbreaks

of disorder and sporadic fighting in and around the Stadium.                                My attention was

particularly drawn to Superintendent Marshall and Superintendent Murray, who

both seemed          to be    extremely       distressed.             ACC M r Jackson was attempting to

speak to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Marshall and at

some point a telephone call was received and was answered by Mr Jackson.                                   From

the nature of the conversation,                     I formed the opinion that it was a call from

the    Chief    Constable.         Mr     Jackson         was    attempting     to   ask    questions     of   Mr

Duckenfield and M r Marshall and relate them down the telephone.                               I remained in

the Control Room and listened to what was taking place through the messages

and noted that the main communications handset was not being utilised, but

that personal radios were being used on talk-through facility. At about 5.15pm

M r Jackson indicated he was to go to Headquarters with Mr Duckenfield and Mr

Marshall       and    informed     me        that    he    had       made   arrangements     for   Det    Chief

Superintendent Addis to deal with mortuary arrangements in the Gymnasium and

had given certain instructions to Chief Superintendent Nesbit concerning the

welfare of Officers and their stand-down arrangements. He asked that I remain

at    the   Ground     with    a   view      to     finalising        any   outstanding     matters      and   to

eventually close down the operation.                         Throughout this time we were visited by
Fire     and    Ambulance          Senior      Officers          and   1   recall       Mr        Don   Page,   the   Chief

Ambulance Officer, and Mr Harry Wright the Chief Fire Officer, both calling at

the Control Box.

I noticed that a Fire Officer was in fact standing at the top of the steps

leading to the Control Room overseeing the Leppings Lane Terraces. Mr Jackson

and     Mr     Duckenfield         and       Mr    Marshall        then     left       the        Control    Room     and   I

immediately          asked    for an update from                  the Sector Commanders in the form of

Superintendent             Chapman      at     the    Nottingham           side    of       the     Stadium     and   Chief

Inspector Waring at the Leppings Lane area of the Stadium.                                              It was clear that

there    was some disorder and no doubt                            as a consequence                of the attitude of

supporters and I instructed that all personnel                                    remain on duty and that the

mobile units, named Tango Units, remain ready and available.

Responses were given to numerous incidents of fighting, but in the fullness of

time calm was restored.

I recall that trains had left the area, as had coaches which were released from

their coach parks and whilst I have no real recollection of time, I recall that

when the situation was calm I made my way to the Gymnasium,                                             leaving Sergeant

Goddard        in    the    Control       Room       and    there      examined             the    temporary     Mortuary

facilities accommodating some 85 bodies.                               There was some natural confusion,

but in general things were in order and Detective Chief Superintendent Addis

was controlling the Mortuary aspect.                             I spoke to a number of Officers who were

clearly in shock and were distressed by events which they had experienced.                                                  I

noted    that       the    temporary Mortuary               was    located in          the Gymnasium,           which was

separated into three sections,                       the first section containing the bodies,                           the

second       section       being    a    relative          sterile     area       where       Police       Officers    were

accommodated and the third section had been set up for identification purposes

and statement taking by CID O ff icers. A separate section had been created for

identification            purposes       and      this     was    adjacent        to    a    separate       office    where
relatives could view bodies in relative privacy.

I formed the opinion that arrangements were well organised and that temporary

Mortuary     facilities      were    well   in       hand.      During    this   time   I did meet Det

Superintendent McKay and noted that he too was in some way distressed by the

events.

Following the visit to the Gymnasium,                   I checked the remainder of the Stadium

and made my way to the Directors area of the Sheffield Wednesday Club situate

in the underside of the South Stand,                    and there saw Graham McKrell the Club

Secretary.        Some members of the staff were clearly distressed and I advised Mr

McKrell regarding counselling facilities for junior members and the need to

ensure that medical facilities were available.

During these conversations Mr McKrell informed me that he had details of the

computer print-outs regarding turnstyle figures at 3pm and that he had seized

them and placed them in his safe (drawer).

Having satisfied myself that things were in order in the Stadium, I resumed

duty the Control Box and then sought security of the terrace subject of the

disaster.

Through     Superintendent        Mordew    I    arranged       for   Officers    to    be   deployed   to

security of the centre pens with the intention of 1) preserving evidence and

2)   recovering property          subject       of    those who had been         injured or who were

deceased.

I noted that numerous Officers were assembling in the North Stand ready for

debrief     and    because   of     their   general          condition    authorised    Superintendent

Mordew and Superintendent Brookfield, who had also attended                              the scene,     to

debrief Officers and ensure that Serial Sergeants could confirm that all their

Officers were accounted for and to note their whereabouts during the events.

In addition,       some Officers who had responded to Operation Support were in the

locality and having consulted with                   'D ' Division,      the Central Division of the
Force,     I arranged for two Sergeants and 20 Constables to be organised for

deployment        to        'D ' Division      who         were       suffering          some    potential        disorder

scenes.

Once      debrief      facilities       had    been        dealt       with,       I    instructed       Superintendent

Mordew to stand down those Officers who were no longer required.

Having     yet    again       assessed      the situation              in the vicinity             of the ground,           I

instructed that Tango Units,                  the mobile units on public order duties, should

remain     on    patrol       and    also     liaise       with       Inspector          Hand-Davis, the             Mounted

Inspector, that his Officers should remain on patrol in pairs in an around the

Ground.

I was informed that relative were in the vicinity of the Ground with a view to

identification and was advised that accommodation and planning had been put

into being for identification of the deceased.

Having experienced the stress placed upon Officers and families in and around

the temporary m or t ua r y, I was conscious of the considerable stress placed upon

Officers and arranged for the Force Welfare Officer,                                                                   to be

called out for counselling reasons.

I was conscious of the fact that social workers and members of the Church and

Salvation Army had been requested to attend at the scene to assist with the

counselling of relatives.

I   was   of    the    opinion       that   there      would          be    some       considerable       delay      in   the

identification of bodies and in the retention on duty of Officers who were

allocated to each body for identification p ur p os e s. In view of this, I caused

feeding     arrangements            to be put    in hand              for    those Officers             who   were    to be

retained, pending identification of individual deceased persons.

At approximately 9.30pm the Chief Constable, Mr Peter Wright, attended at the

scene and I met him              and   toured     the area of the disaster with him.                                  I was

informed       that    at    approximately       10.15pm              that night         Mr     Colin    Monaghan,        the




                                                       -    11    -
Minister of State for Sport,             was scheduled to arrive by helicopter at the

Stadium and arrangements were being made for him to be met.

My   recollection     is     that   at   approximately   10.30pm    the   Minister     arrived,

accompanied    by    Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.             Together with      the Chief

Constable and other Officers, I showed Mr Monaghan the scene and described to

him the facilities at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

Shortly after this, an impromptu press conference took place on the pitch with

television and other media representatives and Mr Moynaghan was then taken to

the Gymnasium where he spoke to Officers concerning their involvement in the

day's events.       He later left the scene.

At approximately midnight the staff of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

departed from the Stadium and I arranged for security of the Gymnasium area to

protect the temporary Mortuary facilities.               Arrangements were made for the

reception    of relatives      for identification purposes         and social      workers    and

members of the Church were briefed to expect relatives attending in distressed

situations.        These    representatives    were   readily    available   throughout       the

night and in fact met numerous relatives and remained with them throughout the

identification procedures.

I remained    in    the    vicinity   of the Gymnasium    throughout      the night    and    was

present   through     many    identifications    of   deceased    persons    and   noted     many

extremely harrowing situations regarding grieving relatives and the effects

upon Police involved.          Throughout these procedures Inspector John Charles,

Detective Policewoman Sandra Lewyn, Police Constable Jean Shelton, maintained

records   of the deceased persons and liaised constantly with Superintendent

Torr in charge of the casualty bureau arrangements.

Throughout these events I noted that the Ambulance Liaison Officer was present

in the temporary Mortuary and at one stage I asked if he could increase the

number of mobile stretchers available to speed up the identification process.

         The Ambulance              Liaison         Officer was most helpful                  in    this connection and was

         extremely professions.! in his duties.                            The process of identification continued

         until approximately 5am, when arrangements were made for the remainder of the

         bodies to be removed to the City Mortuary where the process would be continued

         later in the day.

         During the course of events during the evening, the Coroner, M r Stefan Popper,

         attended         the      scene          together   with        Professor         Alan     Usher,     who    both     viewed

         arrangements            and        confirmed      the    location           of    bodies    at   the       Sheffield     City

        Mortuary.

        At     approximately                5.30am I      left    the     Sheffield         Wednesday        Football      Club    and

        returned to Hammerton Road Police Station, where I confirmed that all Officers

        involved          in     the        operation     other         than       those    connected        with    the   deceased

        persons, had been stood down and were accounted for.

        I retired from duty at approximately 6am and resumed duty at 8am that same day

        at Police Headquarters.

        I wish to place on record my considerable appreciation of the efforts of all

        individuals involved                      in   this matter,           and in particular           the efforts of the

        Officers         involved            in    dealing      with     the       traumatic        events    of     dealing      with

        identification of families of deceased pe r s o n s , the Social Services and Church

        representatives                 and        the   Ambulance            Service       who     maintained         a   presence

        throughout the night.

        I am satisfied that every effort was made to project the professionalism of

        all    the     Emergency            Services      and    from my           experiences have no reservation in

        confirming their dedication to service to the Community.

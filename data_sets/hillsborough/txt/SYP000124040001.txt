THE LINE OF POLICE ACROSS THENPITCN WAS IN MY OPINION VASTLY OVER MANNED.        FOR

THE NUMBERS OF INJURED AND DAZE d N&UPPORTERS ON THE PITCH, MOST OF THE POLICE

LINE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELPING AT THE LEPPINGS LN END INSTEAD OF JUST STANDING

ON THE HALFWAY LINE.     THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION NOBODY KNEW WHAT TO DO,

INCLUDING POLICE OFFICERS.

 WERE HAVING GREAT DIFFICULTY EVEN AT THAT TIME, AND THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING TO

 GET KILLED,    IF THEY DIDN ’T OPEN THE SAFETY GATE AND LET PEOPLE OUT.   I BELIEVE

 THAT THE POLICE COULD HEAR CLEARLY WHAT WE WERE SHOUTING, THEY WERE LOOKING AT

 THE CROWD AND OBVIOUSLY SAW PEOPLE IN DISTRESS, THEY TOOK NO ACTION AND JUST

 CONTINUED PATROLLING THE TRACK.     WHEN I WAS OUT ON THE PITCH THERE WAS A LACK

 OF MEDICAL ATTENTION.

Q '17
        %

 G49.         DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS,

 OR THE INJURIES TO ANY FERi

 (1)         PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING FOR 'NjEL.P BUT IT WA SN ’T FORTHCOMING - THE ORGANISER

 &    THE POLICE DID N’T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

 (2)         LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN POL^QE_j3/STEWARDS -- AT 1440 WHEN I WENT IN

 THE TERRACES, THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY AT CAPACITY BUT NONE OF THE ORGANISERS

 SEEMED TO BE AWARE.

 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPOX?

 •1.        THE FIRST PA ANNOUNCEMENT WAS AT 13^5 -- VjHEN DALGLISH CAME ON.

 4)         THE FANS WERE SHOWING MORE INITIATIVETHEN THE POLICE - SOME OF THEM WERE

 PULLING HOARDINGS DOWN DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO STRETCHERS, BUT THE

 POLICE SEEMED SLOW TO REACT.

 Q54.         IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 •1.        COMPARED WITH THE LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER GROUNDS I HAVE BEEN TO OVER THE

 LAST 2 SEASONS, THE ORGANISATION OF MATCHES AT HILLSBOROUGH BY THE POLICE

 LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED.

 2.         WHY WERE THERE SO MANY SETS OF ROADWORKS ON THE APPROACH TO HILLSBOROUGH

 A SEMI-FINAL WILL ONLY TAKE PLACE ONCE A YEAR.

 3.     THE FA WERE AT FAULT AS REGARDS TO THE TICKET ALLOCATION FOR L I V E R P O O L „
       *
 4.     ’THE CONDUCT OF THE PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS WAS NOTHING SHORT OF ANIMAL - LIKE

 BEHAVIOUR PHOTOGRAPHING PEOPLE WHO WERE IN DISTRESS OR INJURED OR EVEN

 DECEASED.     PROFESSIONALISM GOES SO FAR - A LINE MUST BE DRAWN AT WHICH YOUR

 JOB IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS HELPING SOMEONE WHO IS IN NEED OF HELP.

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER T O W    A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

THERE WERE A COUPLE OF ,SCUFFLES, AND LIVERPOOL CHARGED NOTTINGHAM ONCE

BECAUSE THEY WERE CHANTING, BUT THE LINE OF POLICE STOPPED THAT.

G53

DID YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

ITS DIFFICULT TO SAY^AS I WAS TRAPPED.

054

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU W I ^ k T
                                   'VO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS
JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

I WOULD SAY IT WOULD HELP IF THE PUBS ABOUND THE GROUND WERE KEPT SHUT,       I

TfflNK QUITE A FEW HAD BEEN FOR a DRINK                   DRUNK BUT IT MAKES THEM

LATE TO GET INTO THE GROUND     I THINK     WOUL          D IDEA IF THE REFEREE

HAD SOME SORT OF 5WALK IE TALKIE5, THAT                   E DELAYED THE MATCH

STARTING, THAT WOULD HAVE SAVED SOME                       I WOULD SAY THAT THERE

WAS NOT ENOUGH POLICE OR STEWARDS PRESENT, THAT,    IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR

INCIDENT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT.     WHEN THE CRUSH STARTED AT 2.57PM

(1457) I WAS TRAPPED UNTIL 3.25PM (1525),    I COULDN'T MOVE AT ALL EXCEPT

FOR MY FEET, HANDS AND HEAD ALL YOU COULD HEAR WAS THE GROANS, CRIES

FOR HELP AND PEOPLE PLEADING TO PULL THE FENCE DOWN.       WHEN I DID

      FREE THE POLICE WERE STILL TELLING PEOPLE TO GET BACK, BUT ONCE THEY *D

CLIMBED SO FAR OVER THE FENCE THEY WERE PULLING THEM OUT, THE POLICE WERE

CONFUSED THEY DIDN’T KNOW WHAT TO DO.     ONCE I WAS OVER THE FENCE THEY ASKED

ME TO GET OUT OF THE WAY AND GO TO THE CENTRE OF THE PITCH.     EVERYONE WAS

VERY WILLING TO HELP EACH OTHER ON THE PITCH.

 PREVENTED IF MORE POLICE HAD ORGANISED THE CROWD.

David Riley - Police Inspector - Discipline and Complaints Dept

I reported for duty at Hillsborough at 9.40 am and attended the briefing
in the North Stand which commenced at 9.45 am.

I was responsible to Chief Inspector Beal and Inspector Sewell directly.

My duty was to be available to deal with complaints against police, standing
by in plain clothes at the football ground using the gymnasium as a base.
Between 11.30 am and 2.50 pm I patrolled outside the ground in order to be
able to give an accurate picture of the behaviour and mood of spectators
should the need arise.

Between 11.30 am and 1.15 pm I patrolled on foot and unaccompanied along
Halifax Road and up Leppings Lane to the junction with Catchbar Lane and
back.

The ground on this route appeared to be occupied mainly by Liverpool
supporters.  Generally their conduct was very good but many of them were
under the influence of drink and were sat or stood about drinking from cans
or 2 litre bottles of lager.  Although well behaved the mood was volatile.
I had occasion to speak to two Liverpool supporters whose behaviour was so
boisterous that they stood out in the well behaved crowd.  Although very
boisterous the conduct of the two did not amount to an offence.  Immediately
after I had spoken to the two youths Chief Inspector Sumner also spoke to
them apparently to reinforce my warning.  This was at about 12.45 pm.

I took a meal in the gymnasium at about 1.30 pm then at about 2 pm returned
to Halifax Road.  There were still numbers of supporters sat about drinking
on both sides of Halifax Road.

At about 2.40 pm large numbers of Nottingham Forest supporters were
converging on the Kop end of the ground.  The majority appeared to be
arriving from Herries Road.  They were not well behaved and appeared to have
been drinking heavily.  Many crossed the road without regard for the traffic
and against the direction of a special constable directing traffic.   I had
occasion to speak to one youth who kicked at a passing bus.  Two men were
arrested near to the turnstiles by uniformed officers.

In the main the conduct of these supporters arriving late was worse than
that of the Liverpool supporters I had seen.  Having said that, on arrival
at the ground, they appeared to be passing through the turnstiles in an
orderly manner.

I went into the ground by the large gates leading to the gymnasium at about
2.55 pm-  At this time Nottingham Forest supporters, who appeared mostly
the worse for drink, were still arriving mainly from the direction of Herries
Road.

The Liverpool supporters who had been sitting drinking along Halifax Road
had g o n e .

I went into the gymnasium where a number of uniformed officers were taking
refreshment.  I had been there for a few minutes when Chief Inspector Sumner
came in and called all the uniformed officers out to go onto the track.

At this stage I do not think anybody had any idea that there were casualties
and officers thought it was a pitch invasion.

I went to the pitch and stood near the Kop.   I saw a number of Liverpool
supporters running about on the pitch.   The players had already left the
field.  I saw one Liverpool supporter run the full length of the field from
Leppings Lane to the Kop.   He stood in the goalmouth in front of the Kop
gesticulating at the Nottingham Forest supporters with both arms raised and
making two finger gestures.   On being approached by three special constables
the youth ran back towards the Leppings Lane end but was arrested in
mid-field by PC Brougham.   There was a cordon of uniformed officers across
the field at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

At this stage I was unaware of casualties and still thought it was a pitch
invasion.  I anticipated the match continuing when order had been restored.

I thought there would be trouble between rival supporters after the match
and thought I would be very late off duty.  I then went to use a public phone
to alter arrangements I had made for that evening.

On returning to the gymnasium at about 3-20 pm I was horrified to see bodies
being taken into the gymnasium.  I assisted in keeping order in the area
outside the gymnasium for a short time and then assisted with the handling
of bodies in the gymnasium.

At 6.30 pm some officers were being stood down.  I then spoke to Inspector
Sewell and informed him I was prepared to stay as long as required.  At this
stage I was not engaged in any particular role and as by this time everything
was under control I was no longer required to assist and it was agreed I
should go off duty.

During the time I was patrolling outside the ground I was approached on
numerous occasions by Liverpool supporters asking for tickets.

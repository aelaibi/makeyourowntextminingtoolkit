without           discarding              the     cans         as    they were         only     70 yards

from        the       ground.

Because           of       the; g r e a t      numbers          involved          it w a s     the    only

practical              solution           although             not     very     satisfactory.

Visited           several           times        by    Inspector            Burdis       and PS       Venables.

Neither           PC       Vallance         nor       I had a          radio      to m o n i t o r    o t h er

incidents.

Remained              in    position           until       3    pm w h e n      the    traffic        island

and      nearby            park     walls        were      littered with               hundreds        of

c an s      of    beer        and    lager.

Some        spectators              were       s t i ll    arriving           from     both     te am s,       many

were        worse          for    d ri n k .

Entered           th e      ground and            i n i t i a l l y we        were     h e l d at     the      si de    o

the      North         Stand.

There           was    a    lot     of    activity             of P o l i c e     Officers       but      at     this

time        the       position was               not      c l e a r , in fact          it wa s       very

c onfused.

With        a    la r g e     number        of    colleagues               entered       the    playing          area

where           I could          see w h a t      I thought             was     a ground        invasion          from

t he     Leppings             Lane       end.         Some      officers          were    directed          to    that

end.            With       others        I was        ordered          by a S e n i o r      Officer        to    stan

As     we       did    this       stretcher            cases         began arriving             from      the

Leppings              Lane       end,     to     reach         the     ambulances         at    the    rear       of

the North Stand, but because of the sheer numbers the

alleway door became blocked and people were put on the

ground in front of the Kop.

Civilians were tearing up advertising boards to make

even more stretchers.

In the meantime the Nottingham Forest supporters became

restless and a volatile atmosphere built up.   There was

no information forthcoming and I believe Nottingham

Forest supporters believed as I had that it was a ground

invasion caused by the Liverpool supporters.

Initially Nottingham Forest were cheering and clapping

the stretcher cases.

I was ordered on two separate occasions by a uniform

Superintendent to keep facing the Kop and watch the

Nottingham Forest fans.   As bodies amassed by us this

became more and more difficult.

At one stage, about 20 Liverpool fans annoyed at

Nottingham Forest fans attitude made a charge towards the

Kop.

Several officers including myself managed to contain

them and direct them back towards Leppings Lane.

At this stage I was ordered by a uniform Inspector to

form part of a cordon across one halfway line to prevent

a further charge from Liverpool fans.

The PA appealed for calm but the situation was confused

with people wandering in dazed, angry and injured

conditions.

I remained in the cordon for some considerable time.

At one stage Kenny Dalglish appealed for order and to

co-operate with the emergency services and clear the

pitch.

Eventually a calmer atmosphere began to take over and

the PA announced the game had been abandoned.

People began to leave the ground.

I was ordered out onto Penistone Road to assist.

As we left we were booed by the North Stand occupants

and clapped by the Nottingham Forest fans.

Returned to North Stand and eventually stood down to

Claywheels Lane.

alleway          door       became         blocked         and    people       were         put    on    the

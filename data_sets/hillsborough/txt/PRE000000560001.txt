                       you'll find both tests and reviews of                                      great picture. Only you can do that.
        We would like to demonstrate a remarkable new
aerobics shoe.
        Well actually, we’d really like you to demonstrate it.
        It won’t take long and it’ll require a little imagination,
but if you don’t come to the conclusion that this shoe is
better than any other oh the market, our name’s not Reebok.
        Ready? Then here goes.
        Put on the shoes you normally use for aerobics.
Go through a short exercise programme that involves
some dance aerobic and both high and low-impact aerobics.
Now, remember how your feet feel.
        Next, try it again. But this time, do it in a pair of the
Reebok Aerobic 6000’s you see below.
        (Since you haven’t yet bought a pair, this is the part
where you’ll need to use your imagination.)
        Even when you put them on they feel a little different,
don’t they ? (That’s because they’re purpose-built for the
serious aerobics enthusiast.)
        Right. Now go through exactly the same exercise routine.
        And how did your feet feel this time ?
        Did they have a sort of extra spring? Didn’t they have
more. . .well... bounce ?
        Precisely. And the reason is to be found in the bot­
tom of Our shoe: The Reebok Energy Return System.
        Positioned laterally within the sole and heel
are a series of hollow tubes made from a wonder-
thermoplastic called Hytrel.
        Every time your feet impact with the floor,
the tubes compress. And as your weight
    again, they spring back into shape.
                 Thus, energy that would
           normally be wasted is used to
           add extra spring to your step.
    ^            It may seem an absurdly
           simple idea, but it’s one that’s
           taken us 5 years to develop.
                 Fortunately for us both,
           it’s one that takes only
           seconds to appreciate.
                 As one would ex­
           pect, such superb shoes
           may cost a little more.
          But We guarantee
           they’ll do
           more for
           your aerobics
          than any new
           leotard ever could.

                        N o half-measures about the new range

              of high performance rotary lawnmowers from

              Black & Decker.
                    \
                                  ✓

                        Take the GR520.

                     The immense power o f its 1500-watt

              induction motor is aerodynamically designed

              to throw grass cuttings right to the back of

              the generous 4 3 -litre collection bag.

                     Which means fewer stops to unload,

              and a faster finish.

                     A professional finish too.

                     The hardened steel blade of this 16"

              mower cuts a swathe as clean and short as

              you like. You simply control the cutting

              height with the single front adjuster.

                     The GR520 has an induction motor. So

              it's quiet. You get maintenance-free running too.

                     The safety lock-off switch at the top of

                              the fold-down handle prevents

                               accidental starting.

                                  To cut off the power, release

                              the trigger. This puts a brake

                                 on the blade to stop it

                                      quickly and safely.

                                                With 25 metres

                                           of detachable cable,

                                  the GR520 goes a long way.

                           With Black & Decker’s network of

                  national after-sales service stations (should

                   you ever need them), what’s keeping you?

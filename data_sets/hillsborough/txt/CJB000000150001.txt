        SHEFFIELD. TOflTEP FOOifeALL CLTO

        I refer to- our conversation yesterday concerning the proposals for
        Sheffield.United FC. As I mentioned, the Council is keen to pursue, the
        acquisition of the land adjacent'to the Club owned by A H Laver.    Can I.ask
        you to formally write to A H Laver, for his personal attention, to start
        negotiations for the acquisition.   Can I also ask that I be kept informed
        and if necessary involved in any subsequent discussions on this matter.

Minister for Sport,

LONDON.      SW1P 3EB


Dear Mr. Moynihan,

Thank you for your letter of the 18 November,   sent by your private secretary
on your behalf.

I was sorry to learn that you would be unable to come to a football match   at
Hillsborough  in the near    future because of Parliamentary commitments.   It
was, however, indicated on your behalf that you hoped you would be able     to
attend in the not too distant future.

I am now taking     the opportunity,   two months later, to see if there is a
possibility of your arranging to come to a match in Sheffield before the end
of the season.

I believe    you already have a fixture list for the Club and I know that both
the Club and the Police would be only     too willing,   along with  the City
Council,   to go out of their way to show you the facilities and how they
operate them on match day.    Perhaps I could also suggest that, if you could
find  time   to come, you could fit in a visit to the sites of the new sports
facilities being built for the World Student Games, which I am sure would be
of interest to you.

Yours sincerely,




C. J. C. BETTS                                     1

       Thank you for your letter of 12 July about a possible visit                          by
       the Minister for Sport to a football match at Hillsborough.

       I regret that the Minister's diary has now had to be substantially
       rearranged owing to Committee work on two      bills this season.
       Regrettably,  it has proved impossible to find a convenient date
       for him to attend a Sheffield Wednesday home match in the near
       future - although he very much hopes he will be able to attend
       in the not too distant future.

Dear

Could I first of all thank you for attending the meeting in the Town Hall the
other day to discuss the Football Membership Scheme.  I think we had a useful
discussion about the problems that the Scheme will create and also  the good
practice which already exists in Sheffield, which obviates its introduction.

I do    think   it important,    however, that we continue to present a positive
image   on this matter      rather  than   simply criticising   the Government’s
proposals.     The agreement we reached at the end, therefore, to try and draw
up a Code of Good Practice (in terms of actually writing      down what   already
happens   in Sheffield between the Clubs, the Police and the Local Authority)
is an important initiative to take.      I hope, therefore, within the next   two
to three weeks      all   interested bodies    can set down their thoughts on the
matter and, if you wish, I am sure the City Council will agree to try and co­
ordinate   these   and   to write   up an agreed version.     It would then be my
suggestion that we consult the Football Supporters’ Association      so that we
get no    disagreements on this matter.     Perhaps then we could consider giving
some general publicity to the Code, including referring      it to the various
Bodies we     belong to, at national level, and hopefully provide a focal point
for an alternative National Plan which could either by implemented      in place
of the Government       Scheme or held in readiness when the Government’s scheme
eventually falls apart, as most of us believe it will.

I thank you for your co-operation on this matter and look forward to meeting
with you again in a few weeks to review progress on our joint opposition to
the Membership Scheme proposals.

Yours sincerely,
                                                       1

                   crowd control
                   Yorkshire Post Reporter
                   SHEFFIELD’S Council leader yesterday urged the
                   Government to improve safety and crowd control at
                   football grounds instead of forcing in an “unwelcome
                   membership scheme.
                     Coun Clive Betts, a lifelong supporter of Sheffield
                   Wednesday, said there was a general need to improve
                   safety, crowd control and comfort at soccer stadiums.
                     “Perhaps the Government should spend their time
                   looking at this rather than spending tim e promoting an
                   unworkable and unwelcome members hi p-card scheme,
                   he said.
                     Coun Betts made his comments after he was invited to
C ouhCUVE BETTS    open the new Westfield enclosure for disabled fans at
‘Improve safety’   W ednesday’s Hillsborough ground. He w ill perform the
                   opening ceremony on Sunday shortly before lack-off in
                   the televised game between the Owls and Tottenham
                   Hotspur. The new enclosure, which w ill provide
                   wheelchair-bound supporters with a more comfortable
                   view of matches, is spon------------------------------------—

                     Said Coun Betts: “It is

      SAFETY AT SOCCER GROUNDS CRUCIAL, SAY COUNCIL LEADER



      The Government should spend more time looking at safety and crowd control
      standards at football matches instead of promoting membership card schemes.


      That's the view of Sheffield City Council leader and life-long Sheffield
      Wednesday supporter, Councillor Clive Betts, who this weekend officially
^^    opens the Westfield enclosure for disabled supporters at Hillsborough
      Stadium.


      The ceremony takes place at 2.45 pm on Sunday 20 November, shortly before
      kick-off in the televised Sheffield Wednesday home match against Spurs.


      The new enclosure,     sponsored by Westfield Contributory Health Scheme, is
      designed to give up to 60 supporters in wheelchairs a better and more
      comfortable view of matches.


      Sheffield City Council, through its policies, supports improved access for
      all disabled people, and Councillor Betts said: "It is society's duty to
      ensure disabled people - like everyone else - have a chance to watch
(   ) football   matches."


      He also thought there was a general duty to improve safety, crowd control
      and comfort at grounds, adding: "Perhaps the Government should spend more
      time looking at these than spending time promoting unworkable and unwelcome
      membership card schemes."

         Dear Sir,

        VIOLENCE AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS
        A lot has been said and written over the past few years About violonpo at
        football grounds and how to control it.

        As both an active local politician and also a vary active football
        supporter, I have an opportunity to b o o thin rmtiter ftun »>ol.h
        perspectives. In particular, I must say that I don't regard nnny of the
        so-called solutions to this problem as boiny in any way o f f o c t l w . I have
        been to see Luton Town's experiments in actually keeping football
        supporters away frcra the ground as a mochanism for, supposedly,
        encouraging more people to attend and believe that will ba a disaster If
        other clubs were to follow it. I have also witnessed membership ochanwrj
        have no effect at all on crowd discipline and siiiply make it iroro
        difficult for genuine fans to attend. I believe, actually, this is tho

   •    view of most of the Football Clubs and their supporters in the country.

         Alternatively, I go to Hillsborough every other week and see the excellent
         co-operation which exists between the Football Club and the Police. On
         F.A. Cup Semi-Final day I had the pleasure to go round with the Police and
         Club Officials and see the very detailed and professional operation that
         was instituted to control a crowd of more than 50,000. To the best of my
         knowledge there \vas no serious incident amongst either the crowd in the
         ground or outside the ground, which is great credit to everyone concerned
         in the Police and the Club for the organisation in which -they were
         involved.                                                I

         I also note that throughout the whole of this season at Hillsborough,
         despite the fact that average gates have been around 20,000, only 14
         people have been arrested. Their cannot be any Club in the country which
         has a better record tl an this, whatever membership schema they have chosen
         to operate.

         I would therefore like to suggest that you might consider actually coming
         up to Hillsborough to talk to the Police and the Club about the way their
         co-operation and their organisation ensures that anyone who wants to cone
         to the gane can do so and can come to watch in safety. The reality is
         that many women and children do come to Hillsborough and I certainly will
         not discourage anyone from coming because of the way in which the
         rx'^rtnination of crowd control is operated.

perhaps you might like to take up my suggestion and I know, having spoken
to than, that the Chief Constable and the Secretary of the Football Club
will be oily too pleased to receive you and show you exactly what happens
ard he successful it is.

Dear Clive,

Further to your letter dated 14th February 1989 and our subsequent telephone
conversation please find enclosed details of the Local Plan which operates
here at Hillsborough, This was drawn up in conjunction with the South
Yorkshire Police and has been lodged with the Football League so that in the
event of any problems occurring at our matches the schedule can be quickly
examined to see that the Club or Police have adhered to agreed procedures.

I think that possibly this needs to be amalgamated with the similar document
drawn up by Sheffield United in order that we can present it properly to third
parties.

I will, of course, be pleased to attend any further meetings or undertake such
work as is necessary in order for this to be done.

I further enclose a copy of a document drawn up by Manchester United which I
think you may find of interest together with a schedule showing the flow
analysis of our match at Hillsborough with Manchester United on 11th February
1989.

I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

Yours sincerely,

 Dear


Could I first of all thank you for attending the meeting in the Town Hall the
other day to discuss the Football Membership Scheme.  I think we had a useful
discussion about the problems that the Scheme will create and also  the  good
practice which already exists in Sheffield, which obviates its introduction.

I do think     it important,    however, that we continue to present a positive
image on    this matter rather     than   simply criticising    the G o v e r n m e n t ’s
proposals.    The agreement we reached at the end, therefore, to try and draw
up a Code of Good Practice (in terms of actually writing     down what       already
happens   in Sheffield between the Clubs, the Police and the Local Authority)
is an important initiative to take.     I hope, therefore, within the next           two
to three weeks     all   interested bodies    can set down their thoughts on the
matter and, if you wish, I am sure the City Council will agree to try and co­
ordinate   these  and   to write   up  an agreed version.    It would then be my
suggestion that we consult the Football Supporters’ Association       so that          we
get no   disagreements on this matter.     Perhaps then we could consider giving
some general publicity to the Code, including referring     it   to   the various
Bodies we    belong to, at national level, and hopefully provide a focal point
for an alternative National Plan whi ch could either by implemented      in place
of the Government      Scheme or held in readiness when the G o vernm ent’s scheme
eventually falls apart, as most of us believe it will.

I thank you for your co-operation on this matter and look forward to meeting
with you again in a few weeks to review progress on our joint opposition to
the Membership Scheme proposals.

Yours sincerely,




C. J. C. BETTS

Dear

Consultative Conference - Football Membership Scheme
Friday February 24 1989

Please find attached an invitation card and details relating to the above
conference which this Authority is convening.  I hope that the Leader of the
Council or the appropriate Committee Chair will be able to attend.

As you will see from the programme we have been fortunate in attracting
notable contributors from Parliament, from within football, the police and a
range of other bodies with an interest in the Government's proposals.   Indeed
it promises to be the most representative conference yet held on the proposed
Membership Scheme.

As a local authority with responsibilities for overseeing public safety and
order at football matches, I am sure your Council will want to know more
about the implications of the Government's proposals for the Council, your
ratepayers and the football club(s) and supporters in your area.  The
Conference will allow your Council an opportunity to find out more about the
Membership Scheme and to make known any views you might have.

Please use the attached booking form to indicate your authority's acceptance
of our invitation.

Yours sincerely

Chairman,
Sheffield United FC,
Bramall Lane,

Dear Mr. Brearley,

Thank you for your letter of the 29 December with regard to your visit to see
me and subsequent developments.

I understand from a further meeting with Mr.   Wragg  and Mr.   Woolhouse   with
myself and Council Officers that work is now   in progress between our advisers
to look at the suitability of the Don Valley   Stadium for Sheffield U n i t e d ’s
future use and also the potential for future   development of Bramall Lane.

In response to the question of the publicity about the meeting we had, then I
am sure you will appreciate that the Town Hall is a fairly public place    and
that on entering the building with Mr. Wragg you were seen by a number of
people.   It did not take long for those people to speculate about the purpose
of your visit and within a couple of hours rumours were certainly spreading
at a considerable speed round the   Town Hall.    Given that   the press   are
frequent visitors to the Town Hall I am sure you can understand that however
confidential we had kept the details of our meeting,     the  reality of   its
having   taken place   could not   be kept   secret  for more than a matter of
minutes.

I am sure that the important thing now is to continue to look at the   scheme
together and   see  if there is a way forward, according to the procedures we
discussed, which will be of benefit to both parties.

Yours sincerely,




C. J. C. BETTS

1. The working party was set up following the meeting between the
Prime Minister and the President of the Football League and the
Chairman of the Football Association on 6 July 1988.      At that
meeting, the Prime Minister told the football authorities that
the Government believed that a national membership scheme to
control admission to football matches was necessary to counter
the continuing incidence of hooliganism associated with football.
The Prime Minister pressed the football authorities to establish
a scheme on a voluntary basis. The football authorities did not
believe that such a scheme could be introduced on a voluntary
basis.

2. The Government recognises that there has been considerable
progress on the anti-hooligan measures       agreed between the
Government and the football authorities. The Government cannot,
however, accept that the level of disorder within grounds is
tolerable. The Government and the police remain concerned that at
many grounds, football matches continue to provide a focus for
aggressive behaviour and gestures. These in turn may produce a
hostile environment and create the risk of disorder.          The
consequences  are high levels of policing and increasingly
elaborate physical structures for crowd control and segregation.

3. The Government believes that a national membership scheme,
together with CCTV and other measures, can succeed in removing
the hooligan element from football matches and in breaking the
attachment of hooliganism to football. The Government sees the
national membership scheme as an essential element in a package
of measures which the Government is developing, alongside those
already taken by     the  football   authorities, to deal  with
hooliganism associated with football.

4. Considerable police resources are devoted to football, 'backed
by restrictions on alcohol under the Sporting Events (Control of
Alcohol) Act 1985 and powers for the police and the Courts under
the Public Order Act 1986. The police will continue their efforts
to deal with criminal behaviour. The Government is considering
ways of preventing convicted football hooligans from attending
matches abroad. It has already issued advice to police and the
courts on the enforcement of the law on the misuse of alcohol and
on the need to ensure swift justice following incidents of
hooliganism.

5. The President of The Football League and the Chairman of The
Football Association, told the Prime Minister that they disputed
strongly the necessity for the scheme. They argued that over the
past season there had been very few incidents of crowd disorder
within football grounds; the main incidents of disorder occurred
away from grounds and were outside the control of the football
authorities. They said that individual clubs did, however, take
firm   action   against   supporters   who    were   arrested  for
football-related   offences.   The   football    authorities  were
unconvinced that the introduction of a national membership scheme



                                  1
 would solve the problem of disorder which occurs away from
 grounds and which is coupled with the increasing incidence of
 serious disorder by young people in areas thar are totally
 unconnected with football.                                  y

 6. The football authorities suggested at the meeting that the
 introduction of a national identity card would provide a better
 means of deterring hooliganism in the country as a whole than a
 membership  scheme   confined  to  football.  The view    of the
 Government representatives on the working party was however that
 the question of a national identity card was outside the workina
 party's terms of reference.                                    y

7•      f°°tba11 authorities said that they had co-operated fully
with the Government on the measures to curb hooliganism contained
        agreement following meetings with Government Ministers in
1985 and 1986. The football authorities have taken wide-ranginq
initiatives over the past two seasons to deal with the disorder
within football grounds. The main initiatives were the use of
closed circuit television (CCTV) at grounds, the introduction of
family areas and of voluntary membership schemes in home support
areas and the formation of local plans for dealing with crowd
control at matches in liaison with the local police.         They
consider   that  these   have  been   successful.  The  continued
segregation of supporters both inside and outside the ground
liaison with the police on kick-off times and other measures have
helped to reduce considerably the potential for disorder. The
football authorities consider that, on those few occasions where
crowd disorder has occurred, the Football Association has   after
the necessary inquiries, dealt severely with clubs who have been
adjudged not to have taken all reasonable precautions.

8. The football authorities are seriously concerned that a scheme
involving the checking of membership cards would create new
problems in handling the admission of spectators. They are also
concerned about the possible long term effects on the football
industry of the introduction of the scheme. Football         as a
 eisure industry, relies heavily on the revenue generated' by the
paying spectator and they fear that many casual supporters and
elderly supporters and family groups will be deterred by the
scheme from attending matches.


The working party

9. The Prime Minister said that the Government would brinq
forward_proposals for legislation to give statutory backing to
the national membership scheme. Having made their position clear
Fnn-hvfrieiS1?ent ° f -thS Footba11 League and the Chairman of the
             Association recognised the Government's commitment to
     introduction of a national membership scheme and undertook to
co-operate with the Government in considering the details of the
scheme- It was agreed that a working party chaired by the
Minister for Sport would examine the details of the scheme.




                                2
10. The objectives of the working party were:


    i) tc review the main principles of the scheme; and

   i i ) to identify appropriate technology to implement the scheme
          for the start of the 1989-90 football season.


It met for the first time on Tuesday 26 July and on five furtner
occasions.  Its meetings were attended by representatives of the
following bodies:


   Football Association
   Football League
   Association of Chief Police Officers
   Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency
   Home Office
   No 10 Policy Unit
   Department of the Environment.


11. The football authorities representatives have taken an active
part in the discussions of the working party and they have agreed
the contents of the report subject to the points of disagreement
noted. Given that the Government is committed to the early
introduction of legislation for a national membership scheme, the
working party has been working to a very- tight timetable. This
has imposed considerable pressures on all members of the working
party and, taken together with the strict confidentiality of the
working   party's   discussions,  has   prevented   the   football
authorities from consulting the clubs and others, as they^ would
have wished. They reserve the right to comment ^further in the
light of their consultations.     Subject to this,     the report
represents the recommendations of the working party, to the
football authorities and the Government,       on what the main
elements of an effective scheme might be;     the Government, the
police and the football authorities are not committed to accept
these recommendations.
 12. The Prime Minister made clear at the meeting on 6 July that
 funding for the scheme would be a matter for the football
 authorities. The working party has, in consequence, not discussed
 funding in detail, but the football authorities are concerned
 about the financial implications of the imposition of the scheme.




                                  3
CHAPTER 1: SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

1. This chapter provides a summary of the working party's
recommendations for the main elements of the national membership
scheme, as discussed in the report.


1 . GENERAL

     a)   Admission of spectators to        a   designated   football     match
          will only be permitted i f :

              - the spectator produces a valid membership card for
            checking at the point of entry to the ground; and

              - the ground on which the match is to be played                   is
            covered by a licence.

     b)   The scheme will be a national one administered by a
           Football Membership Authority;    information about all
          members will be held on a central computer.

     c)   A member will be entitled to only one card which will
           indicate the club which he, or she, supports and qualify
          him, or her, to attend any designated match.

     d)   The   scheme  will   apply   in  England  and   Wales   but
           consideration should be given to its extension to Scotland
           and Northern Ireland.

2.    MEMBERSHIP OF THE SCHEME                           (Chapter 2)

     a ) An application should involve:
             a standard application form
             proof of identity
             proof of address
             a photograph.                               (paras 3-6)

          The football   authorities       disagree   with   the   need   for    a
          photograph.

     b)   Membership cards should include:
              the member's name
              a photograph
              a membership number
              date of expiry
              the name of the club nominated
              the member's national football allegiance
           they should be readable electronically and valid for             two
           or three seasons only.                  (paras 7-13)

          The football authorities consider that membership should
          be valid for ten years.




                                       4
     c)   Exemptions from membership
          -   no general exemptions for paying British spectators;
          -   limited temporary membership for accompanied foreign
              nationals;
              clubs   to  make  special   arrangements   for  guests,
              hospitality boxes and groups such as parties of school
              children, accompanied children in family enclosures
              and disabled people in designated areas with special
              access;
          -   non-spectators should not be subject to the scheme.
                                                   (paras 14-21)
     ^)   Criteria for withdrawing or withholding membership from
          hooligans should include:
          - mandatory criteria imposed by legislation linked to
             conviction for football-related offences,     involving
             bans of two or five years;
             discretionary   criteria   operated by    the  Football
             Membership Authority who will decide whether to imoose
             bans and for how long.               (paras 22-28)

          The football authorities consider that mandatory criteria
          should apply to convictions for all offences of violence
          against the person.

     e)   Two new criminal offences should be created:
           - for false application for membership;
              for gaining or attempting to gain entry to ground
             without a valid membership card-      (paras 29-30)

     f)   The football authorities consider there is a need for the
          two further criminal offences indicated in the body of the
          report. There should be a requirement for a member of the
          scheme to produce his/her membership card for inspection.
                                                  (paras 31-32)

3.    DESIGNATED FOOTBALL MATCHES

     a)  The scheme should apply to all matches between League
         clubs’ first teams.                     (para 2)
     b) The scheme should not apply to matches between non-League
         teams.    -                             (para 3)
     c) Matches between League clubs and non-League clubs should
        be designated but the scheme should allow initially for
         admission of non-members;               (paras 4-6)
     d) Special    procedures     for matches   involving    foreign
      , teams._                                  (para 7)
     e) Admission     for    members  only   to   matches    between
        English/Welsh and Scottish/Northern Irish teams.
                                                 (paras 8-11)




                                    5
4.    RESPONSIBILITY FOR      THE   SCHEME:   the    Football Membership
Authority and the clubs                               (Chapter 4)

  a)    The FMA will be designated by the Secretary of State; it
        will draw up a scheme in accordance with criteria imposed
        by legislation; the scheme will be subject to approval by
        Secretary of State.                     (paras 1-2)

  b)    FM A 's responsibilities to include;
            supervise application process
            approve/reject applications
            maintain central register of all members
            draw up rules on withdrawal of membership
            make decisions and possibly hear appeals on withdrawal
            licensing grounds (if this responsibility is delegated
            by the Secretary of State).
                                  (paras 3-6) and (paras 12-13)

  c)    Clubs' responsibilities to include:

             dealing with applications, maintaining records, supply
             of information to central register
             installation and maintenance of approved machinery for
             checking membership cards
             adequate   arrangements   to   control   admission    of
             spectators and to deal with holders of rejected cards
             provision of sufficient trained staff to operate all
             aspects of scheme
             other requirements to ensure effective operation of the
             scheme.     •                        (paras 7-11)

   d)   The scheme should be monitored by a small part-time
        inspectorate employed by and responsible to the FMA or
        another agency (or the Secretary of State).
                                                (para 14)

   e ) sanctions  on  clubs  which   fail       to    carry  out    their
       responsibilities should include:               (paras 17-27)

        i)       withdrawal of the licence to admit spectators to
                 the ground for persistent or serious failure or in
                 an emergency following a serious disturbance;

        ii)      fines for minor breaches;

        iii)     criminal liability for admitting spectators to         a
                 designated match at a non licensed ground.

   f ) The FMA and the clubs will need to register with the Data
       Protection Registrar.                 . (paras 28-31)

5. NOTIFICATION OF OFFENCES                           (Chapter 5)

In operating discretionary criteria to disqualify from membership
those whose behaviour is unacceptable, clubs will need to receive
information from the police about those who are being ej ected




                                    6
from the ground, and about those who are being arrested for an
alleged criminal offence committed on the club's premises (para
3J_-
For the mandatory criteria imposed by the legislation to work
properly, the FMA must receive information about convictions for
football related offences. The working party recommends:


   1. the question of whether an offence     is    football     related
   should be determined by the courts;

   2. the Government should initiate discussions with the courts,
   the Crown Prosecution Service and the police to determine the
   most efficient means of notifying convictions to the FMA
   (paras 5-12).


The Government should determine with the police and the football
authorities suitable arrangements for ensuring that troublemakers
are not admitted to the scheme at the outset. An early Government
announcement should make it clear that past behaviour will be
taken into account in deciding who shall be disqualified from
membership (paras 13-16).


6. TECHNOLOGY AND TIMING                          (Chapter 6)

   a ) The Government representatives and the police are satisfied
       that the technology is available to implement the scheme.
       The main elements should be:

          i)    a computerised central register
         ii)    a computer at each club
        iii)    card readers at turnstiles, to be portable           if
                possible.
                                                (paras 1-11)

   b)   Membership cards are to   be readable electronically. The
        options,   on which the   working  party has   not  drawn
        conclusions, are:

          i)    barcode cards
         ii)    magnetic stripe cards
        iii)    Smartcards.
                                                  (paras 12-17)

   c) The new technology may also provide opportunities for the
      clubs to improve their own administrative procedures and
      for marketing.                          (paras 18-19 )

         The football authorities are not committed to these views
         and the working party agreed that, until the consultants
         report and the views of the commercial advisers had been
         received, these must remain matters of judgement.




                                  7
CHAPTER 2: MEMBERSHIP OF THE SCHEME

1. The central feature of the national membership scheme will be
that spectators will not be admitted to designated football
matches unless they can produce a valid membership card, properly
issued to them.   Cards will be checked at the point of entry to
the ground. No member will be able to hold more than one card,
but a valid membership card will entitle the holder to attend any
designated match.

2. The working party discussed whether people should become
members of the national scheme directly or via membership of a
Football League club. Direct membership of the national scheme
would provide economies of scale and mitigate the burden of the
scheme on clubs; vetting of applications and decisions about
withdrawal of membership could be handled centrally. On the other
hand, the more closely individual clubs, are involved in running
the scheme, the more responsibility they may be expected to take
for its success. On balance the working party accepted the strong
recommendation of the representatives of the football authorities
that members should join the national scheme directly,        but
indicate which club they support (or the club with which they
wish to be associated). Individual clubs may wish to develop a
direct role in exploiting the commercial opportunities of the
scheme.


Applications for membership

3. Applications for membership should be made on a standard
application form drawn up by the body responsible for running the
scheme (hereafter called the Football Membership Authority, FMA).
Application forms would be issued, and received on completion, by
Football League clubs and other agencies who would pass them on
for vetting to the FMA (see chapter 4). The form would seek the
following information:


   name
   address
   date of birth
   date of application
   sex
   club which applicant nominates
   national football allegiance.


4. The working party recognised that a balance had to be struck
between requiring essential information and asking so many
questions   that  people   were  reluctant   to  complete   their
application forms. The view of the Government representatives and
the police was that the applicant should also be asked to confirm
that he was not presently a member of the scheme, and to provide
details of any previous withdrawal of membership and of any
previous conviction or prosecution pending for an offence
committed at 'or on the way to or from a football match. This
would help to deter undesirable applicants and to facilitate the
vetoing process. The football authorities disagreed and felt that
these additional questions would be a disincentive for people to
join the scheme.

5. The applicant would be required to show proof of identity and
proof of address. Young people unable to produce proof of
identity or address could have their applications signed by an
adult who could produce such proof. The view of the Government
representatives   and   the  police,  with  which   the  football
authorities disagree, is that applicants should also provide two
photographs, one for the card, one for the FMA's records.   Clubs
might wish to make arrangements for taking the photographs of
applicants; it would, in any case, be necessary for them, or the
other agencies to which application was made, to check that the
photographs of personal applicants were of the person concerned.
6. The working party took the view that,        provided that a
sufficient number of outlets were available for the application
process, postal applications would be unnecessary and should not
be allowed except     in the case of applicants from Scotland and
Northern Ireland      (if not part of the scheme) andforeign
countries (for whom photographs would need to be countersigned by
a responsible person). Membership cards should be sent to the
applicant at the     address given as an additional test of the
address. The football authorities consider that the availability
of temporary membership cards to cover delays in processing
applications is essential.


Membership cards

7. The technology for membership cards is discussed in chapter 6;
some options would make it possible for the cards to carry more
information than others.   The minimum information required to be
carried on the card for the scheme to be effective would be the
name of the member, photograph (see paragraph 9), the date to
which the card is valid, the name (or logo), of the club the
member nominates and national football allegiance; the card must
also be readable electronically and be numbered. The police
considered that it would be a useful additional safeguard if the
card were capable of bearing the member's signature.

8. The working party recognised that no system of membership
cards was impervious to forgery and fraud. We were advised that,
without causing unacceptable delays at entry turnstiles, it was
not currently possible to verify electronically fingerprints or
other unique personal characteristics. The conclusion of the
working party was that a combination of both a photograph and
electronic readability offered the best means of restricting
admission to holders of valid cards.    If the card did not meet
both of these requirements, the opportunities for abuse would be
unacceptably wide.

9. The football representatives did not accept the necessity for
the card to carry a photograph of the applicant. They were very
doubtful   of  its   value   other  than   to  provide   initial



                                9
identification on detention by the police. The photograph would
add to the complexity of applying for a card. It was however the
view of the Government representatives and the police, that a
photograph was essential to the integrity of the whole scheme
both to deter fraud and impersonation and to aid identification
if the holder were involved in disorder. The football authorities
were firmly of the view in any event that photographs should not
be required for children under 16. The view of the Government
representatives and the police was that photographs should be
required at least for children of 14 and over.

10. The working party discussed what the most appropriate life
span of the membership card might be. If cards were valid for one
season only, the number of lost, stolen and damaged cards in
circulation could be kept to a minimum. But a requirement to
renew cards every year might prove a major deterrent to potential
members (and reduce attendances); it would also add to the
burdens of the FMA and the clubs. At the same time a system of
life membership would entail problems about changes of address
and physical appearance and would, unless the cards were replaced
regularly, build up an unacceptable level of invalid cards in
circulation. An accumulating database of invalid cards would be
likely to rule out the possibility of using portable card readers
(see Chapter 6).

11. The football authorities felt that membership should be valid
for the same length of time as a British Passport, ie ten years.
The cards could be reissued .without reapplication at intervals
say of two or three years thus renewing the database. The view of
the Government representatives was that       membership without
reapplication should be valid for a period of two or three years.

12. When the member arrives at the ground, he will hand his card
to the turnstile operator who will run it through the electronic
reader which will check its validity. There would be unacceptable
delays if the turnstile operators were asked to check photographs
as well. The football representatives were particularly concerned
about the delays that might result when cards are rejected by the
electronic readers. It is essential that there is a means of
identifying   invalid   and   damaged  cards separately   at  the
turnstile. In the case of an invalid card, it would be for the
police to investigate whether a criminal offence had been
committed. The football authorities reserved their right to
comment further on this point after seeking advice from their
consultants. The working party recognised that the arrangements
for dealing with      rejected   cards would  need very   careful
attention.

13. Members should be asked to inform the FMA of changes of
address and of other relevant information, and if their card is
lost or stolen.     Information about lost or stolen cards is
important to the security of the scheme but there is no obvious
way to compel members whose cards are lost or stolen to inform
the FMA. In the view of the Government representatives and the
police the risk that people may fail to report lost or stolen
cards makes it particularly important that cards should include




                                10
photographs. It was accepted that clubs should be able to issue
temporary membership cards, valid for one match only, to members
whose cards were lost, stolen, or damaged.

Exemptions from membership

14. The working party believes that consideration of possible
exemptions from membership should start from the premise that
exemptions should be allowed only if there is a very good reason
for them and if arrangements can be made to ensure that they do
not create an unacceptable loophole in the scheme. For some
groups, exemption is not the obvious answer which it might
appear. A general exemption might be proposed, for example, for
children under a certain age, disabled people, and Old Age
Pensioners, on the grounds that they were unlikely to cause
trouble. But these are potentially large groups and exemptions
would themselves impose an additional layer of checking, for
example to ensure that those concerned were the age they said
they were. The Government representatives and the police consider
it is preferable to require membership of all spectators (subject
to the following paragraphs) and to leave it to the FMA and clubs
to issue some (or indeed all) membership cards free, or at a
reduced rate, if they wish.


Accompanied children in designated family areas

15. The working party considered, in the interest of encouraging
families to attend matches, that children under 16, accompanied
by an adult member of the scheme, could.be exempt from the scheme
provided that:-


   (i)    they view the match from a designated family enclosure;
          and

   (ii)   there is direct access to that family enclosure,    not
          allowing transfer to other areas of the ground.


Disabled people in designated areas

16. The working party considered that a similar exemption could
apply to those disabled people for whom clubs        provide a
designated area and special access.


Foreign Visitors

17. Exemption may also be justified       for foreign visitors
attending a single domestic match, at the discretion of the club.
Clubs could maintain a small stock of temporary membership cards,
valid for one match only, which could be issued to foreign
visitors, against proof of their identity (passport or national
identity card). The clubs should be responsible for their
behaviour.   The clubs should also maintain records of those to
whom the temporary cards are issued,       to ensure that    this



                               11
arrangement is not abused by foreign nationals who attend matches
regularly (and who could apply in the normal way for a standard
membership card).

x8. The working party recommends that similar privileges should
not be extended to Scottish or Northern Irish visitors. Foreign
visitors may reasonably be asked to show their passport or
national identity card as proof of identity (since they will have
needed them to enter the country). This is not the case- for UK
nationals and it is more reasonable to ask an occasional visitor
from Scotland or Northern Ireland to obtain a membership card of
his or her own than to ask a      foreign national, who may be
unfamiliar with our language and institutions, to do so. Wide
availability of temporary cards to UK nationals would lay the
scheme open to abuse.     The arrangements for matches involving
foreign teams are discussed in chapter 3.


Other guests

19. 'The working party considered that there was a good case for
allowing the exemption of certain spectators who do not pay at
the turnstiles such as guests of the clubs' directors, sponsors
and their guests and those using hospitality boxes. On the one
hand, they are present at grounds to watch matches and it may be
argued that they should be expected to become members of the
scheme in the same way as other spectators. On the other hand,
the risk of hooliganism among these groups is negligible and
hospitality boxes .and sponsorship are an important source of
revenue to many clubs. Furthermore, special additional procedures
would be required to check membership cards of people who do not
usually go through the turnstiles. On balance,       the working
party's view is that admission of guests should not depend on
membership of the scheme.

20. For other categories of club or sponsor's guests not
physically segregated from the rest of the spectators it should
be possible for the clubs to make appropriate arrangements in
advance for temporary match day membership,      as for foreign
visitors. In this and all cases where satisfactory arrangements
can be agreed the club, and the sponsor in the case of sponsor's
guests, should take responsibility for the behaviour of those who
benefit from them. Temporary membership cards should be produced
in such a way as to ensure that they could be used only once.

21. .Another group for which exemption could be claimed is that of
organised school parties or parties of children from another
club. The working party would not wish the scheme to preclude
such groups from attending football matches. The working party is
confident that the clubs will be able to davise arrangements to
accommodate them.    The possibilities would include temporary
membership and a special entrance and enclosure within the
ground. The requirements of the national membership scheme will
not apply to those attending football grounds in a professional
capacity: the police; ambulance men; caterers; journalists etc.




                               12
Criteria for withdrawing or withholding membership

22. The main objective of the national membership scheme is to
deny entry to those who may be expected to cause trouble, in
order further to improve standards of behaviour at football
matches.   The  scheme  must   therefore  provide   criteria  for
withdrawing or withholding membership both from those who have
been convicted of relevant criminal offences and from those whose
behaviour is, in other ways, unacceptable.     The working party
considers that:


   (1) the withdrawal or withholding of membership from those
   convicted of relevant criminal offences should be subject to
   mandatory rules, imposed by legislation;

   (2) the FMA should have discretion to exclude people (whether
   convicted of criminal offences or not) from the scheme for
   behaviour which it finds unacceptable, (this discretion should
   be recognised in the legislation which establishes the scheme
   and should be exercised in accordance with rules drawn up by
   the FMA and approved by the Secretary of State);

   (3) nothing in (1) or (2) should remove from the individual
   football club its present right to refuse entry to its
   premises.


Mandatory criteria

23. The purpose of establishing mandatory criteria for banning
those convicted of criminal offences, is to ensure that potential
offenders are aware of the consequences for their continued
membership of the scheme. The working party recommends a two-tier
tariff for convicted offenders:


         i)     if the offender receives a custodial sentence
               -withdrawal Of membership for five years;

        ii)     if any other sentence,    including a community
               service order or a fine, is imposed - withdrawal
               of membership for two years.


These criteria would be established in legislation and the
withdrawal of membership would take effect on the FMA receiving
notification of a conviction from the police or the courts. The
standard two tier tariff suggested above would be broadly
consistent with the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. It
would be open to the FMA to impose additional bans on these
offenders at their own discretion (see paragraph 26 below).

24. The working party considers that these mandatory rules should
operate only in respect of a category of offences similar to that
listed as football-related in the Public Order Act 1986 for the
purposes of exclusion orders (see Annex), (provided that the



                               13
c o u r d e c l a r e s that the offence itself is a football—related one
- see chapter 5), and of the new offences recommended below. It
may be argued, and the football authorities were strongly of this
view, that conviction for any crime of violence should lead to
withdrawal of membership, it would however be difficult to draw a
clear and reasonable line; violence in the family, for example,
may be no guide to a person's behaviour at a football match. A
conviction for violence at other sporting events would be
obviously relevant and again the football authorities considered
that this should be taken into account.

25. It was with reluctance that the Government representatives
and the police took the view that the practical difficulties of
defining   such  offences  and   of  arranging  for  notification
precluded extending the mandatory criteria to them. The wider the
range of offences considered relevant, the more difficult it
would be to arrange the disclosure of information to the FMA (see
chapter 5 below), and to justify such disclosure. The football
authorities maintained their strong view that for the scheme to
operate effectively the mandatory criteria must        extend  to
convictions for any violent crimes.


Non-mandatory criteria

26. It is essential that the FMA should have discretion to impose
bans of its own, both in the form of additional bans in respect
   criminal offences on top of those required by the legislation
and in respect of other forms of unacceptable behaviour.  The FMA
might withdraw membership, other than as a result of conviction
for a criminal offence, in the event of behaviour leading to
arrest or ejection from the ground (whether or not the person
concerned was subsequently charged); and other forms of offensive
behaviour which can produce an unacceptably hostile environment
inside grounds.

27. The working party envisages that the non-mandatory criteria
for withdrawal of membership to be operated by the FMA should be
the subject of rules, •concerning both the abuses for which bans
      be imposed and their length, approved by the Secretary of
State. The working party recommends that the minimum period for
which membership should be withdrawn, at the FMA's discretion,
should be twelve months. Within this category of "discretionary”
rules, some cases (eg ejection from a ground) may give rise to
pre-determined automatic bans, effective from the date the FMA is
notified of the incident. In other cases the clubs would make a
report to the FMA, who would then decide the appropriate ban, in
the light of the circumstances. TheFMA may wish to consider
whether people should have the right to appeal against withdrawal
of membership (see chapter 4 below).     Just as there should be
mandatory and discretionary rules for   withdrawing membership so
there will have to be parallel rules for withholding membership
from applicants.

28. The football authorities felt strongly that the police should
forward to them information on arrests for a football related
offence wherever it took place.      However,  the view of the



                                  14
Government representatives and the polics was that the FM A 's
discretion to withdraw membership in cases of arrest would have
to be restricted to incidents inside or just outside football
grounds -   u might be difficult
           ±.                            for the FMA to impose a
discretionary ban on a member of the scheme who was arrested away
from the ground, in travelling to or from a match for example,
because the F M A would have no direct evidence on which to base
its decision. The F M A might find it difficult to justify imposing
the ban in advance of conviction, when an alleged offence had not
occurred on a football c l u b ’s premises.

New criminal offences

29.   The ^ working party recommends that   the legislation
implementing the scheme should establish  two new criminal
offences in respect of membership of the scheme, along the
following lines:


   a)   it should be an offence knowingly or recklessly to provide
        false information in applying for a membership card;

   b)   it should be an offence for anyone to attempt to obtain
        entry or to gain entry to a ground (or to be present in a
        ground) for a designated football match without being in
        possession of his or her valid membership card, except in
        accordance with the scheme.


30. ^ The case for the second of these offences is perhaps- less
obvious than the first.    It would be possible to rely on clubs
simply turning people away if they did not have a valid card or
if they tried to use someone else's card.   But the working party
believes that it is essential to minimize the danger that large
numbers of people may attempt to gain entry without valid cards.
The establishment of a new criminal offence should deter people
from trying to cheat the system. The police may require specific
powers,   for example powers to arrest in these cases,        for
effective enforcement.

31. The football authorities believed      that   two   further   new
criminal offences were also needed:-


        it should be an offence for anyone to fail to produce his
        or her card on demand to a police officer or authorised
        officer if inside the ground or to a police officer if
        outside the ground, or upon arrest for a football-related
        offence;

        it should be an offence for anyone to fail to surrender
        his or her card when ordered to do so, by a police
        officer, in or around the ground.




                                15
32. The working party concluded that there should be a legal
requirement for a member to produce a membership card for
inspection when asked to do so by a club official or a police
officer. This should be restricted to persons on, or seeking
entry to, club premises for the purpose of attending a designated
match. The Government representatives and the police were not
convinced that this needed the support of a criminal sanction.
Failure to produce a card on request, for example, could give
rise to suspicion that the offence in paragraph 29 (b) above had
been committed. The terms of the scheme could additionally
declare that the card remained the property of the FMA (or the
clubs), and that failure to produce it on request would render
the person, if a member, liable to withdrawal of membership. The
Government   representatives  and   the  police   were  similarly
unconvinced that it would be right to recommend a criminal
offence for failure to surrender a card. The football authorities
maintained their strong view that these two offences were needed.




                              16
CHAPTER 3: DESIGNATED FOOTBALL MATCHES

1. The Secretary of State will designate those football matches
to which admission will be subject to the requirements of the
national membership scheme.    The working party recommends that
designation should initially be confined to matches involving
League teams. The Secretary of State will have the power to add
further categories of matches (and other sporting events) to his
initial list should it prove necessary to do so.

2. Designation should apply to any match between Football League
clubs' first teams, wherever it is played, in England and Wales,
to include:


           i)   Football League matches;

          ii)   Cup competitions confined        toLeague clubs;

         iii)    FA Cup   or   Welsh    FA   Cupmatches   between    League
             clubs;

          iv)   the FA Charity Shield match;

           v)   "friendly matches".


For these matches, admission should be restricted to holders of
membership cards (subject to chapter 2 above). The working party
took the view that there was no present case for designating
matches between reserve teams or youth teams representing League
clubs.

3. The working party proposes that the Secretary of State should
not designate, initially, matches in the GM Vauxhall Conference,
nor other matches between non-League, amateur or junior teams.
There -are two categories of match where the question of
designation is less easy to resolve:


   a)     matches between a League club and a non-League club, in
         the FA Cup or the Welsh FA Cup, or a friendly match; and

   b)     matches between an English or Welsh League                club,   or
         national team, and a team from another country.


4 - a)    Matches between League and non-League teams.    For such
         matches played at League grounds, there are two options:


           i)   restrict admission to holders       of membership cards.
                This would almost certainly         mean that supporters
                of the non-League team would         be admitted only if
                they had joined the national        membership scheme as



                                       17
              supporters of a League club (as many of them may).
              It might be possible to establish a special
              category   of  membership,  within   the  national
              membership scheme, for supporters of non-League
              clubs but the working party did not feel that the
              number of matches involved would justify doing
              so.

       ii)    Allow non-members access to the ground for such
              matches.   Supporters of the League team would be
              encouraged to use turnstiles at which their cards
              would be checked according to national membership
              scheme procedures but supporters of the non-League
              team would not have to produce membership cards at
              the turnstiles allocated to them (though they
              would have to buy tickets, in advance, from their
              own clubs).


5.  The working party felt that option        (i)  represented a
disproportionate burden on non-League clubs and their supporters,
given the small number of matches for which the procedure would
be relevant and the lack of trouble in the past at such matches.
Option (i) might also pose problems of its own - for example, if
supporters of the non-league team had joined the scheme as
supporters of the League club who were the opponents on the day.
The working party recommends, therefore, that option (ii) should
be followed, at least initially. The matches concerned would
nonetheless be designated, so that members will be required to
produce membership cards on request and risk losing them if they
misbehave (the scheme would allow for an appropriate variation).
If there were to be trouble at such matches, they could rapidly
be brought fully within the scheme.

6. For matches between non-League and League teams played at
non-League grounds, only the second option would in practice be
available, if the electronic readers used to check membership
cards at League grounds were not portable (see chapter 6), since
visual checks of all cards would cause too many delays. We would
in any event recommend the second option.

7. b ) Matches between English/Welsh teams and teams from another
country. For matches involving non-UK opponents, whether at club
or international level, all home supporters would be admitted
only on production of their membership cards.    There would have
to be special arrangements for foreign supporters. It is not
reasonable to require nationals supporting their team for one
match in this country to become members of the national
membership scheme; nor can they be excluded altogether.    On the
other hand, some control is essential.        The working party
proposes, therefore, that supporters of foreign teams should be
admitted only through specified turnstiles, on production of a
passport or national identity card. The club will need to take
reasonable precautions to ensure ticket and passport or identity
card are in order. The working party recognised that, having




                                18
taken such precautions,   a club could not be held responsible if
say a supporter were      to gain entry by producing a forged
passport.

8.  For matches between English/Welsh     teams  and teams  from
Scotland or Northern Ireland, the working party proposes that
admission should be confined to holders of national membership
scheme membership cards.      Many Scottish and Northern Irish
supporters will be members because they support Football League
clubs anyway. For those who are not, and who wish to attend
matches involving their teams in England or Wales, there will be
no alternative but to join the scheme, as a supporter of an
English or Welsh club. The working party considers that such a
requirement is essential in order to avoid disruption at matches
between English or Welsh teams and other British teams.

9. The working party does not feel, however, that this approach
is an entirely satisfactory one. In particular, we are concerned
that some Scottish or Northern Irish football supporters might
claim, in joining the scheme, to be supporters of an English club
against whom their own local team plays. It would be impossible
to segregate supporters effectively in such circumstances; and
the threat of withdrawal of membership would not be sufficient to
deter potential Scottish or Northern Irish troublemakers because
it would have no implications for their future attendance at
matches in their own country.

10. In the light of this difficulty, and also because there is
some danger that hooligans banned from the national membership
scheme in England, and Wales will begin to attend matches in
Scotland or Northern Ireland (there is already considerable
evidence of fans from England attending major Scottish games) the
working party recommends that further consideration should be
given to extending the scheme to those countries.

11. Chapter 2 proposes that applicants should be asked to state
their national football allegiance in applying for membership and
that membership cards should indicate that allegiance.  Cards can
therefore help achieve    segregation  at international matches
staged in England and Wales between the four home countries.




                                19
    CHAPTER 4: RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SCHEME: THE FOOTBAT.r, m f m b f b ^ t d
    AUTHORITY AND THE^CLUBS   -------------------------       — -

    1. The Secretary of State will designate a Football MembershiD
    Authority    to   draw  up   the  national  membership  scheme,  in
    accordance with criteria laid down by Parliament.      The FMA will
    c? resP°nsible         submitting the scheme to the Secretary of
                ap?^°val and for ensuring that it is in place on time.
    I?  ™ V Sme     i-    a natlonal one governed by national rules but
    the FMA will delegate much of the day-to-day responsibility for
    operating the scheme to the clubs. This chapter discusses the
    respective responsibilities of the FMA and the clubs and the
    arrangements for monitoring their performance.

       P f w Footba11 Association and the Football League have decided
    that they will wish to share responsibility and establish a joint
    body which they would recommend to the Secretary of State for
    resignation as the Football Membership Authority. The working
    party noted that the football authorities had, at this early
    s^age    appointed consultants to advise on all matters related to
    the scheme.


Responsibilities of the FMA

        kFMA ,will„ Produce the standard form for applications for
membership (as described m      chapter 2). it will determine the
a^ran9 ements y which applications are to be made - whether the
clubs    are to be the only places to which applications may be
           whether Post offices or even banks might be invited to
                  receive forms. Wherever applications are made,
                   t   n   d

they will be passed to the FMA for decision.          it will vet
applications for membership against its records to ensure that
no one     has membership of more than one club and that the
^         13 n0t ,UndSr 3 ban*    wil1 need to inform the police
       false applications.   it may receive information about
misbehaviour by members from sources other than the League clubs
 ror example from the police and the courts (see chapter 5) ^rom
ltnwil?9^  CH UbS; 5k °m Wembley' and from international sources,
   will decide whether applicants are to be accepted and whether
membership is to be withdrawn in cases which do not involve a
criminal conviction (see chapter 2).


Central register of members

4. The FMA will maintain a central register of all members of the
scheme of those "blacklisted" from membership and of cards which
have^ become invalid for other reasons.      The clubs will be
 equirad to supply updated    recommendations for withdrawal of
r a t S r ^1 S n                Pe° Ple
              the FMA) information    on mcancelled
                                          ±ght prafer  t0 tel1 and lost
                                                    membership
clubs of np03          h  tht central register. The FMA will inform
u d - S datp d P t ^ T   ? who have nominated them and also supply
up to-date details of invalid, lost or stolen cards. Thus, eac£



                                      20
club should have, for every match, details of members who are its
supporters and an up-to-date list of all cards that have been
invalidated before their expiry. The FMA will need to take a visw
on the frequency of the exchange of information between itself
and the clubs.


Withdrawal of membership and appeals

5. The FMA will make decisions about withdrawal of membership on
the criteria discussed in chapter 2. It will need to draw up
rules, in consultation with the clubs, on the circumstances in
which.a ban is to be automatic (eg in the case of ejection from
the ground) and for how long, and on the other cases in which it
will consider recommendations for banning from clubs. These rules
      also need to deal with the possibility of extending the
mandatory bans applied in the case of convictions, where the FMA
and the clubs consider that an offence is serious enough to
warrant an extended ban. These rules on withdrawal of membership
will be an integral part of the scheme when it is submitted for
approval to the Secretary of State.

6. In all cases where membership is withdrawn by the FMA for
periods Owher than mandatory periods the FMA may wish to consider
whether it should operate a procedure for appeals.


Responsibilities of the clubs

7. Football clubs would have day-to-day responsibilities for many
aspects of the scheme. They would,      in most cases, hold the
licence to admit spectators to their grounds but licences will
relate to grounds rather than clubs,       since a ground has a
physical existence which a club does not. The licence for the
ground ^ would,  however,   depend   on   the   club   meeting its
responsibilities under the legislation. and^,^E^er the scheme.

8. C l u b s '   responsibilities -under   the   scheme   may   include   the
following:


    a^   Membership applications and records

            i)      ensuring that application forms are complete and
                    that photographs are of the right person; passing
                    applications quickly to the FMA     for vetting;
                    issuing cards promptly (NB any other agency which
                    deals with applications will also have to meet
                    these requirements);

           ii)      supplying regularly up-to-date information about
                    lost and stolen cards and cancelled membership to
                    the FMA;




                                     21
           iii )   amending club records of members who are their
                    supporters and ensuring that their list of invalid
                    cards is up-to-date on receipt of information from
                    the FMA;

      b)   Dealing with offenders

             i)    prompt reporting of misbehaviour which may lead to
                   withdrawal of membership by the FMA;

            ii)    prompt action in response     to   FMA   decisions    on
                   withdrawal of membership;

      c)   Match arrangements

             i)    making adequate arrangements to prevent entry to
                   designated matches by spectators not in possession
                   of a valid membership card properly issued to
                   them;

            ii)    installation of the equipment required by            the
                   scheme and ensuring proper maintenance of it;

           iii)    making adequate arrangements       for   dealing   with
                   holders of rejected cards;                   -

            iv)    taking such precautions as are reasonable,           (as
                   they do now),     to cope with the arrival            of
                   last-minute crowds;

      d)   Staff

             i)    provision and training of sufficient staff to meet
                   all aspects of the club's responsibilities.


   9. The working party considered the case for requiring clubs to
   take other anti-hooliganism measures, in addition to those listed
   above, as a condition of the ground licence. The availability of
   C C T V , effective arrangements for segregating rival supporters and
   adequate stewarding have all been essential to the success of a
   package of anti-hooligan measures. On the other hand, it will
 1 also be essential to avoid an overlap between the requirements of
■| a certificate issued under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
 I and a licence related to the national membership scheme; if the
   two      were  to   overlap,  clubs  could   find  themselves  facing
 | conflicting demands, though of course local authorities would
 1 have to act within the boundaries of the national membership
   scheme legislation.

   10. The case for including a requirement on the availability of
   CCTV in the licence conditions may be a particularly strong one,
   since it does not fall within the Safety at Sports Grounds Act
   and is an essential tool in crowd control and the identification
   of troublemakers. Subject to that point, the working party took
   the view that, at least initially, the responsibilities of the
   clubs in respect of the scheme should be confined to those



                                    22
spelled out in paragraph 8 above.    The Secretary of State should
have the power to add further       conditions to a licence,    on
detailed arrangements for segregation, for example, if it becomes
clear -chat it would be helpful to do so.

11. The working party noted that a number of clubs had expressed
concern about the implications that the scheme would have     for
their arrangements for handling crowds, for example, in dealing
with people who support neither home nor away clubs or in opening
the gates before the end of a match to allow people to leave (and
as a consequence allowing others to enter). Given the variety of
arrangements adopted at different football grounds, issues of
this kind would need to be resolved by individual clubs in
consultation with the local police and the FMA.        There is,
however, no reason why the existence of membership cards should
pre-determine a club's    approach to supporters or change    its
existing segregation arrangements; cards could, moreover, help
clubs in implementing their present segregation arrangements. The
membership scheme will not prevent clubs from allowing people to       /
leave matches before the end but, in doing so, they will have to       j
take reasonable precautions, consistent with the need for safety,
to preclude the admission of people without membership cards.


Monitoring the scheme

12. The working party believes that the scheme should operate, as
far as possible, on the basis of co-operation between the clubs
and the FMA. There will, however, have to be arrangements for
monitoring the clubs' performance   and for a system of sanctions
to   be  applied   in   the   event of   failure   to   meet   their
responsibilities. As to who should perform this role, it may be
argued that if the FMA is to be responsible for the scheme as a
whole,  it should act as licensing authority,       and have full
responsibility for monitoring the c l u b s ' performance and for
taking action against those who do not carry out their duties
under the scheme. On the other hand, there may be advantage for
the Secretary of State to be the licensing authority, to act as
an independent arbiter of the clubs' performance and to take
corrective   action   in    certain circumstances.    The   football
authorities were strongly of the view that the latter was the
appropriate course.

13. One way in which the FMA and the Secretary of State might
share responsibility would be for the Secretary of State to
delegate the licensing function to the FMA, within a framework
which he would approve. He would retain a reserve power to direct
the authority to take action if he considered it essential, in
the event of a serious disorder or if he had reason to believe
that a ground should lose its licence. The Secretary of State
might also require the FMA to make annual reports to him about
its actions as licensing authority but, for the most part, he
would not seek to intervene. The working party did not reach
agreement on this issue and the phrase "licensing authority" is
used throughout this chapter.




                                 23
14. The licensing authority would set up a small part-time
inspectorate to monitor the introduction and operation of the
scheme and to advise on whether a ground should receive a licence
in the first place and whan appropriata on whether it should
subsequently be withdrawn. The inspectorate would need powers to
inspect and warn clubs about any failings in their operation of
the scheme. The working party would expect the inspectorate to be
drawn largely from ex-police officers or others with relevant
experience.

15. The FMA will itself be under a statutory duty to operate the
scheme satisfactorily.  In case it fails to do so, the Secretary
of State will need a power to terminate the scheme, so that he
may designate another body to take on the job. The working party
proposes that the Secretary of State should give at least six
months notice of termination and that this notice should expire
only on 1 May in any year (to give time for a new authority to
prepare for the following season).

16. Given the power of the Secretary of State to terminate the
scheme, the working party does not consider it necessary to
create any specific new sanctions to which the FMA should be
liable in respect of its duties in relation to the scheme; but it
will in any case be liable to action for breach of statutory duty
or to mandamus, if it fails to impose sanctions on clubs as
required by the scheme,     or to carry out its other duties
effectively.


Sanctions on clubs

17. The licensing authority will need to be satisfied that a club
is both capable and ready to carry out its responsibilities under
the scheme before a licence is issued for the ground. In the case
of a non-League club ground that is to be licensed, such as
Wembley, the licensing authority will need to be satisfied that
all the ground arrangements are satisfactory.       The licensing
authority should have discretion to attach conditions to the
grant of a licence and, once issued, the power to suspend, vary,
or revoke a licence if it appears that a club's failure to carry
out its responsibilities under the scheme is of sufficient
significance to put the effectiveness of the scheme at risk,
either at the club itself or nationally.

18. The suspension of a licence may be necessary in the event of
persistent or serious default. Thus, a persistent failure to deal
with offenders promptly or to maintain the scheme's machinery
would be grounds for suspension; so, too, would a serious case of
under staffing at a match.  The licensing authority would need to
warn a club before suspending a ground licence and give it time
to put right the fault or to make representations as to w h y the
licence should not be suspended. The licensing authority would
also need a power to suspend the licence without notice in an
emergency, subject to a right for the club to apply for the
suspension to be lifted as soon as possible thereafter.




                                24
19. The licensing authority might use its power to vary licences
either for individual grounds or for all, for example to add
requirements about segregation. It might also be necessary to
vary a licence in the case of a ground used by two clubs.   If a
licence is initially granted in respect of both clubs and one of
them fails to manage its membership arrangements properly, the
licensing authority might vary the licence so as to suspend the
use of the ground by the offending club, but to allow the other
to continue.

20. The power to revoke a licence completely, rather than suspend
it until a club's failings are put right, may be needed if a
ground is closed or a club goes into liquidation.    A club which
is relegated from the League may wish to have its licence
revoked.  Following revocation, a licence would only be restored
to a ground if the licensing authority was satisfied that the
requirements of the scheme were to be met.

21. The effect of suspending a club's licence would be to deny it
the right to admit spectators to its matches and it would,
therefore, be a financial penalty. Suspension of a licence would
not,  however, prevent clubs from playing home matches,, (and
fulfilling their obligations to the League etc), though they
would have to do so behind closed doors. The football authorities
felt that major sanctions of this sort must be for the Secretary
of State.


Financial oenalties

22. The working party envisages that the FMA should draw up a
structure of financial penalties which it would impose upon clubs
for minor breaches of the scheme.       Thus,  a club which was
regularly a day or two late in supplying information to the FMA
or was negligent in the content of the information it supplied
would not commit an offence serious enough to warrant the
suspension of its ground licence but would be liable to a fine
imposed by the responsible body.     The structure of penalties
would be approved by the Secretary of State as part of the
scheme.


Criminal offence

23. The working party recommends that it should be a criminal
offence for a club to flout     the provisions of the scheme by
admitting spectators to a designated match on a non-licensed
ground. There would have to be appropriate penalties for such an
offence.  Under parallel provisions of the      Safety at Sports
Grounds Act 1975, for example,  club officials who are held to be
liable can be    fined and/or     sentenced  to up   to two years
imprisonment.




                               25
Misbehaviour by a c l u b 's supporters

24. The working party does not believe that the question of
withdrawing a ground licence should automatically arise as a
direct result of the behaviour of a club's supporters, at either
home or away matches.     The club's   responsibilities  are  for
maintaining membership records, dealing with offenders, making
adequate match arrangements and employing adequate staff.      If
those responsibilities are all fulfilled satisfactorily,      and
supporters misbehave, it is not appropriate to penalise the club
but rather to identify and punish the supporters concerned.   The
Government representatives and the police believe that the effect
of the national membership scheme will be to make identification
easier and punishment more effective.

25. The working party has also considered whether it might be
appropriate for the FMA (or the Secretary of State) to have the
power to suspend the membership of all or some of the members of
the scheme who were one club's supporters, for example if there
were serious disorder amongst those supporters. A sanction of
this kind would, however, be indiscriminate in its effects, and
would  inevitably penalise far more innocent than guilty people.
The working party does not therefore consider that such a
sanction is appropriate.


Exemptions for clubs

26. The working party does not propose a specific power for the
FMA or the Secretary of State to exempt any club from the
requirements of the scheme. If the scheme is to achieve and
maintain credibility, it must apply equally to all.   All clubs
will have to satisfy the licensing authority that they are
capable of operating the scheme satisfactorily before they are
granted a licence.     If they are not ready by the date of
implementation, they will not be able to admit spectators after
that date.

27.  The  scheme   should, however,   allow  for  break-downs  of
machinery and other short-term emergencies beyond the club's
control.  In such cases, it should be open to the local police in
consultation with the club to decide that, in the interests of
public safety,   a match should go ahead without the normal
arrangements for checking membership cards at the point of entry
to the ground. It would remain an offence for a spectator to
attempt  to obtain admission to the match without a valid
membership card. The clubs would report all such emergencies to
the licensing authority and any club which appeared particularly
liable to failures of machinery (and could not demonstrate that
it had provided for a reasonable level of maintenance) or other
short-term emergencies would run the risk of having its ground
licence suspended.




                                    26
Data Protection Act 1984

28. The FMA and the clubs will need to register with the Data
Protection Registrar     (DPR),  and comply with the eight    Data
Protection Principles set out in the 1984 Act. When registering,
the FMA and clubs will be required to provide full details of the
data  that  they   will  be  holding,  the purpose  of  it    and,
importantly, the persons to whom it will or might be disclosed'.
It will also be essential for the scheme membership application
lorm to be drawn up so as to ensure that, an applicant is clear as
to why the information being sought is required and how it will
be used or disclosed.

29. Members will have the right to see and challenge the accuracy
of any computerised information held about them. The clubs and
the FMA will also have to ensure appropriate security measures to
guard against the loss, destruction or unauthorised access to, or
disclosure of, any such information.

30. The scheme, as envisaged, does reflect the Data Protection
Principles. ror example, the requirements on members to inform
clubs of changes inpersonal details, and to renew      their card
regularly, will help    avoid the register containing inaccurate
information or holding information for longer than is necessary.
The information required for scheme membership (Chapter 2) , and
that ^ to be transmitted in the case of a relevant criminal
conviction (Chapter 5) has also been reduced to the minimum
considered necessary for the effective operation of the scheme.

31. The principles of data protection may be unfamiliar to the
FMA  and   to many   of  the  clubs.  The  football authorities'
consultants will therefore need to seek the advice soon of the
Data Protection Registrar on how compliance with the protection
principles can best be achieved. The Registrar has a duty, where
appropriate, to encourage the development of codes of practice
for data users and the working party recommends that a 'duty be
placed on the FMA to draw up such a code.




                               27
CHAPTER 5:   NOTIFICATION OF OFFENCES
1. Chapter 2 explains the criteria which the working par^y
recommends for withholding or withdrawing membership of the
scheme. Conviction for a football-related offence would result m
automatic disqualification, for 5 years or 2 years depending on
the sentence imposed by the court.       In addition, Chaptar^
identifies circumstances in which the FMA should h a v e discretion
+-o add   to  these bans   and  to withdraw   membership,    within
guidelines   drawn up by the authority     and approved by      the
Secretary of State, from those whose behaviour is m      other ways
unacceptable.
2. The working party agreed that it was essential to the
effective administration .of the scheme that the rMA shoul
receive information promptly about those from whom membership
should  or may, be withdrawn.    This chapter considers how tnis
might be achieved, in relation to information which will be known
to the courts and the police.


Discretionary withdrawal of membership
3. In Chapter 2, the working party recommends that the FMA should
consider withdrawing membership from those who have been ejected
from the ground, usually by the police, for breach of a club s
g r o u n d " ” regulations';' and from those who have b e e n arrested on a
club's           premises ■ for '”an~ allegecl. criminal offence.    In  sue
circumstances the police should draw the attention of a club
official,           who will be designated        for the purpose,    to  the
circumstances of the ejection or the arrest, so that the club may
note the membership and other details of the member at the time,
and thereafter report those details to the FMA.              A brief standard
report may be devised for the purpose.

 4. The football authorities considered that this should be a
 statutory procedure, but the Government representatives and the
 police considered this unnecessary and inappropriate.  The above
 outline will need to be considered in more detail by the police
 nationally and the football authorities.      It may be useful,
 however, to make it clear within the terms _of the scheme that
 ejection from or arrest on club premises will render a member
 liable to disqualification from the scheme.


 Mandatory withdrawal of membership
 5.  The FMA must receive          information about convictions          for
 football-related offences.         The working party considered          two
 issues:


         (i) Who     should   determine      whether     an    offence
                   "football-related"?
      (ii)    Who should   notify    the   fact   of   conviction   to   the
              FMA?

5. The football authorities considered it should be incumbent
uDon the police to notify all .convictions for football-related
offences to the FMA.   (Indeed they would strongly prefer to be
notified of convictions for all offences of violence against the
person,  but  the  Government  representatives  and  the  police
considered this to be too wide - see Chapter 2, paragraphs 24 &
25 ).
7. There are two difficulties with the proposal to give the
police   this  duty.   First,  police  records   are regarded  as
confidential, and have been disclosed only on grounds of national
security, for the protection of the vulnerable, and to assist in
the administration of justice. Disclosing them to assist the
football   authorities   with a membership    scheme would  be  a
significant step, and one which could have wide implications.  It
is, however, important to point out that, once the scheme is
established, all' that would be disclosed is the fact of a recent
football-related conviction which might well have been reported
in the local press anyway.

8. The second difficulty is that it would be left to the police
to determine what is a football-related offence as defined in the
legislation.  Interpretation of this statutory definition is most
unlikely to give    rise to problems    in respect of offences
committed in or near the grounds.  The working party considers it
is most important, however, that the definition should include
offences committed on the way to or from matches, such as those
arising from incidents at . railway stations, motorway service
areas, or at towns and villages en route.     These incidents may
occur  some considerable distance    from a ground,    and   at a
considerable time before or after a match.

9. The decision as to whether an offence is football-related may
therefore give rise to difficult questions of mixed fact and law
which the interests of justice may suggest should properly be
decided by a court. The Government representatives and the police
recommend that the mandatory withdrawal of membership should
apply to those who have been convicted of offences which have
been declared by a court      to be   football—related within   a
statutory definition.

10. The working party envisages that the           prosecution would be
responsible,  in all   appropriate cases,          tor seeking   such a
declaration at the time of conviction.

 11. If this recommendation is accepted, it affects the question
 of who should be responsible for notifying details of the
 conviction to the FMA.  To involve the police would seem to add
 an unnecessary link in the chain, the more so as the police no
 longer attend court as a matter of routine since the insti uution
 of the Crown Prosecution Service.   T h e most efficient solution
 appears to be for the courts to notify the FMA of the facts of
 conviction.  Although this would represent a new burden for the
 courts, they would be freed from the tasks arising from the



                                    29
existing football exclusion order provisions.      The scheme would
render these redundant.  Thus, the courts would no longer have to
consider in relation to a football-related offence whether an
exclusion order should be made under section 30 of the Public
Order Act 1986; for what period (section 32); and whether to
allow an application to terminate such an order (section 33). For
the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, the implications
would not seem to be significantly different from those arising
from the existing exclusion o r d e r .provisions.

12. The working party recommends that the question of whether an
offence is football-related should be determined by the courts.
We  further   recommend  that  the  Government  should  initiate
discussions with the courts, the Crown Prosecution Service and
the police in order to find the most efficient means of ensuring
that the convictions are notified to the FMA.


Withholding membership

13. The previous paragraphs relate to disqualification       from
membership when the scheme is established.  It is most important,
however,  to ensure that troublemakers are excluded from the
scheme from the outset.   In processing the many applications for
initial membership of the scheme, therefore, the FMA will need to
ensure that they have as much of the necessary information as
possible about previous misconduct.

14. The FMA would have fairly ready access to some of the
information.    The courts,   for example,   send copies of all
exclusion orders to the Football Association.       The football
authorities confirmed that they and the clubs have also collected
a considerable amount of information, for example from other
clubs or through the media, upon which they already acted against
hooligans.

15.  The working party considered what steps may be       taken  to
supplement this information.    Police records do not distinguish
football-related offences,    and it would not be possible to
identify all of them.       There are also issues of principle
involved (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above).      It may be possible,
however, to invite the Association of Chief Police Officers to
ask forces to keep records of convictions,      for example     for
offences occurring on club premises, and to notify these to the
FMA   before  the   initial  applications  are   processed.     The
information would cover the name, date of birth, address, offence
and sentence.    Similarly, the police could be asked to draw   the
attention of clubs to persons whom they were ejecting from,      or
arresting at, a ground,     so that these details too would be
available to the FMA from the clubs at the outset of the scheme.

16. The working party recommends that the Government should
determine with the police and the football authorities suitable
arrangements for ensuring that troublemakers are not admitted to
the scheme.  An early announcement by the Government should make




                                30
it c .ear that previous convictions for football-related offences
may >e taken into account in deciding who shall be disqualified
from membership.




                                 31
CHAPTER 6: TECHNOLOGY AND TIMING

1. The Government representatives on the working party are
satisfied that available information technology is fully capable
of providing for the implementation of the national membership
scheme- The working party was advised that the principles of
applying technology to read membership cards electronically are
well understood and relatively simple. Ths football authorities
were however not completely satisfied that the technology was
available for a workable scheme. They are not committed to
accepting paragraphs 3-17 below, and will wish to be guided by
their recently appointed consultants.

2. Both the Department of the Environment and the Football League
have received large numbers of unsolicited letters offering
technological  and commercial   solutions   for the   scheme. The
working party did not see it as its task to make a choice from
these offers but, in order to consider the different ways in
which the scheme might be approached, we invited four companies
with different market specialities to make a formal presentation
on the scheme: a card manufacturer; a security access control
company; a computer systems company; and a Smartcard systems
supplier. This chapter draws out a number of common features of
the technology available and discusses a number of technical
options    as   drawn   up   by   the    Central    Computer  and
Telecommunications Agency.


Central register

3. Details of all members of the national membership scheme will
be held on a central      register.  The register will be     the
responsibility of the Football Membership Authority though it may
employ someone else to run it. The register will be used for two
main functions:


   1.   to maintain a full listing of all members of the scheme;
        to receive    applications   for membership     and to    apply
        computerised security checks on them, to protect against
        accepting   known   hooligans;       multiple applications   to
        different clubs; repeated use of one address; and other
        possible abuses (there are sophisticated search techniques
        available but their cost is unlikely to be justified by
        the benefits they might b r i n g );

   2.   to build up and maintain a "national referral file" on all
        known   hooligans,  lost   and  stolen   cards,  cancelled
        membership and other invalid cards, a regularly up-dated
        copy of which would be fed into each club's own computer.




                                   32
Computer requirements
4. Every club will need a computer of its own to hold the list of
members who are its supporters and to receive the national
referral file but it would only need to be a micro computer. To
save repeat programming costs this microcomputer should be a
standard type across clubs. Many clubs will already have such a
computer for accounting, management and membership purposes.

5    There      would  be   no   need   for  expensive   permanent
telecommunications links between each club and the FMA or an
aaency running the central register, on its behalf (called, in
this chapter, "the central bureau")* The exchange of information
between the central bureau and each club could be managed through
small computer disks sent by registered or secure post.^ These
disks would only need to be sent once or twice a week (subject to
the F M A 's views). In the unlikely event that the latest version
of the referral file failed to arrive in time for a given match
then the previous version already held in the c l u b 's computer
could be used. Alternatively each club could, at marginal extra
expense, have standby dial-up facilities to the central bureau or
could, at more expense, subscribe to a telecommunication service.
This would make it possible to exchange information much more
rapidly, to cater for matches held throughout the week.

6. The processing requirement of the central bureau is expected
to be modest but will reauire an appropriate computer to support
the potential size of database. The cost of such a computer would
be difficult to justify for only occasional use and the obvious
solution   is  to  employ   a commercial   bureau ^ or  the  card
manufacturer. The bureau must have adequate security to safeguard
the referral file from tampering or disclosure.


Machinery at turnstiles

7. A member seeking admission to a match would hand his card,
with money or ticket, to the turnstile operator (this avoids the
risk of vandalism if spectators were permitted to insert the
cards in the readers themselves). Each turnstile house would be
equipped with a card reader and the card would be read to check
that it was valid (see chapter 2). There is a consensus among
potential ^upp%iers that very little time would be needed for the
card to        read - one of the companies which gave a presentation
to the Working 1 party speculated that this might perhaps be as
little  'ijs '^''-•^^ond for each card in addition to the time now
taken t<f>'fenterXthe ground. Nor would there need to be any better
lighting in JjCi^nstiles (a point of concern raised by the c l u b s )
than i sa l f ^ a d y needed to receive money.

 g. Cards will be checked against the referral file (of invalid
 cards) held in the local computer (the card reader would of
 course distinguish between invalid cards and damaged cards which
 it could not read). This means that either each card reader must
 be cabled to the local computer; or, if intelligent card readers
 with sufficient memory were used, a copy of the referral file
 could be loaded from the local computer into each card reader



                                  33
before each match, making turnstiles self sufficient. Options
which enable card readers to be portable are attractive because
they do not require permanent cabling to the local computer.
Cabling is expensive and time consuming. The cable would also be
vulnerable,  particularly when the ground is unoccupied,      to
deliberate vandalism. Burying the cable or use of specially
secure conduit would increase cost and installation time.

9. Another advantage of portable self sufficient card readers is
that they could be taken to non-league grounds. Card readers with
their own intelligence and memory - hence portable - are in every
day use but no company has claimed to have one currently in
production which is sufficiently powerful to meet football's
needs. A number of companies feel confident they could develop a
sufficiently powerful, battery driven reader quickly (not all
turnstile houses have mains electricity).

10. One disadvantage of not connecting card readers physically to
the local computer is that during match entry no record can be
built up and made available to all turnstiles on which cards have
been used that day. Cards might then be "passed back" for reuse
unless the cards themselves can be marked physically or can
receive information electronically. This is a major consideration
for the technology of the scheme, given the need to avoid a
card-holder passing his card back to someone who might have been
banned. Only Smartcards and "water mark magnetic stripe" cards
can be updated electronically by the card reader while being
checked and so avoid the problems of "passing back" without
requiring cabling.


Programming

11. The programming of the local computer to hold lists of
members who are a club's supporters and the national referral
file, is well within the scope of basic programming techniques
and should not cause any problems.      Programming the on-line
interrogation of the referral file during match entry may require
some special programming to handle the accumulative load at the
larger grounds. This will require investigation but should not be
a major problem.


Membership cards

12. The working party is not recommending any particular type of
membership card. Each type has its advantages and detailed
discussions with suppliers have not yet been held. Without firm
commercial bids the costs and timescales are speculative (and the
costs of cards quoted below also depend on their production in
large quantities). However the following comparisons may be made.

13. Barcodes, consisting of black stripes, are relatively easy to
forge. Someone determined to beat the system would only need to
alter the visible black stripes on his card for it to look the
same as any valid card. Barcode readers are more expensive than
magnetic stripe readers and reputedly less reliable in exposed



                                34
weather conditions. Barcode cards however do have the advantage
of being robust and can be read even if the card is badly bent.
Only a few suDDliers have suggested barcode cards- These cards
with name, photograph, club and other information (such as
advertising) would cost about 50p each.

14. Most suppliers have suggested magnetic stripe cards. The
encoded information is written electronically on a strip of
magnetic material. A disadvantage of these cards is that they are
not secure; the recorded information can be lost accidentally or
destroyed with a magnet. On the other hand, the technology is a
familiar one, in use on credit cards, and magnetic stripe cards
are the only cards which have an ISO standard. This might be
important if the scheme was to be used in Europe or exported, to a
wider market at a later date. The cost with photograph etc is
about £1 each.
15. Smartcards contain a single chip computer which (in most
cases) is accessed through gold pins on the surface of the card.
The chip is mounted either top left or centre left of the card.
There is no ISO standard. Provided the same physical position is
used throughout the national membership scheme, however, the chip
position is not important. Smartcards are very secure. The memory
is erased if the card is tampered with. Smartcards use dip rather
than swipe readers. Dip readers are operationally reliable since
they are not dependent on the correct speed of swipe but the
cards do need careful placing in the reader to line up the gold
pins. Smartcards may take very slightly longer to ^use at the
turnstiles. An alternative Smartcard is available which does not
require contact pins.
16. The major advantage of Smartcards is that they can receive
and store information about the matches which the holder has
attended. This prevents multiple use of the same card and
overcomes the major problem of using portable intelligent card
readers. Smartcards can also hold more information about the
holder, which may have wider commercial advantages, and they
could be extended to cover other sports and activities. The
disadvantages are: the use of Smartcards in the UK is still in
its infancy (but growing); no card reader yet in production is
powerful enough for a fully secure portable system (though the
manufacturers say that one could be produced quickly); there is
no experience in using Smartcards in a hostile environment; and
the time through the turnstiles will have to be checked
carefully. The price with photograph is about £5.

17. A type of magnetic stripe, called water mark magnetic stripe,
is becoming more widely accepted. This card is physically the
same as a normal magnetic stripe card except that the stripe has
an area where the magnetically held information is permanently
bonded and cannot be erased. The stripe can also receive other
information while the card is in the card reader. The cost is not
known but is expected to be about half the cost of a Smartcard
whilst having most of the advantages.




                                35
Marketing opportunities

18. The Government representatives believe that the introduction
of   the  national   membership  scheme   offers  a  number   of
opportunities including:-


   a ) improving club procedures

       provision of automatic entrance        statistics   by     chosen
       criteria eg by age, home address

   -   reduction of fraud at the turnstiles (and, in the case of
       Smartcards allow clubs to check that season tickets are
       used only by the member to whom they were issued);

       availability of local computer for      accounting,      payroll,
       word processing, management support;

   b) commercial exploitation

       availability (subject to the rules of the Data Protection
       Act 1984) of mailing lists for sale to pools companies,
       mail order houses, sports shops etc

       advertising on the membership card

   -   arranging discount schemes with local traders or other
       schemes to enhance the attractions of going to a football
       match
       opportunities for _loca2^otteries and other direct mailing
       schemes.


The football authorities do not share this belief and see little
commercial advantage or improvement to clubs' administration
stemming from the scheme.

19. The basic concepts and technology for a national membership
scheme are available. Different technical options, have different
timing and financial implications. The FMA will have to choose
between options, taking account of the timetable considerations
discussed in the next chaprer. Opinions were divided on the
marketing potential of the scheme. The working party accepted
that this could .only be established once the views of the
consultants and the football authorities' commercial advisers had
been received. It should be noted that, in relation to the Data
Protection Act, members should be given the opportunity to opt
out of commercial uses of their information. Further guidance on
this issue will be included in the proposed code of practice
(Chapter 4 paragraph 31).




                                   36
Timing of the scheme's introduction

20. The implementation of the national membership scheme will be
affected by the technical options discussed in the previous
chapter. The tighter the timetable which the Government imposes,
the more     immediate will   be  the   demands   on   the  football
authorities to commit financial and manpower resources to the
preparation of the scheme if they wish to avoid the closure of
football grounds to the public. The working party accepted that^a
detailed timetable for implementation cannot be imposed in
advance of the consultants report and decisions on the detail of
the   scheme.   The project management     arrangements which    the
football authorities choose to employ will have their own
implications    for   timing. Three   alternative    approaches  a—e
discussed as indicated below:


   i.   "Do it Yourself
   The FMA could, with some consultancy help, buy in the hardware
   and software itself and integrate and manage the whole
   project,   subcontracting out cabling and other works       as
   necessary.


   ii. Contract out the technical work

   The FMA to retain financial control but to contract out all of
   the systems work to a prime contractor-. This prime contractor,
   probably from a "systems house" would act on behalf of a
   consortium which -covered collectively all necessary skills and
   products.


   iii. Handover to a service management company

   The FMA to make a contract with a service management company.
   The FMA would only need to specify its requirements eg the
   start date of the entire scheme; the degree of security
   required; the criteria for issuing membership cards, maximum
   delay at turnstiles etc. It would then be the contractual
   responsibility of the service management company to meet these
   requirements.


21. The working party considers that implementation by August
1389 for all 92 League clubs would be v e r y .difficult to achieve
but the Government's view was that it was just possible given the
right commitment. The working party does not consider that a
phased implementation of the scheme, say a Division at a time, is>
worth pursuing, because of the danger of displacing hooligans
from clubs in the scheme to those outside during the phasing
process. Whatever target for full implementation is set, it would
be in the interests of all parties for the consultants report to
be received, and the football authorities and the clubs to begin




                                  37
their preparations for the scheme, as soon as possible.   The
working party considered the possibility of introducing   whe
scheme in mid season.

  Dear Mr Mackrell

  TWIN TOWNS FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT

  Thank you for your correspondence relating to a proposal by Willy Birkemeyer,
  Bochum, that the 1st Division football clubs Bochum FC, Donetsk-Shaktyer,
  §nd Sheffield Wednesday FC should take part in a football tournament.

 I am sure that this would be a most interesting contribution to the three-way
 city links, and one which I would be happy to support in principle. However,
 as I am sure you realise, the City Council could not undertake to provide
 financial support to an undertaking by professional football clubs such as
 these.  It would therefore be up to the clubs themselves to ensure that the
 financial arrangements and any remuneration to players involved were
 appropriate, and that these matters were agreed at an early stage.

 Having said that, I do hope you will give careful consideration to becoming
 involved in this project, as it would doubtless attract considerable
 attention to both the club and the City's international links.


 Yours sincerely

Mr. H. F. McGee,
Chairman,
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, pic,
Hillsborough,
SHEFFIELD.     S6 1SW


Dear Bert,

Thank you for your letter of the 11 January with regard to your  request   for
Council  funding towards the re-roofing of the South Stand.  Perhaps you have
already seen my reply to your comments in the press on this matter,    but   I
thought I ought to, at least, formally indicate that the Council has no funds
with which to assist any football club in order to redevelop its ground.

You referred to the Council having approached Sheffield United,  although in
fact  the  truth of the matter is that Sheffield United first approached us
about the possibility of their moving to the Don Valley Stadium.  I want  to
emphasise  that  in no way would we be offering United a preferential scheme
whereby Council money was going to support them.

If United wanted to pursue this proposal then they would have to come    to an
agreement with   the Council   about   them paying for any adaptations to the
ground that they wanted to see and also an agreement about  the   rental   they
would give to the Council.   Presumably United might be willing to do this in
order to release the value of the Bramall Lane site and help clear the C l u b ’s
debts.   Of course, this would mean that the overall deal was to the benefit
of United, but it would also be to the benefit of the Council   and no    money
would pass from the Council to United.

To emphasise    the fact that the Council are not simply looking to put money
into any football club, if United decided not  to move   to the Don Valley
Stadium then we would be looking to see whether we could accommodate other
sports such as Rugby League or American Football on a similar basis  of  them
being prepared to pay a rental for the use of the ground and help towards its
overall upkeep.

I hope this reassures you that in no way are the Council giving preferential
treatment to United.  I am sure you do not need any reassurance that I a m not
giving preferential treatment to United; indeed I have   some difficulty    in
convincing some of my colleagues that the opposite is not the case.

Yours sincerely,


C. J. C. BETTS

      Dear Clive,

              Through local newspapers readers are told that Sheffield City Council
      have approached Sheffield United Football Club with a view to realising on their
      property in Bramall Lane, and to use a new stadium in the Don Valley
      redevelopment for their football requirements.

              I am quite sure that our Local Authority will see it gets a proper
      return on any property rented out for such a purpose.

              If the Local Authority is in a generous mood towards football in
      general it might consider affording us the cost of re-roofing our South Stand!?
      Today's "ball park" figure for undertaking the re-roofing is £1.5m sterling.

                  With best wishes.

                                                           Yours sincerely,

                                                          Chair: MEGS Committee

The meeting was chaired by Councillor CJC Betts.

It was agreed by both Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday that
it was not desirable to have turnstiles directly on to the main roads.

The Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday, Mr Bert McGee, stated that the
main problems of football hooliganism occurred outside the grounds
and not inside.  He said that this was a reflection on society generally
and not specifically associated with football.

The Police representative, Assistant Chief Constable Walter Jackson,
said that in a recent Working Party on football hooliganism it was
found that there were few serious disturbances inside the grounds and
that nearly all of them occurred outside.       He voiced concern about
Clause 16 of Part 2 of the Bill which sets out the functions of reporting
agencies.  He wanted to know who the agency was which would be receiving
the reports.   He did not think it desirable for offenders to be queuing
up at Police Stations to report on Saturday afternoons when the Police
could be better occupied policing the general community.

He voiced concern as to how all the supporters could get through             the
turnstiles in time for the beginning of the football match.
                                 - 2 -



He also referred to a membership card scheme operating at Luton Football
Club relating to away fans, whereby supporters were allowed to invite
a maximum of three guests to the ground. This scheme has been successful
in Luton and could perhaps be used elsewhere. Assistant Chief Constable
Jackson is attending a meeting concerning this alternative scheme on
13 February, and will have more information on it after that date.

The Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday said that Luton Football Club was
not representative of most football clubs and could certainly not be
likened to the Sheffield football clubs.     He again reiterated that
the problem was outside the ground and that the proposed Bill was wrong
in principle and should be resisted as it contravened the freedom of
the individual.

The Chairman of Sheffield United said that there was now better liaison
with the Police than ever before.      The proposed scheme in the Bill
would increase the Club's financial problems whilst solving nothing.

The Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday said that clubs have already spent
a lot of their own money to solve this problem inside their grounds.
The number of arrests this year had been halved.

A representative from the Football Supporters Association, Mr David
Dow, said that the proposed new Bill would certainly make matters worse.
He said that if football fans could not get inside the ground to watch
the match then they would vent their frustrations elsewhere outside
the ground rather than peacefully watching the match.    If the new Bill
were to be implemented, then there would be a problem of football matches
starting late because of the length of time it took the supporters
to get through the turnstiles.

The Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday, Mr Graham Mackrell, gave an example
of when people arrived at football matches.       It appears that about
40% of spectators arrive in the last five minutes before the game is
due to start and into the first five minutes of the game which would
therefore cause a large build up of spectators queuing to get through
the turnstiles in the last ten minutes.

The representative from the Football Supporters Association mentioned
that there is not the available computer technology to get people through
the turnstiles on time for the beginning of the match as they would
have to go through an identification procedure first of all, followed
by the payment procedure afterwards.      It often happens,   apparently,
that if the crowds cannot get in in time for the beginning of the match
then the Police order that the gates be opened and the spectators be
allowed in anyway without the necessary checks.     The mechanics of the
proposed new scheme just     would not work.   If there are 95 turnstiles
then there would have to     be 95 Police manning them.There   would then
be the problem that if one person was apprehended and taken away into
a detention room," there would have to be another Policeman on standby
to take his place.

The Police representative stated that, up to 28 January of this year,
there have at the Sheffield Wednesday matches been 26 arrests of which
15 were outside the ground.   This is a percentage of 0.23% of the whole
crowd. Seven of these arrests were for possession of drugs, ie unrelated
to football hooliganism.     These figures illustrated that it is a very
small proportion of people that were arrested inside theground.     None
of the arrests this year were for assault.
                                 - 3 -




The Chairman of Sheffield United said that most turnstile attendants
were of an    average age of 60 and when presented    with an identity
photograph through a glass screen would not be able to accurately say
whether or not that was the photograph of the person passing through.
He reiterated again that most football grounds were built a long time
ago, on busy main roads, so that the problem of congestion created
by fans waiting to get in would be increased further if the new system
were to be implemented.

The Chairman of    Sheffield Wednesday then brought up the question of
computerisation.   The new Bill could not be implemented without the
use of computers which were not 100% reliable.    The problems mentioned
so far would occur assuming that the computers were working normally.
If the computer system went down, for example as a result of a power
cut, then the problem of congestion, waiting times and crowd aggravation
would be very much increased.

The Chairman of Sheffield United mentioned that only    last week a power
cut had affected their computer system.

Mr S S Prasad, the representative from Environmental Health, said that
there was very little room to increase the number of turnstiles at
either of the two football grounds in Sheffield.    He suggested perhaps
the implementation of the queuing system which operate- at most post
offices whereby there is one queue until the very end when each person
uses a different service point.     Both football club chairmen did not
think this style of queuing would work.

The Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday pointed out that, bearing in mind
human nature, if the Police were to order that people be let in once
without going through the necessary procedures, then next time people
would turn up late and expect the same thing to happen again in the
event of congestion.    This would therefore defeat the purpose of the
proposed new system.   Mr McGee said that the Government intended that
the two stages of admission, namely verification of identity and payment,
should be done in one area and that it would only take two seconds
longer than the present system.     He said that the two stages would
take much longer than two seconds extra and would be best done at two
separate turnstiles.   It would not be possible to have an extra bank
of turnstiles at either of the football grounds because of the cost
and lack of space.    A firm of consultants, namely Arthur Young, have
been appointed by the Football Association to work out the details
of the new scheme including the anticipated length of time the new
procedure would take.    They will provide the Council with a copy of
Arthur Young's report as soon as possible.

Councillor Betts mentioned that we already have a Code of Practice
in Sheffield relating to the football clubs which was working very
well.   He suggested that the football clubs should write down what
they have already achieved in Sheffield via the Code of Practice.

The Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday said that most clubs have already
drawn up a Code of Practice and indeed the Football League itself had
its own Code of Practice.    He also emphasised that the cost of the
proposed new scheme should not be overlooked.     He stated that the
implementation of the new scheme would bankrupt most clubs including
the Sheffield clubs.
                                - 4 -


The Chairman of Sheffield United said that it should be emphasised
that in the last five years most clubs, including their own, had done
a lot to improve their relationship with the community as a whole and
to encourage young members to come to football matches as well as other
activities, including for example the Junior Blades Club, allowing
the Community to use the football club gymnasium and by providing family
areas at football matches.    People will be deterred from joining the
club if they have to have an identity card, and indeed many members
have already written to him saying that they will not continue going
to football matches if they have to have an identity card.     This will
obviously cause substantial financial loss.

Mr Dow from the Football Supporters Association said that football
crowds were on the increase again now and that the number of arrests
had decreased. These improvements would be spoilt by the new Bill.

The Police representative endorsed this.    He said that during the last
four years there had been a good liaison between the Police and the
football clubs and that the proposed Bill would only have a marginal
effect on the problem of football hooliganism.

The Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday said that the Bill must be modified
at the Committee stage.

The meeting was concluded by Councillor Betts who suggested that the
Code of Practice should be looked at again and the Arthur Young report
be studied when it is available.    He also added that the note of the
meeting and a note of the timetable for the Bill would be circulatsd
by the Council.    In addition, the Council's Licensing Officer, David
Bownes, would be contacting both clubs Secretaries to co-ordinate the
clubs' responses and the Council's regarding the practical implications
of the Bill's proposals from a Safety of Sports Grounds basis.      The
idea being to confront the Government with as much practical evidence
regarding the undesirability of the Bill's proposals as possible.
To this end, the clubs agreed to forward a copy of a statistical survey
by Manchester United of the patterns of crowds attendance.

It was agreed that, in addition to the above exchanges of information,
the parties would exchange all other relevant information using the
Council to do so and that a further meeting be arranged in due course.

     Dear Cline

     Many thanks for your letter of 1 March.   1 have already tried
     getting the Government to accept the idea of allowing the kind of
     scheme you mention to take the place of their fatuous schema, but
     it is to no avail.  However, use will find another way and then it
     will be over to our good comrades in the Commons 1

Dear

FOOTBALL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME

I am writing as Leader of Sheffield City Council, but also a keen   football
supporter,  to raise   the possibility of a way forward in opposition to the
Government’s Football Membership S c heme.

In Sheffield we have formed a joint working party between the Council,   with
its responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Ground Act, both football clubs
- Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United, South Yorkshire Police Authority
and the Football Supporters Association.

At   our   first meeting we agreed that the football clubs, the police and the
local authority would work together to draw up a code of good practice with
regard    to control   of crowds    at football grounds.   In essence, working
relationships are already extremely good between the organisations   concerned
and what we will be         doing  is to write  these up and also fill in any
additional points which the various organisations feel to be appropriate. We
will     also,   hopefully,   reach agreement with  the Football   Supporters’
Association on these .
                                      - 2 -


My suggestion to you is that, when this work is completed,      hopefully within
the next two to three w e e k s , we will then have a Code of Good Practice based
on real experience at local level of clubs who have now virtually      eliminated
crowd problems    and  that this might well be taken up at national level.
Instead of the ridiculous proposal of a football membership scheme, we      would
then be able     to put forward, in considerable detail, a suggestion that all
clubs adopted this Code of Practice, together with their local authority      and
the police    authority.   This would      give us a clear alternative to the
Government’s proposals rather than simply, what might      in  some quarters   be
construed as,   a negative opposition.

If you think    this way forward is an appropriate one I would be pleased to
forward to you our Code of Practice as soon as it is drawn up.  I would   like
to inform you I have already invited Colin Moynihan on two or three occasions
to come to Hillsborough in order to see how crowd control operations are   put
into effect with a great deal        of success.   He  initially accepted my
invitation, which had the support of both the Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday
and the Chief Constable, but then withdrew due to pressure of work.      As an
alternative it might be appropriate to try and invite a number of national
spokespersons for the various football bodies to Hillsborough if a semi-final
takes place there this year, to launch an agreed Code of Practice,   and   try
and take   the initiative away from the Government, showing that football can
actually deal with its own problems.

Yours sincerely,

I was very surprised indeed to receive your memo of the  10th February   on
this matter.     I had assumed following my      discussions with the City
Treasurer and Directors of United that they were now going to be talking to
us  about what their requirements would be if they chose to move to the Don
Valley Stadium.

Please could you try and liaise on this matter as I do think time is moving
on and we ought to at least have some idea whether the move is a practical
possibility.

      The meeting was chaired by Councillor Clive Betts.

      It was agreed by both Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday that it was not
      desirable to have turnstiles directly onto the main roads.

      The Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday, Mr. Bert McGee, stated that the main
      problems of football hooliganism occurred outside the grounds and not inside.
      He said that this was a reflection on society generally and not specifically
      associated with football.

      The Police representative, Assistant Chief Constable Walter Jackson, said that
      in a recent working party on football hooliganism it was found that there were
      few serious disturbances inside the grounds and that nearly all of them occurred
      outside.  He voiced concern about Clause 16 of Part 2 of the Bill which sets out
      the functions of reporting agencies.   He wanted to know who the agency was which
      would be receiving the reports.   He did not think it desirable for offenders to
      be queuing up at football grounds^ to report on Saturday afternoons when the
S.1
  ,   Police could be better occupied policing the general community.

      He voiced concern as to how all the supporters could get through the turnstiles
      in time for the beginning of the football match.

      He also referred to a membership card scheme operating at Luton Football Club
      relating to away fans, whereby supporters were allowed to invite a maximum of
      three guests to the ground.  This scheme has been successful in Luton and could
      perhaps be used elsewhere.  Assistant Chief Constable Jackson is attending a
      meeting concerning this alternative scheme on the 13th February, and will have
      more information on it after that date.
The Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday said that Luton Football Club was not
representative of most football clubs and could certainly not be likened to the
Sheffield football clubs.  He again reiterated that the problem was outside the
ground and that the proposed Bill was wrong in principle and should be resisted
as it contravened the freedom of the individual.

The Chairman of Sheffield United said that there was now better liaison with the
Police than ever before.  The proposed scheme in the Bill*would increase the
Club's financial problems whilst solving nothing.

The Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday said that clubs have already spent a lot of
their own money to solve this problem inside their grounds.  The number of
arrests this year had been halved.

A representative from the Football Supporters Association, Mr. David Dow, said
that the proposed new Bill would certainly make matters worse.  He said that if
football fans could not get inside the ground to watch the match then they would
vent their frustrations elsewhere outside the ground rather than peacefully
watching the match.  If the new Bill were to be implemented, then there would be
a problem of football matches starting late because of the length of time it
took the supporters to get through the turnstiles.

The Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday, Mr. Graham Mackrell, gave an example of
when people arrived at football matches.  It appears that about 40% of
spectators arrive in the last five minutes before the game is due to start and
into the first five minutes of the game which would therefore cause a large
build up of spectators queuing to get through the turnstiles in the last ten
minutes.

The representative from the Football Supporters Association mentioned that there
is not the available computer technology to get people through the turnstiles on
time for the beginning of the match as they     would have to go through an
identification procedure first of all, followed by the payment procedure
aftlwards.  It often happens, apparently, that if the crowds cannot get in in
time for the beginning of the match then the Police order that the gates be
opened and the spectators be allowed in anyway without the necessary checks.
The mechanics of the proposed new scheme just would not work. If there are 95
turnstiles then there would have to be 95 Police manning them. There would then
be the problem that if one person was apprehended and taken away into a
detention room, there would have to be another Poli ceman ojj_standby to take his
place.
                                                       J S   )
The Police representative stated that, up to the 28£h/January of this year,
there have at the Sheffield Wednesday matches b^mj<f26 arrests of which 15 were
outside the ground.  This is a percentage of Q .23% / of the whole crowd. Seven of
these arrests were for possession of drugs, i.e., unrelated to football
hooliganism.  These figures illustrated that it is a very small proportion of
people that were arrested inside the ground.   None of the arrests this year were
for assault.

The Chairman of Sheffield United said that most turnstile attendants were of an
average age of 60 and when presented with an identity photograph through a glass
screen would not be able to accurately say whether or not that was the
photograph of the person passing through.  He reiterated again that most
football grounds were built a long time ago, on busy main roads, so that the
problem of congestion created by fans waiting to get in would be increased
further if the new system were to be implemented.
                                                       -   3-




              The Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday then brought up the question of
              computerisation.  The new Bill could not be implemented without the use of
              computers which were not 100% reliable.  The problems mentioned so far would
              occur assuming that the computers were working normally.  If the computer system
              went down, for example as a result of a power cut, then the problem of
              congestion, waiting times and crowd aggravation would be very much increased.

              The Chairman of Sheffield United mentioned that only last week a power cut had
              affected their computer system.                      i t /                     H
                                                           t-W   ^          'riV't   L A -   oU V ‘
              The—Counci l 1s —Sa£pfy Tnspeefre?, Mr. S. S. Prasad/ said that there was very
              little room to increase the number of turnstiles at either of the two football
              grounds in Sheffield.     He suggested perhaps the implementation of the queuing
              system which operate at most post offices whereby there is one queue until the
              very end when each person uses a different service point.      Both football club
              chairmen did not think this style of queuing would work.

               The Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday pointed out that bearing in mind human
               nature, if the Police were to order that people be let in once without going
               through the necessary procedures, then next time^ people would turn liMand expect
               the same thing to happen again in the event of congestion.     This would therefore
               defeat the purpose of the proposed new system.     Mr. McGee said that the
               Government intended that the two stages of admission, namely verification of
               identity and payment, should be done in one area and that it would only take two
               seconds longer than the present system.     He said that the two stages would take
              much longer than two seconds extra and would be best done at two separate
               turnstiles.     It would not be possible to have an extra bank of turnstiles at
               either of the football grounds because of the cost and lack of spgce.       fiym of*
A   _     i _ -man agem en t consultants, namely Arthur Young, have been appointed ^ j
        v     Wednesday to work out the details of the new scheme including the anticipated
               length of time the new procedure would take.     They will provide the Council with
               a copy of Arthur Young's report as soon as possible.

              Councillor -eisrve Betts mentioned that we already have a Code of Practice in
              Sheffield relating to the football clubs which was working very well.    He
              suggested that the football clubs should write down what they have already
              achieved in Sheffield via the Code of Practice.

              The Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday said that most clubs have already drawn up a
              Code of Practice and indeed the Football League itself had its own Code of
              Practice.  He also emphasised that the cost of the proposed new scheme should
              not be overlooked.  He stated that the implementation of the new scheme would
              bankrupt most clubs including the Sheffield clubs.

             The Chairman of Sheffield United said that it should be emphasised that in the
             last five years most clubs, including their own, had done a lot to improve their
             relationships with the community as a whole and to encourage young members to
             come to football matches as well as other activities, including for exampletthe
             Junior Blades Club^allowing the community to use the football club gymnasium and
             by providing family areas at football matches.  People will be deterred from
             joining the club if they have to have an identity card.and indeed many members
             have already written to him saying that they will not continue going to football
             matches if they have to have an identity card.  This will obviously cause
             substantial financial loss.
//




          Mr. Dow from the Football Supporters Association said that football crowds were
          on the increase again now and that the number of arrests had decreased.  These
          improvements would be spoilt by the new Bill.

          The Police representative endorsed this.  He said that during the last four
          years there had been a good liaison between the Police and the football clubs
          and that the proposed Bill would only have a marginal effect on the problem of
          football hooliganism.

          The Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday said that the Bill must be modified at the
          Committee stage.

          The meeting was concluded by Councillor Betts who suggested that the Code of
          Practice should be looked at again and the Arthur Young report be studied when
          it is available. )4 e                                 J                f

    Dear Councillor Betts,

    SHEFFIELD UNITED & ARNOLD LAVER


    I refer to your enquiry on the compliment slip, referring
    to Mr. Stevens' memorandum dated 16th February.

    An exploratory meeting has been held with two of the Directors
    of the Club by Mr. Newman, Mr. Wood and Mr.  Stevens.  The
    Directors are prepared to consider proposals involving acquisiton
    of the Bramall Lane ground by the Council, with possible
    relocation to the proposed East End Stadium.  It was agreed
    that the City Council would suggest possible alternatives
    to the Directors and Mr. Stevens has given the City Treasurer
    outline details of several options, although the respective
    requirements of the Authority and the Club seem, at this
    stage, to reduce the mutual acceptability of the options.

     Contact has been made with Arnold Laver in respect of the
     Olypic Saw Mills and we are presently discussing the basis
     of valuation before actual figures can be prepared.

     I will let you know when positive progress is made.

     Yours sincerely,

      I refer to your memorandum dated 8th February, in connection with the
      above.

      Although the Property Services Division prepared a number of valuations
      on scanty information following limited instructions from the former
      Director, Mr. Winter, I have not been involved with any negotiations
      with Sheffield United.

      H o we ver, the City Treasurer has again raised the matter and an update
      is being prepared with a view to discussion with Mr. Newman and then
      the Directors of Sheffield United.

      Additionally, the Board of Arnold Laver have indicated a willingness to
      discuss the possible sale of their premises at Bramall lane, Cherry
      Street, Shoreham Street and I am preparing a valuation of that
      property.

      I will let you have further information as soon as I have anything
      positive to report.

LAUNCH OF RACIAL HARASSMENT PROJECT REPORT - 2 MAY AT 10.00 AM

Sheffield City C ouncil, in conjunction with the Sheffield Council for Racial
Equality and other community groups, has been putting together  a report   on
racial harassment in the c i t y .

The intention of the report is to highlight examples of racial harassment and
to show how various organisations are trying to tackle it and how they    can
improve their approach to this in the future.

We very much recognise the importance of football as one of the institutions
of our community and have also recognised and appreciated the support we have
had  from both    Sheffield Football Clubs    in condemning racial harassment,
particularly   the very unfortunate racial taunting which   goes  on at   some
football grou nds.

In             the document we will
       launching                         be trying to get together a number of
people    whorepresent   the  Sheffield community   in   its widest  form.   I
personally will be     involved as Leader of the Council, but also Hugh Sykes,
the Chair of the Sheffield Development Corporation, David Lunn the Bishop   of
Sheffield and other community representatives have indicated their support
for the project and wish to be present at its launch.
                                          -   2   -




I am writing to ask the two football clubs in Sheffield,   therefore,  whether
they would be prepared to agree to the senior black players on their staff
being present at the launch to give it their support.   I think this wou ld be
a significant gesture, particularly to the young people in our community    who
are at an impressionable age and would respect  the   footballing  stars   they
support  giving a lead on     such matters.  I am thinking, in particular, of
Carlton Palmer and Gary Bennett of Sheffield Wednesday and Brian Deane      and
rony Agana  of Sheffield United and wonder whether they would be able to be
present.

If you require further information about the          project   I   will   be   happy   to
toEEI? 7 °? W ^th thiS and if y °U Wish to contact Frances Homewood on Sheffield
735971, who is the C o uncil’s Police Liaison Officer and   is helping   to  co­
ordinate   this project,    I am sure     she can give you all the information
necess ary.

I very much hope that the two football clubs are able to be    associated with
‘ » P r°ject i-n fche way suggested and I look forward to a positive reply from

Dear Ms. Whitney,

Thank  you  for your       letter   with   regard   to   the Petition on the National
Membership Scheme.

The only advice I can offer about M P ’s is that you     really have       to contact
them directly     as we   do not tend to deal on their behalf through the City
C ouncil. The best thing to do, I think, would be to find a lead MP and make
sure   that   they were present and then ask other M P ’s if they wanted to join
in.   As Bramall Lane is in the Central Constituency and I know Richard Caborn
is also     a United supporter, perhaps you would like to contact him.         He does
have an office in Sheffield and the telephone number is 737947, and you can
contact his     secretary  on     that number during office h o u r s . You might also
like to involve the Euro MP, Bob C r y e r , and, while he is not      a national MP
for   Sheffield,   it may   give     the presentation of your petition a European
dimension.    If you ’phone 753431, you can perhaps contact Bob Cryer          through
his   secretary Jean C r o m a r , who is also another "Unitedite", and presumably
would be pleased to help with your publicity.

Yours sincerely,




C. J. C. BETTS

  Dear Mr Betts,

  I am writing to ask for your help in the fight against compulsory membership

  cards for football supporters.

  As members of the National Federation of Football Supporters Club's, it has

  been suggested to us, that each Club present it's Petition to their M.P. on

  a diffe^nt day in order that more impact can be made if all 92 Clubs attend

  seperatdy.

  We are hoping to present our Petition very soon and would appreciate any help

  support or guidance you can offer in this cause.




  Yours sincerely,

 (DICTATED THURSDAY 13 APRIL)

 FOOTBALL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME

I spoke to you the other day and mentioned that Dennis Howell had contacted
Jonathan Foster   from the   Independent with a view to getting a Local
Authority which was interested in pursuing a possible line of objection  to
Football Membership Schemes*

Dennis H o w e l l ’s view is that under European Legislation, facilities such as
 ootball grounds have to be open to all European citizens.             Under  the
Football Membership Scheme a citizen of another Common Market Country would
not be compelled to have an football        identity  card,  but would have    to
produce   their passport or other similar means of identification.       The line
of argument, as I understand it, is that a citizen of a European          country
should not        be forced to carry their passport around and to use it to gain
access to facilities in Britain.

Perhaps you would have a look whether there is a line of legal argument             to
follow here.


I am also wanting to follow another line of argument to which David Bownes
has drawn attention in his report on the Safety at Sportsground Act.     If
there are   certain  requirements which we    have to carry out to meet the
Safety at Sportsground Act, including a number of turnstiles which will  be
necessary to get spectators safely into the ground within a reasonable time
period,


al   “ "hi8 n,U mb8r ° f turnstiles   to be drastically         increased     because
or the time taken to check membership schemes and

b)   if the number of extra      turnstiles needed        cannot     be    physically
accommodated within the structure of the ground,

does this mean a basic     conflict between   the   Safety at  Sportsground
requirements and the Football Membership Card Scheme requirements?  Perhaps
you could give me your legal views on that as well.

If necessary, could we look at whether we ought to be briefing            Counsel   on
the possible challenge on these matters.

Dear Councillor Betts,

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL,

Further to our recent meeting in the Town Hall to discuss the
Football Membership Scheme, I set out below our thoughts on
the introduction of the Football Spectators Bill into Parliament.

We feel that this measure is both impracticable and unworkable,                                    .
It will have no effect on the problem of hooliganism which is a
national social disease, as evidenced by the widespread acts of
violence and unrest in urban areas throughout the country.

Ninety nine per cent of Football League games pass off without
any serious crowd problems. An arest rate of 0.03% out of a
total of 18 million spectators hardly suggests that a national
membership scheme is necessary and this figure becomes even more
favourable when you take into account that arrests outside the
ground are included - the Police will testify that the vast
majority fall into this category.

When the Minister gave his reasons for introducing the legislation,
he used two instances of crowd misbehaviour at Football League
games last season - two out of almost 2000 games. Significantly,                                              7
the two disturbances quoted by the Minister involved
Wolverhampton Wanderers and Chelsea, both of whom are well
known for problems with their supporters. The only other maj or
instances of crowd misbehaviour over the last three or four
years have involved clubs with similar reputations such as
Millwall and Leeds United. Surely it would be more appropriate

these few clubs at specific problem matches rather than to
introduce a blanket scheme across the country which will do nothing
to cure the problem of hooliganism and merely add to the inconvenience
of 99.9% of genuine football supporters.

Sheffield United Football Club is well known for its work in
helping to combat hooliganism over the past six or seven years.
Closed circuit television cameras have been installed at the
ground and have proved an effective measure in deterring spectators
from possible acts of violence at our games. We have an excellent
working relationship with our local police authority who are
completely satisfied with our present 50% voluntary membership
scheme which is working well and affords segregation, of..supporters.

We have discussions with the Police before each game. Any
problem matches are identified at an early stage and special
plans put into operation - e.g. all ticket games, change of kick
off time, additional segregation arrangements etc, etc.

These measures along with the many other steps we have taken to
integrate the club into the community have made our ground a
pleasant place to visit on a Saturday afternoon and the family
atmosphere is certainly returning to Bramall Lane.

We have now an all seated Family Enclosure in our newest stand
with room for up to 2,000 spectators. We have a special enclosure
for the Physically and mentally disabled together with match
commentary facilities for the blind and for the people in hospital.
In addition we allow our gymnasium to be used during the week
by the unemployed, local schools, charitable organisations and
organised supporter groups.

At our games we provide pre-match entertainment particularly at
big matches at which spectators can be expected to arrive earlier
than normal, as well as half time entertainment.  We organise
football matches between Sheffield United Supporters
and their counterparts from the visiting club as well as get
togethers with visiting Executive Club members. We have a well
organised Away Travel Club which operates trips to all our away
games on a members only basis. All coaches are well supervised
and stewarded.

In addition Sheffield United is extremely active on a day-to-day
basis in outside community activities.   The club employs a full
time public Relations Officer and a part-time Liaison Officer
whose primary responsibility is communication with community
groups and supporters organisations.   They organise and
co-ordinate appropriate activities in which players management
and staff participate. In addition, former Sheffield United
favourite, Tony Currie is in charge of the more formal community
Programme in Professional Football, an excellent scheme which has
now been adopted at well over a third of the League Clubs and
which it is hoped, will eventually spread to all 92.
                              -   3   -




The activities which are set up and implemented through these
sections of the club include visits to schools, hospitals, old
 people's homes, liaison with the police, visits to sporting social
and charitable organisations, charity fund raising, assistance to
students and others requiring information etc, etc. We have both
a junior Blades and a Senior Blades Club, both of which are thriving
organisations catering for young and old. Players and club
officials regularly attend meetings with supporters for discussions,
questions and general chat.   In addition many social functions are
organised as well as an annual open day to enable supporters to
meet the players, management and staff and to look behind the
scenes.

Sheffield United's role in the community is not merely football
orientated.  The club gives its support to worthy activities that
are in no way connected with football.  For example, the club
was the first organisation to take positive steps to help the
Sheffield City Councils appeal for funds to enable them to make a
formal bid to stage the world student games.  Sheffield United
eventually helped to contribute £20,000 to the appeal which
turned out to be successful and the Games will be held here in
Sheffield in 1991.

Similarily our playing staff select a worthy charity every vear
and all the players, through the leadership of the club captain
organise and take part in a large number of events to raise
money for that charity. Beneficiaries in the past have included
the British Heart Foundation and Leukaemia Research.

In addition the club lends itssupport to a large number of public
interest activities such as drink driving campaigns, anti-litter
and anti-smoking initiatives, promoting the firework code and
many others.

The above examples serve to illustrate that all is not bad with
football. Unfortunately, as far as the media is concerned, good
news is not newsworthy, whereas a single isolated incident at a football
match receives widespread front page coverage - the good side of football
hardly receives a mention. The general public are not aware of how much
football clubs have done to put their house in order.

A national membership scheme will cause undoubted problems to everyone
concerned, not just to the football clubs themselves but to the hundreds
of thousands of genuine supporters who merely wish to spend their leisure
time indulging in their favorite pastime. Football has already spent
millions of pounds helping to combat the problem hooliganism at grounds.
Surely, the extra millions that must be spent to introduce a National
Membership Scheme could be put to more constructive uses. Such as
continuing to improve the clubs relationship with the local community
through such schemes as the "Football in the Conmunity Programme". As the
Minister himself has said "the more that a local comnunity is involved in
its football club, the less likely it is that some members of that
community will cause trouble at the ground".

                                                                    -   4   -

May I take this opportunity of thanking Sheffield City Council and
yourself in particular for taking such an interest in this matter
and I look forward to meeting with you again shortly to review progress.

Yours sincerely,




DAVID CAPPER,
Company Secretary.

Dear Mr.      Holmes,

Thank you v e r y m u c h indeed for sending me copies of the letters you hav e sent
to the Sh eff i e l d Football C l u b s . I am very p l e a s e d to w e l c o m e the initiative
w h i c h you have taken and hope you receive a p osit i v e re sponse from              Sh effield
Wednesday.

I re ceived a v ery full and p o s iti ve reply fro m S h e f fie ld W e d n e s d a y earlier in
the season w h e n I asked them w h a t   a t t it ude they    took    towards         r aci sm at
football     grounds.   At   that   time    I did not receive a reply f rom Sh effield
United, except one w h i c h said they did not hav e a p r o b l e m w i t h r a cism so they
w e r e not going to respond.

It   did  perhaps      seem   to me that your a p p r o a c h in y o u r letters was a little
bias ed towards She ff i e l d U n i t e d but pr esu m a b l y that is  b e c ause you are a
su pporter of t h e i r s .

I have            to    say       also,  however, that I am b e c o m i n g rather c o n c e r n e d that an
o r g a n i s a t i o n c a l l e d BBC (which I u n d e r s t a n d refers to the   Blades         Business
Club) has become active in attacks of a racist n ature in b o t h the S h a r r o w and
the D a rna ll a r e a s . I think this is anothe r i tem w e p r o b a b l y have to take                up
with        the       football       clubs  and  is one I intend to w r i t e to She ff i e l d U ni ted

Mr. Derek Dooley,
Managing Director,
Sheffield United F.C.,
Bramall Lane,
SHEFFIELD.

Dear Derek,

I am writing on behalf of Sheffield S.O.S. Racism to congratulate Sheffield
United on their recent tannoy announcements and Dave Bassett's programme
notes warning supporters against racist abuse and taunts directed at black
players.

As a regular on the Kop I have noticed a noticeable drop in the level of
racist abuse this season.   It is also noticeable that there are more black
supporters attending United's matches.   Obviously having two popular
strikers who are black may have helped!

S.O.S. Racism urges the club to remain vigilent in this area, perhaps
turning their attention to the New South Stand where on a recent visit I
was disappointed to find has not experienced a similar drop in racist abuse
as the Kop.

Up the Blades!

   Mr. Graham Mackerell,
   Secretary,
   Sheffield Wednesday F.C.,
   Penistone Road,
   Hillsborough,
   SHEFFIELD S5.

   Dear Mr. Mackerell,

   Sheffield S.O.S. Racism has been informed by a Sheffield Wednesday supporter,
   Mr. Douglas Green, of two separate incidents that have occurred at the last
   two home matches.

  Ihe first incident occurred at the Southampton match, when after constant racial
  abuse by a group of people on the Kop, directed at the Wallace brothers, Mr. Green
  eventually asked that the abuse should stop.   His request met with a hostile,
  threatening reaction from the supporters in question and objects were thrown in
  his direction.

  Mr. Green reported the incident after the match to the receptionist at the Club
  office, whose initial reaction was that it was nothing to do with the Club!
  Mr. Green was advised to report the incident himaif to the police, which he did.

  The second incident occurred at the Charlton game.    A.similar pattern to the
  previous match followed - the Charlton side also containing black players.
  Mr. Green, who was accompanied by his brother, asked one particularly vocal
  supporter to stop as he found his comments offensive.    The man expressed outrage
  that anyone should dare to tell him what he could shout at a match, saying
   'I've paid my money to get in ... I can say what I like ... It s a free country

  Mr. Green pointed out that he actually could not say what he liked, as his
  expressions of racial abuse were in fact a criminal offence, and stated that he
  would inform the police if he continued.    When the man did in fact persist with
  Ills abuse of black players, Mr. Green informed the nearest policeman.

  The police came and warned the man, who finally took heed and stopped his abuse.
  However, when the police left Mr. Green described the atmosphere as being very
  bitter and threatening towards himself and his brother.   Luckily for everyone
  Wednesday soon scored their second goal and the crowd's mood changed!

  Mr. Green has been most upset by both incidents.     He sees no reason why he should
  iriovo and stand elsewhere, as he has a regular spot on the Kop and is a lifelong
  sii[.|<nrM-pr of Sheffield Wednesday.

          Ii.'wimiii would like to ask the following questions:-



                                                                                        Continued
                                  2.

Mi'\ G. Mackerell
                                                                 7th March 1989




 1.    What is Sheffield Wednesday's policy towards racial abuse and taunts
       of black players ?

 2.   How do they seek to implement any policy on this issue ?

 3.   Have warnings been printed in the programme or announced over the tannoy 7
       If so, when ?

 4.   How do Sheffield Wednesday feel about what has happened to Mr. Green ?


 1 am writing this letter with the full support of the Football Supporters
 Association (South Yorkshire Branch) and am sending copies to Councillor
 Clive Betts and Chief Inspector Roger Purdy, South Yorkshire Police.

 I look forward to your reply.


 Yours sincerely,




Howard Holmes.

Chief Inspector Roger Purdy,
South Yorkshire Police,
West Bar,
SHEFFIELD SI.

Dear Mr. Purdy,

J. am writing on behalf of Sheffield S.O.S. Racism to congratulate the
initiative taken by Sheffield United and South Yorkshire Police in seeking
to warn spectators of the consequences of racial abuse and taunts directed
at black players.

Racial abuse has become commonplace at soccer grounds over the years, and
has contributed to the decision of many decent supporters to stay away
from what can be a very unpleasant atmosphere.

ihe sort of joint action taken at Bramall Lane represents an attempt to
reverse this trend, and we wish you every success with the initiative.

Yours sincerely,




Howard Holmes.



P.S.  I am enclosing copies of letters sent to United and Wednesday on this
matter.

De a r Derek,


Y o u m a y have read in the m e d i a of attacks of  a  racist  nature   which    have
o c c urre d   in  the  Darna ll   area and also problems have been oc cur rin g in the
Sh a r r o w area over the last f ew months.


I a m w r i t i n g to you because of slogans w h i c h have been d aubed  on  h ous es in

this slogan refers to something c alled the Blades Business Club w h i c h           is an
;ny ni^       lon  of  the  sort  of fo otball supporters mos t of us w i s h         we h a d n ’t
got.       This group appears  to  have   sympathies,  as  I un der s t a n d         it,   with
  ational      Front  type elements.  I do appreciate the m e a s u r e s w h i c h   Sheffield
f f m t e d have been taking recently to distance themselves from racist              taunts at
          g r °Unds a" d ln  that      context       I thought I w o u l d c ommunicate      this
information to y ou about this p a r t i c u l a r organisation.

I am not sure h o w m u c h you can do a bout it but, neverthless, you m i g h t like
to keep   an eye out in case they appea r in other contexts and the Club m i g h t
vant to take a clear and de ter mine d public stance on the issue.     I have    also

Mr. H. E. McGee,

Dear Bert,

As you know the Council, the two football clubs in Sheffield, the Police and
also,  hopefully,  the Football Supporters Association, have been trying to
work together to agree upon our Code of Conduct for operations at football
grounds.

So far I am pleased with the co-operation of        all parties and I have taken
the opportunity to write to the Football League,     the Football Association,
the ^ Football   Supporters’   Association   at      national   level and some
parliamentarians to inform them of our intentions    and to seek their support.

I have already had an indication of support from Tom Pendry MP,   and Lord
Graham of Edmonton and also, importantly, from Jack Dunnett of the Football
League.

I am wondering whether it would be appropriate to try and invite Colin
Moynihan to Sheffield for the day of the cup semi-final.  If we could do this
I think it will give an opportunity to show him (with a big crowd)  ho- well
the Police and the Club x-rork together to ensure crowd safety. At the same
time, hopefully, we could have our code of practice finalised by then, and,
with the support of the Football Association and Football League, we could
actually present it to the Minister and try and get some publicity    for an
alternative to the football membership scheme, instead of simply stating our
opposition to it in a negative way.                                     ’

As you vn I appreciate, I have in the past invited Colin Moynihan to come    to
a match at Hillsborough with the knowledge of both yourself and the Chief
Constable.  His last reply, before Christmas, was that he could not come     in
the near future.    I have reminded him subse .uentl; tllat the near future has
now ended and ie has cknowledged my letter but,      so far,   I have had no
further response from him.
                                    - 2 -



In this attempt to promote an alternative scheme, I think the very least an
invitation to the Minister could do is to get him declining the invitation
which, equally, could be of some publicity value.

If an invitation is to be made then I think it would probably be appropriate
if it came from yourself although I, with the City    Council,   would like to   be
involved with it.  However, I would like to assure you that we are not trying
to make Party political points on      this matter but to build     a strong,
alternative case which can be pushed on the grounds of a scheme supported by
all those who are -interested with, or involved in, football.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Clive,

Re;    National Football Membership Scheme

On behalf of my Chairman and myself may I thank you for your efforts at
yesterday's meeting, it was most informative and I think indicated the path
ahead.

I confirm that I will liaise with David Bownes of the Safety Committee and
David Capper of Sheffield United to draw up a local "Code of Practice".

At the later Football League Divisional Meeting held in York it was determined
that the main attack on legislation will take place in April as the Bill is
due to come into the Commons at the backend of the month.

I will, of course, keep you fully advised should anything materially alter and
I take this opportunity of enclosing a copy of the Arthur young report which
you may find of interest, please feel free to circulate £his as and where you
think necessary.                                        /

 Dear Councillor Betts

 Thank you for your recent letter concerning the Football Membership Scheme,
 which outlines your suggestion of a Code of Practice. As previously agreed,
 my position on the Working Group is that of observer and adviser concerning
 the policing arrangements of football matches.

 In view of this it would not be appropriate for me to be involved in any
 combined paper to be presented to the Sports Minister, as our stance may not be
 compatible.

 There is good liaison between the police and both Clubs in Sheffield and we
 would certainly wish to support any steps that are viable to prevent
 hooliganism.  I am willing, therefore, to continue to act as an observer and
 adviser on your Working Group, and comment on best practices with the clubs
 and others to prevent hooliganism.

Yours sincerely

FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS ASSOCIATION: ANNUAL CONFERENCE

As you may know, this year's national conference is to be held in
Sheffield. The venue will be the Executive Suite at Sheffield
United on 24 June 1989.

I am writing to you because you have been most supportive in our
work, in Sheffield, against the Government's membership scheme. I
must admit to pushing my luck in asking for more help in the
shape of sponsorship for the conference. I have set out the
reasons below.

The total cost of the event is around £1,200 and half of this
cost is being met by the Football Association and Football
League. Unfortunately, we have been unable,  so far, to obtain
help from the local clubs.

As you will understand, we are trying to keep down the ticket
price to a     reasonable sum, given that delegates will be
travelling to the conference from all parts of the country.

In previous years     conferences have attracted    considerable
publicity. This year we expect even greater television and press
coverage due to the media interest in the membership scheme,
which is the main focus of the conference.

The conference as such represents a worthy cause and a highly
effective platform for communicating your commitment to sport and
the community in Sheffield. Moreover, it is our hope that either
the Lady Mayoress or yourself would be good enough to open the
conference.

If you, or your officials wish to discuss the matter further,
please do not hesitate to contact me on Sheffield 352894.

Thank you for your letter of 10 February
about the possibility of coming along to
a football match this season at Hillsborough.

I regret that my diary remains extremely full
for the foreseeable future and, regrettably,
it will be impossible for me to attend a
Sheffield Wednesday home match this season -
although I will certainly bear in mind a visit
to Hillsborough next season.

         Dear Councillor Betts,

                Thank you for your letter of 1st March and I apologise for the delay
         in replying.

                I was interested to read of the joint working party you have set up
         in Sheffield. I would certainly be interested in seeing your Code of Good
         Practice, once it has been drawn up.

                You will, of course, be aware that all clubs now have to draw up
         detailed plans for the management of crowds in consultation with the police
         and the local authority and submit these to The Football League at the start
         of each season.


                                                           Yours sincerely,




                                                                  J. D. Dent

            Thank you for your further memo. I apologise for not replying in writing to
            the original.

            I support   the  strategy you   are  adopting. If you intend to extend the
            research to Liverpool and Nottingham,   I will  be pleased   to make   the
            necessary political contacts and clearances.

            You will be aware that Hammersmith Council are hosting a Day Conference on
            related matters, to which Councillor Betts and Wigfield are our  delegates.
            Please find attached a copy of the programme. You may wish to speak to them
            in advance of the Conference.

     Dear Rogan Taylor

     Following the Hillsborough disaster Sheffield City Council are anxious to help
     in whatever way it can to ensure that meaningful lessons are learnt for the
     future.  Like your organisation, it is our hope that   the supporters of the
     future will at last be regarded as valued paying customers, rather than a
     problem needing to be controlled.

     I understand that you will be helping the City Council get the design of the
     new Don Valley Stadium right for the spectators and that you are liaising on
     this matter with our City Treasurer, Malcolm Newman.

     We are interested, however, in going a stage further                          and hope that your
     organisation may be interested in our proposal.

     Our section of the City Council, the Communications Unit, operates a new survey
     method which we use to consult with a whole variety of audiences to find out
     what they really want and what their priorities are. As a method of finding
     out what people's views are it differs quite considerably from the more usual
     forms of market research, as explained in more detail in the enclosed leaflet.
     The basic principle of the method, however, is to help people to come up with .
     their own solutions to a problem that is of real concern to them - and then to
     survey them to find which of those 'solutions' they attach greater priority to
     than others.

     We feel that this method, called 'Priority Search' would be an ideal tool to
     find out what football supporters' want to happen now, following the Hillsborough
     disaster. The question to invite football supporters' own solutions could
     be :

                      "How can we ensure that football grounds are safe and
                      enjoyable places for the supporters".




                 Sandy Campbell                                                   (0742) 734024
To contact                                            direct, please telephone

                                                                                                                          R7788

        Our'thought is, therefore, that we could run this survey with supporters
        say from Liverpool, Sheffield and Nottingham and that the results could be
        useful to you in your evidence to the Hillsborough Inquiry.

        We are of course offering you access to this method free and would see it as
        appropriate to conduct the work largely under your organisation's direction -
        treating you in effect as the client. Our Council Leader, Clive Betts, is very
        supportive of us making this offer to you.  If you are interested in discussing
        this proposal further, perhaps you could give me a ring and we could arrange to
        meet.

        Yours sincerely_______________

A new survey method which can help you identify what people
really want and what their priorities are.



What are its uses?

*       It can be used by a Council service to help them sort
       out what their customer's priorities are.
*       It can be used in a local community, or with specific
       sections of the population to help them identify what
       their needs really are.

*       It can be used to find out the views of people who don't
       normally get listened to - whether inside the Council or
       in the Community.

      It can be used within a Council department to help staff
      focus on ways of being more effective in their work.

       It can be used to help staff focus on ways of tackling
       issues that cross departmental boundaries.

       It can be used in any organisation,, large or small, to
       help them prioritise the use of scarce resources




What makes it different to other survey methods?

*      It avoids leading questions.

*      It encourages people to think positively.

*      It helps people to find solutions to their problems.

*       It gives people the power to identify what their   needs
       really are.

*      It ensures that everyone has their say and guarantees that
       minority opinions are not overlooked.

*       It produces questionnaires that are   e&sy to understand and
       quick to fill in.

*      It avoids jargon and can be conducted in the everyday
       language of the people being surveyed.

*      It provides people with information    they can make sense
       of.

*      It uses computer technology to makethe survey part of
       the process quick and uncomplicated.
How does it. work?

Let's say a school wants to find out the views of their parents
on how to improve the school.
More traditional market research surveys would    use questions
phrased beforehand either by   the school or  by  marketresearch
professionals. These questions may or may not be the ones that
parents actually want to be asked. For example they might ask
them to tick boxes indicating their satisfaction (or not) with an
existing facility - eg the teaching of languages, sporting
facilities or school meals. While such methods can be good for
building up a picture of what people think about how an existing
service is provided, they do not provide many concrete ideas on
how to improve it in the future.
Priority Search approaches the problem in quite a different
manner.

   Firstly the client commissioning the survey (in this case a
   school) decides on just one 'open question' which they want
   to ask of their customers   (in this case parents).

   Such a question would be:

                                      How can we improve our school?

   In stage two a cross-section grouping of about 20 parents are
   brought together for a couple of hours. During this time they
   are taken through a process which helps them to focus on
   'solutions' to the open question. The way the session is run
   ensures that everyone has their say. Those with more power or
   confidence aren't allowed to dominate.

   In the third stage the group's 'solutions' are entered into
   the computer.  A questionnaire is produced minutes later.   All
   the 'solutions' are listed several times down either side of
   each page. The person being surveyed is asked to balance each
   'solution' in turn with the one opposite.

   The illustration below shows a completed questionnaire.   The
   position of the dot on each line indicates the balance of

In practice this method is easy to follow and quick to complete.
No knowledge of computers, statistics or any other specialism is
necessary. Anything up to 300 people can be surveyed with the
same questionnaire.
          What does it. p r o duce ?

          Once all the questionnaires have been completed they are 'scored'
          by the computer.  In a complex mathematical equation^every
          preference from every line on every questionnaire is weighted
          against every other one. What comes out is the 'solutions' in
          the order of priority felt to be important by all the people
          surveyed. The system can further break this information down to
          show the priorities of different categories. The illustration
          below shows what the 'top ten' priorities of parents, broken down
          year by year could be:
                                                                   Parents of   Parents of   Parents of   Parents of      Parents of

           Some other examples
           *                A library could use Priority Search to ask:

                             "What would encourage you to use the Library more?"

           *                 A school kitchen could use Priority Search to ask:

                             "What sort of school meals service would you like for
                             your child?"
           *                 A group of council information officers could use Priority
                             Search to ask:
                             "How can we keep the public well informed about the City
                             Council?"

            *                A team of social workers could use Priority Search                                        to ask:

                             "How could we provide better day care facilities for the
                             elderly?"
            *                A tenants association could use Priority Search to                                        ask:

                             "How could we improve the upkeep and look of this
                             neighbourhood?"

             We shall be addressing a number of issues particularly on the impractical and ineffective
             nature of the proposals, the police opposition to the proposals and the general civil
             liberties implications of the Bill.
             Obviously for the Conference to be successful we need the support of both the Football
             Chairmen and Supporters’ Clubs.

•      T h e Police Federation has criticised the
       scheme as u n w o r k a b l e . Fans tend to
       arrive m o m e n t s before kick off and there
       will be enormous congestion at the
       turnstiles. Consultants, Arthur Young,
       w h o were commissioned by the Football
       League, have examined the technology on
       offer and none of the alternatives is
       foolproof. Frustration at the delays
       could actually trigger trouble.
 •     T h e cost of implementing the scheme is
       likely to drive m a n y of the smaller clubs
       out of business. Casual spectators will
       be prevented from attending the
       occasional match. T h e Arthur Y o u n g
       study forecast that the scheme would cost
       league clubs £72 million to implement
       over the first 5 years. A n d it predicted
       that gates would fall by a m i n i m u m of 20
       per cent - causing a £34 million loss in
       revenue in the first year.

 Th e Tories say the Bill is needed to curb football
 violence. But even here the logic is shaky. Th e

        I acknowledge receipt of your very kind letter dated 8 June.

        I know I speak for all my colleagues who took part in the football match at
        Molineux that we were more than pleased to help and the day was a most
        enjoyable one.

        I will certainly circulate your letter to all who took part in the event.

Dear Councillor Betts



     Today I had the pleasure of being invited to the Civic Centre in Wolverhampton
to receive a cheque for £2,200 from Councillor Norman Davies, Leader of our Council.
This wonderful, nrtd most welcome sum, was raised by the football match at Molineux

between your civic side and oursI
     Perhaps you know that our Charity was founded by a small group of mothers
in Wolverhampton who all have extremely severely handicapped sons and daughters
and the funds we receive, together with authority part-funding, operate a Care
and Relief Service of the highest quality. Our funds provide qualified and experienced
care attendants to give home—based care to the disabled individuals in order that

families may have a break.
     We appreciate so much the efforts of those in our Authority who took part
in the events, and made the plans and practical arrangements etc., but we are
doubly indebted to you and all the participants from Sheffield because time and
effort had to be expended to travel here. We are therefore deeply grateful that
so much time, thought and generosity was given to our cause.
     We ho-e you did not return with any casualties and we always hope that
fund-raisers enjoy comradeship,laughter and other benefits as their share of
the events that help us. We are thankful to share the total sum raised with the
families so sadly affected by the events at Hillsborough. Please will you pass
on to everyone in Sheffield who helped us our warmest gratitude.

                          Yp^rs sincerely


                          Mary uiixmgs

                The first note sets out in draft comments w h i c h the C o u n c i l could make about
                the Bill from a safety of sports ground point of view.          I should point out

                The second note relates to the Police vie w of the Bill itself.                     This second
                note should be kept confidential.

                W o u l d you please let me have your comments on the first note as soon as

Point of Vi e w            __________________________________________________________



Introduction

O n the face of It, fr o m a safety of sports g round point of view, the C o u n ci l as
C e r t l f i c a t l n g A u t h o r i t y has few comments It c an m a k e In co n n ec t io n wi t h the
p r o p o s e d football m e m b e r s h i p scheme.      However, it is ap p a re n t that there may be
d i f f i c u l t i e s w i t h the proposed scheme w h i c h could w e l l affect the s afety of
s p e c t a t o r s and thus become the l egitimate c o n c e r n of a Council as C e rt l f I c a t l n g
Autho r i ty .

The P r o b l e m

B o t h S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y and Sh e f field U n i t e d S t a d i a a r e more or less s u r ro u n de d
by b u s y mai n roads and the ma jo r i ty of the e ntrance turnstiles are located
d i r e c t l y on the highway.              It w ould be i mp o s si b le to mo ve the m a j or i ty of the
t ur n s ti l es to locations act u a ll y w i t hi n the stad ia as there is no room for them.
O b v i o u s l y people coming through the t urnstiles need to be di re c t ed along we l l
d e f i n e d routes to v i e w in g locations w i t h i n the stadia.                    These routes are a l r e a d y
o p e r a t i n g at near m a x i m u m capacities and the s h or t e n i n g of t h e m could cause
s eve r e di f f iculties and p ossibly danger w i t h i n the stadia.

The f o o t b a l l m e m b e r s h i p scheme proposal w o u l d p r o b a bl y involve th e use of some
sort of computer c hecking of id e ntitiy cards p r i o r to a d m is s i o n to the stadium.
I t hink it is fairly we ll agreed that this sort of p ro c ed u r e would slow the
a d m i s s i o n of s pectators to turstiles.          This is u n f o r t u n a t e as there is a great
deal of evidence to sh ow that the m a j o r i t y of s u pp o rt e r s turn up a t the
t ur n st i l es just before the start of the game.                 E v e n w i t h the current f ai r l y
q u i c k s ys t em que u ei n g still occurs and pr o bl e ms in that area have to be
controlled.          W i t h fur t he r delays at the turnst il e s e v e n if they a re at the level
of p e r h a p s two or three seconds per p er s o n it is quite l i k el y that subs ta n ti a l
crowds will develop.                  T here is, of course, m u c h e v id e n c e in relation to crowd
b e h a v i o u r available but some of the m a i n p roblems are outlined below.

O b s t r u c t i o n of Traf fi c

As I have p r e vi o us l y m en t i on e d both the s t a d ia in S h e f f i e l d are a d j a c e n t to at
least two main roads and crowds of people trying to g a i n access to the
t ur n st i l e s w ould e f f ec t iv e l y obstruct traf f ic and cause severe c o n je s ti o n o n
these busy roads.           As many football m a t c he s take place on Saturday a f te r no o n s
this d i s r u p t i o n to traffic could be serious.

Ri sk to Spectators f r o m M o ving Traffic

O b v i o u s l y large numbers of people o b s t ru c ti n g traffic w i l l give rise to the
risks of collisions between vehicles and pedestrians.                   As..the crowd sizes a n d
l oc a tions will pro b ab l y fluctuate the s i t u a t i o n will be very difficult for
drivers.          O b viously the Police could c lo s e the roads but this would involve a
m a j o r d i s r u p t i o n to traffic on major highways.     It woul<i also neces s it a t e e v e n
more p o l i ce time being a l lo cated to f o otball matches.

Access for Em er g en c y Vehicles

As f o o t ba l l stadia are large it is ne ce s s ar y         for em e rg e nc y vehicles to be a b l e
to get to the site of the emergency at the clo s e st part of the exte r io r of the
stadium.          In some cases, of course, it w o u l d be n e c e ss a r y for them to a c t u a ll y
get to the playing area.             In the cases of bo t h Sh e f fi e ld United and S h e f f i el d
W e d n e s d a y emergency veh i cl e s w ou l d need to a p p r o a c h on the main roads that may
well be blocked by crowds.  This sort of situation is not acceptable; in the
event of an emergency such as the fire at Bradford F.C. the emergency vehicles
must be able to arrive at the scene as quickly as possible. Delays either
inside or outside turnstiles might well result in the blocking of exit gates.

Crowd Behaviour

It seems likely that crowds at the turnstiles will be conscious of the passage
of time towards the kick-off.  This could lead to unruly behaviour as that time
draws near and perhaps cause significant problems for the Police and stewards
in controlling the situation. It also seems likely that considerable numbers of
spectators will not be able to gain admission to the stadium prior to the start
of the match and this could also result in public disorder.

Crowd Control

The control of crowds in the street is, of course, a Police problem, perhaps
helped by Club Stewards.   I would imagine that the control of a disorderly crowd
on a busy main road would be extremely difficult and would cause problems on a
large scale for the Police.   The situation would not it seems to me be capable
of being contained easily.

Crowd Pressure on Stadium Structures

Obviously when crowds are focused on relatively small areas of the externa^
walls of the stadia (that is the turnstiles and the adjacent walls) there will
be considerable pressure on the structure of those areas of the stadia.
Hoepfully the structures would be able to take this pressure but the matter
would need to be reviewed carefully.

Risk to Spectators in Crowds

As with any crowd (especially an unruly one) there is a risk of people being
crushed or trampled in the absence of suitable crush barriers or other safety
measures.

Criminal Activities within Crowds

Again I am sure the Police can detail the sort of criminal activities which take
place in crowds especially when they are unruly.    These range from assault to
pickpockets and other thefts.    Obviously the more crowds there are the more
criminal activity there will be.

 Unauthorised Access to the Stadia

 One of the Clubs current problems is that spectators gain admission to the
 ground by climbing over walls, etc..   It is quite likely that these unruly
 individuals would probably take advantage of the Police and stewards pre­
 occupation with the crowds at   turnstiles to get into the stadia without paying.
 This would, of course, defeat   the object of the football membership scheme.   It
 could perhaps also be argued that these particular people would be the ones to
 cause trouble within the ground anyway.

 If it became apparent that,   the scheme (when commenced) would lead to significant
 crowd problems, outside the   ground then the Council would have to look to its
 powers under the Safety of    Sports Grounds Act 1975_(as amended).  The Council as
 Certificating Authorityhas    responsibility of insuring as far as possible the
reasonable safety of spectators.  It has ample powers under the legislation to
ensure that standard of safety and it could take two steps to deal with this
potential crowd problem.

Firstly it could serve a Prohibition Notice on the club preventing use of the
whole stadium or parts of it if it appears there is a serious risk to spectators
if they are admitted to the stadium or parts of it. I should point out that the
exercise of this power in circumstances I have described is perhaps somewhat
marginal and I am not sure that it would be entirely legal.

Secondly, the Council could change the Certificate conditions so as to attempt
to eliminate this sort of problem.

It is obvious that the Council's only recourse is against the clubs themselves
in what would no doubt be an extremely unpopular series of actions.

I would now appreciate directions on the next step to -be taken in this matter.

CONFIDENTIAL FILE NOTE - THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS' BILL

O n 2nd M a r c h , 1989 I talked to a contact w i t h i n the Police about                   the F o o t b a l l
Spectators' Bil l and the P o l i ce v i e w of it.

T h e first point m a d e was that the Bill itself m e r e l y sets the f r a m e wo r k and does
n o t p r ov i de any detailed i n f ormation as to how an actual m em b e r s h i p scheme w o u l d
work.      It is seen as a 'broad brush' a p p r o a c h to the problem.

T h e s e co n d point is that the P o l i c e ha v e a p p a r e n t l y not been f o rmally con s u lt e d
a b o u t the Bill or the sort of items w h i c h w o u l d need to be included in the
scheme.        A p p a r e n t l y ACTO have u n d e r s t a n d a b l y e x p r e ss e d a vi e w that they ought
to be c l o s e l y consulted, par t i cu l ar l y in r e l a t i o n to the scheme itself.

T h e next point relates to the chances of the Bill's success.              It is a p p a r e n t l y
felt that the B i l l itself wi l l have little, or no di f fi c u l t y in g e t ti n g t h r o u g h
owing, amongst o ther things, to the P r i m e M i n i s t e r ' s views on the subject.

T h e P o l i c e are m a i n l y concerned about crowd contr o l outside the ground, b e a r i n g
in mind that a third to half of specta t o rs tends to try and get into the g r o u n d
w i t h i n the last 15 m i nu t es prior to the k i c k - o ff . This a l r e a d y causes some
problems, but if significant delays w e r e to occur in ad m itting people, then it
is a p p a r e n t l y anticipated that ma j or crowd cont ro l p roblems would result.

I think the P o lice wi l l take the " official" v i e w that they do not object in
p r i n c i p l e to a foot b al l m e mb e r s h i p scheme, but they want to be c o ns ulted about
t h e d e t a i l s to -ensure that crown cont r ol p r o b l e m s do not arise.     T h e y will also,
I think, ta ke issue on p a rt i cu l a r portions of the Bill, for example that
r e l a t i n g to the "reporting a g e n c y ” .

Co nc i u s i o n s

T h e P o l i c e are unl ik e l y to overtly support a c a m p a i g n against the Bill a l t h o u g h
they m ight be persuaded to refrain f r o m d i s a g r e e i n g w i t h rational comments a b o u t
the risks of crowd control problems w h i c h m a y r e sult u n de r a scheme.

It seems to be important to re member that there are two separate issues here.
O n e is the principle of the Bill itself, w h i c h can be the subject of all sorts
of arg u me n t s (for example, i ndividual freedom) and the scheme itself w h i ch is
the p r a c t i c a l framework w i t hi n w h i c h the Bill' s objectives will be achieved.

The d r a f t le g islation appears to be rathe r curious in that as far as the
s c h e m e / l i c e n s i n g arrangements are concerned, they wi ll come into effect
i m m e d i a t e l y on the p a s s i n g of the Act, but S e c t i o n s 2 and 7 (which relate to
offences committed either by spectators or by clubs) w i l l not come into effe ct
u n t i l an ap p ropriate S ta tutory I n st r u me n t is made.          I assume that if it is
im po s s i b l e to draw up a "safe scheme" then the Act w i ll simply not be e ffective.
T h e G o v e r n m e n t ' s in t ention would seem, therefore, to be to arrange to have i n
p la c e the maj o ri t y of the legislation, but w i t h the offence provisions s i m p l y
coming in later wh e n the scheme has bee n esta b l is h ed .

 It seems to me un l i ke l y that the Bill itself w i l l be su b st a n ti a ll y revised
 b efore it becomes Law; p r essure therefore, ought to be directed at the s c h em e
 itself.

                  Dear Clive

                       Just a short note of thanks to yourself, your Members and their
                  families and friends , for making last Sunday's Charity Football Match
                  such a success.

                   The main comment I have been hearing from those who took part, or
              who attended the match, is what a very nice, pleasant and enjoyable day
              altogether it was.  Obviously the weather and the Stadium added to the
              day, but I do think that the friendship and relaxed atmosphere were
              particularly noticeable.

                   The sponsorship and programme money is continuing to come in and
              we are hopeful of making good donations both to the Hillsborough Appeal
              and to the local charity, the Wolverhampton Multi-Handicap Care and
              Relief Service,

                       I hope that the injury sustained by your colleague was not too
                  serious.  I enclose for your information a press cutting from Wolverhampton's
                  local evening newspaper, the Express & Star.

                          Best wishes.

                                                   Yours sincerely




                                                  Norman G Davies,

      Dear Councillor Carr,

      FOOTBALL        MATCH BETWEEN SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY                            AMD    MXDDLESBORQgGH

      I     am writing            in     relation      to  the               f o o t ba l l   match        which        t o o k p l a c e at
      H i l l s b o r o u g h a c o u pl e of w e e k s ago.

      I a m sure the p e o p l e in Middlesborough are v e r y d i s a p p o i n t e d at                                  t he        outcome
      of the m a t c h and the fact that y o u r side w e r e relegated.

      I too,           while     being  pleased     that W e d n e s d a y d i d n o t suffer r el e ga t i on , w a s
      d i s a p p o i n t e d that the match, e f f e c ti v el y , h a d to    decide    which    of     our    two
      teams w e n t d o w n to the s e c o n d division.

      The       reason       I    am w r i t i n g   this letter in such terms is t h a t I w i s h to give
      p r o p e r p r a i s e and credit to the w a y in w h i c h             the  fans  from Middlesborough
      b e h a v e d o n this o c casion.           I a m the first to a ccept th a t the a r r a n g e m e n t s for
      the       allocation          of  tick e ts      at   the g r o u n d w e r e exceedingly       unfair            to
      Middlesborough               fans  a nd      the a t te m p t s m a d e to stop fans c o m i n g to S h e f f i e l d
      w e r e q u e s t io n ab l e , to say the least.

      The r e a l it y is, of course,              t ha t     many  more   Middlesborough   fans    than      had
      tickets      in the s e g r e g a t e d a r e a came to the g r o u n d and sat a r o u n d the v a r i o u s
      stands a m o n g s t S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y supporters.      ■

      At n o time t h r o u g h o u t the game d i d I w i t n e s s any                          in c idents         w h a t s o e v e r . and,
      while         your        fans      shouted         for y o u r t e a m as hard as they could, there w a s no
      u n p l e a s a n t n e s s b e t w e e n M i d d l e s b o r o u g h a n d W e d n e s d a y s u p p o r t e r s of w h i c h I        am
      aware.

      I     t h in k w h e n f o o t b al l fans b e h a v e in this w a y it is i m p o r t a n t t ha t   al s o gets '
      publicity, as all too o f t e n the                     media       are  prepared  to     jump     on  the few
      m i n d l e s s h o o l i g a n s who, u n fo r t u n a t e l y , get all football fans a b a d name.

With supporters like yours, I only hope that you can make a quick comeback to
the first division and X am sure we will welcome all of you back           to
Hillsborough the season after next.

I am taking this opportunity of copying the letter to the Middlesborough
Football Club and to your local paper as I feel that your supporters deserve
full appreciation and credit for the way they behaved.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Councillor Carr,

FOOTBALL MATCH BETWEEN SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY AND MIDDLESBOROUGH

I am writing in relation to the        football   match   which   took    place at
Hillsborough a couple of weeks ago.

I am sure the people in Middlesborough are very disappointed at     the   outcome
of the match and the fact that your side were relegated.

I too, while being pleased that Wednesday did not suffer relegation, was
disappointed that the match, effectively, had to decide which of our two
teams went down to the second division.

The reason I am writing this letter in such terms is that I wish to give
proper praise and credit to the way in which the fans from Middlesborough
behaved on this occasion.  I am the first to accept that the arrangements for
the allocation of tickets at         the ground were exceedingly unfair    to
Middlesborough fans and the attempts made to stop fans coming to Sheffield
were questionable, to say the least.

The reality is, of course,  that   many more Middlesborough fans     than had
tickets  in the segregated area came to the ground and sat around the various
stands amongst Sheffield Wednesday supporters.

At no time throughout the game did I witness any incidents whatsoever and,
while your fans shouted for your team as hard as they could, there was no
unpleasantness between Middlesborough and Wednesday supporters of which I am
aware.

I think when football fans behave in this way it is important that also gets
publicity, as all too often the    media are prepared to jump on      the few
mindless hooligans who, unfortunately, get all football fans a bad name.     AU'

With supporters like yours, I only hope that you can make a quick comeback to
the first division and I am sure we will welcome all of you back to
Hillsborough the season after next.

I am taking this opportunity of copying the letter to the Middlesborough
Football Club and to your local paper as I feel that your supporters deserve
full appreciation and credit for the way they behaved.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Dean,

I sat behind your mother at the match at Newcastle.  To put it mildly she was
highly delighted by the match and, not least by your first goal for the clubi

I thought she might like to have a copy of all the newspaper reports of     the
game and perhaps you would be good enough to pass these on to her.

Please give her my best regards and I look forward to seeing her as happy    at
future matches.

With best wishes for next season.

Mr. J. Thorn,

Dear John,

Re: Sheffield Wednesday v Middlesborough

You   wrote   to   my   office   at the time of the Sheffield Wednesday
v Middlesborough match on the concerns of the Owlerton Ward about   the
prevention of the Middlesborough fans travelling to Sheffield.

I raised this matter with the Police Authority and subsequently    wrote to the
Chief Constable about it with some very detailed questions.  I enclose a        copy
of my original letter together with the Chief Constable’s reply.

I am not sure in hindsight that we can do very much about the issue now but I
think at least by asking the questions and gaining information we will be in
a better position to deal with any future incidents and perhaps by indicating
that we are not prepared simply to accept such situations we will at least
have had some effect.

Yours sincerely,

 SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY       v   MIDDLESBOROUGH
 - 1 3 MAY 1 9 8 9

 I refer to your letter of the 7 June and our discussion 011 23 June. I
 will deal with the points raised in the order they were presented in your
 letter.

 The decision to limit the number of tickets available to Middlesborough
 fans was taken by Sheffield Wednesday F.C. in the knowledge that the West
 Midlands Inquiry Team would not release the West Stand and Terrace to
 visiting supporters for this match as their enquiries were still not
 complete.  The Club decided after consultation with my officers that 1500
 tickets was a reasonable number to allocate in the interests of safety
 and good order.  Consideration was given to allowing more than 1500
 persons into the North Stand but it was felt that the number of police
 officers needed to control numbers in excess of 1500 would have been
 prohibitive.

 The power to prevent fans without tickets coming to the ground lies at
 common law if the police fear a breach of the peace is l i k e l y . Based on
 the intelligence available to us and our experience with the same Club
 visiting Barnsley in the Spring of 1988 and Doncaster the preceding y e a r ,
 we readily feared that breaches of the peace were likely to occur. This
 power at common law was reinforced in the case of Moss and Others v
 McLachlan Queens Bench Division, 22 November 1984.




                                                          /C o n t 'd
                                  - 2 -



In relation to the policing of this match a total of 667 police officers
were on duty.  Including supervisory ranks 195 of these officers were
located inside the ground.  A further 326 officers were located in and
around the streets adjoining the ground and approach roads.  A further 67
police officers were deployed on duty in the City centre meeting trains
arriving from the North of England and ensuring that no disruption was
caused to normal Saturday afternoon trading by football supporters.   A
further 79 officers were deployed at various checkpoints on all the
approach roads to Hillsborough, paying particular emphasis to the
checking of public transport vehicles en route to the ground to ensure
that they were not carrying intoxicants in contravention of the Sporting
Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985-  These officers were also
engaged to check that all fans attending had tickets for admission to the
ground.

The charge levied to the Club under our Contract for policing matches at
Hillsborough totalled £3,312.23p which represents the services of
1 Inspector, 4 Sergeants and 34 Constables.  At this stage I cannot give
the exact cost of the operation as all of the 667 officers concerned were
of different ranks, the majority of whom were constables.  However, each
of these constables would attract a different rate of pay according to
his length of service.  Secondly, some of them would be paid basic duty
rate as they would be working in normal duty time and others would be
working overtime.  If this overtime were on a normal working day as an
extension to their shift reimbursement would be at time and one third.
Others working on their rest day would be compensated at time and a half.
Assuming each officer has performed 6 hours duty in connection with this
match and taking a mid-point on the constables salary scale then the
total wage bill would be about £35,000.00 at basic rate.  This takes no
account of overtime and when we have finalised the costs they are likely
to be considerably in excess of that amount.

From the outset our intention was to mount a massive publicity campaign
aided by our colleagues in the Cleveland Police Force to prevent
supporters without tickets travelling to Sheffield.  For the most part,
this exercise was a complete success . It is true that several hundred
Middlesborough fans actually acquired tickets to various parts of the
ground.  We are aware of one instance where a local contractor with close
connections in Middlesborough acquired 50 tickets and distributed them in
that area on behalf of his firm.  Our intelligence reports (which proved
to be very accurate) led us to believe that due to the importance of the
match as many as 10,000 Middlesborough supporters might wish to travel to
this game.  In 1987 3,000 fans were turned away from the Belle Vue Ground
in Doncaster without tickets.  Considerable disorder occurred and 25
arrests were made.  In May last year there was further trouble from this
Club's supporters at the Oakwell Ground, Barnsley.  As the week preceding
the match progressed then the numbers thought likely to travel decreased.




                                                            /Cont'd.
                                  - 3 -



We were well aware that Middlesborough supporters might emerge at other
parts of the ground and this is the reason why such a large number of
officers were deployed inside the ground in order that they could nip any
trouble in the bud very quickly and if necessary, remove those spectators
to a different part of the ground.

I hope that the above information is of value to you.   If you have any
further queries I will endeavour to answer them.

Given that this operation was arranged, it did not seem to have been a
conspicuous success in that many thousands of Middlesborough fans actually
got in the ground and got tickets to various parts of it. It does seem to my
point-of-view that the arrangements were far from adequate and it would have
been much better to have given more tickets to Middlesborough and to have
properly planned the operation on the basis of many more Middlesborough fans
coming but having a proper ticket allocation which could then have been
controlled and organised in the normal manner.

Perhaps you would like to respond to these various points and questions.

Yours sincerely,

BILES:         ^ But many clubs find major improvements to their
grounds impossible, as the Chairman of Sheffield United, Ray
Brealey, well remembers from nine years ago.

BREALEY:                         We decided that our stadium needed a lot of
money spending on it and the best thing to do was to
redesign.                     We called in architects, and prepared a very
good                scheme,
4 - i i v t v \ /-\ ^
                           which  was about 20million
                                  *r              . .
                                                        pounds, * and it was
turned down.                  It’s   as simple as that.
BILES:               Why?
BREALEY:             (Sigh)    Two words - political bigotry,
BILES:               And what is the position now?
BREALEY:        We spent a lot of money on the ground,
repairing, so to speak, and made the best of a bad job, but
we have a very good ground; we have the safety certificates,
and we made the best of what we’ve got.       V

BILES:           How different would the new stadium have been
if it had gone ahead?

                 ^ was ^-esiSne(i "to be a sort of Wembley of
the North.   It woulil liaVc- had an eight lane athletics tr^ck
around the inside, and it had all kinds of sporting facilities
underneath the stadium.      Underneath the stands, the snooker rooms
where tournaments could take place.      It really was a sporting
complex - paid for by the commercial enterprise which was
around the perimiter of the stadium.

BILES:              Ironically, a new sports stadium, with a
capacity of_4Q,QQQ is to be built in Sheffield.        Purpose built
for fiel(Tand -fcr a c k athletics, when the 1991 World Students
Games w i n be”"held there.       .........

SHEFFIELD UNITED FOOTRAT.T. p.t.ttr

In response to your memoranda on the above I can now bring you up to date
with the position.  It has taken a considerable amount of time to get
feedback from the directors of the Club as to their intentions.  Finally I
managed to arrange a meeting on Wednesday with Mike Wragg, Paul Woolhouse
Tony Wood of D&BS and Tony Stevens of Estates.

Mike Wragg and Paul Woolhouse have confirmed that they would be looking for
a move for the 1992 season, which suits us as this is post World Student
Games.  I understand that four of the directors are in favour but the
Chairman has his doubts.

Briefly the course of action is as follows:

a)   Tony Wood and I are to meet with the Directors again next week at the
     Club to discuss in detail their likely requirements for moving into the
     stadium.  This will involved Tony looking at what they have at present
     and then assessing the options and potential costs for the stadium.

b) The main point is that both Paul Woolhouse and Mike Wragg are saying     we
    must put some form of offer in writing together with a number  of
    options centred around our view of the valuation of the Club.  Tony
    Stevens has had a very quick look at this and has come up with a figure
    in the order of £6 million which is slightly above the figure shown to
    us by the Club. We have agreed that Tony would liaise with the C l u b ’s
    valuers in order that we can have a fuller valuation.

c)   The Club would be wanting to have a number of options as to how we move
      forward, having satisfactorily agreed a valuation, for example their
      preference would be some king of joint development initiative where
      they could retain equity equal to the valuation, and thus retain
      freehold ownership of the developed site. We would need to bear in
     mind whether we would want to give cash payment, if we could find a way
     of doing this given our capital problems, and whether this would be
     simply putting money into the Chairman’s hands. However, once Tony
     Stevens has done his valuation I will discuss the matter fully with you
     in order to determine some of those options.

     One further point which you might be interested in is that negotiations
     are taking place between our Estates and Lavers on the sale of their
     site.  There appears to be a bit of a hiccup in that the company are
     looking for valuation and cost of removal.  I will keep you informed of
     progress.

     You will see I have copied this to Richard Caborn MP in view of his
     continuing interest.

          PRIORITY SEARCH - WORKING WITH FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS’


          Following our original proposal to use Priority Search with the football
          supporters1 of Sheffield, Liverpool and perhaps Nottingham,  we understand that
          you are supportive of us offering this service on behalf of the City Council.
          We therefore, propose to contact Rogan Taylor of the Football S u pporters1
          Association to suggest that the FSA act as the clients in this project w i t h a
          view to the findings being used to complement their evidence to the Inquiry.

         We also understand that the City Council is recruiting the services of
         Rogan Taylor in an advisory capacity in connection with the design of the new
         Don Valley Stadium and that the City Treasurer is liaising with Mr Taylor
         on this matter.  We have made contact with Malcolm Newman and he has expressed
         an interest in how Priority Search may be used to support this work.
         Consequently we are making a presentation of Priority Search to the
         Student Games Management Team on 16 May.

         We will contact you again once we have made contact with Rogan Taylor and
         discussed with him more fully this approach.

                   LAND AND PREMISES, BRAMALL LANE
                   SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL AND S.U.F.C.
                                                                                      jy f      &

                   I refer to our recent meeting with two of the Directors
                   of S.U.F.C. and, as agreed, set out for consideration possible
                   options, and comments on them.

                   In considering each option I have made the following assumptions


                         i)     S.U.F.C.       is to remain in existence as a football league
                                club.

        )           ii)         Planning consent for the Bramall Lane ground will
                                be limited to residential and office use

                   iii)         The estimated total cost of construction of the new
                                East End Stadium is £22m.

                    iv)         I estimate the current open market value of the Bramall
                                Lane Stadium to be £6m. (the "redevelopment"  value
                                is greater than existing use value).

                   The options at this stage appear to be:-

        v'         O P T IO N    1 :-   City Council to acquire the Bramall Lane complex
                                        and the Club makes its own reaccommodation arrangements.

            v'     O P T IO N    2 ;-   City Council to acquire the Bramall Lane complex
                                        (£6m.) and lease back to S.U.F.C.  for a term
                                        of 3 years certain, S.U.F.C. to make own reaccommodation
                                        arrangements.  Estimated rental required on
                                        lease back £690,000 per annum but the City Council
                                        could, with a policy decision, accept a rent
                                        lower than market value provided the lease term
                                        is less than 7 years.

        ✓          O P T IO N    3 :-   City Council acquires the Bramall Lane complex
                                        (,£6m. current value) on a deferred purchase
                                        basis (e.g. full payment in 1992 of £7.56m.
                                        or 3 annual payments reflecting inflation);
                                        S.U.F.C. leases from the City Council accommodation
                                        at the new Stadium.

                                        I assume the Club will require exclusive possession
                                        of* -
                                              i) administrative accommodation;
                                            ii) changing facilities;
                                          iii) playing surface and shared use of -

                                                   (a)   turnstiles
                                                   (b)   car parks
                                                   (c)   spectator areas (executive boxes?)
                                                   (d)   media facilities
                                                   (e)   common parts.

                    ,     Further considerations will, of course, expand
                    \     and refine this list and it will be necessary
                          to estimate the cost and value of these various
                        1 elements.

                          Under Option 3 the financial arrangements could
                          b e :-

                          A.   Council pays S.U.F.C. £6m. as a capital
                               sum for the Bramall Lane complex and S.U.F.C.
                               takes accommodation in the new Stadium paying
                               a premium for the "exclusive"  accommodation,
                               and a rental, or service charge, for the
                               shared facilities; or

                          B.   Council pays S.U.F.C. £6m. for the Bramall
                               Lane complex and the Club takes a lease
                               of the exclusive/shared accommodation at
                               a market r e n t .

    O P T IO N   4 :-     City Council acquires the Bramall Lane complex
                          and leases the East End Stadium, in total, to
                          S.U.F.C. (estimated rent £2m.  p.a.) and the
                          City Council guarantees to buy back a specific
                          number of days during the year at a figure to
                          be agreed.

    O P T IO N   5 :-     City Council acquire the Bramall Lane complex
                          and lease to S.U.F.C. the playing surface with
J                         "daily" use of the necessary ancillary facilities;
                          under this Option the Club would build its administrative
                          offices outside the Stadium e.g. at the Woodbourn
                          athletics track which could become the S.U.F.C.
                          training facility.

    Unfortunately, the respective values of Bramall Lane and
    the new Stadium are so disparate that a joint venture arrangement
    would not appear to satisfy either the Club's or the Council's
    r e q u i re m e n t .

    Of the Options put forward I feel the one which is worthy
    of further investigation is Option 3;  should you have any
    further alternatives please let me know - clearly, I am
    happy to discuss the possibilities with you and will be
    pleased if you will not quote the estimated value of £6m.
    openly as to do so may be damaging to the Authority.

                             National Footb a l l M u s e u m

                                                                   W S JAN 1989
         Everyone in the Sh e f f i e l d area is look i n g on w i t h interest
and admiration at the tremendous w o r k w h i c h is be i n g done in p r e p ­
aration for the W o r l d Student Games. You will be aware however, that
some people are expressing conc e r n as to what use these facilities
will be put when the Games are over. I w o u l d like to set before you
a proposal which w o u l d have lasting benefit for the city long after
the Games have g o n e —  a Nationa l F o o tball Museum.


            Please do not dismiss this as a "crank" suggestion. I have
given it a lot of thought a nd k n o w that it could work. I am 36 years
of age and have been H e a d of Ph y sical E d u cation at a large c o m p r e h e n ­
sive school for 10 years. I feel that I have s p o rting experience in
many a r e a s .


          I find it strange that a country w h i c h is so p r o u d of its
heritage, which has museums for science, industry, aeronautics, space,
railways, photography - not to m e n t i o n cricket, tennis and rugby
league - should not have a natio n a l football museum. Football is the
most popular game in the w o r l d a n d E n g l a n d i n v e n t e d it! I believe this
country should have a national football m u s e u m and I believe it s h o u l d
be in Sheffield, because, as you are aware, the h i s t o r y of the o r g a n ­
i sed game originates in our city.


         When on ho l i d a y with m y fami l y we often go on day trips to
various museums and exhibitions up and down the coun t r y a n d ne v e r
cease to be amazed at the n u mbe r of people who will pay to see displays
(some of which are of only mode r a t e standard). I always leave t h i n k i n g
that a well-pr e s e n t e d football m u s e u m could be successful and w o u l d be
extremely worthwhile.


           In my present job I am f r e q u e n t l y made aware of childrens'
interest in sport an d find it f r u s t r a t i n g that I often have to take
them to London if they want to visit a m a j o r sporting venue. All this
will change with the advent of the superb facilities p l a n n e d for the
Wor l d Student Games. A national football m u s e u m w o u l d be a m a j o r draw
all year round to a city which is idea l l y g e o g r a p h i c a l l y s i t u a t e d and
a nd which hosts football supporters from different areas of the
country every Saturday of the fo o tball season.


                Engaging the support of the Football League a n d e s pecially the
Football Associ a t i o n (who I am sure w o u l d want any s u c h project to be
bas e d in London) wo u l d be a difficult but important ingredient for the
success of the venture. However, I am sure they could not fail to be
im p r e s s e d by the preparations for the pr o v i s i o n of excellent sporting
facilities in S h e ffield and could be p r e v a i l e d upon to look f a v o u r a b l y
on a national museum.


                              P.T.O.
Brief Outline of Some of the Displays


      1.   Documentary and Picto r i a l evidence of the origins
           of the game, both in S h e f f i e l d and the rest of the
           country.

      2.   The game develops over the years.

      3.   H istory of the Football League.

      4.   H istory of the Football Association.

      5.   The International Game - b o t h at club a n d national
           team level.

      6.   The Wo r l d Cup.

      7.   Hall of Fame - along the lines of Baseball and
            Ameri c a n Football. A v e r y select club of outs t a n d i n g
            players from all over the world, w i t h photographs
            and films of them in action.

      8.   Cafeteria.

      9.   Restaurant in pleasant surroundings.

      10. M u s e u m Shop.



         I trust you will see from the above that I am very e n t husiastic
about this project and that I have thought it through. Please do not
be m i s l e d by the fact that I live in Derbyshire. I am a Sheffielder.
All my schooling was in Sheffield, I p l a y e d for S h e f f i e l d Boys at
football and was on the books at S h e f f i e l d United.


      I hope y ou find the above plans to be of interest and w o u l d
welcome an opportunity to discuss them w i t h y o u in the n e a r future.

                   REPORT ON FOOTBALL CONFERENCE (16 MAY 1989)
                          HFTD    AT HAMMERSMITH TOWN HALL


The   Conference   was   opened    by   Councillor Mike Goodman,   the Leader   of
Hammersmith and Fulham Council, who asked delegates to stand for a minute's
silence in memory of the 95 football supporters who lost their lives at
Hillsborough Stadium.


Dave Blunkett, the Member of Parliament for Sheffield Brightside, whose
constituency contains Hillsborough Stadium, spoke of the need for the
government to recognise football hooligans as the social blight that they
are.   The vast majority of ordinary, decent and largely working class
supporters, should not be punished because of the antics of a tiny minority
bent on causing havoc.

Lord Ted Graham, the Shadow Minister of Sports in the Lords, gave a history
of the fight against the Football Spectators' Bill in the House of Lords.

He spoke about his own personal view on the progress of the Bill when it
returns to the Commons. He was less than optimistic about the chances of
defeating the Bill as the Prime Minister has declared her strong support
for the legislation.

Rogan Taylor, the Chair of the Football Supporters' Association, made a
very challenging contribution.     He spoke with some contempt about the
hierarchy that currently runs football and the amateur and incompetent
fashion in which they go about running our national game.

He demanded that supporters should be given a far greater voice if we are
to stop the decline in the game's fortunes.

He was followed by Craig Brewin who was refreshingly honest about the
game's administrators and the role of the police.
He spoke of the work of the Football Supporters' Association and made
specific reference          to   the   crowd disturbance      that had   taken place   at
Selhurst Park the previous Saturday.


Robert Trent a Boummouth supporter who is wheelchair bound spoke with
humour about the state of the game - his comments have already appeared in
Saturday's Guardian Soccer Diary.


He   also   on   a   more    serious    note voiced his       grave   concern about    the
implications      of   the       I.D   Card    Scheme   for    supporters   with   severe
disabilities.


Tom Pendry MP for Halbridge and Chair of the All Party Parliamentary
Football Committee gave the Labour Party case against the bill.


The Labour Party oppose the bill as they believe it to be irrelevant to the
incidents of violence that occur today, which tend to be away from the
immediate vicinity of the grounds.


The speaker from the NCCL spoke about her organisation's considerable fears
concerning the implications of the legislation for Civil liberties.


The conference organisers spent a good deal of time and energy attempting
to arrange for a morning speaker from the Government who was prepared to
defend   the     legislation but despite offers          to change the date of         the
conference were unable to do so.


Councillor Viv Dunnington the head of Luton Council and a supporter of
Luton Towns ban on away fans gave his authority's view of the experience of
the scheme.      The Council in Luton feel it has been a most useful initiative
which has made the streets safe again for local people on a Saturday.


He did admit that attendances had fallen and that there was a lack of
atmosphere but felt that these disadvantages were outweighed by the more
friendly and less intimidating environment that now prevailed.




                                              - 2 -
Ken Bates     said that   the Bill could lead   to further Hillsborough-like
tragedies and demonstrated the "complete ignorance that        the government
ministers have of football."


He claimed that Chelsea, who have in the past had a notorious reputation,
had just finished a highly successful season where they had won the 2nd
division championship and, equally importantly for him, the season had been
virtually trouble-free.


After the lunch break Gary Stemple, the Community Development Officer of
Millwall Football Club, gave the Conference an insight into the Millwall
initiative.


He talked about how at first he had come across resistance to measures
which he wished to implement, but how there was now a general atmosphere of
enthusiasm about the progressive anti-racist, anti-sexist strategies being
adopted by Millwall.      He gave information about the sponsorship deal with
Lewisham Borough Council and other new policies, such as the creche on
match days and the players' contribution at local schools.


Simon Ingliss, who has written a book about English football stadiums and
is currently researching a book on European grounds,         spoke with great
knowledge about the implications of the Hillsborough disaster.      He did not
believe that all-seater stadiums were necessarily       the panacea for the
future and gave example of stadiums he recently seen in Europe.


At the end of each session, delegates were given the opportunity to ask
questions or make short contributions and these were,        in general, very
thoughtful.    Simon Ingliss, in particular, provoked a good deal of interest
and debate around the question of facilities at football grounds.


The next session dealt with partnership between local authorities and the
football grounds, and Councillor Ivan Gibbons, the Chair of Hammersmith and
Fulham's Leisure and Recreation Committee,      gave details of the reduced
prices deal that the Council has negotiated for the three clubs to take
very seriously their responsibility to the local community and to take on



                                     - 3 -
more of those concerns and complaints about the activities of the club.
Councillor Gordon Prentice, the Hammersmith and Fulham representative on
Fulham Football Club Management        Committee,   gave a history of how       the
Council tried to protect local clubs from grasping hands of the property
developers.


He spoke about the unique compulsory purchase order initiative that the
Council has adopted at Craven Cottage, which everyone appears to believe
stands the best chance of securing the future of the club on their current
site.


Garth Crooks, the chair of the Players' Football Association, was a late
substitute    for Gordon Taylor,     but spoke with great passion about         the
players' view of the problems of the game are at this time.             He talked
about   the   concerns    of   the ordinary players,    such as   injuries,   crowd
invasions and failure to re-new contracts           - aspects of    the game not
necessarily normally considered by the average supporter.


After tea and a short discussion between delegates concerning issues raised
during the day, two members of parliament arrived with very different views
about the proposed Football Spectators Bill.           John Carlisle, the MP for
Luton North, and a well known back bench government loyalist, defended the
Bill stoutly in the face of obvious hostility from the delegates.               He
believed that the government had a duty to protect citizens from those
hell-bent on causing violence and destruction and such a duty had to
prevail over the interests of any sport, including football, which is a
game which he said he loved.


Simon Hughes, liberal MP for Bermondsey, had just released details of an
opinion poll, commissioned by the SDLP and sponsored by Millwall Football
Club.      This poll     clearly demonstrated   the dwindling     support for   the
Football Spectators Bill and the details of the poll made interesting
reading.      He had demonstrated that many conservative MPs in marginal
constituencies could have their chances for re-election seriously damaged
at the next election, unless the Bill was the subject of major amendments.
There was an animated question and answer session with MPs, and the Chair


                                       - 4 -
of   the Conference closed by asking John Carlisle               to take back to his
colleagues the message of the Conference which was quite clear,                  ie that
football supporters recognised          the problem of soccer violence but            they
would   not   stand   idly   by   and   see   the   game   destroyed   because   of   the
irrelevant    legislation    introduced by     a    government   who clearly have      no
understanding of the issues involved.

  WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO IMPROVE FOOTBALL FOR THE
                    SUPPORTERS?
The most striking aspect of this survey is the extraordinary degree of unanimity. The FSA conference
could be regarded as a fairly homogeneous group. Nevertheless a very wide cross section of society
was represented |see Appendix 1): people of different and no earned income; home supporters and
away fans; people who watch the game with friends, with children or on their own; people who sit as
well as those who stand; different age groups; members of supporters clubs and season ticket holders;
and men and women. No matter what category of people we examine, their perception as to the
priority solutions for improving football for the supporters is virtually identical.

The first diagram below shows all the thirty items used in the questionnaire prioritised in order, 1 to 30,

The following is a broad brush description of the general themes that emerge from these
results - how they hang together into a consensus outlook on the way forward for football.
Without apology, this report is a subjective account of the views of football supporters.
 It is not intended to be impartial. It does not take into account the views of the
club's management, the police, the players or the stewards. Such an overall view would
only be possible if similar surveys were conducted with these groups. In such an eventuality
an overall picture could be painted taking into account the subjective views of all parties.
The absence of such data does not, however, invalidate this search. The viewpoint of the
customer matters in its own right and deserved to be listened to without qualification.


1.    Responsibility

      There is undoubtedly a high level of preparedness amongst
      supporters to take responsibility for sorting out the problems of football.
      Football supporters' are more than just customers. They
      follow the game with a passion often incomprehensible
      to those on the outside. Football is an important part of many people's
      lives with deep roots in English culture. Consequently there is
      no lack of commitment to the game; no shortage of volunteers.

      Specifically supporters have demonstrated in this survey:

             a preparedness to shoulder some of the responsibility
             for the behaviour of others, which demonstrates a high level of
             positive collective identification with their fellow supporters;

             a preparedness to give up their own time, energy and
             intelligence to working with each other to finding solutions;

             a commitment to basic moral principals of fairness and
             accountability.

       In other words there is a recognition that while supporters have their
       problems of bad behaviour when they get together, these could be successfully
       tackled, largely by or with the participation and guidance of democratically
       accountable supporters in the game. The same basic principles of fairness
       that lie behind the rules of conduct of those on the pitch, should be used to
       steward the conduct of those off it.


2.     Respect

       Supporters expect to be treated better. Throughout the country there is a
       growing realisation that the customer has a right to better service and treatment.
       Their collective characteristics are there to be understood and catered for by
       the body providing the service.

       Football supporters' do pay to get in. They provide three times the amount of
       finance into the game than all the sponsorship money put together. Not only
       that but they are participative customers who give of themselves (and would do
       more if they were only asked) to improve the product in the interests and
       enjoyment of everyone.
     They pay for, and expect to be treated with more respect.

     Specifically they want:

     a)    a different relationship w ith the police. Out of all the various
           suggestions for coping with the problems of ground control, this was
           the one which highlighted the gulf in respect between the customer
           and those currently charged with their stewarding - the police. The
           gulf is too large to be bridged by statements of goodwill or policy
           declarations about impartiality. Treating rival supporters impartially
           can still result in both sets of fans being assumed collectively to be a
           problem/ What the supporters want instead is a serious injection of
           police personnel training with the emphasis on serving, protecting
           and respecting the supporter as a valued, participative customer, the
           length and breadth of the country;

     b)    a different relationship w ith the clubs. Running in parallel to their
           hopes for change in their relationship with the police, supporters seek a
           more participative sort of partnership with their own clubs. Running as a
           theme throughout many of the prioritised items is the demand to be
           respected, involved and generally catered for in a respectful manner by
           those with power in the game - the clubs;

            *    democratically accountable supporters should be represented at
                  every decision making level in the game and should share
                  responsibility and hence power, for managing the game;

            *     the supporters 'stage' in which they play their part to the creation
                  of a football spectacle - the terracing and stands - needs to be as
                  the supporters want them to be:-

                  ij    without any fencing which is likely to impede their view
                        and movement;

                  iij   the terracing's, where historically the core of a team's
                         passionate and melodic support emanates, should remain;

            *    the general experience of being in a football ground should be
                  pleasurable; specifically clubs need to direct their investment to
                  improve the facilities throughout the ground in terms of catering,
                  refreshments, toilets and other services. Such measures by
                  themselves would reduce the unattractiveness of football grounds
                  to many women with the consequences of diluting the overtly
                  macho culture of football with all its ugly spin offs;

            *    supporters' needs are important when decisions are being made
                  about investment and pricing. Their main concern is to keep the
                  game affordable to existing supporters. This may reflect fears of
                  football being priced out of their price range to suit an imagined
                  new and more affluent market.


3.   Changing the Culture

     Supporters want to see a change in the atmosphere at football matches but they
     don't want to loose the emotion and passion of a partisan crowd at its best.
     They want to change the 'culture', but not too muchl

     Specifically what needs to change is the white and male exclusiveness of football
     crowds. The proportion of black players on the pitch is in no way matched by
     black supporters in the crowd. The supporters surveyed (86% of whom were
     white men) are quite clear as to why this is: the level of racism emanating from
     a section of the white crowd which is tolerated by other supporters and club alike.
     Supporters want to see firm official action, which carries the authority of the club
     behind it, to be seen to be taken against racist supporters. Furthermore, as described
     above, supporters are prepared to play their part in tackling the problem.

     As also referred to above, clubs need to act to improve facilities and viewing
     arrangements in the grounds in order to recruit a broader spectrum of support.
     While the game may always remain a primarily male passion, it is nevertheless a
     family passion as well. Clubs need to demonstrate, in terms of the physical condition
     of the ground, the everyone in the family is welcome and will be catered for as a matter
     of course.

     By acting against racists in the crowd and improving facilities to encourage more
     women to the game, the culture of the match will inevitably change. There is,
     however, a clear view amongst supporters that in the effort to change the crowd
     atmosphere the collective experience of the standing supporters should not be lost.

     It is obviously the strongly held belief of supporters that if we are to retain the
     spirit of the crowd, terracing must remain. The problems of safety and violence will
     only be resolved by a change in the relationship between supporters, the clubs and
     police - a partnership of mutual respect where each sees the other as indispensable
     contributors to the spectacle of the game - not by forcing everyone to sit downl

     Linked very much to the issues of retaining what is best about football crowd
     culture and encouraging clubs to developing partnerships with their supporters is '
     the need to improve links with local community. Supporters see this as a practical
     way of clubs demonstrating their commitment to local people - the community which
     provides them with their (usually) life long followers. Many clubs have already seen
     the importance of such links. The message from this survey is that community links
     are not an optional extra. They should form a central commitment to the work
     programme and investment plans of every club, every year.


4.   Other Themes

     While not ranking quite so high as the above themes of responsibility, respect and
     culture, some further general concerns emerge.

     Supporters are looking for some of the vast sums of money around in football to
     be directed back into the game with tangible benefits to the supporters. Specifically
     they suggest new stadiums, and especially an alternative to Wembley in the North of
     England.

     Supporters also display a keen sense of fairness. They want to see a reformed
     commonsense system of democracy and discipline. Specifically they suggest attention is
     given to the standard of refereeing, the policing of away fans and the
     democratic management of the game nationally.


5.   The Differences Explained

     As emphasised above the striking factor about this survey is the extraordinary high degree of
     consensus. There were however, some slight differences of emphasis which only enrich the
     overall conclusions. These differences give us a richer picture of the needs of supporters.
     At no point do they demonstrate a split of opinion. They can be summarised as follows:

           a)     women place a slightly higher emphasis on the need for improved
                  facilities in the ground, including better and cheaper catering facilities;
      b)      those under 20 years oppose membership schemes very strongly, are
              attracted by the idea of encouraging earlier arrival at grounds and want
              to see improvements to the entertaining quality of the game itself in terms
              of attacking football;

      c)      the over 40s, place considerable emphasis on the need for better and
              cheaper facilities in the ground and want to see standing areas retained.
              This links in with the view of those who attend matches with children
              (see ji) below). There seems to be a connection between the retention of
              standing areas as a means of keeping football affordable;

      d)      unwaged supporters want to see more investment in the game, namely
              the building of new stadiums and increasing the money available to
              football by bringing the pools money back into the game;

      e)      students are again another group who place extra emphasis of the need
              for better and cheaper catering facilities;

      f)     those who walk to home games, probably because they live nearby, want
              to see the clubs do more for the local community and place higher
              emphasis on tackling racism;

       g)     away supporters who travel by public transport and official transport are
              stronger in their opposition to compulsory membership schemes;

       h)    those who attend less than 50% of their teams' home match place very
              high emphasis on improved facilities to encourage more women to the
              game;

       i)    those who attend matches with children have particularly strong views on
              improved facilities both to encourage more women and to improve the
              standard of catering. They are also the group who place the greatest
              emphasis on retaining standing areas (see also (c) above).

                                        A b o u t th is s u rv e y

This survey has been conducted by Sheffield City Council's Communications Unit using
a relatively new survey method called Priority Search

Priority Search is essentially a survey method which deals in finding solutions to a problem.
The first stage in the process is to turn the problem into a question - in this case;

       What needs to happen to improve football for the supporters?

A sample group of a least a dozen of the people to be surveyed are then gathered together.
Over a period of 2 - 3 hours everyone in the group is helped to contribute solutions or
 responses to the main question. Special care is taken to ensure everyone's voice gets heard.
There is no attempt to reach a consensus within the group. On the contrary, a diversity of
opinion is encouraged.

These solutions form the items to be included in the questionnaire. The questionnaire
itself is different to the usual more familiar format. It invites the person filling it in to weight
their preference for each solution when paired off with other solutions in turn. In practice,
this method is easy to follow and quick to complete. It has been used successfully with a wide
 cross-section of society.

In essence. Priority Search gives people the power to identify w hat their needs really
are and to sort them out into a prioritised l/st of their own making as illustrated in the diagrams
 in this report.

SHEFFIELD UNITED FC

I thought I would bring you up to date on the above. Following a meeting
with Paul Woolhouse and Mike Wragg on 11 August it now looks as if the
Sheffield United deal is beginning to struggle.

The main reason appears to be of some joint understanding between Brearley
and Laver on land disposal. According to Tony Stevens from Property
Services, negotiations have come to a halt on the question of the Laver
site, despite repeated requests to take the matter further. If I
understood Paul Woolhouse correctly, then I believe Laver is holding out to
see what the football ground land is going to be valued at. If you
remember the whole basis of going forward was to buy the Laver land first.

A further problem is that Woolhouse and Wragg are saying that the Club
cannot afford to pay more than £200,000 a year for the new stadium. This
would be inclusive of rent, share of gate income, car parking income etc.
Clearly on these figures I do not believe we have a deal.  I am finding out
the precise details of the Leeds deal so that we can write back to Paul
Woolhouse giving him our formal views on the £200,000 level. He is aware
of my views.  I will contact you as soon as possible once the Leeds
information is to hand.

              SAFETY OP SPORTS GROUNDS ACT (1975) AS AMENDED

              In answer to the question you posed on the telephone the other day,
              basically the above Act applies to any sports ground which has a capacity
              of 10,000 or more.

              Moving on, a sports ground is then defined in Section 17 as "any place
              where sports or other competitive activities take place in the open
              air and where accommodation has been provided for spectators consisting
              of artificial structures or of natural structures artificially modified
              for the purpose".

              Accordingly, therefore, if all you can do at a particular sports ground
              is stand on the touch lines, the Act clearly does not apply but if there
              is any kind of artificial "accommodation" provided then the Act would
              apply, subject to the capacity of the ground.    This would mean so far
              as Rugby League is concerned that in principle it could apply to all
              grounds although some might be exempt simply because they are below
              the capacity limit.

 MANCHESTER UNITED -V- SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY - AWAY SUPPORTERS ACCOMMODATION
 Thank you for your letter of 17 October. I note the detailed points that you
 mentioned and the fact that they are a cause of concern.
 I tried to contact you by telephone today but was unable to do so and left a
 message on your answering machine. The position in fact is that the
 Manchester United FC ground is in Trafford Local Authority and I am therefore
 passing your letter onto to Mr Allan Lewis the Chief Executive of Trafford. I
 hope this is helpful to you.

 Dear Sir,

 MANCHESTER UNITED -V- SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY - AWAY SUPPORTERS ACCOMMODATION

 On Saturday,   14 October, I attended the Manchester United versus Sheffield
 Wednesday match at Old Trafford and was standing at the away supporters’ end.

v I have a number of issues to raise regarding the accommodation and the way in
  which the Police organised events.   I am very concerned indeed about some of
  these matters, particularly in light of the tragedy at Hillsborough and the
  subsequent report by Lord Justice Taylor.

 1.   I would like to receive from Manchester City Council details of the
      capacity of that end of the ground and how that capacity is calculated
      in relationship to the Green Guide and also in relationship to Lord
      Justice Taylor’s modifications of that. The reality is that the end was
      substantially overcrowded to the extent that the Police could not get
      all the supporters onto the standing area designated and many supporters
      were standing in the gangways, particularly the main gangway which ran
      along the top of the standing area.      In my view this was highly
      dangerous as people could not get proper access into or exit from the
      standing areas because of other people blocking the gangways.        One
      Police Constable actually said to us, "We did not expect this number of
      people - we were only expecting two thousand".

      I am particularly concerned as this was advertised as an all-ticket
      match for away supporters and I therefore want to know how many tickets
      were actually designated for this end and how many people were let in,
      in addition,   through the turnstiles.    The questions which then would
      follow are whether more people were let in than the designated capacity
                                    - 2 -


     for the end,    or whether the designated capacity is in excess of that
     which is reasonable in the light of all the recommendations which now
     exist to be followed at football grounds.


2.   I would like to receive some comments from the Police and the Club about
     the way they organise away supporters.  Generally, although Old Trafford
     clears fairly quickly and home supporters were gone within 10 minutes of
     the game finishing, away supporters were kept behind for half an hour
     after the final whistle.   This is an incredibly long period of time and
     far longer than I have experienced at any other ground.  The reality, on
     this occasion, is that when the away supporters were let out there was a
     sudden surge of fans which led to quite severe crushing within the
     terraces.   This, of course, was exacerbated by the fact that there w£re
     so many people in the terraces in the first place and the gangways were
     full.   People in the gangways then got pushed by others forcing their
     way up the terraces and there was quite a struggle to get through the
     narrow gaps which exist at the top of the radial dividing barriers.
     Perhaps you would like to advise me about the reasons for keeping fans
     behind for so long and whether this does not lead to difficulties. A
     further point with regard to this is that whilst fans were trying to
     leave the ground there was no attempt at all by the Police to organise
     the exit and, while many dozens of police were simply standing around,
     fans were getting crushed with no attempt at all being made to try and
     control the situation.  I find this particularly worrying and when I
     approached a senior officer outside the ground, no one seemed concerned
     about it at all.


3.   My third question concerns the design of the terraces. It seemed to me
     there were far too many people standing on the terraces for the one exit
     from the ground which is available. As you will appreciate, the ground
     is designed in such a way that the exit is right in one corner and,
     effectively, everyone has to come up the terraces to the top and walk
     down one very narrow gangway. As people were attempting to do this,
     more people were pushing their way up the terraces and also trying to
     get onto the gangway, and then to squeeze through the very narrow gaps
     on the gangway at the top of the radial fences.  In my mind this whole
     design,  at some stage,    could be a recipe for a very unfortunate
     incident. I would like comments from both the Local Authority and    the
     Club as to whether they regard the design of this ground as being in any
     way suitable for the large numbers of fans who may, from time to time,
     occupy it.

I    am writing this letter not in a spirit of condemnation but one of great
concern that there was crushing at Saturday’s game.  Fortunately, as far as I
atn aware, no one was badly injured,       but the numbers of people on the
terraces, the design of the ground and the Police arrangements all        did
                                                 -   3   -



c omb i n e    to give a ve r y u n c o m f o r t a b l e situation and one w h i c h could lead to a
t r ag e d y o c c u r r i n g in the future unless some a c t i o n is taken.

I look forward to a reply from the var i o u s a u thorities concerned.

Y ours   sincerely,

         in r e l a t ionship to the Green Guide and                 also      in      rela t i o n s h i p  to Lord
         Justice T a y l o r ’s m o d i f i c a t i o n s of that.     The reality is that the end Tfas
         su bstantially o v e r c r o w d e d to the exte n t that the P o li c e could                      n o t get
         all the supporters onto the s t anding area d e s ig n a t e d and m a n y supporters
         w e r e standing in the gangways, p a r t i c u l a r l y the m a i n gangway w h i c h                   ran
         al o n g   the    top   of     the       standing     area.       In m y        v i e w this w as highly
         dangerous as peop l e could n ot get p r o p e r access into or                          exit      from   the
         standing       areas    because          of other    peop l e   b l o c k i n g the gangways.             One
         Police C o n s table act u a l l y said to us, "We did n ot e x pe c t this n u m b e r                    of
         p eop l e - w e w e r e only e x p e ct i n g two thousand".

         I am particularly                 c o n c erned as  this w as a d v e r t i s e d as an all-ticiet
         m a t c h for away supporters and I therefore w a n t to k n o w h o w m a n y             tickets
         were      actually      d e s i g n at e d for this end and h o w m a n y p e ople wer e let in,
         in addition, thr o u g h the turnstiles.              The   questions           which  then w o u l d
         f oll o w   are w h e t h e r m o r e people w e r e let in than the d e s i g n a t e d capacity
                                                      -   2   -


      for the end, or w h e t h e r the d e s ig n a t e d capacity is in excess       of     that
      which  is  reaso n a b l e   in the light of all the recom m e n d a t i o n s w h i c h n o w
      exist to be f ollowed at football grounds.



2.    I w o u l d like to receive some comments from the Poli c e and the Club about
      the w a y they or g a n i s e away supporters.                   Generally, a l t h o u g h Old Trafford
      clears fairly q u i ck l y and ho m e supporters w e r e gone w i t h i n 10 min u t e s of
      the       game finishing,         away supporters w e r e kept                b e h i n d for ha l f an ho u r
      after the            final whistle.            This is an incredibly long p e r i od                     of time and
      far longer than I ha v e e x p e ri e n c e d at any other ground.                           The reality, on
      this occasion, is that w h e n the away supporters w e r e let out there w a s a
      sudden          surge    of     fans      which       led  to quite severe cru s h i n g w i t h i n the
      terraces.           This, of course, was e x a c e r b a t e d by the fact that there                        we r e
      so m a n y peop l e in the terraces in the first p lace and the gangways we r e
      full.         People in the gangways then got p u s h e d by                     others        forcing     their
      way       up     the    terraces and there was quite a struggle to get t h r o ug h the
      n a r r o w gaps w h i c h exist at the top               of     the   radial          div i d i n g  barriers.
      P erhaps         y ou w o u l d like to advise me about the reasons for k e e p i n g fans
      b e h i n d for so long a nd w h e t h e r this does not lead                      to     difficulties.           A
      further          p oint   with       regard        to this is that w h i l s t fans w e r e trying to
      leave the ground there was n o attempt at all by the Police                                        to  organise
      the       exit        and, w h i l e m a n y dozens of poli c e w e r e                 simply standing around,
      fans we r e          gett i n g c r u s h e d w i t h no att e m p t at all              being made      to     try and
      control          the    situation.            I    find this p a r t i c u l a r l y w o r r y i n g and w h e n I
      a p p r o a c h ed a senior o f f i c e r outside the ground, no one seemed                           concerned
      about it at all.



3.    My   third   q u e s t i o n concerns the d e s i g n of the terraces. It seemed to me
      there we r e far too m a n y people s tanding on the terraces for the one exit
      from   the ground w h i c h is available.                As y ou w i l l appreciate, the ground
      is d esigned in such a w a y that the exit is                      right  in   one     corner     and,
      effectively,       eve r y o n e     has    to come up the terraces to the top and w a l k
      down one ve r y n a r r o w gangway.          As p e o p l e w e r e  attempting     to   do    this,
      more   people     were       p u s h i n g their w a y up the terraces and also trying to
      get onto the gangway, and then to squeeze throu g h the ve r y                         narrow     gaps
      on   the   gangway at the top of the radial fences.                       In m y m i n d this whole
      design, at some          stage,        c ould  be    a     recipe     for  a ve ry      unfor t u n a t e
      incident.      I w o u l d like comments f r o m b o t h the Local A u t h o r i t y and the
      Club as to w h e t h e r they regard the d e s i g n of this grou n d as b ei n g in any
      way   suitable       for the large numbers of fans w h o may, from time to time,
      occupy it.

I a m w r i t i n g this letter n o t in a. spirit of c o n d e m n a t i o n     b ut   one    of    great
c o n c e r n that there wa s c r us h i n g at S a t u r d a y ’s game.    Fortunately, as far as I
a m aware, no one was           badly    injured,      but       the  num b e r s of   p e ople    on   the
terraces,         the  desi g n   of   the    ground       and     the Police arrangements all did

comb i n e to give a v e r y u n c om f o r t a b l e s i t u ation and one w h i c h could lead to   a
t r a g ed y o c c u r r i n g in the future unless some acti o n is taken.

I look forward to a reply from the vari o u s authorities concerned;

D e a r Sir,

MANCHESTER UNITED -V- SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY - AWAY SUPPORTERS ACCOMMODATION

On      Saturday,          14  October, I a t t e n d e d the M a n c h e s t e r U n i t e d versus Sheffield
W e d n e s d a y m a t c h at O l d T rafford and wa s standing at the away s u p p o r t e r s ’ end.

I have a n u m b e r of issues to raise re g a r d i n g the a c c o m m o d a t i o n and the w ay in
which      the Police o r g anised events.       I a m very c o n c e r n e d indeed about some of
t hese matters, p a r t i c u l a r l y in light of the tragedy at H i l l s b o r o u g h   a nd  the
s ubse q u e n t report by L o r d Justice Taylor.

1.       I would             like    to    receive       from M a n c h e s t e r City Council details of the
         cap a c i t y of that end of the grou nd and h o w that cap a c i t y                  is  calculated
         in      r e l a t ionship      to   the     Green    Guide a nd also in r e l a t ionship to Lord
         J ustice T a y l o r ’s m o d i f i c a t i o n s of that.         The reality is that the end -was
         s u b s t a ntially       overcrowded         to   the extent that the Police could n o t get
         all the supporters onto the standing area d e s i g n a t e d and m a n y supporters
         we r e      standing        in the gangways, p a r t i c u l a r l y the m a i n gangway w h i c h ran
         along the top of               the   s t anding     area.          In m y    view   this  wa s  highly
         dangerous             as  p e ople   could not get prop e r access into or exit from the
         standing areas because of                   o ther   people          blocking   the   gangways.    One
         Police          C o n stable actu a l l y said to us, "We did n ot expect this n u mber of
         p e ople - w e w e r e only e x p e c t i n g two thousand".

         I am p a r t i c u l a r l y c o n c e rn e d as this    was      advertised       as  an all-ticket
         match      for away supporters and I therefore w a n t to k n o w h o w m a n y tickets
         w e r e act u a l l y d es i g n a t e d for this e nd and h o w m a n y people w e r e     let    in,
         in addition,             thr o u g h    the    turnstiles.        The questions w h i c h then w o u l d
         follow are w h e t h e r mor e peop l e we r e let in than the desig n a t e d              capacity
         for      the    end,       or w h e t h e r the d e s i g n a t ed cap ac i t y is in excess of that
         w h i c h is reasonable in the light of all the                      r ec o m m endations which now
         exist to be followed at football grounds.

2.    I w o u l d like to receive some comments from the Police and the Club about
      the w a y they organise away supporters.                 Generally, a l t h o u g h Ol d T r afford
      clears fairly quic k l y an d ho m e supporters w e r e gone w i t h i n 10 m i n u t e s of
      the game finishing, away supporters we r e ke p t b e h i n d for                       half   an ho u r
      after      the final whistle.            This is an i ncredibly long p e r i o d of time and
      far longer than I have e x p e r i e n c e d at any other ground.                     The reality, on
      this occasion, is that w h e n the away supporters w e r e let out there w as a
      sudden surge of fans w h i c h led               to  quite    severe      crushing within             the
      terraces.        This, of course, w as e x a c e r b a t e d by the fact that there we r e
      so m a n y p e ople in the terraces in the first place an d the gangways                            we r e
      full.       People    in    the gangways then got p u s h e d by others forcing their
      w a y up the terraces and there w as quite a struggle to                          get     through     the
      narrow      gaps   which      e xist      at     the top of the radial d i viding barriers.
      Perhaps y ou w o u l d like to advise me about the reasons for                           keeping    fans
      behind      for   so    long and w h e t h e r this does not lead to difficulties.                       A
      further p o i n t w i t h r e g a r d to this is that w h i l s t       fans        were     trying    to
      leave      the   ground there w a s no attempt at all by the Police to organise
      the exit and, w h i l e m a n y dozens of p o lice w e r e simply                 standing      around,
      fans      were   gett i n g c r u s h e d w i t h no attempt at all b e i n g m a d e to try and
      control the situation.              I find this p a r t i c u l a r l y w o r r y i n g   and w h e n    I
      approached       a senior o f f i c e r outside the ground, no one seemed co n c e r n e d
      about it at all.



3.    H y t hird q ue s t i o n concerns the d e s i g n of the terraces. It seemed                      to    me
      there w e r e far too m a n y p e o p l e standing on the terraces for the one exit
      from the grou n d w h i c h is available.            As y ou w i l l appreciate, the               ground
      is     de s i g n e d   in     such   a w a y that the exit is right in one co rner and,
      effectively, everyone h as to come u p the terraces to the                            top    and w a l k
      down      one       very      narrow   gangway.    As peop l e w e r e a t t e m p ti n g to do this,
      m o r e p e ople w e r e p u s h i n g their w a y up the terraces and             also    t r y i ng    to
      get     onto        the gangway, and then to squeeze t h r o u gh the ve r y n a r r o w gaps
      on the gangway at the top of the radial fences.                       In m y m i n d      this      whole

      occu p y it.

I     am w r i t i n g        this  letter n ot in a spirit of c o n d e m n a t i o n but one of great

terraces, the d e sign of the              grou n d       and  the  Police   a r r a ngements  all  did
combine         to give a ve r y u n c o m f o r t a b l e situation and one w h i c h could lead to a

Dear Graham

MANCHESTER UNITED -V- SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY - AWAY SUPPORTERS ACCOMMODATION

O n Saturday, 14 October, I at t e n d ed the M a n c h e s t e r      United  versus        Sheffield
W e d n e s d a y m a t c h at O ld Tra f f o r d an d was standing at the away s u p p o r t e r s ’ end.

I h a ve a n u m b e r of issues to raise r e g a r d i n g the a c c o m m o d a t i o n and the w ay in
w h i c h the Police o r g a n i s ed events.          I a m ve r y c o n cerned indeed about some       of
these         matters,   p a r t i c u l a r l y in light of the tragedy at H i l l s b o r o u g h and the
s u b s e q u e nt report by L o r d Justice Taylor.

1.       I w o u l d like to receive from M a n c h e s t e r         City     Council          details     of  the
         c apacity      of   that end of the g r o u n d and h o w that ca p a c i t y is c alculated
         in r e l a t ionship to the G r e e n Guide a nd            also    in      rel a ti o n s h i p  to L o rd
         Justice T a y l o r ’s m o d i f i c a t i o n s of that.    The reality is that the end w a s

         all the supporters onto the standing area d e s i g n a t e d and m a n y supporters
         w e r e standing in the gangways, p a r t i c u l a r l y the m a i n gangway w h i c h                zan
         a long     the    top  of      the       standing     area.      In m y         v i e w this was high l y
         d angerous as peop l e could n ot get p r o p e r access into or                        exit     from the
         standing       areas   because           of     other  p e ople   b l o c k i n g the gangways.        One
         Police Constable act u a l l y said to us, "We did not expe c t this n u m b e r                         of

         I am p a r t i c u l a r l y        c o n c e r ne d as   this was a dv e r t i s e d as an all-ticket

      which  is  r easonable  in the light of all the r ecommendations w h i c h n ow
      exist to be f ollowed at football grounds.



2.    I w o u l d like to receive some comments from the P o lice and the Club about
      the w a y they o r ganise away supporters.                Generally, a l t h o u g h Old Trafford
      clears fairly qui c k l y a nd home supporters w e r e gone w i t h i n 10 m i n u t e s of
      the       game      finishing,       away supporters w e r e kept b e h i n d for h a l f an hour
      a fter the final whistle.                 This is an incredibly long p e ri o d of time                   and
      far longer th a n I h a v e e x p e r i e n c e d at any other ground.                  The reality, on
      this occasion, is that w h e n the away supporters w e r e let out there was a
      sudden         surge    of     fans      which   led  to quite severe cru s h i n g w i t h i n the
      terraces.           This, of course, wa s e x a c e r b a t e d by the fact that there                  were
      so m a n y p e ople in the terraces in the first place and the gangways were
      full.        People in the gangways t h e n got push e d by                 others        forcing     their
      way       up     the   terraces and there w a s quite a struggle to get t h r o u g h the
      n a r r o w gaps w h i c h e xist at the top         of   the      radial        div i d i n g   barriers.
      Perhaps          y ou w o u l d like to advise m e about the reasons for k e e p i n g fans
      b e h i n d for so long and w h e t h e r this does not lead                  to    difficulties.           A
      further          point    with     regard      to this is that w h i l s t fans w e r e t r ying to
      leave the groun d there w a s no atte m p t at all by the Police                              to  organise
      the       exit      and, w h i l e m a n y dozens of police w e r e simply standing around,
      fans w e r e get t i n g crus h e d w i t h no atte m p t at all b e i n g ma d e to              try     and
      control          the   situation.          I   find this p a r t i c u l a rl y w o r r y i n g and w h e n I
      a p p r o a ch e d a senior offi c e r outside the ground, no one seemed                         concerned
      about it at all.



3.    My     third   q u e s t i o n concerns the d e s i g n of the terraces. It seemed to me
      there w e r e far too m a n y peop l e st a n d i n g on the terraces for the one exit
      from     the grou n d w h i c h is available.              As yo u w i l l appreciate, the ground
      is d e signed in such a w a y that the exit is                       right   in   one     corner   and,
      effectively,        e v eryone         has    to come up the terraces to the top a nd wa l k
      down one ver y n a r r o w gangway.             As p e o p l e w e r e  attempting      to   do   this,
      mo r e   people     were       p u s h i n g their w a y up the terraces and also t r y i n g to
      get onto the gangway, a nd then to squeeze thro u g h                       the very      narrow   gaps
      on     the   gangway at the top of the radial fences.                        In m y m i n d this w h o l e
      design, at some            stage,        could   be    a     recipe     for   a ve r y     unfortunate
      incident.        I w o u l d like comments f r o m b o t h the L o c a l A u t h o r i t y a n d the
      Club as to w h e t h e r they regard the d e s i g n of this g r o u n d as b e i n g            in any
      way     suitable       for the large n u m b e r s of fans w h o may, from time to time,
      occupy it.

I a m w r i t i n g this letter n ot in a spirit of c on d e m n a t i o n   but     one       of    great
c o n c e r n that there w as crus h i n g at S a t u r d a y ’s game.  Fortunately, as far as I
a m aware, no one w as         b a d ly  injured,     but      the  numbers  of    p e ople       on   the
terraces,         the  desig n     of   the  g r ound    and     the Police arra n g e m e n t s ail did

t r a g e d y o c c u r r i n g in the future u n less some action is taken.

I lo o k forward to a reply from the vari o u s authorities concerned.

D e a r Director

                              Providing a Home for Sheffield Eagles

All       of    y ou w i l l surely be aware by n o w of the tremendous v i c t o ry Sheffield
E a g l e s g a ined over w o r l d c h a m pions W i d n e s at Bramall Lane this Sunday. Some
of y o u m a y have h a d the pr i v i l e g e of b e i n g there to w a t c h it.

Many        of     y o u w i l l also be i nvolved in vari o u s p a r t n er s h i p v e ntures w h i c h are
n o w e xisting in our city.              We are w r i t i n g to y o u in the h o p e y o u w i l l assist
in      de v e l o p i n g   one further p a r t n e r s h i p for the coming year; a p a r t n e r s h i p in
w h i c h the two football clubs in                Sheffield       come  togethier      to he l p    provide
S h e f f i e l d Eagles w i t h a venue for t h e i r r e m a ining home fixtures.

In      our v i e w      partnership         is    about   p e ople  and  o r g a n i s a t i o n s w i t h coirimon
o b j e c t i v e s comi n g t o gether to       achieve     them.     Surely       t here        is    a   common
objective           in   Sh e f field     to b u i l d a city of sporting excellence.                   Sheffield
E a g l e s have n o w p r o v e d that they are in the top league                within          their     sport,
but       because      of the problems at O w l e r t o n S t a di u m the p e o p l e of S h e f f i e l d who
w a n t to take pa rt in their success w i l l be                 denied  the       opportunity            to   see
them.             In p a r t i c u l a r the    many    school c hildren w h o h a v e p u r c ha s e d season
tickets, w i l l be p r e v e n t e d from m a k i n g use of them.

We do n ot believe that rugby league is a competitor to s o ccer                              in    Sheffield,
but     rather  it  p rovides        a n o t h e r o p p o r t u n i t y for the p e o p l e of S h e f f i e l d to
g a i n enjoyment by w a t c h i n g top quality sport.                   The reality is that m a n y             of
the     people  who   go     to E a g l e ’s games go to United or W e d n e s d a y m a t c h e s on a
Saturday.

We a p p r e c ia t e the concerns w h i c h bo t h soccer clubs m a y h a v e in n ot w i s h i n g to
damage          their      pitch    by   playing  e xt r a  games  on it.    The true situation,
h o w e v e r , is that if bo t h of the S h e f f i e l d teams could matiage      to     accommodate
during          the     ne x t seven months,      four     or  five extra  F i r s t D i v i s i o n Rugby
f ixtures, the p r o b l e m for Eagles w o u l d be solved and h o p e f u l l y mo r e pe r m an e n t
a r r a n g e m e n t s c an be m a d e for them ne x t year.
                                                  -   2   -




We      are    w r i t i n g this letter not simply on b ehalf of the C i t y Council, but we
b e l i e v e on b e ha l f of the s porting p u blic of Sheffield w h o w o u l d like            to   see
t h o s e w h o have a p a r t i c u l a r interest in one sport, coining to hel p their newer
a n d less p r i v i l e g e d c olleagues in anot h e r sport in w h a t o t h e r wi s e w o u l d be   a
v e r y d i f ficult an d trying season.

We hope that y o u w i l l all give c o n s i d e r a t i o n to this m a t t e r and w i l l be very
p l e a s e d indeed if both  the  Clubs        c ould       m a nage to w o r k    t o gether  on  a
tripartite        basis with  the  Eagles         to accommodate them d u ring the n e x t few
months.

SHEFFIELD EAGLES/RUGBY LEAGUE


H a v i n g g i v e n some c o n s i d e r a t i o n to the pr o b le m s faci n g the Ea gles c an w e
please        see if there is any w a y w e ca n w r i t e off the o u t s t a n d i n g loan as
a r e t u r n for the services they ha v e p e r f o r m e d w i t h i n the city                 re g a r d i n g
rugby       league c o a c h i n g and, perhaps, r e - e st a b l i s h a n e w one to h e l p th e m
c o v e r the pro b l e m s of the c h a n g i n g a c c o m m o d a t i o n at O w l e r t o n Stadium.

As I u n d e r s t a n d it these w i l l no t be suffi c i e n t to a c c o m m o d a t e        the       top
matches        with      Wigan        etc       but    that talks are b e i n g h e l d w i t h S h e f f i e l d
U n i t e d a n d S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y to a r r a n g e these m a t c h e s in their      more
s u itable stadia.

Nevertheless              it w i l l       still      be  necessary          to      do  s o m e t h i n g w i t h the

place         a nd    therefore, it seems to m e that the best s o l u t i o n w o u l d be to
give t h e m a loan but this time w i t h the insis t e n c e that it be repaid.

       Dear Director

                                       Providing a Home for Sheffield Eagles

       All       of    y o u w i l l surely be aware by n o w of the tremendous vic t o r y Sheffield
       E a g l e s g a i n e d over w o r l d ch a mpions W i d n e s at Bramall La n e this Sunday. Some
       of y o u m a y ha v e h a d the pr i v i l e g e of b e i n g there to w a t c h it.

       Many        of     y o u w i l l also be in vo l v e d in various p a r t n e r s h i p v e ntures w h i c h are
       n o w e x i s t i n g in our city.        We are w r i t i n g to y o u in the hope y o u w i l l assist
       in      d e v e lo p i n g   one further p a r t n e r s h i p for the c o m i n g year; a p a r t n e r s h i p in
       w h i c h the two football clubs in                Sheffield       come    t ogether      to   help      provide
       S h e f f i e l d Eagles w i t h a v e n ue for their r e m aining h o m e fixtures.

       In      our      view     p a rt n e r s h i p   is     about    people     and     organis a t i o n s w i t h common
       o b j e c t i v es c o m in g to gether to            achieve      them.        S urely    there         is     a  common
       objective           in    Sh e f fi e l d      to b u i l d a ci t y of spo r t in g excellence.                Sheffield
       E a g l e s have n o w p r o v ed that they are in the top league                         within         their     sport,
       but       beca u s e     of the problems at O w l e r t o n S t a d i um the people of S h e f f i e l d w h o
       w a n t to take part in their success w i l l be                       d e nied     the    o p p o r t u n it y   to  see
       them.            In    particular            the    many     school c h i l d r e n w h o have p u r c h a s e d season
       tickets, w i l l be p r ev e n t e d fr o m m a k i n g use of them.

       We do not b e l i e v e that rugby league is a c o m p e t i to r to soccer                      in    Sheffield,
       but     rather         it  provides         a n o t h er o p p o r t u n i t y for the p e ople of S h e f f i e l d to
       g a i n en j o y m e n t by w a t c h i n g top quality sport.                  The reality is that       many       of
       the     people         who  go      to E a g l e ’s games go to U n i t e d or W e d n e s d a y matc h e s on a
       Saturday.

       We appre c i a t e the concerns w h i c h bo t h soccer clubs m a y have in not w i s h i n g to
       damage          their       pitch   by   playing     extra  games  on it.      The true situation,
       however, is that if b o t h of the Sh e f f i e l d teams c ould m a n a g e       to     a c c ommodate
       during          the     n e xt  seven months,        four  or  five e x t r a First D i v i s i o n Rugby
       fixtures, the p r o b l e m for Eagl e s w o u l d be solved and h o p e f u l l y mor e permanent
       a r r a n g e m e n t s c an be m a d e for t h e m next year.




                                                                                                                                   R3474

We      are w r i t i n g this letter not simply on b e h a l f of the City Council, but we
b e l i e v e on b e h a l f of the sporting p u blic of S h e f f i e l d w h o w o u l d like    to   see
t hose w h o ha v e a p a r t i c u l a r interest in one sport, c o m i ng to h e l p their newer

v e r y d if ficult and t r ying season.

W e hope that y o u w i l l all give c o n s i d e r a t i o n to this m a t t e r and w i l l be very
p l e a s e d indeed if  both  the  Clubs        could        manage    to w o r k       t ogether     on  a
t r i p a r ti t e basis with  the  Eagles         to acco m m o d a t e t h e m d u r i n g the n e x t few

 Dear Vice President,


 I am sure you are aware of our problem regarding the closure of
 Owlerton Stadium.


 This     has      come      at    a     particularly            difficult           time      as     our      team
 strives         to     consolidate             a     position          in     Rugby        Leagues          First
 Division.            It is likely that some of our home fixtures will now
 be staged at venues outside the Sheffield area.


  I   trust      we    can     count       on       your    support          through       this      difficult
  period and          I can assure you that every effort will                                       be made        to
  provide       the     very      best      facilities            for     Vice       Presidents           at     the
  various venues.


  I will       contact        yo u       before      each     match       but     if     you     require         any
  further information please do not hesitate to contact me.




  Very best wishes,

D e a r Sir,

O n v i s i t i n g the N o t t i n g h a m Forest ground recently w i t h Sheffield Wednesday,      I
s t o o d on the a w a y - su p p o r t e r s end.

Having          h a d an opport u n i t y to read the G r e e n Code of Practice and the actions
d e m a n d e d by Lord Justice Taylor in his i n t e r i m report,        I  a m not  sure  the
a w a y - s u p p o r t e r s end complies w i t h those directions.

I     u n d e rs t a n d one  of  the  requirements    which  n o w exists is that a p e n or
s e p a r a t e d area must have some means by w h i c h the numbers of      people  entering
the       individual       pens  can be counted.  This applies w h e t h e r the gates on the
pe n s are open or not.

A t the away- s u p p o rt e r s * end at N o t t i n g h a m Forest there are several pens,   and
w h i l e the gates w e r e open for the S h ef field W e d n e s d a y match, I saw no attempt
b y anyone to count people going into the pens or to m o n i t o r the s i t u a t i o n        in
any       d e t a i l e d way.   Indeed,  I     do n ot believe simply h a v i n g someone there
t r y i n g to do a v i su a l a ssessment complies w i t h         the  letter,  or  i n deed the
spirit, of w h a t Lor d Justice Taylor requested.

I w o u l d be grateful for y o u r o b s e r vations on this m a t t e r as I do think it is
of p a r t i c u l a r      conc e r n    if  the     details         of   the  interim report into the
H i l l s b o r o u g h D i s a s t e r are not b e i n g f o l l o w e d precisely.

Y o u r s faithfully,

      Dear Councillor Betts,

      MANCHESTER UNITED V SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY
      AWAY SUPPORTERS ACCOMMODATION - 14 OCTOBER 1989

      T hank you for your letter, dated 17 October.

      The matters which you               have raised with the Police, Club and Council are
      all dealt with in this             reply, using the machinery of the advisory group
      set up by the Council              and of which I a m Chairman.    Both your letter
      and m y reply will be              considered further by the advisory group at it's
      next meeting.

      I will refer to the matters in the order in which you raised them in
      your letter.

      C a p a c itie s

      The capacity of the terraces has been re-assessed for the current season
      in line with the recommendation in the Interim Report by Lord Justic Taylor.
      The Warwick Road or 'Scoreboard' Terrace is reserved for a w a y supporters.
      It is divided into eight separate pens.   These have been numbered 6 to 13
      inclusive for the purpose of assessing capactiies.  They are used in various
      permutations dependent on the number of visiting team supporters which are
      to attend.   This number is k nown beforehand as admission to visiting
      supporters is by ticket only.

      For the Sheffield Wednesday match, pens 6 to 11 were used.   These pens
      permit a total capacity of 2,509.  The number of tickets sold for these
      pens was 2,093 and the number admitted through the turnstiles was 2,075.
      From these figures, you will see that the area was by no means overcrowded
      being some 17% below the permitted capacity.

G angw ays

W hen terraces are filling, spectators are stewarded into position and
g a n g w a y s are kept clear.

However, when the match has started, it is not possible to prevent
spectators encroaching into these areas, particularly the radial gangways.

The advisory group has discussed this matter.  Barriers have been considered
but it was agreed that these would create more problems than they solve.

A study of the police video taken at the match clearly shows that there
was no over-crowding of the area occupied by Sheffield Wednesday supporters.
Indeed, it shows them able to turn around and face Manchester United,
supporters seated in the stand behind them.    In addition, the video shows
that spectators were able to circulate along the rear gangway.    Furthermore,
there is clear evidence that, in each pen, the areas nearest to the pitch
were largely empty.

A dm ission of V is itin g   S p ectators

As mentioned earlier, no admission was permitted to the area reserved for
visiting spectators, except by a ticket from the visiting teams allocation.

This number is always known beforehand.              No cash was taken at the turnstiles
feeding this area.

C le a r in g T erraces O ccupied By V is itin g Sp ectators

This did not commence until approximately twenty-five minutes after the
match ended.     This is exceptional, but the decision was taken because the
road system around the stadium was congested with traffic.     Whilst Sheffield
Wednesday supporters could have been escorted earlier to some twenty coaches
in which m a n y had travelled, they would have been stranded in heavy
traffic. The possible consequences of this, while m a n y home team supporters
were in this area, were considered too great a risk to the safety and well­
being of the visiting fans.

In the event, it was judged safer to bring their coaches to the stadium and
then escort the coaches to their route, which by this time, was much clearer.

Messages were conveyed through the loudspeakers during the latter part of
the match to inform visiting spectators that they would be held back until
home spectators had dispersed.   A further announcement was made during
the period the visitors were held back.

The Police officers observed as "standing around" were in fact,          used to
escort groups of Sheffield Wednesday supporters to their cars, a          duty of
which is regarded as essential.    It has not been possible, from        the information
supplied, to identify the police officer w h o m you approached on       this subject.

E g ress from the T erraces

As previously observed, the number on the terraces was below capacity.
It appears that there is a misunderstanding about the number of exits
from this area of the terraces.   There is, in fact, an exit of equal size
on the opposite side of the terrace to that which was used.    In some
cases, and certainly in an emergency, both exits would be used.
However, for normal egress with the number of spectators involved, it
is regarded as acceptable to use only one exit.

C onclusion

Whilst being in no w a y complacent, I think it fair to point out that
Old Trafford is a stadium regularly accommodating in excess of forty
thousand   spectators.   This has been the case for m a n y years and
Manchester United Football Club along with Greater Manchester Police are
most experienced in handling large crowds.    The numbers accommodated
on 14 October were not unusual, however, when standing on a terrace
which is near capacity, a certain amount of bodily contact is inevitable
during the match.

A Trafford Councillor who is also a member of the advisory group attended
the match to study the police operation and endorses the contents of this
letter.

Following the Interim Report by Lord Justice Taylor, a review of both
the stadium and crowd management procedures is being undertaken in
order to re-issue the Safety Certificate. During this process, any changes
which could be regarded as an improvement will be considered by the
advisory group.   We, therefore, welcome your considered observations and
appreciate the spirit in which they have been made.

Yours sincerely,

       D ear Gary

       I have finally got a reply from Sheffield United - more than a month a fte r I sent my
       le tte r to them.

       As you will see from the copy I am sending you it is not terribly hopeful and I am very-
       sorry about this as a t one tim e I did think, from the information I have, th at they
       would be willing to be more flexible. At least they are offering the possibility o f
       more games a t the end of the season.

       I have also been to see Bert McGee a t Sheffield Wednesday and have basically got the
       same answer from him. Although really there was no damage at all to the pitch a fte r
       the' Wigan game. Again, he is saying th at he does not want to risk the pitch during
       the winter months but towards the end of the season might be willing to receive your
       request for extra games.

       I wonder, therefore, whether there is any possibility of any reprogramming of fixtures
       towards the end of the season when the football clubs might be more amenable. I
       presume th at is something th at you would be wanting to consider yourself.

       Once again I am sorry I have not had any more success but i f there is anything else I
       can do to help please do let me know.

       Yours sincerely

 Dear CLive,


 At our last meeting it was hinted that you might have some imput
 on the number of policemen at our matches.      I have enclosed a
 couple of copy invoices which underline the extent of our problem.


 Look forward to hearing from you with news of any developments.


 Best wishes,

   Re: S h e ffield W e d n e s d a y Football Cl u b -
   R e v i s e d O p e r a t i o n a l Plans____________


  1 refer to yo u r various conversations w i t h Mrs. Woodhead concerning this matter,
  w en you e x p l a i n e d the a r r an gements you had entered into wit h Sheffield
  W e d n e s d a y F o o t b a l l Cl u b to make use of the L e p p i n g s La n e turnstiles for access
  by home suppor t e r s using the N orth Stand.- Y ou confirmed that the proposal was
  to be i m p le m e n t e d only in respect.of "non contentious matches" where you
  e x p e c t e d smalx numbers of v i siting fans.          O ther than that, the'usual a r ra n g e m e n t
  w h e r e b y no use was made of L e p p i n g s L a n e turnstiles and home fans all coined
  access to the ground by turnstiles se r v i c i n g the Kop w o u l d prevail.

  A s you are aware, members of the City Counc i l are e x t r emely concerned that the
  m a t t e r was not referred to them at an early stage, despite the fact that the
  l e t t e r to the Cl u b setting out the p r o p o s a l s is dated the 11th October.
  F ur t n e r m o r e. that letter clearly en v i sa g e s that the m a t t e r will require
  d i s c u s s i o n w i t h the L o c a l Authority.


  M e m b e r s or the C o u n c i l are anxious to ensure that this does not occur in the
  future, and a c c o r d i n g l y have asked me to write to you seeking yo u r assurance
  that in the future, issues such as this will be referred to them for
  consideration.


  I confirm, that in accordance wi t h y o u r conv e r s a t i o n with Mrs. Woodhead, I am
  m a k i n g a r r a n g e m e n ts for you and yo u r s e nior officers to meet with members of the
  g e n e r a l P u r p o s e P anel to discuss the m a t t e r generally, and the distinction
  between opera t i o n a l issues and issues of general safety.

  I will contact you further to make                           the n e c e s s a r y arrangements.

   Police Headquarters,

   Sheffield,
   S3 8LY.

   Dear Sir,

   Safety of Sports Grounds - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club —
   Proposed use of the North West Terrace for the admission of spectators

   I refer to Chief Inspector Beal's telephone conversation with my Chief
   Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes on Wednesday 8th November, 1989 and to the
   discussion which took place at the Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group
   Meeting on Thursday 9th November.

   As I understand it, the Police intend at the Sheffield United v Sheffield
   Wednesday football match on 21st November to permit the North West Terrace
   to be used for the admission of spectators in the oridinary course of events
   rather than in the emergency situation as dealt with in additional Condition
   10 of the Sheffield Wednesday Safety Certificate. It was explained at the
   Advisory Group, that in view of the anticipated numbers of away supporters
   likely to wish to gain admission to the Sports Ground, it would be
   appropriate for the North West Terrace to be brought into use as they could
   not be accommodated fully in the West Stand. If the North West Terrace
   facility were not to be available then it would be likely that the Sheffield
   United fans might enter the Kop with the Sheffield Wednesday fans and thus
   give rise to a potential problem.

   At the Advisory Group meeting no one dissented from this proposal and
   bearing this factor in mind and also that the question of policing at sports
   grounds will be discussed in principle with members of the General Purposes
   Panel on 20th November, I can confirm that the local authority do not, at
   this stage, propose to interfere with the proposed arrangements for the
   football match on 21st November. The arrangements for that match are
   therefore regarded as an operational matter between the Police and the Club
   at this stage.

   I look forward to a wider discussion of these policing issues on 20th
   November.

   Yours faithfully,

P o licing Issues at Sports Grounds in Sheffield - Briefing Note

P u r p o s e of the Note

T h i s note is prepared in order to assist members and Officers attending
the meeting w i t h the Police, w h i c h will take place on M o nday 20th
November, 1989.     There are three points to be m a d e in this note firstly,
that relating to the initial Police a t titude to the Council with regard to
their plans at Sheffield Wednesday; secondly the proposed changes in
policing arrangements which took effect on 28th October, 1989 and thirdly,
further changes in the policing a r r a n gements at Sheffield W e d n e s d a y on
21st November.

T h e initial Police attitude

A t a m eeting of the General Purposes Panel on 17th August, Chief Inspector
Beal of the South Yorkshire Police gave a very thorough p r e s e n t a t i o n to
the Panel about the proposed policing arrangements at Sheffield W e d n e s d a y
and in particular the use of the N o r t h Stand at the Hillsborough Football
Ground.    I believe the members of the Panel felt that this i n f ormation was
most helpful and it indicated a positive attitude on behalf of the Police.

Essen t i a l l y the Police proposal in r e l a t i on to the North Stand at
Sheffield W e dn e s d a y was, simply to use it for home supporters via the
Penistone Road turnstile and not as has been traditionally the case, to
allow the Sheffield W e d n esday supporters to enter both via the Penistone
Road turnstiles and the Leppings Lane turnstiles.

T h e Leppings Lane turnstiles would be us e d in part for the admission of
away spectators to the West Stand and by m e a n s of the p r oposed Police
arrangements complete segregation w o u l d be m a i n t a i n e d between away
supporters and home supporters.

Proposed Rev i s i o n in Policing arra n ge m e n t s w i t h effect from 28th October

At a meeting of the A d visory Group on the 19th October, the Police
me n t i o n e d that they intended to change the operational arrangements in
respect of games taking place at S h e f f ie l d Wednesday.  Th e y said that the
revised arrangements would take effect on 28th October and that, they
would w rite to the Council concerning this issue.        It should be noted,
that there was no prior notice to the Council that this issue w o u l d be
raised at the A d v i s o r y Group on 19th October.

Following the meeting, both m y Assistant Solicitor, Mrs.         Woo d he a d and
Mr. Bownes (The Chief Licensing Officer) m a d e telephone calls to various
Police Officers in attempts to o b tain the letter w h i c h had been me n t i on e d
on the 19th October.  Eventually, a co p y of a letter detailing the
proposals was sent by Sheffield W e d n e s d a y to the Council by fax o n 27th
October.  On 31st October, a letter wa s received from the Police (which
was dated 25th October) enclosing a co p y of the letter sent to the Club on
11th October about the proposed revised policing arrangements.

In the Star of Tue s d a y October 24th, 1989 there was a report indicating
that the Leppings Lane turnstiles w o u l d be open a g ai n and detailing the
r evised policing arrangements.

Mrs. Woodhead consulted wi t h the Chair of the Gene r a l Purposes Panel and
in vi e w of the fact, that there could be a greater danger to spectators in
insisting upon the original arrangement being re verted to, it was decided
that in the interests of safety, it w as proper for the revised
arrangements to stand.  This i n f ormation was transmitted to the Police by
a letter dated 2nd November,          1989 a copy of w h i c h is attached.

It should be pointed out, that the letter is slightly inaccurate in that
it says that, the usual     arrangement is that no use is ma d e of the Leppings
La n e turnstiles; in fact, the Leppings   Lane turnstiles would        n o rm a l l y have
been used to admit away supporters.

The Police p r oposal was to permit the old arrangement wher e b y home fans
could use the N o r t h Stand, both by means of the Leppings La n e turnstiles
and the Penistone Road turnstiles.

The 21st N o v em b e r Proposals

At 2.45 p.m. on We d n e s d ay 8 th November, 1989 Chief Inspector Beal rang and
spoke to Mr. Bownes and         indicated that he w ould like another    item to
appear on the Safe t y of       Sports Grounds A dvisory Group Agenda    for 9th
November.

Mr. Beal indicated that there was to be a local Derby m a t c h between
Sheffield W e d n e s d a y and U n ited at H i l l s borough on 21st November, and the
Police would like to use the N or t h West Terrace as part of the oridinary
spectator accommodation.            The idea of the proposal is that it w o u l d enable
an appropriate number of spectators to be accommodated and that it w ould
be unlikely that any w ou l d r e m a i n outside the ground and attempt to ga i n
access to it by other methods.            It was also proposed by the Police that at
the Liverpool m a t c h (29th November) the same arrangement w o u l d apply.

The amended a dditional C o n d i t i o n 10 of the General Safety Certificate
issued to S h e f field W e d n e s d a y (which was dated 19th August, 1989)
indicates that the South Y o r k s h i r e Police Officer in command of the ground
m a y authorise the use of the N o r t h West Terrace if he "... is of the
opinion that use should be m a d e of that area in emergency to ensure the
reasonable safety of spectators at the sports ground ...".

The matter was discussed brie f l y on 9th November, and no m e m b e r s of the
Ad visory Group di s sented from the P o lice proposal. A letter w as therefore
sent to the Police a copy of w h i c h is attached.

Summary and Concl u s i o n

The basic p r o b l e m h i g h l i g h t e d by these two incidents appears to be one of
communication.        Whilst the Council as Safety of Sports Grounds A u t hority
w o u l d not want to get involved in the detailed policing arra n g e m e n t s for
football matches, it w o u l d be a ssisted in its functions if, it could
■simply be m a d e aware of them and g iven appropriate notice if changes we r e
planned.      It is also sometimes not appreciated that changes in policing
can have effects on other issues for example the means of escape in the
case of fire u p o n w h i c h the Fi r e Service w ould no doubt w i s h to comment
and it is therefore important that the Council have sufficient information
to enable all aspects to be considered.

One other m a t t e r that perhaps needs cla r i f i c a t i o n is the p e r c e p t i o n of
what is an " e m ergency" in police operational terms.              The police v i e w was
that about 10 days before a match, tickets w o u l d need to be sold and
therefore the qu e s t i o n of use of the North West Terrace w o u l d ne e d to be
decided shortly after that date; this is not the same as the normal
perception of an emergency as being something happening at v e r y short
notice.

       PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE




       AMBULANCE COVER AY SPORTING EVENTS




       In response to the news release issued on the 6th December 1989 by the
       Leader of the Sheffield Council, Mr* Clive Betts, the South Yorkshire
       Metropolitan Ambulance Service can confirm the f o llo w in g i-


       The ambulance provision provided to the football stadiums within this area
       on Saturday 9th December 1989, will be provided by fully qualified
       ambulance personnel from the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service
       and not by the Police, Military or any other organisation.


       This fact was supplied and confirmed by the South Yorkshire Metropolitan
       Ambulance Service to the Sheffield City Council on Monday 4th December
        1989.


       Don Page, the Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer of the South Yorkshire
       Metropolitan Ambulance Service wishes to emphasise that the escalation
        identified by the Trade Unions, which took effect from 0600 hours on
       Monday 4th December 1989 contained the threat to withdraw professional
       ambulance provision from football arenas.          It is only by management's
       action that such cover will be provided on S a tu r d a y .


       ENDS.

            Dear Councillor Chase,

            I reply to your letter of* 23rd November in relation to seeking our
            views on the use of pitch perimeter and radial segregation fencing
            in football stadia.

            The situation at Sheffield Wednesday Club is that the pitch perimeter
            fencing and the gates remain.    The gates are open during specified
            activities in accordance with Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations
            and fully scawarded.

            The situation at Sheffield United Football Club is that the perimeter
            gates have been removed and the perimeter fencing remains. Additionally
            radial fencing on" the Kop has been removed, since in the particular
            circumstances it was felt that it impeded egress fro® the terracing.

            It appears that there are arguments both in favour of such fencing
            and also against it.    In the circumstances we feel that decisions
            on this matter should be reserved until Lord Justice Taylor publishes
            his final report in the New Year and this is our position at the
            present time.

            I hope this letter has been of      some   assistance   to you and your
            colleagues.

            Yours faithfully,

PROVISION OF AMBULANCE SERVICES AT FOOTBALL MATCHES

The i n t e r i m report of Lo r d Justice Tayl o r i n d icated a n u m b e r of steps             which
h a d to be taken at football matc h e s held at d e s i g n a t e d sports grounds.

One       of these steps wa s to ensure that an "authorised" ambulance                        w as on duty
at all such events.              In the light of the a m b ulance dispute and the                 possible
s u b s t i t u t i o n for the regular ambulance service of a m a k e s h i f t service staffed

c o m p l y w i t h Lo r d Justice T a y l o r ’s requirements?

As y ou w i l l appreciate, as a L i c e n s i n g A u t h o r i t y for sports grounds, the City
C o u n c i l is v e r y anxious i n deed to m a k e        sure    it  fully      complies   with   Lo r d

that y ou advise us imme d i a t e l y w h e t h e r the t e m p orary a r r a n gements      which   are

On 1st D e c e m b e r , 1989 at approximately 4.00 p.m. Mr. Ward, Principal
Solicitor, informed ine that it wa s likely that the Ambulance Dispute would
deteriorate on Monda y and that the q u e s t i o n of the provision of ambulances
at Sports Grounds needs to be satisfied so that appropriate action could be
taken. .

On 4th December, 1989 at 3.00 p.m. I telephoned Mr. Morley, South Yorkshire
M e t r o p o l i t a n A m b u l a n c e Service, and pointed out that recent press reports
had indicated that ambula n ce s w o u l d not be provided at Sports Grounds in the
near future.              Mr. Morley said the situation at the moment was very fluid but
he w o u l d contact Mr. Page (the Chief M e t r o p o l i t a n Ambulance Officer) and
obtain a positive assurance that either an ambulance would be provided for
the next football m a t c h on Saturday, 9th December, 1989 at the Sheffield
Wednesday Sports G r ound or that the service could not provide an ambulance
for that game.

A t 4.20 p.m. on the same day, Mr. Morley telephoned Mr. Derricott and said
that an a m b u l a n c e w o u l d be provided w i t h professional ambulance personnel at
the f o r thcoming football match.           I thanked Mr. Morley for his time and
effort in dealing wi t h this situation.

At 4 . 2 4 p.m. I  informed Mr. Ward of my                                    conversation with -Mr. Morley a nd said
that the issue     could be now raised at                                     Che proposed Panel m e e t i n g next week.
He agreed wi t h this.

A t 4.35 p.m. I          informed Mrs. Woo d h e a d of my conversation with Mr. Morl e y ,
South Y o r k s h i r e M e t r o p o l i t a n A m b ul a n c e Service.

1.                   CHAIRMANS INTRODUCTION




1989 has been a remarkable year    for Rugby League in Sheffield.
The excitement   over the well     merited success of Sheffield
Eagles RLFC has infused not only    a pride in the achievements of
the professional club, but has     created a new interest in the
game in the city.

A parallel success story has been unfolding over the last three
years with SADARDLA's development     of    the amateur game in
Sheffield and District.

This report outlines that progress on a number of levels.
Firstly the spectacular increase in the number of primary and
secondary schools playing Rugby League and the inter-schools
competition    that     have  been   established.   Secondly  the
opportunities    for   junior  players   to  obtain  coaching and
competitive r u g b y from the age of 8 to 18, and thirdly the
steady progress in open age rugby including Women's Rugby
League and the formation of the South West Yorkshire Referees
Society.

The SADARLDA committee is extremely appreciative of the work of
Tim Butcher in his second year as our Rugby League Development
Officer and of those members of the coaching team, some of whom
like Daryl Powell and Mark Aston were once little known members
of the Eagles squad but are now famous throughout the Rugby
League world.   Our thanks also to our colleagues from overseas
who have added their Australasian skills to the rugby coaching
in South Yorkshire.

I would like to thank the Rugby League Foundation and the
Sports Council who have been our funding partners for the last
two years, and to our new SADARLDA patrons from the Sheffield
business commu nity who have enabled us to field extra coaching
teams.   That Amateur Rugby League is in such an encouraging
position is due to the active support of many individuals and
institutions and especially the Sheffield City Council who have
given  invaluable   infra-structure  support. In  1990  we  are
confident that SADARLDA's work will continue to develop and
achieve new standards for our game in an area where until
recently it was unknown.


J C CORNWELL
CHAIRMAN
2.    SCHOOLS COACHING

2.1   The second year of operation has seen an expansion in the
      Schools coaching Programme, SADARLDA is grateful for the
      co-operation of Sheffield MDC and Barnsley and Rotherham
      MBC's and to the headmasters and teachers of all the
      schools involved for their enthusiasm and assistance.

2.2   The increase in curriculum time coaching has been made
      possible through the generous support of the Patrons of
      SADARLDA namely, Sheffield Insulations, South Yorkshire
      Transport, Sheffield Eagles R L F C , Sheffield Co-operative
      Society Ltd, Bickerton Garage Ltd, Sugg Sport, Poppleton
      and Appleby and Hallam Towers Post House Hotel.

2.3   The in-school coaching has been provided by the Sports
      Development Officer, full-time coaches provided by
      Sheffield Eagles RLFC and by volunteer coaches.    All the
      coaching is of a high standard and involves a four to six
      week course covering the basic skills of Rugby League.

2.4   In conjunction with the National Coaching Scheme coaching
      courses have been provided for primary and secondary
      teachers and many now teach Rugby League to their own
      pupils.

2.5   Rugby League has been included on the curriculum in 15
      secondary schools in Sheffield which represents exactly
      half of the total number in the city.   Those schools
      visited were :- All Saints RC, Chaucer, City, Ecclesfield,
      High Green, High Storrs, Hinde House, Myrtle Springs,
      Newfield, Norfolk, Park House, Stocksbridge, Tapton,
      Yewlands and Silverdale.

2.6   In Rotherham, three secondary schools namely Oakwood,
      Clifton and Wingfield received in-school coaching.
      In Barnsley, four secondary schools, St Helens, Kingston,
      Edward Shearien and Priory were visited.

2.7   The summer term was spent in primary schools throughout
      Rotherham, Sheffield and Barnsley and the enjoyment and
      enthusiasm of teachers and pupils was obvious.
      In Sheffield, 26 schools were involved, Birley Spa,
      Hartley Brook, Halfway, Beck, Hatfield, Lydgate,
      Crookesmoor, Greenhill, Outibridge, Arbourthorne, Birley
      Middle, Athelstan, St John's Deepcar, Mansel, Shiregreen
      Monteney, Coit, Burngreave, Shirebrook, Grenoside, Angram
      Bank, Greengate Lane, High Green Junior, Windmill Hill,
      Warren and Lound.
      In Rotherham, 5 schools - Rawmarsh Rosehill, Rawmarsh
      Sandhill, Thrybergh, Dalton Foljambe, Ravensfield.
      In Barnsley, 9 schools - Hoyalnd Common, Elsecar, Holyrood
      Wombwell Oakfield, Tankersley, Dodworth, Keresforth Road
      Mapplewell, St Josephs RC.

2.8   The total number of schools visited in the past twelve
      months was sixty-two and an estimated four and a half
      thousand youngsters have had an introduction to Rugby
      League.
SCHOOLS COM P E T I T I O N
Until c o mmunit y based clubs emerge, inter-school
competition has provided youngsters with their first
real experience of competitive Rugby League.

In the first term of the academic year Schoools Leagues
operated at Under 15 and Under 14 year groups.
The Under 15s League attracted an entry of 10 teams and
was w o n by Kirk Balk Hoyland, who beat Oakwood 24-8 in the
Play-off Final.
The Under 14s attracted 8 entries, won by Oakwood 20-12
from runners-up Myrtle Springs.


The Spring Cups attracted fewer entries because of the
early Easter and both cups were won by Oakwood, beating
City at Under 14 level and High Green at Under 15.

At the beginning of the 1989/90 academic year leagues were
operating at Under 16, 15 and 14 Level and the standard of
play has improved considerably.

In September 1989 in conjunction with the Rugby League
National Coaching Scheme, a Teachers Coaching Course
concentrating on Tactics and Refereeing was h e l d at Tapton
School, attended by 12 teachers.   Many are n o w
refereeing their own matches and all are now responsible
for preparing their own teams.

A significant advance in the past year has b e e n the growth
in popularity of the Mini-League Rallies for younger
children.
These took place at U12 and Ull level throughout the year
at Owlerton (three), Rawmarsh, Hoyland, Thrybergh, Birley
Spa, High Green and Mansel, and involved 17 schools, most
entering more than one team.
These rallies were competitive but no winners a nd losers
were decided and each boy and girl received the same prize
at the end of the day.

Barnsley Schools Association has expended over the past
year and in addition to entering and U16 team in the
English Schools Rugby League now enters U13 a nd Ull sides.

Rotherham Schools Association is now firmly established
in its first year as a full member of the English Schools
Rugby League and organises an U16 side.

Sheffield Schools Association is affiliated to E.S.R.L.
and organises U16, 13 and 11 teams in the national
competition.
4     JUNI O R D E V ELOPMENT
4.1   As the popularity of Rugby League increases mor e and more
      youngsters have an ambition to play the sport regularly,
      and SADARLDA has aided and stimulated the provision of
      playing opportunities.

4.2   The Daryl Powell Christmas Clinic staffed by Daryl, Mark
      Aston and Andy Young, run over two days at Owlerton,
      attracted 24 youngsters aged 8-15 years.

4.3   In the Easter School holidays, SADARLDA was invited to
      p r o vi de an input into the Sheffield Wednesday Sportacular
      which involved over 200 youngsters sampling nine sports.

4.4   SADARLDA organised an extensive Summer Programme in
      conjunction with Sheffieled MDC Recreation Department.
      Fun/Taster sessions took place at :- Colley, Earl Marshal
      Rowlinson, Westfield, Hurlfield, Concord and Stocksbridge
      Sports Centres, at   Hillsborough, Norfolk, Hig h Hazels,
      Millhouses, Longley Parks and at Aston, Verdon St.
      Community Centre and Goldthorpe.

4.5   SADARLDA organised UlOs and U12s Advanced Training Centres
      during the summmer attracting over twenty youngsters
      weekly.

4.6   The Monday night coaching sessions at Owlerton Stadium and
      Colley Sports Centre continued to attract over fifty
      youngsters weekly, and has now evolved with the formation
      of the Junior Eagles ARLC, which is now self governing,
      providing Rugby League for U17s, U15s and U 9s.

4.7   Rotherham Rangers have entered an Under 17s team in the
      Yorkshire Youth League and have been awarded a travel
      grant of £200 for season 1989/90.

4.8   Dearne Valley and Dodworth were assisted in forming
      Junior sections with a view to playing friendlies in
      Season 1989/90.

4.9   The South-West Yorkshire District Development Association
      was formed with SADARLDA involvement and took responsib­
      ility for the organisation of an Under 19s team in the
      British Coal League.

4.10 A South-West Yorkshire Under 17s team was entered in the
     BARLA Inter League Competition.

4.11 Mini-League sections were formed in preparation for 1989/
     90 at Dodworth, Hoyland, Dearne Valley and Junior
     Eagles.

4.12 A Level 1 Coaching Course was held in July at Hoyland
     Sports Centre, with 21 coaches from around South York­
     shire qualifying.



                                                                      J
5.     AMATEUR CLUBS

5.1    The development of Open-age amateur Rugby League can only
       be viewed in the long term.   The biggest advances of the
       last year have been on the administrative front.

5.2    South-West Yorkshire Amateur Rugby League was formed in
       June 1989 to act as the governing body for amateur Rugby
       League in Rotherham, Barnsley and Sheffield.

5.3    Early in the season 1989/90 South West Yorkshire Open Age
       caused a massive upset in the BARLA Inter-League compet­
       ition b y beating last years winners Heavy Wollen 15-14.
       At the next stage they lost to Wakefield 24-8 but this
       cannot take anything away from a marvellous performance.

5.4    The Pro-Am Challenge in August ended in a 50-2 victory
       for Sheffield Eagles.

5.5    The Sheffield Co-op Spring Cup attracted 10 entries and
       was won in a thrilling final at Stocksbridge RUFC by
       Goldthorpe 'A' who defeated Dodworth 14-13.

5.6    On an individual club basis, some stability has been
       achieved although High Green Rose folded whilst Royal
       Mail Scorpions (Sheffield) have begun playing fixtures.

5.7    This summers Whitbread Touch Rugby League took place at
       High Green and the finals at Bramall Lane produced
       victories for Freedom House (Losers Shield) and Welling­
       ton (Cup).

5.8    The South-West Yorkshire Referees Society was formed in
       July 1989 and has six members with a view to doubling
       within the next year.

5.9    South-West Yorkshire ARL have appointed Mr Jerry Delahunt
       as consultant physiotherapist for all the amateur Rugby
       League players in its area.

5.10   A Women's Rugby League team was formed during the summer
       and is presently playing Touch & Pass friendlies with a
       view to joining the Ladies Amateur Rugby League.

5.11   Discussions with the Afro-Caribbean Sports Development
       Officer have explored ways of developing Rugby League
       within the community.
6     PRESS

6.1   Once again in the second year SADARLDA has maintained an
      excellent relationship with both the local and national
      media.

6.2   Regular press releasing of local newspapers in Barnsley,
      Rotherham and Sheffield has produced steady coverage of
      amateur Rugby League.

6.3   Radio Hallam and Radio Sheffield continue to give wide
      spread exposure of local competitions, women's rugby
      league and development in general.

6.4   The Rugby Leaguer and Open Rugby have kept the wider
      Rugby League public informed of developments.
7      PROMOTIONS AND SPONSORSHIP

7.1    Co-operation with the Sheffield Eagles RLFC meant that
       every home match provided a platform for promoting the
       development of the game.

7.2    Curtain raisers have included, three Mini-League Rallies
       a Ladies Amateur Rugby League match, T ouch & Pass finals,
       Sheffield & District Schools finals and Junior Eagles
       matches.

7.3    In April 1989, an English Schools B International versus
       French Scolaires attracted a crowd of 200 on a Wednesday
       afternoon at Owlerton Stadium.   Radio Hallam filed live
       reports.

7.4    The 2nd Pro-Am Challenge took place on 14 August at
       Cudworth but the disappointing crowd of 150 could be
       explained by the Friday evening kick-off.   The match was
       sponsored by Lancasters of Barnsley.

7.5    The Whitbread Touch Rugby League,  sponsored by
       Whitbread Yorkshire was once again enjoyable and gave
       many local sports people a chance to sample Rugby League
       in a non-contact form.   The Finals day at Bramall Lane
       was a fine occasion.

7.6    Sheffield Co-operative Society Ltd once again sponsored
       Spring Cup to the tune of £160 and the final at Stocks-
       bridge was the first ever Rugby League match to take
       place in the town.

7.7    A Schools News-sheet was produced promoting all aspects
       of Rugby League in the area and was distributed to over
       3000 youngsters city-wide.

7.8    SADARLDA made an input into School Fayres at St Johns
       Deepcar and Burngreave Middle.

7.9    SADARLDA was donated a free place at the Bobby Charlton
       Sports School and awarded this to a local junior player.

7.10   Eagle Star sponsored the Junior Eagles for a new kit,
       cost £380.

7.11   The expansion of the schools coaching programme has been
       made possible by the successful launch o f the Patrons
       scheme which raised £7500 in 1989.

THE FUTURE
SADARLDA enters its third year of existence with an
excellent record of achievement secure in the knowledge
that a full-time development officer will be funded
for another 12 months, and for that it must thank the
Rugby League Foundation and the Sports Council.

The development of amateur Rugby League in Sheffield,
Rotherham and Barnsley requires a long-term committment
and ways and means of its future funding are currently
being explored.

Consolidation of the position in local schools by
establishing Rugby League as a curriculum sport must be a
priority.   Certainly SADARLDA has ensured that Rugby
League has a very high reputation in local schools.

With the formation of South-West Yorkshire District
Development Association the district now has a forum for
a co-ordinated development of Rugby League with every
interested section of the game represented.

With the promotion of Sheffield Eagles into Division One,
awareness of the sport of Rugby League has increased
generally.

Certainly amongst teachers who have worked with SADARLDA
there is now a greater understanding of the sport and the
benefits to be derived for their pupils.

With the continuing support of the Sports Council,
Rugby League Foundation, Sheffield MDC and the local
business community, the sport of Rugby League in
Sheffield and District can only get stronger and it is
fascinating to ponder on what the situation will be when
today's crop of Under 9 Rugby League players are entering
adulthood.

The following is a broad brush description of the general themes that emerge from these
results * how they hang together into a consensus outlook on the way forward for football.
W ithout apology, this report is a subjective account of the views of football supporters.
 It is not intended to be impartial. It does not take into account the views of the
dubs' management, the police, the players or the stewards. Such an overall view w ould
only be possible if similar surveys were conducted w ith these groups. In such an eventuality
an overall picture could be painted taking into account the subjective views o f all parties.
The absence of such data does not, however, invalidate this search. The view point of the
customer matters in its ow n right and deserves to be listened to without qualification.


1.    Responsibility

      There is undoubtedly a high level of preparedness amongst
      supporters to take responsibility for sorting out the problems of football.
      Football supporters are more than just customers. They
      follow the game w ith a passion often incomprehensible
      to those on the outside. Football is an important part of many people's
      lives w ith deep roots in English culture. Consequently there is
      no lack of commitment to the game; no shortage of volunteers.

      Specifically supporters have demonstrated in this survey:

            a preparedness to shoulder some of the responsibility
            for the behaviour of others, w hich demonstrates a high level of
            positive collective identification w ith their fellow supporters;

            a preparedness to give up their ow n time, energy and
            intelligence to working with each other to finding solutions;

            a commitment to basic moral principals of fairness and
            accountability.

      In other words there is a recognition that while supporters have their
      problems of bad behaviour when they get together, these could be successfully
      tackled, largely by or w ith the participation and guidance of democratically
      accountable supporters in the game. The same basic principles of fairness
      that lie behind the rules of conduct o f those on the pitch, should be used to
      steward the conduct of those off it.


2.    Respect

      Supporters exp ea to be treated better. Throughout the country there is a
      growing realisation that the customer has a right to better service and treatm ent.
      Their collective characteristics are there to be understood and catered for by
      the body providing the service.

      Football supporters do pay to get in. They provide three times the am ount of
      finance into the game than all the sponsorship money put together. Not only
      that but they are participative customers w ho give of themselves {and w ould do
      more if they w ere only asked) to improve the product in the interests and
      enjoyment of everyone.
     They pay for, and expect to be treated w ith more respect.

     Specifically they want:

     a)      a d iffe re n t relationship w ith the police. O ut of all the various
             suggestions for coping w ith the problems of ground control, this was
             the one which highlighted the gulf in respect betw een the customer
             and those currently charged w ith their steward ing - the police. The
             g u lf is too large to be bridged by statements of goodw ill or policy
             declarations about impartiality. Treating rival supporters impartially
             can still result in both sets of fans being assumed collectively to be a
             problem. W hat the supporters w ant instead is a serious injection of
             police personnel training w ith the emphasis on serving, protecting
             and respecting the supporter as a valued, participative customer, the
             length and breadth of the country;

     b)      a d iffe re n t relationship w ith th e ciubs. Running in parallel to their
             hopes for change in their relationship w ith the police, supporters seek a
             more participative sort of partnership w ith their ow n clubs. Running as a
             them e throughout many of the prioritised items is the demand to be
             respected, involved and generally catered for in a respectful m anner by
             those w ith power in the game - the clubs;

             *     democratically accountable supporters should be represented at
                    every decision making level in the gam e and should share
                    responsibility and hence power, for m anaging the game;

             *      the supporters' 'stage' in which they play their part in the creation
                    of a football spectacle - the terracing and stands - need to be as
                    the supporters want them to be:-

                    i)      without any fencing which is likely to impede their view
                            and movement;

                    ii)     the terraces, where historically the core of a team's
                            passionate and melodic support emanates, should remain;

             *     the general experience of being in a football ground should be
                    pleasurable; specifically clubs need to direct their investment to
                    improve the facilities throughout the ground in terms of catering,
                    refreshments, toilets and other services. Such measures by
                    themselves would reduce the unattractiveness o f football grounds
                    to many women w ith the consequences o f diluting the overtly
                    macho culture of football w ith all its ugly spin offs;

             *     supporters' needs are important w hen decisions are being made
                    about investment and pricing. Their main concern is to keep the
                    gam e affordable to existing supporters. This may reflect fears o f
                    football being priced out of their price range to suit an imagined
                    n ew and more affluent market.


3.   C h a n g in g th e C u ltu re

     Supporters w an t to see a change in the atmosphere at football matches but they
     don't w an t to lose the emotion and passion of a partisan crowd at its best.
     They w a n t to change the 'culture', but not too muchl

     Specifically w h a t needs to change is the w hite and male exclusiveness o f football
     crowds. The proportion o f black players on the pitch is in no w ay matched by
      black supporters in the crowd. The supporters surveyed (86% o f whom w ere
      w hite men) are quite clear as to w hy this is: the level of racism emanating from
      a section of the white crowd which is tolerated by other supporters and club alike.
      Supporters w an t to see firm official action, which carries the authority of the club
      behind it to be seen to be taken against racist supporters. Furthermore, as described
      above, supporters are prepared to play their part in tackling the problem.

      As also referrred to above, clubs need to act to improve facilities and viewing
      arrangements in the grounds in order to recruit a broader spectrum of support.
      W hile the game may always remain a primarily male passion, it is nevertheless a
      family passion as well. Clubs need to demonstrate, in terms of the physical condition
      o f the ground, that eveiyone in the family is welcome and w ill be catered for as a m atter
      o f course.

      By acting against racists in the crowd and improving facilities to encourage more
      w om en to the game, the culture of the match will inevitably change. There is,
      however, a clear view amongst supporters that in the effort to change the crowd
      atmosphere the collective experience o f the standing supporters should not be lost.

     It is obviously the strongly held belief o f supporters that if w e are to retain the
     spirit o f the crowd, terracing must remain. The problems of safety and violence will
     only be resolved by a change in the relationship between supporters, the clubs and
     police - a partnership o f mutual respect w here each sees the other as indispensable
     contributors to the spectacle of the gam e - not by forcing everyone to sit dow nl

     Linked very much to the issues o f retaining w hat is best about football crowd
     culture and encouraging clubs to develop partnerships w ith their supporters is
     the need to improve links w ith the local community. Supporters see this as a practical
     w ay of clubs demonstrating their commitment to local people - the community w hich
     provides them w ith their (usually) life long followers. Many clubs have already seen
     the importance of such links. The message from this survey is that community links
     are not an optional extra. They should form a central commitment to the w ork
     programme and investment plans of eveiy club, every year.


4.   O ther Themes

     W hile not ranking quite so high as the above themes of responsibility, respect and
     culture, some further general concerns em erge.

     Supporters are looking for some o f the vast sums of money around in football to
     be directed back into the game w ith tangible benefits to the supporters. Specifically
     they suggest n ew stadiums, and especially an alternative to Wembley in the North of
     England.

     Supporters also display a keen sense of fairness. They w ant to see a reformed
     commonsense system of democracy and discipline. Specifically they suggest attention is
     given to the standard o f refereeing, the policing of away fans and the
     democratic managem ent of the game nationally.


5.   The Differences Explained

     As emphasised above the striking factor about this survey is the extraordinarily high degree of
     consensus. There w ere, however, some slight differences of emphasis which only enrich the
     overall conclusions. These differences give us a richer picture of the needs of supporters.
     A t no point do they demonstrate a split o f opinion. They can be summarised as follows:

           a)     wom en place a slightly higher emphasis on the need for improved
                  facilities in the ground, including better and cheaper catering facilities;
b)   those under 20 years oppose membership schemes very strongly, are
      attracted by the idea of encouraging earlier arrival at grounds and w ant
      to see improvements to the entertaining quality of the gam e itself in terms
      of attacking football;

cj   the over 40s place considerable emphasis on the need for better and
     cheaper facilities in the ground and w ant to see standing areas retained.
     This links in w ith the view of those w ho attend matches w ith children
     (see (i) below). There seems to be a connection between the retention of
     standing areas as a means of keeping football affordable;

d)   unwaged supporters w ant to see more investment in the game, namely
      the building of new stadiums and increasing the money available to
      football by bringing the pools money back into the game;

e)   students are again another group who place extra emphasis on the need
      for better and cheaper catering facilities;

f)   those w h o walk to home games, probably because they live nearby, w an t
      to see the clubs do more for the local community and place higher
      emphasis on tackling racism;

g)   aw ay supporters w ho travel by public transport and official transport are
      stronger in their opposition to compulsory membership schemes;

h)   those w h o attend less than 50% of their teams' hom e match place very
      high emphasis on improved facilities to encourage more w om en to the
      game;

i)   those w h o attend matches w ith children have particularly strong views on
      improved facilities both to encourage more w om en and to improve the
      standard of catering. They are also the group w ho place the greatest
      emphasis on retaining standing areas (see also (c) above).

                                         About this survey

This survey has been conducted by Sheffield City Council's Communications U nit using
a relatively n ew survey method called Priority Search

Priority Search is essentially a survey method which deals in finding solutions to a problem .
The first stage in the process is to turn the problem into a question - in this case;

       W hat needs to happen to improve football for th e supporters?

A sample group of a least a dozen of the people to be surveyed are then gathered together.
Over a period of 2 - 3 hours everyone in the group is helped to contribute solutions or
responses to the main question. Special care is taken to ensure everyone's voice gets heard.
There is no attem pt to reach a consensus within the group. On the contrary, a diversity of
opinion is encouraged.

These solutions form the items to be included in the questionnaire. The questionnaire
itself is different from the usual more familiar format. It invites the person filling it in to w eig ht
her/his preference for each solution w hen paired off w ith other solutions in turn. In practice,
this method is easy to follow and quick to complete. It has been used successfully w ith a w ide
cross-section of society.

In essence. Priority Search gives people the power to identify w h a t th e ir needs really
are and to sort them out into a prioritised list of their ow n making as illustrated in the diagrams
in this report.

    Survey in to the views o f members of the Football Supporters' Association w ho attended
    th e ir annual conference, 2 4 June 1 9 8 9 . Summary analysis of th e prioritised responses
                                          to th e question:


     WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO IMPROVE FOOTBALL FOR THE
                       SUPPORTERS?
The most striking aspect of this survey is the extraordinary degree of unanimity. The FSA conference
could be regarded as a fairly homogeneous group. Nevertheless a very w ide cross section of society
was represented (see Appendix 1): people of different and no earned income; home supporters and
aw ay fans; people w ho watch the game w ith friends, w ith children or on their own; people w ho sit as
w ell as those w ho stand; different age groups; members of supporters clubs and season ticket holders;
and men and wom en. No matter w hat category of people w e examine, their perception as to the
priority solutions for improving football for the supporters is virtually identical.

The first diagram below shows all the thirty items used in the questionnaire prioritised in order, 1 to 30,

The following is a broad brush description of the general themes that emerge from these
results - how they hang together into a consensus outlook on the w ay forward for football.
W ithout apology, this report is a subjective account o f the views of football supporters.
 It is not intended to be impartial. It does not take into account the views o f the
club's management, the police, the players or the stewards. Such an overall view would
only be possible if similar surveys w ere conducted w ith these groups. In such an eventuality
an overall picture could be painted taking into account the subjective views o f all parties.
The absence o f such data does not, however, invalidate this search. The viewpoint of the
customer matters in its ow n right and deserved to be listened to w ithout qualification.


1.    Responsibility

      There is undoubtedly a high level of preparedness amongst
      supporters to take responsibility for sorting out the problems of football.
      Football supporters' are more than just customers. They
      follow the game w ith a passion often incomprehensible
      to those on the outside. Football is an important part of many people's
      lives w ith deep roots in English culture. Consequently there is
      no lack o f commitment to the game; no shortage of volunteers.

      Specifically supporters have demonstrated in this survey:

             a preparedness to shoulder some o f the responsibility
             for the behaviour of others, which demonstrates a high level of
             positive collective identification w ith their fellow supporters;

             a preparedness to give up their ow n time, energy and
             intelligence to working w ith each other to finding solutions;

             a commitment to basic moral principals o f fairness and
             accountability.

       In other words there is a recognition that w hile supporters have their
       problems o f bad behaviour w hen they get together, these could be successfully,
       tackled, largely by or w ith the participation and guidance of democratically
       accountable supporters in the game. The same basic principles of fairness
       that lie behind the rules of conduct of those on the pitch, should be used to
       steward the conduct o f those off it.


2.     Respect

      Supporters expect to be treated better. Throughout the country there is a
      growing realisation that the customer has a right to better service and treatment.
      Their collective characteristics are there to be understood and catered for by
      the body providing the service.

     • Football supporters' do pay to get in. They provide three times the am ount of
       finance into the game than all the sponsorship money put together. Not only
       that but they are participative customers w ho give of themselves (and would do
       more if they w ere only asked) to improve the product in the interests and
       enjoym ent o f everyone.
        They pay for, and expect to be treated w ith more respect.

        Specifically they want:

        a)          a d iffe re n t relationship w ith th e police. O ut o f all the various
                    suggestions for coping w ith the problems of ground control, this was
                    the one which highlighted the gulf in respect between the customer
                  ~ and those currently charged w ith their stewarding - the police. The
                    gulf is too large to be bridged by statements of goodwill or policy
                    declarations about impartiality. Treating rival supporters impartially
                    can still result in both sets o f fans being assumed collectively to be a
                    problem. W hat the supporters w ant instead is a serious injection of
                    police personnel training w ith the emphasis on serving, protecting
                    and respecting the supporter as a valued, participative customer, the
                    length and breadth of the country;

         b)              a d iffe re n t relationship w ith th e clubs. Running in parallel to their
                         hopes for change in their relationship w ith the police, supporters seek a
                         more participative sort o f partnership w ith their ow n clubs. Running as a
                         theme throughout many o f the prioritised items is the demand to be
                         respected, involved and generally catered for in a respectful manner by                                                                                          _
                         those w ith power in the game - the clubs;

                          *                democratically accountable supporters should be represented at
                                           every decision making level in the game and should share
                                           responsibility and hence power, for managing the game;

                          *                 the supporters 'stage' in which they play their part to the creation
                                            of a football spectacle - the terracing and stands - needs to be as
                                            the supporters w ant them to be:-

                                            i)    w ithout any fencing which is likely to impede their view
                                                  and movement;

                                            iij   the terracing's, w here historically the core of a team's
                                                  passionate and melodic support emanates, should remain;

                          *                 the general experience of being in a football ground should be
                                            pleasurable; specifically clubs need to direct their investment to
                                            improve the facilities throughout the ground in terms of catering,
                                            refreshments, toilets and other services. Such measures by
                                            themselves would reduce the unattractiveness of football grounds
                                            to many w om en w ith the consequences o f diluting the overtly
                                            macho culture of football w ith all its ugly spin offs;

                          *                 supporters' needs are important w hen decisions are being made
                                            about investment and pricing. Their main concern is to keep the
                                            game affordable to existing supporters. This may reflea fears of
                                            football being priced out of their price range to suit an imagined
                                            new and more affluent market.


3.       C h a n g in g th e C u ltu re

         Supporters w ant to see a change in the atmosphere at football matches but they
         don't w ant to loose the emotion and passion o f a partisan crowd at its best.
         They w an t to change the 'culture', but not too muchl

         Specifically w hat needs to change is the white and male exclusiveness of football
         crowds. The proportion of black players on the pitch is in no w ay matched by




     yayW H   r3g " g T - - ^ T J F T ^ T i t            ----* * ™ tit* ^ -* * - * - -- ------■ -n -   -7 -n   ,------T ~ c »   ---- f   ^ - r= - r~ .   ^   — -tw*"—“ — -.   ->a- f >.       r-« i-   i-^
     black supporters in the crowd. The supporters surveyed (86% o f whom w ere
     w hite men) are quite clear as to w h y this is: the level of racism emanating from
     a section o f the w hite crowd which is tolerated by other supporters and club alike.
     Supporters w ant to see firm official action, which carries the authority of the club
     behind it, to be seen to be taken against racist supporters. Furthermore, as described
     above, supporters are prepared to play their part in tackling the problem.

     As also referrred to above, clubs need to act to improve facilities and viewing
     arrangements in the grounds in order to recruit a broader spectrum of support.
     W hile the game may always remain a primarily male passion, it is nevertheless a
     family passion as well. Clubs need to demonstrate, in terms o f the physical condition
     o f the ground, the everyone in the family is welcome and will be catered for as a m atter
     o f course.

     By acting against racists in the crowd and improving facilities to encourage more
     wom en to the game, the culture o f the match will inevitably change. There is,
     however, a clear view amongst supporters that in the effort to change the crowd
     atmosphere the collective experience o f the standing supporters should not be lost.

     It is obviously the strongly held belief o f supporters that if w e are to retain the
     spirit o f the crowd, terracing must remain. The problems of safety and violence will
     only be resolved by a change in the relationship between supporters, the clubs and
     police - a partnership o f mutual respect w here each sees the other as indispensable
     contributors to the spectacle of the gam e - not by forcing everyone to sit down!

     Linked very much to the issues o f retaining w hat is best about football crowd
     culture and encouraging clubs to developing partnerships w ith their supporters is
     the need to improve links w ith local community. Supporters see this as a practical
     w ay o f clubs demonstrating their commitment to local people - the community which
     provides them w ith their (usually) life long followers. Many clubs have already seen
     the importance of such links. The message from this survey is that community links
     are not an optional extra. They should form a central commitment to the work
     programme and investment plans o f every club, every year.


4.   O ther Themes

     W hile not ranking quite so high as the above themes of responsibility, respect and
     culture, some further general concerns emerge.

     Supporters are looking for some o f the vast sums o f money around in football to
     be directed back into the game w ith tangible benefits to the supporters. Specifically
     they suggest new stadiums, and especially an alternative to Wembley in the North of
     England.

     Supporters also display a keen sense o f fairness. They w ant to see a reformed
     commonsense system of democracy and discipline. Specifically they suggest attention is
     given to the standard o f refereeing, the policing o f away fans and the
     democratic management of the game nationally.


5.   The Differences Explained

     As emphasised above the striking factor about this survey is the extraordinary high degree of
     consensus. There w ere however, some slight differences o f emphasis which only enrich the
     overall conclusions. These differences give us a richer picture of the needs of supporters.
     At no point do they demonstrate a split o f opinion. They can be summarised as follows:

            a)    wom en place a slightly higher emphasis on the need for improved
                  facilities in the ground, including better and cheaper catering facilities;
b)   those under 20 years oppose membership schemes very strongly, are
     attracted by the idea of encouraging earlier arrival at grounds and w ant
     to see improvements to the entertaining quality of the game itself in terms
     o f attacking football;

c)   the over 40s, place considerable emphasis on the need for better and
      cheaper facilities in the ground and w ant to see standing areas retained.
      This links in w ith the view o f those w ho attend matches w ith children
      (see (i) below). There seems to be a connection between the retention of
      standing areas as a means o f keeping football affordable;

d)   unwaged supporters w ant to see more investment in the game, namely
      the building o f new stadiums and increasing the money available to
      football by bringing the pools money back into the game;

e)   students are again another group w ho place extra emphasis of the need
      for better and cheaper catering facilities;

f)   those w ho w alk to home games, probably because they live nearby, w ant
      to see the clubs do more for the local community and place higher
      emphasis on tackling racism;               —

g)   away supporters w ho travel by public transport and official transport are
      stronger in their opposition to compulsory membership schemes;

h)   those w ho attend less than 50% of their teams' home match place very
     high emphasis on improved facilities to encourage more wom en to the
     game;

i)   those w ho attend matches w ith children have particularly strong views on
     improved facilities both to encourage more w om en and to improve the
     standard of catering. They are also the group w ho place the greatest
     emphasis on retaining standing areas (see also (c) above).




                                                                                   & m s m

                                        About this survey

This survey has been conducted by Sheffield City Council’s Communications Unit using
a relatively new survey method called Priority Search

Priority Search is essentially a survey method which deals in finding solutions to a problem.
The first stage in the process is to turn the problem into a question - in this case;

      W hat needs to happen to improve football for th e supporters?

A sample group of a least a dozen of the people to be surveyed are then gathered together.
O ver a period of 2 - 3 hours everyone in the group is helped to contribute solutions or
 responses to the main question. Special care is taken to ensure everyone's voice gets heard.
There is no attem pt to reach a consensus w ithin the group. On the contrary, a diversity of
opinion is encouraged.

These solutions form the items to be included in the questionnaire. The questionnaire
itself is different to the usual more familiar format. It invites the person filling it in to w eight
their preference for each solution w hen paired off w ith other solutions in turn. In practice,
this method is easy to follow and quick to complete. It has been used successfully w ith a wide
 cross-section o f society.

In essence. Priority Search gives people the pow er to id en tify w h at th e ir needs really
are and to sort them out into a prioritised list of their ow n making as illustrated in the diagrams
 in this report.

To:    Councillor C.J. Betts                                                   16th January, 1990


OWLERTON STADIUM


Briefly, the current position is:-

1)    If industrial development is to be achieved, the best way forward would appear to be to
      secure the shortest term possible (unlikely to be less than 7 years), so that we can at
      the end of the lease have firm redevelopment proposals to enable us to take possession.

      Unrealistic are:-

      -   The Council re-locating the Stadium.
      -   Re-development of part only of the site, with the Stadium in situ.


2)  In progressing discussions with the Stadium Company they have put forward a proposal
    whereby the Council would dispose to either the Stadium Company, or an independent
    developer who would contract to provide a phased development, and to deal with the
Stadium itself.

      I expect shortly confirmation that they wish to discuss further, and feel that this is
      worth exploring further. We will need to be convinced that the proposals are feasible
      and financially acceptable, and input will be required from Property Services,
      Planning, Employment and S.D.O. on land use, design, demand etc.


3)    The Stadium Company have requested that the question of a new lease be put back into
      Court, and a meeting with HALD took place this morning. A directions appointment is
      fixed for early next month.

      The Stadium Company feel that the lease must be resolved as:-

      - they need some security to carry on the current operation.
      - the lease will have a fundamental bearing on the value of the site for redevelopment,
        and the feasibility of any proposals.


At the meeting this morning John Morrell suggested that the Council actually taking over
the running of the Stadium may be the best way to achieve the Council's redevelopment aims.
The financial and resource implications are however obvious.

This, as you may recall was the grounds used to serve Notice, and what the Council must
defend. To change the grounds now may not be possible, and Council's opinion would be
required.


The fundamental decisions therefore appear to be:-

a)    Industrial redevelopment v Leisure.     (If leisure then the Stadium Company has
      already agreed verbally to a 20 year lease).

b)    If industrial redevelopment, does the Council wish to run the Stadium itself                 ie. the
      defence to the lease renewal.

c)    If the answer to (b) (above) is "No" then can discussions proceed on redevelopment in
      "partnership" with the Stadium Company.

            12th March, 1990.




            After consultation with m y fellow Council Leaders here in South
             Yorkshire, we are all agreed that football has an essential role
            to play in the cultural life of our communities.   I think it can be
             fairly said that football has traditionally and to this day been a
             central focus of sport in South Yorkshire, and it is essential that
            it responds positively to the many pressures being placed on it.


             Accordingly, I am delighted to invite you to a dinner here in
             Barnsley T o w n Hall, the date of which I will advise you of in due
             course, but will in any event be a Thursday in March/April.


             The guest list that night will include myself, the Leaders of Doncaster,
             Rotherham and Sheffield, and hopefully the Chief Constable and Chief
             Fire Officer of South Yorkshire* along with two Directors of each of
             the five South Yorkshire Football League Clubs.



                                                            /Cntd.
/Cntd.



                                    2.



The purpose of this get-together, which is on an informal basis,
would be to discuss problems common to us all here in South
Yorkshire, hopefully in a convivial atmosphere.    No doubt if the
evening is successful, and I hope and trust it will be, then I see
no reason w h y this should not be the first of an annual get-
together of this nature.


M a y I suggest that you accept this letter as an invitation to two
Directors from your Club, and in the event that you personally
cannot attend, then perhaps another Director may be able to attend
in your stead.


As I said above, I shall let you have further details of the actual
arrangements in the event that we all agree that such an exercise
will be worthwhile.


I look forward to hearing from you.



Yours sincerely,

                                                  G L Y N S H E R W I N A N D MR.    HASH IM I

             F o l l o w i n g a p r e l i m i n a r y exchange of pleasantries, the L e a d e r asked Mr.
             H a s h i m i to outline the current situation regarding the deal for his purchase
             of shares in S h e f field United.

             1.    Mr. Hash i m i said that he h ad an agreement to pur c h a se shares from Mr.
                   Brearley, but this w as b e i n g opp o s ed by the o ther shareholders.

                   He pr o d u c e d a copy of a "Heads of Agreement" b e t w e e n Else 1982 Ltd.
                   (Mr. B r e a r l e y ’s comp an y based in Gibraltar) and B a rnacle Holdings Ltd.
                   (the company repre se n t e d by Mr.       Hash i m i b a s e d at 28-34 Hill Street,
                   St.   Helier, Jersey), a copy of w h i c h he said officers of the Cou n c il
                   could o b tain from his solicitors on a strictly con f i d e n t i al basis.          He
                   asked if the C o u n c i l ’s solicitor i.e.        M a r k Webster, could contact his
                   solicitors -

                             Brechers and Co.
                             78 Brook Street,
                             London, W 1 Y 2 A D .

                             Tel:  01-494-5141
                             Fax: 01-493-6255
                             Contact:  Robert W i e d e r

                   F r o m a cursory e x a m i n a t i o n of the document it appears that some £ 6 . 25m
                   has be e n agre e d as the p u rchase price of 621 of the shares (2,097
                   o r dinary shares?).

                   Mr.       Hash i m i said that he h a d look e d at the n e w stadium in the Don
                   V a l l e y and was c o n si d e r i n g the implications of a mo v e to the stadium
                   including attempts to increase the international interest of bot h the
                   club and the sta d i u m w i t h v i d eo and TV marketing, international
                   exchange matches, and the devel o p m e n t of the leisure, c atering and
                   e nterta i n m e n t aspects of the stadium.         In add i t i o n he said that he
                   w o u l d like to m a i n t a i n the "Bramall Lane" name on the n e w site if a
                   move was made.

             2.    Mr. Hashimi then w en t on to discuss the p o s i t i o n r e g arding the site of
                   the Bramall La n e pitch, in w h i c h he saw the C o u n c i l as h a v i n g two areas
                   of interest:-

                    (a)   As p l a n n i n g authority, w h e r e w e could offer advice,                 and h o p e fully
                          eventu a l l y approval to any development, and

                    (b)   As a p ossible p a r t n e r      in any d ev elopment on the site, u s i n g la n d
                          w h i c h the Cit y C o u n c i l  owns adjacent to the m a i n site.

                   The L e a d e r pro v i d e d his views on the possible d e velopment of the site,
                   on an "off the record" basis, w h i c h in no w a y c o m m i t t e d the Council.
I                  He said that it was p o ssible for the Cou n c il and any owner of the site
                   to w o r k together w i t h a d e v eloper acting for bo t h parties, but poi n te d
                   out that such a development w o u l d not be able to include food retail,
                   although housing, hotels, offices and leisure c ould be considered.

                   The e x c l u s i o n   of food retail came somewhat as a shock to Mr. Hashimi,
                   w h o said that         a retail element is n e e d e d to realise the full value of
I
    SH3AAN
              the land.      He said that Mr. Br e a r l ey h a d quoted a figure of £7m as
              b e i n g an amount w h i c h the Coun c i l is p repared to p ay for the Bramall
              Lane site.

              The L e a d e r i n d i c a t e d that this m ay be about the devel o p m e n t value of
              the site if de v e l o p e d in c o n j u n c t i o n w i t h other adjacent sites.
              However, he did not w i s h to be co m m i t t e d to this figure or quoted
              thereon.        He w e n t on to say that the Cou n c i l w i l l n ot w a i v e pla n n i n g
              regulations to increase the v alue of the site in order to p ossibly
              enhance any capital c o n t r i b u t i on to the n e w s t a d i u m in the D on Valley.

              The L e ader asked Mr. Has h i m i to submit a scheme t o gether w i t h a
              d e v eloper for the Ci t y C o u n c i l ’s planners to comment upon.             The City
              C o u n c i l ’s p o s i t i o n is flexible and w i l l discuss the m a t t e r of the
              development of the site w i t h the appropriate people, but reiterated
              that at the present time Mr. Hash i m i does not o f f i c i a ll y have the
              ability to n e g o t i a t e on the m a t t e r as the share p urchase has not b e e n
              concluded.

              Mr. Hash i m i said that he h a d already be e n in touch w i t h the developer
              and he w o u l d ask the d e veloper to contact our planners.           Should the
              p urchase of the shares in S.U.F.C.       go through he w o u l d still w i s h to
              consider the p o ssible move to the D o n V a l l e y S t a d i u m and w o u l d need, at
              that time, to talk about the rent r e quired for use of the stadium.                   If
              such a mo v e takes place he w o u l d require exclusive use of the sta d i u m
              i.e.   not to be shared w i t h another football team, but its use for
              athletics w o u l d be acceptable.

              The Lead e r said that in v i e w of the W o r l d Student Games in 1991 and the
              n e e d for p o ssible enhancements to the stadium, he was ex p e c t i n g that
              any football club u s i n g the stadium w o u l d do so from September 1992.

         3.   The L e a d e r asked Mr. Hash i m i about his pedigree and Mr. Hashimi said
              that he was a U.K. cit i z e n w h o was acting for M i d d l e East contacts v i a
              Barnacle H o ldings Ltd.        This company has bee n f o rmed to b r in g overseas
              investment to Britain, one such investment b e i n g the S.U.F.C. deal.
              He said that he h a d w o r k e d in Saudi A r a b i a for the last five years, for
              the "Jasirah Group of Jeddah".

              He went on to say that he has his o wn private company, Omni Leisure,
              w h i c h has leisure activities in B e l d o n in Y or k shire and a h e a l t h club
              in Mayfair.

              The L e a d e r r e i t e r at e d that the C o u nc i l n e e d e d to k n o w w i t h w h o m it w a s
              talking and h a d to have confidence that the o r g a n i s a t i o n h a d some
              substance.

         4.   Mr. Hash i m i asked if the Cou n c i l h a d ma d e an offer to the other
               directors for the g r o u n d and the L ea d e r said that w h a t e v e r price is
               available, it is available to w h o e v e r owns the club, but as yet no
               formal offer has be e n made.

         5.   In c o n c l u si o n it w as agreed by bo t h parties that c o n f i de n t i a l i t y was
               p a r a mount and that Mr. Hash i m i w o u l d provide details of all his
               proposals to the Ci t y C o u n c i l ’s solicitors and b o t h solicitors w o u l d be
               able to discuss the form and content of the c o m p a n y ’s involvement.                   He
               w o u l d also w ri t e to the Ci t y C o u n c i l ’s planners for advice on the
               pr o p o s e d development.

               Finally, Mr. Hash im i stated that the developer w i t h w h o m he is

SH3AAN
         c u r r ently d i sc u s s i n g his proposals is Tarmac, w h o he was in p a r tnership
         w i t h for the d ev elopment of the B r i t i sh Rail site at Swindon.

Dear Mrs. Gordon,

I have been asked to write to you on behalf of the Board of Directors of
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. I too am a Director.

We are very concerned about the amount of safety work your officers are
insisting we carry out at the Hillsborough Stadium. Naturally, following the
tragic events of the semi-final disaster we are keen to co-operate in every way
we can to comply with any regulations. However, the problem is that the
Council's safety officers are choosing to interpret the 1986 Hone Office Guide
to Safety at Sports Ground as though it is the letter of the law and that every
full stop and comma is statute bound rather than the guide it is intended to be.

I sit on the Hone Affairs Select Committee which deals in specific Hone Office
issues and, after checking with the officials there, they assure me that the
Guide is simply a list of recommendations which need to.be applied in a common
sense way.

I am also informed that if the Council makes unreasonable demands before issuing
a safety certificate then it can be challenged in the courts on the grounds that
the council is being unreasonably restrictive.

The matter is further complicated by the fact that very soon the Hone Offiee is
to set up a Football Licensing Authority (its composition and chairman should
have been announced on June 1st). This authority will then have the power to
overule local Councils and even Police on the safety and timing of games and no
doubt listen to appeals from clubs.

Obviously we do not want to enter into legal action with the Council. It is in
both our interests to maintain an amicable relationship. However, perhaps I
should point out that in law we are a PLC. We do have to balance our books
without subsidy and have to compete in the same market place as our competitors,
while satsifying our shareholders.



                                           continued
Our Club was recently relegated to the Second Division of the Football League
and this will cost us £1 million in loss of sponsorships, TV fees and gate
receipts etc. In addition we are already in debt to the Bank for £1.5 million,
which makes it very difficult for us to fund the ever increasing demands for
ground alterations continually required by your staff.

What makes the situation even more harsh is that next season we will be playing
on grounds at places like Oxford, Port Vale, Bristol Rovers (who actually use a
non-league ground in nearby Bath) and the standards of crowd accommodation there
is ludicrously inadequate when compared to Hillsborough. Yet these clubs appear
to have no difficulty at all with their Local Councils, or any restrain on their
trading facilities.

I am attaching a list of the work the. Council is demanding, which we feel is
excessively bureaucratic, in general, and after conversations with the Home
Office experts, it does seem ridiculous that walls now only 18 inches high
should have to have safety exits. Or that staircases which previously had three
descending handrails 100 cms. apart should now be reduced to two because the
Guide recommends 110 cms. It seems daft to take out perfectly good modern
concertina gates in order to instal push bar exit doors like the type used in
cinemas, which could be opened by idiots from the inside to let in their
hooligan friends without tickets.

Or to insist that the hundreds of crush barriers on the Kop now have to be
tested and re-welded when (a) we have reduced the standing capacity from 21,000
to 16,800 and Ob) they will all have to be torn up again by 1994 at the latest
because the Government has ruled that all seater stadiums must be in force by
then.

The capacity of our ground is more than enough for the gates we get. Even at
the latest reduced limit it is 38/000 and our average First Division attendance
last year was 21,000. Our highest gate was only 33,000. In the Second Division
we would expect crowds substantially less and have a very much reduced income.

Consequently we feel that we must draw to your attention our dissatisfaction at
the way in which we are being unfairly discriminated compared to other Second
Division clubs and would ask you for an urgent meeting with your officials and
leading members of the Council to discuss the situation. The new season will
start in about six weeks time and we do not wish to be in dispute then.

We look forward to your reply.

                                     Yours sincerely,




                                                                             n.

                     De a r Mr. Ashton,

                     Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 (as amended)
                     Sheffield We d n e s d a y Foo t b a l l Club

                     I refer to y o u r letter of 3rd July, 1990 and to the m e e t i n g at
                     Sh e f field W e d n e s d ay Foo t b a ll Club of the S a fety of Sports Grounds
                     A d v i s o r y Group w h i c h y o u at t en d e d on Monday, 30th July, 1990.

                     For your information I have not yet r eceived the list of works
                     d e t a il e d on page 2 of your letter. I am, therefore, only able to
                     respond to your comments in more gene r a l terms.

                     Y o u raise a number of points in your letter w hich I feel m a y be
                     summarised as follows

                     (a) appl i ca t i o n of the Guide to Safe t y of Sports Gro u n d s (the Green
                         Guide) by The Sheffield City C o u n c il as c e r t i f i c a t i o n a u t h ority to
                         Sheffield W e d n e s d a y Foo t b a l l Club;

                     (b)     specific works requested b y the C o u n c i l as c ertifying a ut hority
                             following the H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m Disaster;

                     (c) c a p a c i t y :reductions w i t h i n the, S t a d i u m . f o l l o w i n g the I n t e r i m and
                         Final Taylor Reports;

                      (d) cost to the Cl u b of unde r t a k i n g safety works;

                      (e) operation of the n e w F o o t b a l l L i c e n s i n g Authority.

                      If I m ay deal with these mat t e r s            in turn:-

                      (a )     A p p lication of G re e n Guide

                      A s y ou point out in your letter, the G u i d e to Safety of Sports Grounds
                      issued by the Home Office is a n att e m p t from a central, na t i o n a l base
                      to offer guidance to local a u t h o r i t i e s w h e n cons i d e r i n g safety related
                      m a t t e r s at sports grounds.      It b e c a m e clear to this A u t h o r i t y
                      following the H i l l sb o r o u g h S t a d i u m D i s a s t e r that if a Cou n c i l departs
                      fr o m the Green Guide standard it mu s t jus t i f y this.                 I agree that the
                      G u i d e can not u n i formly be appli e d throu g h o u t the C o u n t r y to football
                      s t adia and ,1, would, point to a, number- o f : instances where;, the Council,
                      h a s relaxed 1 the "Guide"standards at y o u r :Stcd'iun.' •(Barrier layout;
North Stand ramps, etc.)*             I believe the Council h as p r operly applied
the Guide to, y o u r Stadium, but y o u .s h ould bear in m i n d that when the
Council j through, the L i c e n s ing. Panel- , is c onsider ing any proposal
af f ecting your Ground, the Club m a y a t t e n d at the L i c e nsing Panel
hearing and ma k e a pp r o p r i a t e r e pr e s e n t a t i o n s d irectly to Mem b e r s of
the Council.

(b)    Specific Grou nd Safety W orks

I am aware of no request by the C o u n c i l that falls into the category
of being " e x c e s s i v e l y bureaucratic".           Again, I would suggest that if
you have strong rese r v a t i o n s about a n y request made by the Council
your Comp a n y Secretary, Mr.                M a c krell, should speak d irectly with the
City Soli c i t o r ' s Chief L i ce nsing Officer, Mr.            Derricott, or attend
the appro p r i a t e L i c e n s i n g P a n e l hearing.

(c) Capacity R e d u c t i o n s

I would refer you to R e c o m m e n d a t i o n s 7-10, 23, 32 and 33 of the Final
Report of Lord J,ustice; T a y l o r . F o l l o w i n g the H i l l s b o r o u g h .Disaster
and p u b 1icat i on.jof'the 'interim R e p o r t ,' capacities at bo t h footba 11
clubs w i thin tile City were reviewed and n ew c apacity figures set by
the Council in a c c o r d a n c e w i t h a p p r o p r i a t e recommendations.

It is my u n d e r s t a n d i ng that the Hom e O f fice intend to incorporate the
Final R e c o m m e n d a t i o n s w h i c h affect s p e ctator capacities at sports
stadia into the n ew G r e e n G uide w h i c h is to be published, I b e l i e v e ,
some time in October of this year.                     C a pacity for the n ew football
season has, therefore, been c a l c u l a t e d w i t h d i r e c t reference to t h e s e ’
recommendations by yo u r C l u b' s C o n s u l t i n g Engineers, Messrs.         Eastwood
& Partners.         T heir c apacity c a l c u l a t i o n s w i ll obviously be checked but
are likely to be inco r p o r a t e d into a n e w General Safe t y Certificate.
I believe further reductions in s p e c t a t o r capacity w i l l follow as a
result of these calculations.

 (d)    Cost of Safety W o r k s        to the C l u b

 I fully u n d e r s t a n d and a p p r e c i a t e that in v i e w of the. C l u b 's^ recent
 relegation! -to^-^£;.Se^pd>^t!ly^s;i^ of ,the,'^o^tbally L ^ gtie^v;t J i £ ^                     =
 have lost revenue , How e v e r , l :,feel dh’          a t it w o u l d bev a d i f f ic u l t and
 dangerous road for the Council to f o l l o w if it were to trade off
 spectator safety against cost.

 I also realise that there a re a n u m b e r of m u c h smaller clubs within
 the F o otball L e a g u e a nd the Second D i v i s i o n whose stadia do not
 compare wi t h that of H i llsborough.              If standards of safety at these
 clubs fall b e l o w the standards req u i r e d nation a l l y I a m sure the n ew
 Football L i c e n s i n g A u t h o r i t y will be swift to act to improve matters.

 (e)    N e w Football L i c e n s i n g A u t h o r i t y

 I understand from the H o m e Office that a chairman has n o w been
 appointed for this n e w licensing authority.                   However, in practical
 terms the L i c e nsing A u t h o r i t y is u n l i k e l y to commence ground surveys
 and visits to local a u t h o r i t i es u n t i l well into the n e w F o otball
 Season.  I have been g i v e n no i n d i c a t i o n by the Home Office as to h o w
 this n e w j               ^    ^             ,
 the H e a ^ h - ^ t i ^ s ^
 and licensing autho r i t i e s w o u l d nave to justify depart u r e s from
 national standards and their failure to impose hi g h standards of
 safety for spectators.
I ho p e that I h a v e been able to answer some of your queries but
shouldyou require an yt h i n g further, please do not h e s i t a t e to contact
the City Soli c i t o r ' s Chief L i c e n s i n g Officer, Mr. D erricott, on

full stop and, comma is statute bound rather than the guide it is intended to be.

I sit on the Home Affairs Select Committee which deals in specific Home Office
issues and, after checking with the officials there, they assure me that the
Guide is simply a list of recommendations which need to.be applied in a common
sense way.

I am also informed that if the Council makes unreasonable demands before issuing
a safety certificate then it can be challenged in the courts on the grounds that
the Council is being unreasonably restrictive.

The matter is further complicated by the fact that very soon the Home Office is
to set up a Football Licensing Authority (its composition and chairman should
have been announced on JUne 1st). This authority will then have the power to
overule local Councils and even Police on the safety and timing of games and no
doubt listen :to appeals from clubs.

Obviously we ;do not want to enter into legal action with the Council, it is in
both our interests to maintain an amicable relationship. However, perhaps I
should point out that in law we are a PLC. We do have to balance our books
without subsidy and have to compete in the same market place as our competitors,
while satsifying our shareholders.



                                           continued . .
Our Club was recently relegated to the Second Division of the Football League
and this will cost us £1 million in loss of sponsorships, TV fees and gate
receipts etc. in addition we are already in debt to the Bank for £1.5 million,
which makes it very difficult for us to fund the ever increasing demands for
ground alterations continually required by your staff.

What makes the situation even more harsh is that next season we will be playing
on grounds at;places like Oxford, Port Vale, Bristol Rovers (who actually use a
non-league ground in nearby Bath) and the standards of crowd accommodation there
is ludicrously inadequate when compared to Hillsborough. Yet these clubs appear
to have no difficulty at all with their Local Councils, or any restrain on their
trading facilities.

I am attaching a list of the work the. Council is demanding, which we feel is
excessively bureaucratic. In general, and after conversations With the Home
Office experts, it does seem ridiculous that walls now only 18 inches high
should have to have safety exits. Or that staircases which previously had three
descending handrails 100 cms. apart should now be reduced to two because the
Guide recommends 110 cms. It seems daft to take out perfectly good modern
concertina gates in order to instal push bar exit doors like the type used in
cinemas, which could be opened by idiots from the inside to let in their
hooligan friends without tickets.

Or to insist that the hundreds of crush barriers on the Kop now have to be
tested and re-welded when (a) we have reduced the standing capacity from 21,000
to 16,800 and (b) they will all have to be torn up again by 1994 at the latest
because the Government has ruled that all seater stadiums must be in force by
then.

The capacity of our ground is more than enough for the gates we get. Even at
the latest reduced limit it is 38,000 and our average First Division attendance
last year was 21,000. Our highest gate was only 33,000. In the Second Division
we would expect crowds substantially less and have a very much reduced income.

Consequently we feel that we must draw to your attention our dissatisfaction at
the way in which we are being unfairly discriminated compared to other Second
Division clubs and would ask you for an urgent meeting with your officials and
leading members of the Council to discuss the situation. The new season will
start in about six weeks time and we do not wish to be in dispute then.

We look forward to your reply.

                                     Yours sincerely,

D e a r Sir

RE 8  SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 (AS AMENDED)
POLICE CONTROL ROOM - OPERATION


W i t h reference to y o u r c o m m u n i c a t i o n of 16th A u g u s t 1990      (received by fax

at 3.55pm)        u p o n w h i c h I have obt a i n ed the immediate comments of m y Chief

L i c e n s i n g Officer,     I w o u l d point out that the assumptions c o n t ai n e d in

the second p a r a g r a p h of your letter are totally u n w a r r a n t e d and that this

b e i n g so, m a y I respectfully suggest that y ou look slightly n e a r e r to

home      for the source of the i n formation leaked as it was n ot the City

Coun c i l w h o w as      responsible.



M a y I also ask         (if it is still available)               that y ou let me have the

 envelope c o n t a i n i n g m y letter of 8 th A u g u s t 1990 then I m a y check the

p o s t m a r k to d i s c o v e r w h y such document a p p a r e n t l y took seven days to

 reach y ou and appeared,               coincidentally,         w h e n m y second fax,   reque s t in g a

 response,       arrived.



 It is p r e c i s e ly because I do a ppreciate the m e d i a implications of the

 a c t i on that m i g h t still be n e c e s s a r y on m y part that I regarded the issue

 as totally c o n f i dential b e t w e e n the Club a nd the City Council and w h y I

w as pr e s s i n g for a response to m y e a rl i e r letter.               In this regard,       if you

 pause for a m o m e n t to give some rational c o n s i d e r a t i o n to the issue,                you

w i l l realise that f r o m m y point of view,                  it w o u l d be totally illogical to

 m a k e such an a p p r o a c h to the press w h e n it m a y wel l be that you w e r e              in a

 p o s i t i o n to assure me that the wo r k h a d alr e a dy been carried out,

 p a r t ic u l a r l y as m y O fficers are scheduled to ma k e a further inspe c t i o n on

 this issue today.

W i t h regard to the p e nultimate p a r a g r a p h of y o u r communication,                         I would

stress once again,             the only contact m y staff ha v e h a d w i t h the press upon

this issue, w as           to fend-off enquiries                   from reporters w h o clearly h a d

received the i n f o r m at i o n from elsewhere as can be seen from the enclosed

a rti c l e w h i c h a p p e a r e d in The Star on 16th August,                   a nd I can therefore

only repeat m y ear l i e r suggestion that you look elsewhere,                                as a m a t t e r of

urgency,      for the source of this infor m a t i o n as I can categor i c a l l y assure

y ou that it did no t emanate from m y staff and therefore there is no need

for me to give c o n s i d e r a t i o n to the implications of al l o w i n g m e d i a access

to confidential matt e r s             since such access is compl e t e l y c o ntrary to m y

d e p a r tmental p r actice and process,                     p a r t i c u l a r l y as the Department,   by its

v e r y nature,        is us e d to h a n d l i n g all m a n n e r of c o n f i d e n t i al issues       in a

secure and safe fashion.



This b e i n g so,       I w o u l d a gain strongly suggest that y ou make enquiries

elsewhere w i t h regard to this                ’l e a k ’ and accordingly,             I await your

comments w i t h regard to the outcome of such enquiry w i t h interest.



Finally,      can I point out that w h o e v e r y ou dis c o v e r is u l t i m at e l y

r esponsible for this              ’l e a k ’ of c o n f i dential information,             this incident

does n ot in any sense a lter the b asic facts of the situation and the

d e cision w h i c h m a y or m a y no t be n e c e s s a r y d e p e nd i n g on the con s t r u c ti o n

  Dear S i r ,

  S a f e t y of S p o r t s Grounds Act 1975              (as amended).
  Police Con t r o l R o o m - Operation.

  I ajn e x t r e m e l y concerned at press reports today that our game against L i v erpool on
  S a t u r d a y 25 A u g u s t may be postponed due to the fact that the Police Cont r o l Room at
  Bramall Lane m ay not be fully operational.

  I have r e c ei v e d this morning your letter dated 15 August enclosing a copy of
  your l e t t e r dated 8 August (which was also rec e i ve d this morning). I can on l y assume
  that the comments c o n t ained in y o u r letter have been relayed by the Council to the
  media.

  This is something that J. find totally i n a c c e p t a b l e . Do you not realise the
  i m p l i cations of a l lowing the m e d i a access to this information? Our s w i t c h b o a r d is
  already inundated with calls from concerned supporters who have already purchased
  tickets for the game. We are also emba r r a s s e d by the fact that both the Football
  League and Liverpool Football Cl ub will have re c e i v e d these comments second hand.

( As far as I am aware the concern is that the C C T V and PA Syst e m will not be fully
  o per a t i o n a l in time for the Liverpool game. I can only state that the contr a c t o r was
  aware of the time factor when he accepted the contract and he has said today that
  the C C T V s y stem will be ready for the L i v erpool game. As you are aware the Public
  A d d r e s s s y stem has been installed for some time, the only work n e c e s s a r y here is to
  r e - c o n n e c t to the n e w Policc Control Room.

  I w o u l d add that plans for the new Police C o n t r o l Room were s ub m i t t e d to the Council
  by E a s t w o o d & Par t n e r s on 9 N ovember 1989. No r esponse was received by the Council
  until April 1990 when, after further c o nsultations with the Police, an amended
  scheme was s u b mitted for approval. This approval was granted in June 1990.

  Apparently,         the reason for the delay by the Council was that                      the Police were
  a w a i ti n g Home Offi c e guidelines re the cri te r i a for CCTV. Su c h advice was apparently

l^r. G. H. Mackrell
Secretary
Sh e f field Wednesday Football Club
Hillsborough
S H E F FIELD S6 1SW



Dear Mr. Mackrell

I am aware of the correspondence which has taken place between
y o urself and the Owlerton Community Group since the meeting
which took place in the Riverside Suite on 23rd January 1990.

I am very disappointed indeed that after months of prevarication,
the final outcome is that the promised toilet facilities at the
Leppings Lane end are not to be constructed at the present time.
This is despite the a cknowledgement by the club that major
p r oblems exist for local residents whose property is regularly
a b used by the fans.

Relegation to the Second Division does not change the problem
for residents, nor, according to press reports, does it change
the likely number of supporters expected to attend matches.
As a Sheffield Wednesday supporter myself, I hope th a t this is
indeed true.

W h i l st I obviously recognise that relegation to the Second
D i vision mus t have financial consequences for the Club, I do feel
that it is very unfortunate that whilst contracts for particular
players have not, over recent times, taken account of the success
or otherwise of the Club, their relative placing in the Football
League immediately affects the C l u b ’s ability to provide essential
facilities.

I believe that these amenities are necessary not only to protect
local residents but also on two other counts:   firstly the
c onvenience and well-being of the fans attending the ground,
and secondly on basic environmental health grounds.

I am therefore formally asking, as MP for the area, that you
r econs i d e r the decision so that local people should not be the
losers for the Club's lack of success last season.
I do hope that things improve, both inside and outside the
ground over the coming months so that we can take pride in
Sheffield Wednesday, in all respects, in the coming years.

I look forward to hearing further from you on this matter.

Yours sincerely




DAVID BLUNKETT

                                  Dear Mr. Ashton,

                                  Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 (as amended)
                                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

                                  I refer to your letter of 3rd July, 1990 and to the meeting at
                                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club of the Safety of Sports Grounds
                                  Advisory Group which you attended on Monday, 30th July, 1990.

                                  For your information I have not yet received the list of works
                                  detailed on page 2 of your letter.  I am, therefore, only able to
                                  respond to your comments in more general terms.

                                  You raise a number of points in your letter which I feel may be
                                  summarised as follows

                                   (a) application of the Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds (the Green
                                       Guide) by The Sheffield City Council as certification authority to
                                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club;

                                  (b) specific works requested by the Council as certifying authority
                                      following the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster;

                                   (c) capacity reductions within the Stadium following the Interim and
                                       Final Taylor Reports;

                                   (d) cost to the Club of undertaking safety works;

                                   (e) operation of the new Football Licensing Authority.

                                  If I may deal with these matters in turn:-

                                   (a)           Application of Green Guide

                                  As you point out in your letter, the Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds
                                  issued by the Home Office is an attempt from a central, national base
                                  to offer guidance to local authorities when considering safety related
                                  matters at sports grounds.  It became clear to this Authority
                                  following the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster that if a Council departs
                                  from the Green Guide standard it must justify this.  I agree that the
                                  Guide can not uniformly be applied throughout the Country to football
                                  stadia and I would point to a number of instances where the Council
                                  has relaxed the Guide standards at your Stadium.  (Barrier layout;
North Stand ramps, etc.)*  I believe the Council has properly applied
the Guide to your Stadium, but you should bear in mind that when the
Council, through the Licensing Panel, is considering any proposal
affecting your Ground, the Club may attend at the Licensing Panel
hearing and make appropriate representations directly to Members of
the Council.

 (b)   Specific Ground Safety Works

I am aware of no request by the Council that falls into the category
of being "excessively bureaucratic".  Again, I would suggest that if
you have strong reservations about any request made by the Council
your Company Secretary, Mr.  Mackrell, should speak directly with the
City Solicitor’s Chief Licensing Officer, Mr.  Derricott, or attend
the appropriate Licensing Panel hearing.

(c) Capacity Reductions

I would refer you to Recommendations 7-10, 23, 32 and 33 of the Final
Report of Lord Justice Taylor.  Following the Hillsborough Disaster
and publication of the Interim Report, capacities at both football
clubs within the City were reviewed and new capacity figures set by
the Council in accordance with appropriate recommendations.

It is my understanding that the Home Office intend to incorporate the
Final Recommendations which affect spectator capacities at sports
stadia into the new Green Guide which is to be published, I believe,
some time in October of this year.    Capacity for the new football
season has, therefore, been calculated with direct reference to these
recommendations by your Cl ub ’s Consulting Engineers, Messrs.  Eastwood
& Partners.  Their capacity calculations will obviously be checked but
are likely to be incorporated into a new General Safety Certificate.
I believe further reductions in spectator capacity will follow as a
result of these calculations.

(d)    Cost of Safety Works to the Club

I fully understand and appreciate that in view of the C l u b ’s recent
relegation to the Second Division of the Football League, the Club
have lost revenue.  However, I feel that it would be a difficult and
dangerous road for the Council to follow if it were to trade off
spectator safety against cost.

I also realise that there are a number of much smaller clubs within
the Football League and the Second Division whose stadia do not
compare with that of Hillsborough.  If standards of safety at these
clubs fall below the standards required nationally I am sure the new
Football Licensing Authority will be swift to act to improve matters.

(e )   New Football Licensing Authority

I understand from the Home Office that a chairman has n ow been
appointed for this new licensing authority.  However, in practical
terms the Licensing Authority is unlikely to commence ground surveys
and visits to local authorities until well into the new Football
Season.  I have been given no indication by the Home Office as to how
this new authority will operate but if it is drawn up on the lines of
the Health and Safety Executive I would envisage that football clubs
and licensing authorities would have to justify departures from
national standards and their failure to impose high standards of
safety for spectators.
I hope that I have been able to answer some of your queries but
shouldyou require anything further, please do not hesitate to contact
the City Solicitor's Chief Licensing Officer, Mr.  Derricott, on
Sheffield (0742) 734087.

Yours sincerely,

          _____

 Should you wish to come prior to Saturday's match with Hull City we will be

       Dear Graham

       Thank you for your letter with          regard   to   your   invitation      to       visit
       Hillsborough on Saturday next.

       As you will appreciate, the Council has certain codes of practice with regard
       to acceptance of hospitality and w e , obviously, as public representatives,
       have to be careful about the way in which we operate and, are potentially
       seen to be influenced in our decisions by hospitality.

       In general terms, where I am invited to the Club and receive hospitality and
       a ticket to watch a game, then I am happy to accept that in my role as Leader
       of the Council and have done so in matches involving both Sheffield clubs in
       the last 2 or 3 years. On those occasions, I have appreciated the offer and
       have been only too pleased to accept it.

       However, on this occasion, the Council obviously has a direct statutory
       involvement in terms of the improvement works at Hillsborough, and I am also
       aware of correspondence which is being exchanged between officers of the
       Council and Joe Ashton concerning the nature and extent of the works which
       are being required.

       In these circumstances, I think therefore, it would be inappropriate for me
       to both come to the ground to look at works which are being carried out as
       part of the Council’s requirements and,       at the same time, to accept
       hospitality, particularly, bearing in mind that there        are still some
       substantial issues regarding future works which are being discussed between
       yourselves and the Council.

       Therefore, I hope you will understand that, while      in no way questioning your
       motives, it would not be appropriate for me            to accept  your offer of
       hospitality on this occasion, although, I will        be only too pleased to cone
       and look on Saturday at the works which have been     carried out in line with
                                   -   2   -




the safety requirements.     I am sure you will understand that, in such
matters, it is not simply a question of what is intended by the offerer but
how the public who look at these things may form views about the offer.

Therefore, if you could let me have details of an appropriate time for me   to
come and look at the facilities with you, I will be only too pleased to     do
so.

Yours sincerely

Dear Clive

PROVISION OF TOILET FACILITIES FOR FANS AT LEPPINGS LANE

I am enclosing copies of further correspondence between myself
and Joe Ashton concerning the above, about which I wrote to you
recently.

I should,|ae grateful if you could help sort this matter out so
that there is a very clear division of responsibility between
Sheffield Wednesday providing toilets for match days which will
remain closed otherwise, and public conveniences being provided
by the Council, say in conjunction with other developments in
the area at Beulah Road or in Hillsborough Park.

I would welcome a response from you on this matter.

Yours sincerely

Dear Joe

PROVISION OF TOILET FACILITIES AT LEPPINGS LANE
Thank you for writing to me about the above.    I have to say I
was very surprised that you had been asked to reply rather than
Graham Mackrell on behalf of the Club.    I am very pleased to
be able to talk to you about it, as a colleague, but I do not
think that it in any way reduces the responsibility of
Sheffield Wednesday tcJ deal with this issue themselves.

I am taking up with Clive Betts the question of provision for
the community in the way of generally available public
conveniences but high quality, clean provision, kept only for
match days by Sheffield Wednesday FC is both the responsibility
of the Club and a desirable contribution to treating fans in
the way all of us talked about when the Taylor Report was
published.

Whilst community facilities are not needed at the ground,
toilets for the fans attending and leaving the ground clearly
are.

I hope the excellent attendance of 23,000 last Saturday can be
kept up and will compensate for the Liverpool and Manchester
United matches you mentioned!

Yours sincerely

Dear David,


Graham Mackrell has asked me to reply to your letter about the need for
toilet facilities at Leppings Lane.


We have said that we will instal this amenity (even though I know of no

other league ground in the country which has one outside the stadium) but

unfortunately it will have to be part of the renewal of the Leppings Lane

area.


As you know all grounds will have to be all seater by 1994 and because the
Sheffield Town Hall and police are beig extraordinarily bureacratic abcut

segregation and safety at Hillsborough and Bramall Lane we cannot just build

anything ad hoc in the area.   They are demanding new turnstiles, new wall,
entrances, total segregation of standing supporters from those in the seats

(even though they are both supporting the same team) and other total nonsense

which has cost us £300,000 so far with another £300,000 yet to come.


That is to say nothing of a new stand roof which could be a million.

              «
Apart from the cash there is a matter of time.   There is work which can only

be done in the close season and I am afraid that the police insist that

safety must come before amenities.
In fact, seeing that it is a public convenience and could be used in the

middle of the week by people who d o n ’t attend matches perhaps we ought

to be asking the City Council to pay half the cost.


However as we will probably get far fewer spectators from away teams this

year such as Brighton or Oxford and" I suspect there will be half the
problems that o c c w w h e n Liverpoorl or Manchester United visit us.



Best wishes,

      You will be , no doubt, as pleased as I was to see that Lord
      Justice Taylor has accepted our football group's invitation
      to meet, although he cannot come until after 27 March.

      I am delighted that he has responded in this way and you will
      see from the attached copy of his letter that he is anxious
      not to be seen as necessarily au fait with all up-to-date
      developments. Nonetheless, I am sure that his presence would
      be enlightening.

      I have circulated this letter to our colleagues and now leave
      to you the choice of a date - or a series of dates - to offer
      to Lord Justice Taylor, so that we can finalise arrangements.

Dear Councillor Betts,

                  Re:       Incident at Ipswich Town v. Sheffield Wednesday
                               Barclay's League Division II match on
                                    Saturday, 25th August, 1990

      With reference to previous correspondence on this subject having now
received a full report on this incident I am now in a position to respond.

      It appears that the ground had been inspected by the local Safety Team
on a number of occasions during the summer and this culminated in a Safety
Certificate being issued on the 10th August, 1990.

      The Club complied fully with the terms of the Safety Certificate on
Saturday, 25th August, 1990, and there is no evidence to suggest that the
pen where the incident occurred was over capacity.

      Pre match intelligence from the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday and
the police at Sheffield indicated that a maximum of 3,500 supporters would
be travelling to the match, this included the 750 who had purchased stand
tickets that had been allocated to away supporters.

      On this basis, the Club and police planned accordingly, all available
turnstiles were open and a full compliment of stewards were on duty.

      Whilst there were some delays at the turnstiles it is significant to
note that all who arrived before 3.00 p.m. were in the ground before the
kick-off.


                                                                      -   1
                                                                          -




               All c orrespondence to b e a d d re ss e d to The Secretary. R egistered Office as above. R egistered in England 80612
                                    -2-


      Enquiries have been made regarding the reports of persons being
allowed to climb over the turnstiles and no evidence has come to light that
this was widespread. This has been viewed seriously by both the Club and
the police and observations are being kept on all turnstiles in this regard.

      Your informants have not been telephoned as it was considered that in
the light of the enquiries made it would be counter-productive.

      It has been accepted that the packing in the pen was not as good as it
could have been and that the siting of the advertising boards on the pitch
perimeter and the erection of the high wire mesh fence between the corner of
the pen and the home seating area, contributed to the problem by partially
obscuring the view of the pitch.

      This undoubtedly led to the surge forward once the advertising boards
were removed, resulting in the families who had positioned themselves in the
front of the terrace being put under pressure.

      I can appreciate the concern and apprehension of those caught up at
the front of the fence and I feel that the stewards and police officers did
an excellent job in responding to the incident when it became evident that
they were unccmfortable.

      It is a measure of this response that there were no injuries reported
and no person required first aid treatment.

      Not wishing to minimise the seriousness of the incident in the eyes of
those involved, I feel it must beborne in mind that this was the first
match of the season and it was an uncomfortably warm         day.

      Whilst there is no evidence to suggest that there has been gross
negligence on the part of the Club in providing for the safety of spectators
within their ground, that is not to say that valuable lessons have not been
learned by all concerned.

      A full investigation into the incident was immediately carried out by
the Local Authority Safety Team which has resulted in the Club carrying out
further improvements at the ground to increase safety and comfort of
spectators.
                                    -   3-



      These improvements cover many of the points you raised.

      In closing can I say that we view any incidents involving the safety
and comfort of our supporters very seriously and we will continue to monitor
the situation to ensure that there is no lessening of standards.

                              Yours sincerely




                                A. Sandford,
                              Chief Executive.

Dear Sir

There have been a number of letters over the past weeks regarding      the
closure of speedway and the future of the Owlerton Stadium.

First of all may I make it very clear that the City Council has no plans
to change the current situation at the Owlerton Stadium. The Stadium has
been on a lease to the Owlerton Sports Stadium Limited for a number of
years which has been renewable every seven years. It is the Company that
sublets the stadium to the various users - greyhounds, speedway, rugby
league and American football.

The current situation is that the seven years lease is up for renewal and,
contrary to our refusing a lease, negotiations are taking place to extend
that lease to at least 25 years in order to allow the Company to develop
the stadium and get a return on its investment. It really is, therefore,
unfortunate that the City Council is getting the blame for what is, in
fact, a sub lease agreement between the Owlerton Sports Stadium Limited
and the promoters of the Sheffield Tigers Speedway.

I too am bitterly disappointed to see the end of speedway in this manner
as I also attend the occasional speedway meeting, but I am helpless to
interfere in the delicate negotiations that are taking place between the
City Council’s Estates Officers and the advisers to the Company, as
clearly we must ensure that the City achieves an agreement that benefits
the ratepayer as well as the user.

YourS sincerely

SHEFFIELD
Sll I     I



Dear Ms

Councillor Betts has passed your   letter   of   21   February   regarding   the
Speedway to me for a reply.

First of all may I make it very clear that the City Council has no plans
to change the current situation at the Owlerton Stadium. The Stadium has
been on a lease to the Owlerton Stadium Company for a number of years
which has been renewable every seven years.     It is the Company that
sublets the stadium to the various users - greyhounds, speedway, rugby
league and American football.

The current situation is that the seven years lease is up for renewal and,
contrary to our refusing a lease, negotiations are taking place to extend
that lease to at least 25 years in order to allow the Company to develop
the stadium and get a return on its investment.It really is, therefore,
unfortunate that the City Council is getting the blame for what is, in
fact, a sub lease agreement between the Owlerton Stadium Company and the
promoters of the Sheffield Tigers Speedway.

Like yourself, I too am bitterlydisappointed to    see the end of speedway
in this manner as I also attend the occasional speedway meeting, but I am
helpless to interfere in the delicate negotiations that are taking place
between the City Council’s Estates Officers and the advisers to the
Company, as clearly we must ensure that the City achieves an agreement
that benefits the ratepayer as well as the user.

Yours sincerely

Owlerton Stadium

I refer to the memorandum dated 5th June, 1989, from the City Treasurer.

For a number of reasons, the whole questions of Owlerton Stadium is clearly
now coming to a head. For my part I have been attempting to discuss in more
detail with the Stadium Company’s Agents the way forward in respect of the
lease. As I am sure you appreciate the question of tenure is fundamental to
the Stadium's future.

I still hold the view that a lease for a term of 25 years is inappropriate,
and would not solve the current problems. If the principle of 50 years were
to be accepted I now believe that X have a solution, which in valuation
terms I can recommend.

If the City is to ensure the continued operation of the Stadium, a corporate
view must be agreed as a matter of urgency. I should be pleased to receive
your views and instructions at the earliest opportunity.

Please note that in the light of previous involvement, and the contents o f
the City Treasurer’s memorandum, I have copied this to Councillors Betts and
Price.

            John Morrell and I have been discussing the problems surrounding the future
            use of Owlerton Stadium. There would appear to be particular problems with
            whichever route we decide to go concerning the ultimate use of the Stadium
            site.

            The other point which we will need clearance on is the writing off of the
            Eagles loan. Whilst Recreation Committee have no objections they are not
            in a position to find the money from within their budget as this is not one
            of their priorities. The sum involved is of the order of £8,000.

            It would be very helpful if we could have a meeting to discuss the
            political objectives and I will ask Caroline to see if she can arrange a
            meeting with yourself, Deputy Leader, Chair of Finance, John Morrell,
            Rod Jones and myself.

              David Bownes and Frances Woodhead have had several conversations with Officers
              from the Recreation Department concerning this matter. It is obviously
              important that a corporate view is maintained upon this matter. I attach a
              copy memorandum detailing the contents of a recent conversation Mrs. Woodhead
              had with Mr. Morrell of the Recreation Department and a copy of a memorandum
              which was sent to Mr. Morrell following that discussion. If you wish to

Re: Safety of Sports Grounds - Owlerton Stadium

John Morrell telephoned from Recreation on the 13th September, 1989. He
said that Recreation were putting pressure on Owlerton Stadium to
re-introduce rugby at the ground. He wanted to know again what the
purpose of the meeting of the Advisory Group was tomorrow. I explained to
him that the Advisory Group had been sent away with a wide brief to
establish whether or not Owlerton Stadium was safe for the admission of
spectators. I said that I did not know how they were going to report.
They could say that it was entirely unsafe. They could say it was
entirely safe. Alternatively, they could say that it was safe for some
activities and not others. He wanted to know whether there would be any
justification for the decision and whether their reports were likely to
specify works which were required at the ground to improve it. I
confirmed that this was likely. He felt that this would be useful because
that would then give the City Council and Owlerton something to work to in
improving the ground.

            O W L E R T O N SPORTS STADIUM LEASE

            Further to our brief telephone conversation of M o n d a y 18 September, in connection
            with the above topic. Frances Wood h e a d ascertained from Jon Bauer that last
            Wednesday i.e. the 13 September, the Council had m a d e a verbal offer of the grant
            of a lease of 25 years at £35,000 a year rental with an inflation provision built
            in. The Club want 49 years at the s a m e rental and in addition there seems to be
            an argument as to w h o would have speedway and rugby league, with the Council
            wanting those and the Club equally wanting them.

            Apparently, M r Littlewood is going to put the proposals to the Board and is expected
            to c o m e back quickly.

            With regard to the Prohibition Notice, conversations with the Club’s Solicitor suggest
            that they will not be appealing but will concentrate on getting the work done,
            however, this is not borne/out by recent public statements by M r Littlewood as
            per the attached article.

Dear Sirs,

      We hereby acknowledge your letter of 5th September that arrived this morning .
toe would like to make the point that if Mr. Bownes had not kindly faxed a copy of
the letter through to us yesterday that it would have been impossible to give you a

       b)      We have been in touch with Chief Inspector Beal who advises us that policing
               is not required for greyhound racing, stock car racing and speedway.
               Policing however is required for Rugby matches and-they will only provide
               such policing if the Stadium is issued with a Safety Certificate.

     Geneial Manager:   J.»S. CARTER


                                                                                 2
     Mrs. Woodhead.                                                                                                          7th September, 1989-


                        A random sample of the barriers and perimeter walls on the back straight
                        terrace have been load tested. Stress tests indicate that the barriers
                        and walls will safely withstand Category 'B* loading. The general condition
                        of the barrier is good.

                        The opening between the perimeter wall and rows of barriers satisfies
                        the requirement of the Green Guide in respect of the slope of the terrace,
                        However, the spacing of the individual barriers, along the rows does
                        not strictly comply with the suggested arrangement shown in Figure 3 of the
                        Green Guide. We would therefore expect the capacity of that particular
                        area of terrace to be reduced accordingly.

             d )        We have checked the turnstiles which are in use three nights a week and we
                        can average ten people per minute per turnstile. On this calculation with
                        ten turnstiles operating at the main entrance we would easily accommodate
                        the imposed limit within the Statutory Hour. For sports other than Rugby
                        League we can accommodate expected crowds within thirty minutes.

                        The turnstiles themselves are awaiting mechanical checks by Mayer Turnstiles.

             e)         The Interim Report requires us to have 1 first aid member per 1,000 of crowd
                        and we usually have at least double this for stock car racing.

             n          Our medical practitioner for motor sports is:-
                        Dr. Colin Shawcross,
                        400 Firth Park Road,
                        Sheffield, 5.
                        (Tel.No. 425908 )

                        He is retained and approved by the R.A.C. and is qualified to the highest
                        degree in advanced first aid.

                        He is located in the Private Box with the Duty Safety Officer throughout
                        the evening where he can observe the racing and where he can reach the
                        First Aid Room. He is contactable by telephone and the Duty Officer's radio.

                        As far as the 156 greyhound racing days are concerned we have been unable
                        to obtain the services of a Doctor as yet as racing clashes with surgery
                        hours. We are arranging with Para Medical Organisations that a member of
                        their staff is present at the First Aid Room at every meeting and would
                        ask the General Purposes Panel to consider our request that this measure
                        would suffice for the time bei n g .

OWLERTON STADIUM

Please could someone now map out to me a way forward on Owlerton Stadium.
I have never been quite certain why we were not prepared to give a 50 year
lease on Owlerton Stadium and it seems to me a 25 year lease had all the
disadvantages, in terms of not being able to use the stadium in the near
future for other purposes which we may have wished, and also we could not
get an agreement with the current operators.

It may well be now that with the requirements under the Licensing
Regulations the rental we are likely to get for the Stadium will have been
reduced.

One way or the other we have surely got to come to a conclusion on the
matter fairly soon as, until we get the question of the lease sorted out,
we are not likely to get any development work and the Stadium is simply
going to stay there in a derelict condition.

If we want to move to get the stadium back for other alternative purposes
then surely we should have a plan to achieve that, rather than muddling
along as at present.

I am also very unhappy that so far we do not appear to be exchanging things
in writing with Owlerton Stadium, and in terms of an offer and making it
verbally.   I am not sure either why Recreation Officers are making offers,
when surely that is the job of the Property Services Department who ought
to be leading very clearly on this matter and advising Members on it.

        Re:   Owlerton Stadium

        I refer to your memorandum of 5th October to the Assistant Director of
        Property Services.

        I thought you may be interested to know that the occupiers of the stadium have
        now put forward proposals for a phased re-opening starting with the Panarama
        Room.  This is on the basis that the works specified in the Prohibition Order
        are carried out. The matter is to be referred to the General Purposes Panel
        for consideration at a meeting on the 13th October, 1989.

                         Dear Councillor Betts,

                         OWLERTON - PROGRESS

                         A meeting was held on the 8th November to review                    progress     in
                         clarifying options in relation to Owlerton Stadium.

                         The four options which are currently the subject of consideration are
                         listed below.

                         1.     Leave the Stadium completely alone

                                This would involve agreeing a long lease of 25 or 50 years and
                                allowing current use to proceed.

                                In the light of the considerable interest in releasing the land
                                upon which the Stadium is built, (and parcels of land adjacent to
                                the Stadium), for industrial use, it does not appear at this
                                stage to be an attractive option.
                                                      ....
                         2.     Relocation of____________________

                                There are a number of ways in which this could be pursued but a
                                substantial compensation figure to do with relocation and
                                re-establishment of the facility will inevitably accrue. It may
                                be that this figure is in the order of a third to half a million
                                pounds.

                                Clearly the variations range from a local relocation through
                                relocation in another part of the City and onto relocation
                                outside the City perhaps in Doncaster.

                                Lease Reiiegal   ;

                                An interesting option which has emerged in discussion is that of
                                renewing the lease but including in the renewal a clause to
                                vacate without compensation at the end of the lease period.
                                Current discussion is exploring the potential for this option

        stated above.                            DIRECTORATE                                                   AG2ASa
     with the Stadium Company with a view to determining a lease
     period which would be acceptable to them of 7 years or less.

     This would given an opportunity for a local strategy for
     industrial land to develop and to begin to be implemented and at
     such time as the Stadium land is released, this could then also
     be drawn into the developing strategy and emerging industrial
     land stock evident on the ground.

4.   Relocation within immediate site proximity

     Relocation on an adjacent site which has an industrial potential
     appears to give no real benefit and will only serve to create
     considerable relocation expenses for the Authority

The second and third options listed above are to be explored in more
detail with the Stadium Company at a meeting this week to be conducted
by John Goodrich.

It was agreed that a planning condition would be introduced in
relation to the adjacent development, (Nurdin & Peacock on the former
Daniel Doncaster's site) going before Planning Committee next month to
ensure that a potential route for vehicular traffic is protected
through the site to allow for a future road crossing the Don giving
access to the land currently held by C.E.G.B.

Such a proposal has not been considered in any detail, but it is
currently recognised that this may well be a requisite facilitating
measure to enable future industrial development in the area.

DEED also recorded that they are currently exploring use options with
Developers in relation to Owlerton.

A further brief progress meeting will be held on the 22nd November.


Yours sincerely,




Director

            DE DESIGNATION OF OWLERTON STADIUM

            Following our conversation the other day about Owlerton Stadium applying
            to be de designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds legislation, I
            would be grateful if you could draft out for me some basic information
            about how the law operates in such cases.

            I also spoke to you and you agreed to provide some information to
            David Blunkett about which he could then table a Parliamentary question.

            Quite frankly the idea of Owlerton Stadium with all its faults applying
            for de designation because it will have a capacity under 10,000 and then
            proceeding to allow several thousand spectators in to a ground which we
            would not be happy with if it were de designated fills me with extreme
            concern. The reality surely is that if there are only 5,000 people
            there and the ground is not safe then those people are potentially at
            risk.

            If the information could be provided to David I would presume that he
            could ask the appropriate questions and try and get from the Government
            what exactly they would advise a local authority to do who believe that
            a ground is potentially unsafe but may not have the powers under the
            Safety of Sports Grounds legislation to operate to require the owners to
            undertake the necessary work.

OWLERTON STADIUM - SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS

I write merely to confirm the brief discussion you and I had the other day
following my meeting with the Leader on this and other matters, namely that
he asked that we draft, for David Blunkett, a parliamentary question to be
asked of the Minister for Sport, concerning the issue of designation and in
particular asking him the following matters

    1.   Whether there were steps in hand to designate further sports
         stadia or grounds other than those that have a capacity for 10,000
         or more, given that a large number of rugby grounds throughout the
         country currently remain undesignated and that it seems axiomatic
         to have one set of standards for crowds safety etc for 10,000
         people and not to apply the same standards to say 2,000 or 3,000
         or 4,000.

    2.   Could the Minister categorically state that on no occasion would
         he allow an organisation to avoid what could otherwise be quite
         onerous obligations under Safety of Sports Grounds requirements by
         the simple expedient of applying to have a ground undesignated on
         the basis that it had taken steps to physically alter the ground
         to reduce this capacity from 10,000 to say 9,500.


If you   are   in any doubt at all as to what is required then please let me
know.

           With reference     to your query of the 25 September, I suppose the answer to your
           question is that   w e do, on occasions, in the interest of urgency communicate offers

Dear Mr. Bates,

FOOTBALL

Thank you for your further letter dated 6 September, which I received on       the
11 September.

I can assure you my reply was not intended to offend and that the conclusions
to which you refer in your letter are incorrect. Indeed, the reply which you
received was a standard acknowledgment which my secretary sends out to all
external enquiries and letters as a matter of courtesy.    Perhaps you wi.ll
understand    that with a postbag of around 3,000 external pieces          of
correspondence a year, it is not possible to reply to everyone immediately
and fully. The letter which was sent to you is merely a holding reply until
I am able to respond more fully.

However, Ican inform you that, along with many other letters I    received on
the same     subject,   a copy of your letter   was sent to SheffieldWednesdayand
the Licensing Authority for their comments.

I will write to you     in more detail   when   I   have   received   areply   tomy
enquiries.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Sandford,

Thank you for your acknowledgement of my letter to        you   concerning   the
Ipswich Town versus Sheffield Wednesday football match.

I am now enclosing further information and evidence I have received from a
number of individuals which I hope will aid your investigations.

In my previous letter to you I referred to a number of people who had
telephoned me to pass on information about the way in which they had to climb
over turnstiles to get into the ground. This obviously opens up the strong
possibility that those individuals were not formally counted as part of the
crowd calculation for that area of the ground.      Unfortunately, I cannot
provide the name of one person who informed me that her nephew was passed
over the turnstile for a charge of £3.50 and who claims that other people
were encouraged to do the same. I can, however, give you, as set out below,
the names of four people who have contacted me who are all adults and all
climbed over the turnstile, paying the full £5.50, but had to climb over as
they were told by the gateman that the turnstile was stuck and could not be
used. I am sure this matter is something you would wish to investigate.




I   also enclose copies of correspondence I have received from other
supporters, which generally describe the totally inadequate arrangements
which they experienced. Throughout the comments I have received from other
supporters and also my own personal observations there appears to have been a
complete lack of any attempt to control the situation by either the Police or
                                    -   2   -




Club Stewards. It was not apparent who was responsible for crowd control if,
indeed, anybody was.     This is not simply a comment about the way the
overcrowding and the spillage of spectators on the pitch was coped with, but
about the whole matter of the direction of supporters to appropriate
turnstiles, the direction of them once they entered the ground and any
attempt to control and prevent overcrowding occurring.     I am sure you will
find this correspondence of interest.

I have also had a conversation with the Chairman of the Sheffield Wednesday
London Supporters’ Association. I enclose a copy of a letter he has written
to "The Times".   Mr. Kerrich indicated to me the problems he had in buying
tickets for seats for the game. He was effectively told by the Police on
duty that if he was found to be a Sheffield Wednesday supporter they would
ensure he would be ejected from the ground. Therefore, in order to obtain
seats, Mr. Kerrich had to pretend that he was not a Sheffield Wednesday
supporter, which he was able to do as he lives in London at present.
Nevertheless, his comments that the area of the ground where he sat was more
than two-thirds full with Sheffield Wednesday supporters seems to indicate,
again, a major problem in estimating the number of Wednesday supporters who
were going to the game and having any flexibility of arrangements to cope
with that number.

If I acquire any further evidence, I will ensure this is passed on to you     as
well.

I look forward to your eventual response on the action you intend to take.

Yours sincerely,

                   letter of the 29th August.   I am asking
our Security Adviser, who is a former Assistant Chief
Constable, to look into the matters which you raise and
clearly he will need to be in touch with people at the Ipswich
end.   I will write to you again when I have had a full report
from him.

I am most grateful to you for drawing these matters to our
attention so that they can be fully investigated and if
necessary, corrective action taken.

11 September 1990



Mr. A. Sandford
Chief Executive
Football League

FY8 1JG



Dear Mr. Sandford,

Thank you for your acknowledgement of my letter to        you   concerning   the
Ipswich Town versus Sheffield Wednesday football match.

I am now enclosing further information and evidence I have received from a
number of individuals which I hope will aid your investigations.

In my previous letter to you I referred to a number of people who had
telephoned me to pass on information about the way in which they had to climb
over turnstiles to get into the ground. This obviously opens up the strong
possibility that those individuals were not formally counted as part of the
crowd calculation for that area of the ground.      Unfortunately, I cannot
provide the name of one person who informed me that her nephew was passed
over the turnstile for a charge of £3.50 and who claims that other people
were encouraged to do the same. I can, however, give you, as set out below,
the names of four people who have contacted me who are all adults and all
climbed over the turnstile, paying the full £5.50, but had to climb over as
they were told by the gateman that the turnstile was stuck and could not be
used. I am sure this matter is something you would wish to investigate.

I   also enclose copies of correspondence I have received from other
supporters, which generally describe the totally inadequate arrangements
which they experienced. Throughout the comments I have received from other
supporters and also my own personal observations there appears to have been a
complete lack of any attempt to control the situation by either the Police or
Club Stewards. It was not apparent who was responsible for crowd control if,
indeed, anybody was.     This is not simply a comment about the way the
overcrowding and the spillage of spectators on the pitch was coped with, but
about the whole matter of the direction of supporters to appropriate
turnstiles, the direction of them once they entered the ground and any
                                    -   2 -




attempt to control and prevent overcrowding occurring.     I am sure you will
find this correspondence of interest.

I have also had a conversation with the Chairman of the Sheffield Wednesday
London Supporters’ Association. I enclose a copy of a letter he has written
to "The Times".   Mr. Kerrich indicated to me the problems he had in buying
tickets for seats for the game. He was effectively told by the Police on
duty that if he was found to be a Sheffield Wednesday supporter they would
ensure he would be ejected from the ground. Therefore, in order to obtain
seats, Mr. Kerrich had to pretend that he was not a Sheffield Wednesday
supporter, which he was able to do as he lives in London at present.
Nevertheless, his comments that the area of the ground where he sat was more
than two-thirds full with Sheffield Wednesday supporters seems to indicate,
again, a major problem in estimating the number of Wednesday supporters who
were going to the game and having any flexibility of arrangements to cope
with that number.

If I acquire any further evidence, I will ensure this is passed on to you    as
well.

I look forward to your eventual response on the action you intend to take.

Yours sincerely,




C. J. C. BETTS

IPlay was not
 disturbed
 F r o m   M   r J .A .A . K e r r ic h   ,

     Sir, Louise Taylor reports (Au­
     gust 27): “The most serious
     disturbance was at Ipswich
     Town, where dozens of Sheffield
     Wednesday supporters scaled
     the fencing . . There was no
     disturbance and scaling implies
i a stockade rather than the low
| fence there was. -           .
| The facts are these. Due to the
i arrival o f substantially niofe
 j Sheffield Wednesday supporters
 I than had been expected, the
  i standing areas which had been
     allocated to them were in­
     sufficient to hold the numbers
     involved. This situation was not
     improved by the police policy of
     trying to prevent Wednesday
     supporters from buying tickets
     for the seating except in the
     inadequate area provided.
   ! I know this since it was with
     the greatest difficulty that I was
     able to purchase seat tickets for
     my group of friends. Indeed I
     was told that if we and anyone
     else in the stand were found to
     be Wednesday supporters we
      would be put out. As two thirds
     of the spectators in that part of
     the stand were Wednesday
      supporters, it was fortunate that
      the police did not follow their
      policy, as then there might well
      have been a disturbance.
         When the police realised that
      standing pens were dangerously
      full they told a number of
      Wednesday fans to get out on to
      the edge of the pitch. This they
      did, either by passing through
      the gales or by climbing the low
      fence. At no time did the fans
      encroach on the playing area
      and play was never held up. The
      fans were moved in small
      groups to available space else­
      where in the ground without any
      trouble. At all times the fans
      were cheerful and well behaved
      and so far as I am aware there
      were no arrests,
    iYours sincerely,
    1J.A.A. KERRICH,

        Dear Mr Sandford

        I am writing with regard to an incident at the Ipswich Town versus                 Sheffield
        Wednesday Football Match at Portman Road on Saturday 25th August.

        In m y j i e w the incident could have led to serious injury or worse, and I am
        requesting that the Football League institute an inquiry into it.

        If I could inform you of the situation as I personally saw it. I arrived at
        the ground at approximately 2.50 pm and queued for a short while to get in.
         e ore queuing I asked if there were any seat tickets available for the game
        and was informed that they had all been sold.

                                                              visiting   nearest entra™*

        congregated. There appeared to be a number of pens      at that end and theone I
        was in was the pen at the c o m e r of the ground.

        On getting to the end of the entrance passageway it        became clear        that     the

       corner                                “e tried to             “ >* “P    tie

       that you could not properly see a quarter of the pitch at the far end of the
       ground. Nevertheless, there was still very little room in this . area.   We

       led to the crowd surging forward to the front of the pen. This was a
                    exPer^ence Particularly bearing in mind the        memories   of
       Hillsborough which many of us have. There were young children at the front
       and I was particularly concerned about their situation.       I? personal!^

In relation to the capacity, how many people where actually allowed into the
ground?   Was that number, which is recorded in the official records, the
actual number, or were people climbing over the turnstiles, for whatever
reason and, therefore, the number calculated at the entrances was not the
actual number who were in the ground?

In terms of crowd control andcrowd safety who wasresponsible       at   Ipswich
Town Football Club for crowd control?. Is it the police, or is it the Club’s
stewards? How many club stewards and police were actually on duty at that
end of the ground, and what was their respective responsibilities?    Why where
there no Club stewards visible to do any directing?      Why were the    police
standing .there refusing to take any action at the beginning of the game, and
initially refusing requests to open the gates when the crowds distress became
evident?

As you will appreciate, I am extremely concerned about the whole of this
matter, and I think we were very fortunate indeed that a more serious
accident did not occur.      The fact that we were fortunate on this occasion
should not leave us to believe that we will always be fortunate at this
ground, or any other ground, when incidents of this kind occur. What we
ought to have done by now is to have learnt the lessons from Hillsborough
that Taylor so clearly spelled out for us.          I don’t believe that the
situation at Ipswich reflected this to be the case and, therefore, I request
an inquiry into what happened, with the hope that it will not be repeated
here, or anywhere else, in the future.

With regard to further information that has come to me, I understand that
Leeds United supporters have telephoned the local radio station in Sheffield
and have indicated that there  was a similar incident   last year when Leeds
United played at Portman Road  and they had exactly the same problems. Was an
investigation carried out into that incident, and what steps were learnt from
that?

I do believe the Football League has to carry out this inquiry as all the
other parties obviously have some vested interest in ensuring that they are
found to be faultless in what happened. If no inquiry is conducted, and the
incident is repeated at a future game, except with more serious consequences
for the individuals concerned, then I do believe there will be a heavy burden
of responsibility on the Football League for failing to carry out what I now
believe is their duty.

I look forward to your reply.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Rose
I am writing to you on behalf of the Suffolk and North Essex
Football Supporters Association, concerning the events which
occurred at the match against Sheffield Wednesday on
25th August 1990.
We have absolutely no criticism to make regarding the handling
of the incident by the club and the police. On the contrary, we
believe the incident was handled very well and the decision to
m ove many of the Sheffield Wednesday supporters into the sparsely
occupied Portman Stand seats was definitely in the interest of
all concerned.
M any of our F.S.A branch members are regular away supporters
of Ipswich Town Football Club and therefore we are keen to insure
the safety and comfort of away supporters in general. As a
result, our main aim is to prevent a re-occurence of these
events at Portman Road.
W e are pleased to note that the club has already taken measures
to avoid a re-occurence, namely to refuse admission to the North
Stand to children under 13 and to adjust the location of
advertisement boards which can obscure the view of youngsters.
Following discussions at our branch meeting on 30th August, we
do, however, feel that there are other factors which could be
reviewed in addition.
In particular, we would question the necessity of the high
fencing that separates the two away support pens. If it is
absolutely necessary to maintain the position of this fence,
perhaps its height could be lowered sufficiently to allow
spectators an unobscured view of the pitch from all areas of the
enclosure.
We are also keen to ensure that adequate seating is made
available (at a reasonable price) for away supporters,
particularly supporters of clubs which attract a large following,
and as an alternative for family members who will no longer be
able to stand at the terrace.

We would be very pleased to meet you to discuss our proposals
and look forward to receive a response at the above address.

Yours sincerely

               TH E chairman of Ipswich Town supporters’ club has wel­
               comed the banning of children from one of the Portmari
               Road stands.
                  Youngsters aged 13 or under were last week barred from the
               North Stand by Suffolk County Council’s safety committee
               following § four-hour meeting.                -                -
                  It was called after hundreds of Sheffield Wednesday fans
               spilled on to the pitch to avoid being crushed at Ipswich
               Town’s opening match of the season,
                   “ I think it is a sensible idea. It is a reasonable decision to
                come to,” said Mr. Philip Houseley,. chairman of the sup­
                porters’ club.                                          .
                   “ Children always go to the front because of their size, so
                they are able to see. They will always have problems if there is
                a surge.”
                   Mr. Houseley also called for a. family visitors’ enclosure to
                be provided for away supporters.
                   The move to ban youngsters from the North Stand came
                amid calls for an official inquiry into police handling of crowd
                problems at Town’s opening match.                               ■
                   Fans involved in the crush in the North Stand visitors
                 enclosure went on to the pitch after the crowd surged forward.
                    Mr. Houseley criticised parents who take young children to
                 football matches, claiming he had seen children as young as
                 two and three coming out of the ground.
                    As a result of the Taylor Report, published following the
                 Hillsborough disaster, all first and second division clubs must
                 have all-seater stadiums by 1994.
                    However, Mr. Houseley said he was not in favour because
                 many fans preferred to stand to enjoy the atmosphere. .
                    It would take longer for all-seater stands to be evacuated
                 and would be more difficult for police to get into the
                 stand.

            Dear C 11r Betts
            As you will be aware the Inquests into the deaths of the 95 people
            who died at Hillsborough Stadium on 15th April 1989, have now
            concluded. I cannot let this moment pass without writing you a
            note to thank you and through you all the Councillors, for your
            generosity and help in making the facilities of the Council
            Chamber available to me for what has proved to be a very lengthy
            period of time. I am sure that this must have created a considerable
            amount of inconvenience and I very much appreciate what you have
            done.
            I would be most grateful if you could ensure that the Councillors
            know how much I appreciate their action.
            Yours              erely

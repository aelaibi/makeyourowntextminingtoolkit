Dear     Pro f e s s o r Maunder

Just a     short note     to say  how much I have enjoyed being part of
your W o r k i n g Party on the Taylor  Inqu i r y  and    as  e v e r , I have
learnt     muc h    from  our  discussions,    find i n g them e n joyable and
stimulating.

As you know, as a de s i g n engineer, I                 do have      r e s e r v a t i o n s as to
the p r a c t i c a l i t y of i n s isting on a l l - s e a t e r stands, both in terms
of cost and user requirements.                This was           the purpose          of my hand
w r i t t e n note to you, and I no w enclose a t y p e w r i t t e n copy of that
note so that you can a c t u a l l y read w hat I am trying to say!

I am also enc l o s i n g for your interest what        I consider  to be two
of  the   best    papers     written  by  eng i n e e r s on aspects of crowd
safety, d ated F e b ruary 1933 and Janu a r y 1928 respectively.

Once again, my thanks for i n v iting me to contribute.                                                                                       Please pass
my   thanks   also   to   Jonathan     Sweet  for  his                                                                                       support  and
contribution.

RE M I N U T E 35 (ii) OF 28 N O V E M B E R
A L L SEATER STADIA


I agreed       I would      try and write down             s o m e t h i n g further.

At the recent m e e t i n g of               the   ISE    Appraisal           of  Sports Grounds
Committee, it             was agreed that s t a n d i n g terraces, at a d e n s i t y of
54 p e r s o n s / 1 0 m 2 c o m p l y i n g  in   resp e c t      of   gradient, conditions,
crush      barr i e r      arrangement           and   s t r e n g t h i n d icated in the Green
p u i d e were NOT i n h e r e n t l y unsafe.

Normal          seat i n g    in      the       UK    achieves            a     density      of  around 20
p e r s o n s / l O m 2, has      wide enough             rows to           p r e v e n t domino effect of
even p a s s i o n a t e      crowds, and             with g a n g w a y s          and radials provides
for r e a s o n a b l y     c o m f o r t a b l e v i e w i n g even at the higher tiers.                To
get v i e w i n g d i s t a n c e s down these hi g h e r slop i n g tiers have to get
quite steep             in order          to b r i n g      the sig h t l i n e down to a cceptable
d i s t a n c e s and retain a              v i e w over        the w hole            field of   play.   My
p oint has           always been            that at         these d e n s i t i e s        of seating only
multi-tiered               'new'          concrete            stands              can      achieve    these
'comfortable' v i e w i n g               standards, and these (viz Chelsea etc) are
c ostly struc t u r e s r e q u i r i n g ver y               s u b s t a n t i a l investment     if they
are to be d e s i g n e d to the 'correct' standards.

In      the     UK  and  elsewhere,   the s o l u t i o n has been to retain the
s t a nding terrace,      properly organised        and d e s i g n e d  to the Green
G uide        requirements.    In   Europe,     for      grou n d s up to 15-20,000
c a p a c i t y single tiers of all seated      stands have           become the nor m
wit h       higher   capacity  grounds   adopting         hig h e r raking tiers at
lower seating densities.

The adv a n t a g e       of the      single low          r a k i n g tier         is that 'bleecher
type'         prec a s t   step p e d    seat i n g     can       be      used, with minimal row
width,          achieving     densities            in   35      p e r s o n / 1 0 m 2 ranges   (as I
u n d e r s t a n d it).     These       are safe for an o r d e r l y audience whe n in
the m a i n pe rsons re m a i n seated.                   At      peak        viewing    areas where
crowd a c t i v i t y      is high, it seems to me that there is a danger of
e v e ryone s t a n d i n g on 'tip toe' on their b l e e c h e r s leading with o u t
the p r e s e n c e      of crush      b a r r i e r s to     p o t e n t i a l domino collapse in
the crowd.           In    such circumstances,                I feel          that a well ordered
s te w a r d e d s t a nding   terrace    (which  incidentally        some  regular
f o o tball s upporters        favour I    gather) has  g r e a t e r potential for
safe containment.

Perhaps you could at best check this 'minority' view with someone
else, since the inference of n e w all seater stands is that higher
seat i n g d e n s i t i e s will be sought. T hank you.

           TECHNICAL WORKING PARTY SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES


Introduction

1.   In the review of the technical aspects of safety, the
Technical Working Party considered the content and the
presentation of the Green Guide in detail.  The principal
conclusions of the review and the consequent recommendations are
contained in the Working Party Report to the Inquiry, but in view
of the amount of material gathered in the course of the work
detailed suggestions for the revision of the Green Guide are
assembled in this separate document as a contribution to any
revised edition.

2.   The Final Report may refer to the relationship between the
Green Guide and the Safety Certificate and to the view that the
local authority should follow the Green Guide criteria in
assessing the mandatory requirements for a particular ground.
Variation from the figures then included in the Safety
Certificate would only be permitted by formal revision.

3.   Paragraph 3 of the Report of the Technical Working Party
already records that:

     "3.  It considers that a revised issue of the Green Guide
     should form the basis on which a designated ground or stand
     is certified by the certifying authority, and recommends
     that any departures from the guidance or Technical
     provisions that may arise from local circumstances should be
     fully defined and should be subject to approval in writing
     by the certifying authority".

4.   The Technical Working Party believes that a revised edition
of the Green Guide should incorporate these recommendations
prominently in the introduction.  A high degree of definition in
the guidance offered will be required if ambiguity is to be
avoided.

                Non-technical Aspects

            5.   Non-technical aspocts of the Green Guide lay outside the
            Technical Working Party's terms of reference, but they interact
            closely    with   the   physical   characteristics    of    grounds.
            Responsibilities    for  the   improvement   of    structures    and
            communications at- grounds, and for the conduct of inspections and
            tests, including those accepted from the Technical Working Party's
            Report, should be made clear in the Green Guide.          Particular
            attention should be drawn to the management and training of those
            carrying out the work, to the monitoring of procedures, and to the
            recording o£ results.

            6.   Reference to the required degree of competence of those
            responsible for carrying out the technical work should be included
            in the Creen Guide. An example from the Pressure Systems code of
            Practice is

                    "3.1.      The 'competent person'    (whether a body or an
                     individual) should have such practical and        theoretical
                     knowledge and actual experience of the type of system which
                     is to be examined as will enable defects or weaknesses, which
                     it is the purpose of the examination to discover,      to be
                     detected and their importance in relation to the intergrity
                     and safety of the system to be assessed.”

                 A reference to "the recommending of corrective measures" might
            be added to appropriate specifications.________

            7.      Layout (notes only)

                    Observations include:

                    (i)      Coordinate overlaps in Chapters 3,4,9, Annex C,
                    (ii)     includea list or tabulation of all inspections and
                             tests,
                    (iii)    make     separate chapter on temporary stands     or
                             structures,
                    (iv)     include   a new chapter on provisions for disabled
                             spectators, and
                    (v)      provide   a bibliography (at least for use by Home
                             Office).


                 The remaining sections should include the details that have
            been agreed.    Their sequence could be based on either the Creen
            Guide (starting with Chapter 4 and omitting Chapters 14 and 15), or
            on the Technical Working Party recommendations.

                         As co format, the minimum would appear to be a reference list
                    as in the FAX of 19th January (possibly with the agreed elements
                    marked), and the maximum a selective and re written list.

                          For the following notes, reference should be made to the index
                     of Technical Working Party's papers and to the Technical Working
                     Party Report.


                     CHAPTER 3.   GR n KRAI. FABRIC AND STRUCTURAL MATTERS


                          The chapter should aim to include (i) a broad introduction to
                     the requirements for structures, but without numerical detail, (ii)
                     reference to later chapters of the Green Guide where details are to
                     be found, and (iii) reference to other documents such as the SCICON
                     report and the TSE reports.

                          Consideration should be given to a separate chapter           on
                     lighting, electrical supplies and computer-based equipment.


                     CHAPTER 4.   INSPECTIONS AND TESTS

                          A major re-write should be undertaken along the lines of the
                     Technical Working Party Report paragraph 40. if it is decided to
                     separate details of the structural testing of crush barriers, for
                     example, or Lhe effectiveness of communication systems . from the
                     text u f the chapter, clear references should be given.

                          It is important to outline the purposes of inspections and
                     tests and it is vital to emphasize that accurate and certified
                     records of all such procedures must be kept.

                          A   complete tabulation of the minimum       requirements     of
                     inspection and test, including frequencies, should be provided.

                  CHAPTER 5      INGRESS

                     If separate chapters on ingress and egress are retained they
                 should be well co-ordinated with each other. They should also be
                 well co-ordinated with the chapters on stairways and. ramps and oil
                 means of escape from fire.

                      Prominence should be given to the importance of each ground
                 having a fully documented networked plan delineating all aspects of
                 ingress and egress not only within the ground but also at its
                 approaches.   For both ingress and egress, the plan should take
                 account of the distribution of entrances and exit routes so as to
                 encourage even packing and dispersed departures.

                     The principal conclusions and recommendations on ingress are
                given in paragraph 33 and recommendation 12 of the Technical
                Working Party Report. They incorporate the proposals contained in
                Mr. Bush's paper of 30th October, 1989,


                  CHAPTER 6      EGRESS

                      The principal conclusions are recorded in minutes 10 - 17 of
                 WP 89 (M) 3, derived from discussion on 7th November 1989 of Mr.
                 Bush's paper on egress. Detailed proposals for improvements in the
                 arrangement and the clarity of the text are made in these
                 documents, including co-ordination of material with other chapters,
                 as also noted above. It is recommended that particular attention
                 should be given to the paragraphs on funnelling and reservoir
                 areas, to which recommendation 13 of the Technical Working Party
                 Report also refers.

                                           CHAPTER 7     STAIRWAYS AND RAMPS




                           The Technical Working Party's conclusions are summarized in
                      paragraphs 19-27 of WP(89)M3 and in paragraphs 36-39 of the Report,
                      Reference   should also be made to Mr- Bush's paper          of....

                           Particular attention should be given to improving the clarity
                      of presentation in the text and to introducing more and better
                      illustrative diagrams. Reference to the spacing of handrails and
                      their extensions at the top and bottom of stairways should be
                      revised (recommendation 15 of the Technical Working Party Report.

                            The requirements for handrails, balustrades and barriers
                      serving different functions should be differentiated. Barriers are
                      required at exits to from ramps leading directly to the rear of
                      terraces.    More explicit guidance should be given to       those
                      handrails or other protective structures that separate a stairway
                      or ramp from a hazardous drop. Handrails should be provided to
                      assist, the channelling of flows through wide ramps.


                                    CHAPTKft 8      TERRACES AND VIEWING SLOPKS

                           A more positive approach should be adopted to the marking of
                      gangways.   Ml   gangways should be kept clear during events:
                      "discouragement from standing in them is not enough (see Professor
                      Maunder's and Mr. Stickley's notes on chapter 8).    The front-to-
                      back spacing of crush-barriers should be less on viewing slopes
                      than on terraces; a ratio of two-thirds is recommended.


                                   CHAPTER 9        CRUSH BARRIERS AND HANDRAILS


                           A complete rewrite     of this chapter and Appendix C      is
                      recommended. In view of the deficiencies in inspection and testing
                      that were exposed in Phase I of the Inquiry, it is imperative that
                      guidance should be clear and unambiguous. Reference should be made
                      to the lSE report "Appraisal of Sports Grounds" and to "Crush
                      Barrier Strengths and Spacings", Home Office, March 1973, both of
                      which contain a wealth of useful information.

                           The conclusions of   the TechnicalWorking Party   following
                      discussion of Dr. Nicholson's paper on Chapter 4 and 5 are
                      summarized   in paragraphs 13, 15-22 and 25-29 of        WP89(M)2;
                      paragraphs 2(iv) and 3 of WP89(M))3;     and paragraphs 15-18 of
                      WP89(M)4. A definitive summary is given in paragraphs 23-29 of the
                      Technical Working Party Report. Note that each barrier should be
                      tested at intervals of not more than four years and less         as
                      determined by inspection.

                           A model format prepared by Dr. Nicholson and Mr. Dickson ,
                      Inspection and Testing of Crush Barriers and Handrails",        is
                      attached.   it- emphasizes the importance of visual   inspections,
                      particularly where corrosion is visible or suspected calls for
                      certified records of inspection and tests, and sets out the best
                      practice of structural testing.


                               CHAPTER 10   ROOFED STANDS WITH SEATED ACCOMMODATION

                           The principal recommendation is that guidance on   temporary
                      structure should be transferred to a separate chapter (Technical
                      Working Party Report, recommendation 11).   See alsoMr, Bush's
                      paper of ?.2nd November, 1989.


                                            CHAPTER 11      FIRE SAFETY


                           Material in this chapter on evacuation should be co-ordinated
                      with chapter 6 on egress. The networked plan of entrances and
                      exits recommended above for each ground should include escape
                      routes in emergencies.     Full account should be taken of the
                      relationships between normal and emergency provisions in drawing up
                      evacuation plans.

                           Attention should be drawn to the importance of clear lines of
                      authority in determining the requirements for fire safety, as for
                      other requirements for safety.      The Technical Working     Party
                      considers that the certifying authority should be identified as the
                      responsible body (Technical Working Party Report paragraph 42).

                           Reference should be made to the four general documents
                      identified in the index accompanying these notes.  (North Yorkshire
                      County council paper, 1952 Fire Grading of Buildings, TSE paper,
                      Building Research Establishment Report by Professor Canter.

                                            CHAPTER 12      COMMUNICATIONS

                           A substantial expansion of the chapter is recommended in line
                      with paragraphs 44 and 45 and Recommendation 17 of the Technical
                      Working Party Report. See also Professor Maunder1s notes of 3rd
                      July (?) and 28th October, 1989 and Mr. Stickley's note of 16th
                      November, 1989.

                           Particular attention should be drawn to the         provision,
                      capacities, effectiveness and testing of equipment in the Police
                      Control Room, in the Club Communications Centre and in the hands of
                      police and stewards inside and outside the ground.  Secure means of
                      communication between turnstiles and the Police Control Hoorn are
                      essential to ensure that admittances to enclosures are limited
                      strictly to specified safe capacities.  This requirement should be
                      emphasized. Guidance should be given on the requirement of back-up
                      systems, and on special   ^ans    communicating via public address
                      systems   during emerge    as.   References to CCTV     should   be
                      strengthened.

                                               CHAPTER 14   CROWD CONTROL

                               The Working Party considered that the balance between safety
                          and crowd control presented in this chapter is unsatisfactory.
                          Guidance   on   safety should be     presented    more  positively.
                          Substantial redrafting is recommended, including co-ordination with
                          the succeeding chapter on Pitch Perimeter Fence/Wall.  Requirements
                          of safety and crowd control at the approaches to           grounds,
                          especially at turnstiles, should be incorporated.

                               WP89(M)4 paragraph 29 summarizes discussions based on the
                          paper by Mr. Bush and Mr. Carter, of 22nd November, 1989. It notes
                          two paragraphs of the Green Guide which gave particular concern.
                          The first is paragraph 206, which advocates internal sub-divisions
                          of terraces in the interests of crowd control. Such sub-divisions
                          present serious dangers. The paragraph should be revised in the
                          light of Hillsborough.     No sub-divisions should be permitted
                          without reliable means of counting the movement of spectators.

                                The second is paragraph 209, which states that "access to the
                          pitch    must   be made as difficult as       possible   in   normal
                          circumstances", followed by qualifications that the police should
                          have access from the pitch to the terraces and, lastly, that the
                          pitch should be used in serious emergencies.       The emphasis is
                          clearly on crowd control, and it is recommended that the paragraph
                          be rewritten with a substantially changed emphasis in favour of
                          safety;    inter alia, not only should the current reference to
                          spikes and barbed wire be removed, but spikes and barbed wire
                          should    be   expressly prohibited.    (Technical   Working   Party
                          Recommendation 6.)

                               Clear, prominent and unambiguous signs marking turnstiles,
                          other entrances, exits and routes to identified enclosures and
                          stands form an important aspect of crowd control, and should be
                          treated comprehensively in the Green Guide.


                                         CHAPTKR 15   PITCH PERIMETER FENCE/WALL

                               Paragraphs 17-22 and recommendations 5-7 of the Technical
                          Working Party Report set out the conclusions of the Technical
                          Working Party.   See also Dr. Nicholson's paper discussed on 2nd
                          November, 1989.

                               Attention should be drawn in the Green Guide to the general
                          principles of separation outlined in paragraphs 17 and 18 of the
                          Report. The Green Guide should also include recommendations on the
                          size, design and disposition of perimeter barriers.        It   is
                          imperative that exit gates or gaps providing emergency access to
                          the pitch should be defined for each ground such that they allow
                          evacuation of an enclosure within a prescribed time, taking into
                          account the capacity and the dimensions of the enclosure.

                         The   strength criteria and test procedures for crush barriers
                    and for    perimeter fences should be distinguished one from the
                    other.


                               CHAPTER 16           ESTIMATION OF SAFE GROUNDS CAPACITY

                         A comprehensive rewrite is recommended. A full summary of the
                    Technical Working Party's conclusions and recommendations is given
                    in its Report. See also the papers by Professor Maunder (31st
                    October, 1989) and by Mr. Stickley (16th November, 1989).

                         Calculations of the safe capacity of terraced enclosures and
                    viewing slopes depend on a large number of parameters. The Green
                    Guide should identify all parameters clearly. It should recommend
                    the procedure by means of which the capacity is to be estimated.
                    The procedure should be set out in a form that can readily be
                    followed,   preferably   as   a   simple   step-by-step  sequence,
                    characteristic numerical examples should be provided, and they
                    should be accompanied by explanatory notes.

                         In view of the move towards more seating accommodation, urgent
                    consideration should be given to recommended configurations and
                    allowable densities of seating.

                                               CHAPTER 17     RECOMMENDED FLOW RATES


                         The chapter should be co-ordinated with chapters 5,6 and 7.
                    It should be expanded to consider flow rates along complete ingress
                    and egress routes as well as through component parts.      Guidance
                    should be included on flow rates relevant to chapter 11 dealing
                    within emergenci evacuation.

                                                              ANNEX C

                         Revision of this annex should be considered in the                     light of
                    the foregoing notes on chapters 4 and 9.      See also                      WP89(M)4,
                    paragraphs 25-28.


                                                              ADDITIONS

                    1.    A separate   chapter               on provisions   for   disabled    spectators
                          should be included.

                    2.    A separate chapter on auxiliary power supplies, with special
                          reference to auxiliary lighting, should replace paragraphs
                           166-169 of the current Green Guide.     See also WP89(M)4,
                          paragraph 16.

                     3.   A bibliography for further reference should be considered.                   An
                          example prepared by Mr, Dickson is attached.

From 1115 hours       in position.         (_/

Noted Travellers Rest ~ closed.

The Gate Public House         - OPEN (side door to locals only).

We were directing       coa ches down C l a y w h e e 1s Ln and dur i ng the first few

hours the crowds were steady.           They were making their way to the

ground and no trouble was seen.

There were a lot of people         (maybe twenty in total) asking for           'The

S p o r t s m a n ’ which I did not know where   it was and there was a gradual

increase of people coming from the           ground side asking     ifany Pubs         were

open.      Some Liverpool     fans did get into The Gate Public House through

the side doors       (door men on duty).

All who enquired were told most Public Houses were closed for the day

but those who enquired still made their way away from the direction of

the ground and up Penistone Rd Nor^-fC^

The supporters"      train arrived          Wadsley Bridge at    1350 hours     (some

fifteen to twenty minutes earlier than e x p e c t e d ) .

About eight hundred to oiye thousand s u p p o r t e r s , who all made their way-

under separate e s c o V t   /own Leppings Ln to the ground.         This crowd was

orderly and I saw no incidents at all.            Little singing - well behaved

in g e n e r a l .

Traffic was now building up and it was noticed a lot of the spectators

were    carrying drink.      The time    now about 1410 hours.      Some were

drinking from f ou r pa/ks and others from          large bottles.

Pedestrian traffic/now was fairly heavy and a lot were sat on the
                                                                                   PAGE

walls drinking before making their way to the ground.

At    1415 hours, approximately,             instructions    received via radios to

close Leppings Ln to vehicular traffic - D O N E .

Coaches were still arriving but these were now parking on Halifax Rd

as Claywheels Ln was full.                 Very few cars.     Pedestrian traffic now

very heavy.            Obvious that some had no tickets as they were            in a group

asking for tickets.

The general           behaviour    1 would describe as good.       Some had been/were

drinking,          many were not.       By this time all making towards the g r o u n d .

Could hear over the radio of problems at Leppings Ln end and at a

certain time,           I believe after the match had started, an instruction

"ALL AVAILABLE OFFICERS TO THE G R O U N D 11.             My few Serials were soon

gathered together and we made our way to Leppings Ln side of the

ground.

On arrival           could see a large group of Police Officers and argument

taking      place with supporters.            I. thought^t+us was a Public Order

situation and I formed a cordon acrjyss^the turnstiles to keep

spectators away.              The turns              re closed but people were arguing

that they had tickets and were demanding entry.                    These were kept back

and it was some minutes                later when people were    leaving the ground,

directing abuse to the Police,                that    I realised something else was

drastically wrong.

I entered the ground itself behind the West Stand.                    A large number of

people were           injured,    some were obviously dead.       Others were   in a state

of shock.           People were tending to the injured.           After the initial

shock,      I remember giving first aid to a youth who had obvious                 internal

i n j u r i es .

I cannot           remember   if the    radio was working at this time ~ but I do not

recollect hearing any transmissions.

Together with another Officer,                I moved the    injured youth,   who was
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                SI 380

         conscious,     to the sterile area behind the West and South Stand.     I

         remember a doctor arriving and I said I wanted the injured

         prioritising.     This he did.     I noticed another doctor   certifying the

         dead.

         Initially,     the ambulances were slow.    They would find it difficult

         getting through traffic and pedestrians.

         One would arrive and the injured near the turnstiles would get on •••••

         although they were not the more urgent       cases.   This was eventually

         overcome and with more ambulances now arriving all the injured were

         r em ov e d.

         The dead were then removed and the Officer dealing with the dead taken

         with it.

                                                                    G Millett SIGNED

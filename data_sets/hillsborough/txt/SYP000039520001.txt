Dear Mr Jones,

Further to|              [letter to you of the 9th instant, I acknowledge
receipt of your two letters and fully understand the position as far as the
photographs are concerned.

No doubt when you have firm instructions after your enquiries are complete
as to what photographic material may be released you would be kind enough
to get in touch with me.

As   agreed with              n>n my latest Bulletin to members I asked that
if   people were still taking statements which related directly or indirectly
to   the position of people who died they should let me have them to forward
to   you to assist in the enquiries to the Coroner.

I have received such a statement of                      which gives some information
as to whereabouts of Philip Hammond.           I enclose a copy herewith.

All good wishes.

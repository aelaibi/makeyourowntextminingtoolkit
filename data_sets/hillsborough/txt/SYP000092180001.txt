                   On the walk        to the ground          I saw    police        officers     standing aro un d on

                   street     corners a tt em pt in g        to organise        s upporters and           checking     their

                   tickets.        I didn't         pay to much a t t e n t io n as we were           hurrying       to the

                   game.      I _r emember      seeing a couple          of fans drinking            from glasses

                   outside a pub but            they were not unruly.                 It was ge ne ra ll y a good

kicking       off.           It was about       this time       that   the       pen became                     very                        J

At about       1453 hours (1433) there was a mass iv e                               surge from behind us

w hi c h    propelled me forward and pinned me up against                                         the front

perimeter          fence       to a point       1 have m ar k ed 08 on the a tt ac h ed grid

plan.        (Ex No              ) (Ref No            ).     We   remained            in this                  position

for about          10— 15 minutes.             There was     no   let up in the                       pressure

behind me.              My dad get shouting at me to see                        if I was alright.                             He

  c o u l d n ’t help me as he was               pinned agai ns t          the fence                  himself.

He tried his best                he    could to console me,            I was          crying.                    I was

very frightened.                 The     pressure of the wall and fence against me

was    ho r r i f i c .

I could see             that    everyone ar ou nd me was            very f r ig ht en ed you                           could

see    it on their             faces.      I could hear         the fans screaming                             to get out but

the    police       in front          of the fence       just     told them to move                             back.

I heard my Dad shout                   to me to move        to the     left          into a corner where

there was a y outh helping y oungsters                          out of the               pen into                pen 5.        1 was

still       pinned           agai ns t the     fence but g r ad ua ll y the              pressure                eased a

little and          1        m a na g ed to escape into Pen 3 r with the help of the youth

I had seen earlier.                     I wa lk ed through the         gate of Pen 3 onto                               the

pitch.        I was          still    crying and very shaken               I a ch ed all                       over.     A Police

Officer       came           over     to me.    He was     very nice then             I heard Dad shout                            my

name       I saw him still              pinned up agai ns t       the fence.                     He       looked very

f rig h t e n e d and m an a ge d to hand me his glasses                     through the wire meshed

fence.

At this       point a P o l i c em a n m oved me back so that fans                  could jump out of

the    pens and onto             the track.       I lost sight         of my dad for a couple             of

minu t e s and the next             thing    I knew he was           beside me on the       pitch having

escaped out of the                pen.

We then       looked a ro un d for friends and event ua ll y sat down on the                          pitch

once we had found other members                      of our      party.       We were   both very

shaken and shocked.

I didn't          know    if anyone       had died but       I did know that t h er e ( w.ere fans

ser i o u s l y    injured.

My    injuries       consisted of bruising              to shoulders,          arms and    chest.     I

also    grazed my          leg jumping       out of the       pen.      1 never a t t e nd e d hospital

in S h e f f i e l d neither        did    I attend my own doctor.

I remember          seeing a man          I think    he was white,           he was wear in g a long

t rench type         coat,      and was     carrying what           looked    like a large sack

he was      thick        set    I saw him lean down beside an                 injured or dead

supporter a c t u al l y on the             pitch.      O ther      fans were    shouting at him

words     like,      thief and thug shortly after                    I saw two    police    officers

lead him away.                 I cannot    say if he stole anything,              but he    certainly

looked s u spicious and was                 not a t t em p ti n g    to assist    the   person   in any­

way. I e v en tu al ly          left the ground at about              1730 hours    (1730)    with my

father.

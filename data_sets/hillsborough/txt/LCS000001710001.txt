   RE :    Hillsborough Database - Information Required




     At the time of writing this memo approximately 600 clients have been entered
onto the database and a further 550 referrals are awaiting to be entered. Our
energies in the last two weeks have been concentrated on getting the system
established and trying to deal with the backlog of referrals.

     It is important that before too long we determine what information we
require out of the system and consider standard reports that could be provided
to District Offices and other local authorities. We need to demonstrate as
early as possible that information can be generated by the system.

     A note is attached which could perhaps be considered by the inter-agency
group.

INTRODUCTION:

     The database |in use in conjunction with the Hillsborough Helpline has
been provided by Kent County Council and was developed by them following
the Channel Ferry disaster (Herald of Free Enterprise).

     The database can provide details of persons affected by the disaster.
At the present time the level of information available varies, but in the
main it is restricted to details of the caller, the client, the nature of
the referral and the action taken.  In those instances where there is only
one contact to helpline, no further details can be obtained.  Where there
is further ongoing work there will clearly be an opportunity to obtain
further details about the client.

ADDITIONAL REPORTS:     i

     Consideration should be given to information needs which are not covered
by'the above.  Any additional reports identified would require adaptations to
the system by Kent County Council.  A listing by date of first contact may be
useful, an alphabetical list of the whole database would also seem to be an
obvious requirement.

     Clearly for the (database to be of use, the information on it must be
accessible. Access to the information must be in a controlled manner and
a procedure should be drafted for the processing of requests to the database.
Consideration could also be given to the provision of regular update print
outs to other Local Authorities/Agencies.

     I thought it would be useful if I set out arrangements that have now
been reached in relation to the staffing of the Database Team.

Computers Input:
                                                    *           1
     To date this has been covered by R.D.I. and Court and Residential.
         and              have generally supervised the day to day input of
data. Paul is on holiday for 2 weeks from 1st May, 1989.    v]           ] will
generally be responsible for the day to day running of the input team.   On
Thursdays when Joan is on day release her role will be undertaken by
         from Child Protection.   Both officers have agreed this arrangement,
but I would welcome some information about the length of time that such
arrangements are likely to carry on.   I must draw attention at this early stage
to difficulties that we are llktely to encounter at the end of May, (two weeks
commencing 28.5.89.)               is on leave and Joan has exams.  I will also
be on leave from the 26th May - 5th June (inclusive).

                  will be available during this period and may be able to
provide the necessary supervisory input.  At present we have two staff from
Trafford assisting with input.  They will cease duties on the 5th May.  I may
be able to negotiate a further two staff for the following two weeks.  If we
cannot obtain assistance from elsewhere we will certainly encounter problems
from mid-May as staff in Court and Residential will require exam leave and will
not be available.

Admin. Support to the Database:

     We have begged and borrowed staff for this function over the last two
weeks. Finally we appear to have it on a more formal footing.   A schedule is
attached which covers the next six weeks (from 2nd May).  A team of six is
required.  Four of the team will be provided by other local authorities.
The remaining two will be covered by Liverpool Social Services.  One will be
a supervisory role on a rota basis provided by five of the District Admin.
Officers.  The remaining post will be provided by the five central office
admin, sections on a rota basis.  I have emphasised from the start the need for
a consistent team on this work.  Whilst there has been a core group from R.D.I.
and Court and Residential, we have had to use a variety of other staff.   The way
the unit has been staffed must have some implications for the data on the system.

     The agreement reached with other local authorities will obviously mean that
variation in interpretation of information will continue, but I think the
arrangements now reached will provide for better continuity than we have achieved
to date.

     With regard to my own role I intend to now return to my own office and to
be available to the admin, support and input team as required.  I envisage that
I will keep a watching brief on the unit, but will not be as heavily involved as


                                                                  /Cont'd

       I have over the last two weeks.  I would estimate that approximately 50% of
       my time has been spent sorting out staffing issues.  Having decided to' proceed
       with the database there seemed to be little commitment, in staff terms to run
       the unit.          <

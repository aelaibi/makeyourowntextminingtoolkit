Joint Report of the Clerk and Financial Officer and the Chief Constable
F0RCE TRAINING SCHOOL. ECCLESFIELD
ALTERATIONS io CASUALTY ENQUIRY gDftEAU (S/84)

1.   Matter for Consideration
     The approval of a capital estimate and the invitation of tenders.     * â€¢
2.   Background Information
     An existing classroom within the Training School was designed to double as
     the Casualty Enquiry Bureau during a major emergency occurring anywhere in
     the County.
     Experience gained during the Hillsborough Stadium disaster brought to the
     Force's attention the shortage of space available to cope with such a major
     incident. It is proposed therefore to carry out internal alterations to
     the classroom and the adjoining classroom so that in any future emergency
     situation and for current training purposes the space and facilities
     available for a Casualty Enquiry Bureau can be effectively doubled.
3.   Comments
     A scheme has been prepared by the Architectural Services Officer which is
     estimated to cost 18500. A sum of 1500 is required for furniture and
     equipment.
     The works comprise the replacement of a partition wall with a proprietary
     demountable wall, relocation of services to the air conditioning units and
     some minor modifications to the computer floor. As the items are
     individually of such a specific nature it is proposed to obtain
     confirmatory quotations and place orders with the firms and suppliers
     involved.
4.   Financial Implications
     The scheme is included in the Authority's approved Capital Programme as
     part of the total provision of 1150,000 for works costing under 112,000
     each (Item 64), to be financed wholly in 1989/90. Total cumulative
     estimated expenditure to date on such schemes is 196,812.
     Estimated revenue costs, for which provision is made in the current Revenue
     Estimates is:-
                                     1989/90             Full Year
     Running Costs
     Debt Charges                     250                    1000

                                     1250                   11000

5.       Recommendations
         The Authority is requested to approve a capital estimate of 19000 and the
         ordering of the work in the manner described.

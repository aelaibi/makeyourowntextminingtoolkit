Serial Ho. 6,   Inap Harvey, DS 729 Norbura

At appoximately 11.0Ga.ffl. together with DC 515 Cawkwell, I commenced duties in the sterile
area between South Stand Gate 'E' and the Loppings Lane turnstiles. This area was to b«
kept sterile and access was restricted to Official personnel and B.B.C. staff. The area
was protected by means of temporary barriers.
Most of the time was spent an the barrier© outside gate rE* and we were constantly
appoached by Liverpool supporters asking for access to Leppings Lane, ^his was refused
with the exception of the elderly and infirm who were escorted through the sterile area.
From approximately 2.00p.m. the numbers asking for access increased considerably and these
people were directed to Lappings Lane via Penistone Road and Catchbar Lane.
At 2.%0p.m. I became aware of a large build up of supporters at the Leppings Lane turnstiles
and approximately 6 mounted officers were let through the barriers in order to attend 5
there. At that time supporters were still asking to be let through the barriers.
I continued duties at the barrier until approximately 3.06p.m. when a call went up to the
effect that Liverpool fans had invaded the pitch.     fogether with approximately 6 other
officers I made my way through gate »E' into the Sptith Stand and onto the playing area.
At that time the match had been stopped but the players were still on the pitch. I saw that
supporters were climbing over the security fences and onto the pitch, supporters were also
climbing from the terraces into the West Stand. I saw that the centre section of the
terraces was very crowded but there appeared to be ample room in the sections either side.
On reaching the security fencing I saw that supporters were not in fact invading the pitch
but were attempting to escape from the centre pen. Police Officers were helping them
climb the fences and I went to the fences to assist people who had already escaped onto
the pitch. One in particular was a 10 year old boy, j                 h/a Doncaster who had
received injuries to his back in particular and bruising to all parts of his body. I carried
him to the players tunnel and then into the physiotherapy room where first aid was rendered.
During that time several other sasualties came there and I attended to them.
Whilst at the security fencing there was general confusion and during this I   saw what
appeared to be people dying or dead, laying on the floor beneath the feet of   other people.
These bodies were not at the front of the terraces but a few yards back just   to the south
of the goals. Other fans were trampling on the bodies in order to reach the    security
fences.

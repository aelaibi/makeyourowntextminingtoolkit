    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                         Re

         Dear Sirs,

         Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


         If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
         of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
         on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
         due course.

         I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of,,
         evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
         coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
         inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

         Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
         under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
         witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
         this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

         Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
         to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
         appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
         consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

         May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
         attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

         I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
         names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
         to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

         I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
         heard from you by the end of SeptejaJjer I will assume you have no names to
         submit.

         Yours faithfully,

Dear Dr Popper

RE:   IAN DAVm BHETAN

I have >ust been consulted by Wilfred Whelan, David's father.

He had previously instructed Messrs Col in Watson & Go of Warrington, I have
written to them today for the papers and trust that I will receive very
soon.

Will you please amend your records to show my practice as acting for Ian's
parents.

In ay capacity as a raesaber of the Steering Ccnraittee I had a copy of
Ian's Suaraary available, Mr Whelan had not previously seen it and having
been through it with him yesterday I an able to tel l you that he has no
questions to put to the presenting officer ex' the pathologist on the 26th
April.

I understand Mr Whelan, his wife and perhaps oneother individual will be
present in Court when the summary is presented.

Dear          Sir8»
          Ian David Vhelan (afloemwd) lfo A .

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed* You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

 I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
 has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
 behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
 Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

 I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
 Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
 he may wish to undertake.

 I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
 or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
 matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
 a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
 on this matter further.

  I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
  is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
  fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

  Yours faithfully,



  S.L.Popper,
  BLM. Coroner.

Dear Sirs,

You will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
in fact put in as evidence.

However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
report of your clisnt(s).

The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis thats-

               They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
               subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
               they are given or produced in evidence at the Inauest.

               They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
               conselling of the deceased’s relatives or for proper
               legitimate purposes in connecstion with any legal proceedings
               in which solicitors may be engaged.

               Subject to the/jafeove, they are to be kept confidential until
               they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is     ^ per sheet ftotal
Please make your cheques payable to. the City of Sheffield*

Yours faithfully,




S.L.Popper,
H.i-i.Coroner.

 Dear Mr. Popper,

                       Re:               Hillsborough Disaster                                 -       Ian David Whelan Deceased

      Further to my letter to you of the 5th July, informing you of
 my interest on behalf of the above-named, I write to ask if it
 would be possible for you to let us have access to the post mortem

 before the inquest can be reinstated.

     I act for the parents and next of kin of the above-named Ian

let me know in due course the date of the inquest, and any other
further information you can advance about h o w the inquest is to be
conducted.   I am liaising with the Hillsborough Steering Committee,
and it may well be that there will be joint representation.

                                                                       Yours sincerely,

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
rhTl ^°^ZeVni^5 thS release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough xncident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

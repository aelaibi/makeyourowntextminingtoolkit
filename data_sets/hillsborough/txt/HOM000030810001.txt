   Mervyn Jones, as Assistant Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police headed the police
   enquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster, on behalf of his Chief Constable and for
   Lord Justice Taylor

   Mr Jones retired from the Police Service on 31 August 1997. I have subsequently learned that
   when Mr Jones concluded his investigation in the Hillsborough Inquiry in 1391, he kept certain
   documentation relevant to the inquiry, for reference purposes and in the event that he needed to
   consult them, subsequent to the conclusion of the investigation. In addition, he kept personal
   notes which he intends to retain.

   It is my understanding that there are no original documents in the material, which is stored in a
   room 11 feet square at Cheshire Police Headquarters and covers two walls of that room, merely
   duplicates of certain parts of the enquiry that were passed to South Yorkshire Police at the end of
   the inquiry. (Please see attached letter dated 25 July 1997, from Mervyn Jones, Chief Constable
   of Cheshire Constabulary, to Richard Wells, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police.)

   It was felt that the material should not be destroyed and I have now arranged with the
    Cheshire Constabulary that they will box up the material and index the content of each box.
   It would then be my intention to transport the material from Cheshire to South Yorkshire and
   place it in the Hillsborough Archive, unless Lord Justice Stuart-Smith should direct otherwise

  I would be pleased if you could inform Lord Justice Stuart-Srnith of the existence of the material

                HILLSBOROUGH

                You will no doubt be aware that I retire at the end o f August, When I concluded my investigation in
                the Hillsborough Inquiry in 19 9 1 1 kept copies o f certain documentation relevant to the inquiry.
                These were kepi for reference should I have to refer to them subsequent to the conclusion o f the
                investigation. In addition, 1 kept my personal notes which I intend to retain. However, the question is
                whether the South Yorkshire Police wish to receive the duplicate material which I presently hold.
                There are no original documents, merely duplicates o f certain parts that were passed to you by
                Detective C hief Superintendent Foster at The end o f the Inquiry.

                The question again, therefore, is would this duplicate material be o f any assistance to you? I f not I
                will make arrangements for it to be confidentially destroyed.

                With best wishes

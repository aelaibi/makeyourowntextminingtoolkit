                                           PC Ryan (see statement) made several

                                           people to stop pushing.

                                           To supplement these announcements, Supt.
                                           Marshall requested that similar messages
                                           be passed via a mobile public address

                                            took control of the equipment which was
                                            positioned to face supporters trying to
                                            enter the turnstiles. He claims to have
                                            shouted through the loudspeaker,
                                            demanding that people stop pushing.

                                            Given the limitations of the equipment
                                            and the cacophony of noise from the
                                            crowd, the police made every effort to

                                             to prevent a stampede.

                                             Gates 'A' and 'B' did not lead directly

                                             Chief Supt. Duckenfield reasoned that the

                                             by the crowd, to be dissipated.

                                             Police action simply compounded a problem

experience of such incidents. Fellow
spectators were even slower to realise
the nature of the incident.

As soon as the situation was appreciated,
the officers took immediate and positive
action, disregarding instructions to
obtain authorisation of Ground Control
before evacuating pens.


Officers were then faced with an
impregnable enclosure which was
surrounded by fences, railings and packed
supporters who were reluctant to
surrender their position on the terraces.
The emergency gates are only wide enough
to accommodate one person at a time and
quickly became blocked.   The gate only
opens to 90’ thereby giving access to one
officer from one sife of the gate.

 Police officers were, like other members
 of the public, making futile attempts to
 knock down the fencing which formed a
 barrier to their assistance - Many
 officers refer to a sense of helplessness
 and vain rescue attempts.


 There was a great deal of action, hidden
 from view, at the rear of the enclosure -
 officers having entered via the tunnel at
 3.02 pm (see statements of Insp. Builas,
 PC Martin and PC Aitken) Supt. Murray led
 the resue efforts at this location.


 Also police activity via both sides of
 the railings (see statements of PS
 Gutcher and PS Payne) was quickly in
 prog ress.

 The police quickly formed a chain of
 officers leading onto the pitch from the
 emergency gate, under the direction of
  the senior officer present at that
  location - Chief Supt. Nesbit. The chain
  rescued and passed on the dead and
  injured who were treated accordingly by
  the officers who happened to be on the
  end of the chain.

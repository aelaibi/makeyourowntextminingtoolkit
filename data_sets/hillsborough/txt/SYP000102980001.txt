                           e      Final April 15     - Liverpool v Notts Forest

                  Sir,
                      I am a Police Constable in thp South Yorkshire Police, presently working
                  in the Operations Room, Snig Hill, Sheffield. I was born on

                  On the 15.^.89 our shift in Oper tions Hoorn were on We k l y Leave, and I
                  volunteered to work the Semi Fin~l at Hillsborough.

                  I arrived at Hillsborough on Saturday 15 April '9 8 9 st aporox         a^d went
                  to sit with my serial which I b'li^v was ^ithrr k2 or *+3i P«S Williamson
                  from HQ Prosecutions wrs our Serial Sergeant for th'- match.
                  After thf= briefing, we were detailed to patrol Herrins Rd,th^ five arches
                  briig- up to Moonshin-' Lanc Round'bout,an 1 Shirecliffe Lan^:.
                  Tog“-thrr with Pc 2323 Mitton from C3     comm nc'd patrol walking up and down
                  thos^ roads.
                  As far ss I    sm aw'r°, the supporters travelling along this route, were Notts
                  Forest fans only, and th rc was no trouble vith any of them, that we had to
                  deal with.
                  At about 2pm we wrre c- llcd to the shopping ■rea just past the roundabout
                  with Moonshine Lane and Shirecliffe Lane,wh-re we saw num-ruos su^port^rs
                  rnt ring the beer-off =nd purchasing packs of beer and bottles of wine.
                  Generally th^ fans were of good behaviour and we had no cause to speak to
                  any of them about th^ir conduct.

                  At approx 2.*+5pm we mad'" our way back to the ground, coll-cting th'1 oth^r
                  mmbers of eur serial an ro*te. We arrived at th^ ground st approx 3»00pm.
                  We madc our way towards th area where the horses congregate, and after a
                  few minut s were informed that the stand at Leppings Lane had collapsed.
                  We. ell made our v;=y into thr ground, and on ant "ring th^ main area, I saw
                  initi'lly wh*t looked likc a spillag of fans on the pitch at the Leppings
                  L a n e End. I  ould say -pprox ^000 f-ns t thi tim- ■cr<- g th-T-d on th-
                  pitch. I did not know st this time exactly vh't had happened.
                  We were approached by an Ins^ th-~n,who told ns to spread out in front of the
                  Notts Forest End, inc'se th re was any trouble. I duly did this, and was near
                  to thr goalpost, on th*= Peniston1- Rd cnd.
                  Aft^r about TO mins, I saw bodies been brought over on stretchers from the
                  Leppings Lane end and literally dropped on the floor at th° side of where
                  I was standing. Th- first few bodies appeared to b br<= thing,and fans from
                  Liv rpool wcre running ■-•ll over,end thrn as more bodies arriv'd at thr side
                  of mc, I saw thrt some of th m v.^re not breathing, nd by th colour of thcm
                  appeared d*=ad.
                  I was so shocked at first, I just couldn't t~ke in what was happening.
                  By now more f ns w~re arriving from the oth r end,end were now rip ing off the
                  boards from th^ side of thr ground ~nd using tlv m as stretchers to cerry th'-
                  injur d.
                  The f-ns thrt w re rriving ■ith the injur -d/de-d wcre scatt-T*" ell ovrr
                  our end of the oitch, and th re was literally mass hysteria.Thcy wcre scr aming
                  and shouting at us to h lp,crying end som wrre even being ebu:ive to police
                  and oth-r fans.
                  I d cided that I could no longer stay end watch what was happening, so I left
                  my serial, -nd went ov-r to the arps wh're bodies wcre arriving to try and
                  assist.
                  I tri'd to render first aid to several mal- fans that h d arrived,on^ who was
                  vomitting and gro*ning as we tried to givr kiss of life and heart massage,
                  and it was obvious th=t aft^r a short whilc, he was already dead.

                                     -   2   -




I then tri d to assist v.’ith heart masssg' on sev^r-1 other fans, vhilst waiting for
thn arrival of m r:ie-l assistance. Lv ntually Fire of.ic*=rs with o x y g e n t'nks and
bre_thing apparatus r-lso attended, s did St Johns A m b u l a n c e and th A m b u lncr Service
itself.
I saw that by now, and I can't rememb r what tim it was, but som o f the L i v e r p o o l
f~ns w re calling out and goeding thc Notts For-st Fans. There was not much else I
could do =t this tim', o t h r offic rs had erriv d, and our nd of th' pitch wss just
as busy with bo^ie>s as th _eppin.cs L=ne End,I msde my way back tovards the centre
of the pitch wh re th had been s courdon of offic rs formed, snd I eventually found
my seri~l. Th' Notts Forest Fans were told ov r the loud speaker, after what seemed
a very long tine, that therc h'd be n an incident at the Leppings Lane End,and that
th game was going to be postponed.
By this tim', from whst I remember cv ryone including Police Officers app ared to be
walking ^rouni in - dsze,som' offic rs had lost parts of th'ir uniforms,others were
crying,oth rs just t-lk d with coll-agues.

Eventually, end agein, I c'n’t remember th' exact time, perhaps about 5p®, we all
mad our way back tovards th' Gym ara, and waited for further instructions.

T o g ' t h e r with a S'rgcant end 9 oth^r officers from the match, end they weren’t from
my s riel, v ~ thcn wrnt out on mobil patrol - trying to assist outside the ground
unfo r t u n r l c y, th re was so much traffic, that ell w<= could do, was tour up and down the
side str ts, =nd didn't actually respond to anything. We esCort'-d a Det'ctive Sgt
who was in his own car, ■nd looking for his son, to Hamm rton Rd.
We m=-de our way beck toward the ground, and then walked to Cleywheels L a n e , wh re we
were v ntually stood do-n at about 7pm.

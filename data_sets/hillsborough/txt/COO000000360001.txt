The attached R£if>er to H is, for the most part, simply a round-up
of action in hand, most of which you will already be familiar
with.   You might like to glance at what is proposeid in
paragraphs 17 and 20.            The steps in paragraph 17, although
            ■

modest, seem sensible: there are still occasions where, despite
all the publicity about English fans abroad, the local police
                                    _   M          ■■ ■—                         .. ..... — —   »

seem to be caught by surprise at the level of violence and
hooliganism; so a manual of best practice would not come amiss.
Similarly, it may be right to press Council of Europe signatories
to deal vigorously, if fairly, with hooligans who have committed
offences (note the contrast between the vigorous Greek action
against English hooligans earlier in the month).


For the medium term, you will see that they are not proposing to
                                                                            r■          »
urge the Football Association to withdraw the English team from
the World Cup (though I think that needs to be kept under
review).    Nor do they propose to take any action on withdrawing
passports from hooligans.               It is certainly right, as the Home
Office suggest, to consider with police and the Scottish Office
nearer to next May whether the England v Scotland match should be
cancelled or at least held on a weekday evening.

Finally, it is worth glancing at the flagged annex which shows
the tally of hooliganism and violence on just one day at the end
of the season just finished and that one day exactly a month
after the Hillsborough~3isaster!                                            '          “
